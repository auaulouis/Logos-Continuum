#### Settler Colonialism is the grounding force of the international -- the understanding as colonialism as a domestic matter forgoes the way that Settler Colonialism was a project of domination in the name of civilizing the savage

Sitting alongside themes of imperialism, internationalism, and realism
in the study of Australian IR, was [a stream of thought on race and
empire that focused on settlement]{.underline}. For the history of
international thought, this [is significant. The control of territory by
settlers is the foundational concern of the]{.underline} Australian
[state]{.underline}. **[This was therefore foundational to its
international thought and its politics]{.underline}**. **[[The blurring
of the international and the domestic, structured around racial
categories and seeking to maintain and advance white supremacy, was a
constitutive element of the founding of IR]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
Australia. This lines up closely with Vitalis's findings in the US.105
Australia's Others under IR's gaze were primarily its nearest
neighbours, its colonial projects, and those within: its own settlement,
its immigration policy and its Indigenous population. Although dominated
by a white man's view of the world, there were contributions made by
women throughout this period. Prior to Coral Bell's taking up of a
realist framework, though, these contributions were sometimes confined
to subjects stereotyped as feminine. The settlement of the Northern
Territory and the rest of Australia remained parts of Australian IR
through the Austral-Asiatic Bulletin's time as its primary publication
outlet. The study of imperial affairs, based on the development of
societies, was slowly shifting into the study of international affairs.
At this moment in Australian IR, the two sat alongside one another: with
articles on events in China and Japan placed next to discussion of the
colonial development of Northern Australia and New Guinea. Imperialism
and racial development politics sat alongside analysis of great power
conflict in East Asia. The Second World War led to another reshaping of
Australia's international thought. The first IR department in the
country was placed within Pacific Studies, which was intended to focus
on both East Asia and Australia's colonial projects. Still, **[race as
an explicit subject of IR]{.underline}** in Australia **[shifted, and
the explicit [maintenance of racial hierarchies moved into racialised
psychological and cultural explanations of the irrationality of]{.mark}
the [postcolonial societies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[This erasure
made it more difficult to analyse race and racism, allowing them to
continue unchecked.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In terms of our disciplinary
historiography[, it led to the exclusion of empire and settlement as
insufficiently international to be analysed. We might be tempted to
think that, because settlement and land tenure are not viewed as
'international' today, we can simply erase them from our disciplinary
memory. To do so is anachronistic]{.underline}. [Colonial settlement was
thought of as international affairs. It was a common topic, discussed
thoroughly and regularly]{.underline}. Forgetting this effectively
produces the excision of Australia's settler colonial history from its
international affairs. **[[The connection between land, sovereignty, and
settlement remains foundational to the international
system]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That a series of colonial questions of
settlement sat alongside Australia's early studies of its relationship
with East Asia reflects the transition from a broadly colonial system to
an international system. [This transition was not simple or
straightforward. It is not even complete]{.underline}. Australia has not
decolonised. [Neglecting this transition closes our eyes to the
contemporary politics of race and hierarchy that postcolonial scholars
of IR have repeatedly and forcefully emphasised]{.underline}.
Australia's contemporary international affairs, questions about its
defence, Australia's positioning inside or outside Asia, its
relationship with Pacific island neighbours, its strategic culture,
fears about foreign ownership of land, all look very different if we
place them in this context. If we accept that settler colonial
ideologies were a key element of the founding of Australian IR, a claim
for which there is ample evidence, IR in Australia needs urgent critical
reflection. Australian **[[settlement means the dehumanisation and the
genocide of existing populations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This continues
today. Settler colonial Australian IR justified and argued for this,
presenting it as natural and desirable. As Vitalis put it in the US
context, [']{.mark}[the history of ideas, institutions, and practices
has a constitutive role in their present forms and
functions']{.underline}. 106 While Australian IR forgets its settler
history[, [policies of dispossession and intervention, and **the
'civilising mission', continue at home and
abroad**]{.underline}]{.mark}.107 Australian [foreign policy, often
wrapped in liberal idealism, normalises and affirms settler
colonialism]{.underline}. **[[We would need to engage deeply with
Indigenous perspectives]{.underline}]{.mark}** about Australia and the
world **[[to understand this in the present]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Sadly, few, if any, such voices are in dialogue with IR in Australia. I
can only conclude that the rot is particularly deep[. [Forgetting this
history cleanses our thought]{.mark} of colonial violence]{.underline}
and the settlement of Australia, [[making it impossible to reckon
with.]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[Addressing these issues requires more
than a mild and unthreatening 'diversification' of the discipline's
voices, but a thorough and conscious effort to decolonise, which
challenges our foundational assumptions.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Settler violence threatens the entire planet with endless racist violence

In the years that followed, politicians and pundits in Britain and its
[[settler]{.underline}]{.mark} colonies of Australia, Canada and the
United States would jointly forge an [identity
[geopolitics]{.mark}]{.underline} of the "higher races." Today it [[has
reached its]{.mark} final and **[most desperate]{.mark}
[phase]{.mark}**[, with **existential fears** about]{.mark} endangered
[white power feverishly circulating]{.mark}]{.underline} once again
between the core and periphery of the greatest modern empire. "The
fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to
survive," President Trump said last year in a speech hailed by the
British journalist Douglas Murray, the Canadian columnist Mark Steyn and
the American editor Rich Lowry. More recently, Mr. Trump tweeted
(falsely) about "large-scale killing" of white farmers in South Africa
--- a preoccupation, deepened by Rupert Murdoch's media, of white
supremacists around the world. To understand the rapid mainstreaming of
white supremacism in English-speaking liberal democracies today, we must
examine the experience of unprecedented global migration and racial
mixing in the Anglosphere in the late 19th century: countries such as
the United States and Australia where, as Roosevelt wrote admiringly in
1897, "democracy, with the clear instinct of race selfishness, saw the
race foe, and kept out the dangerous alien." It is in the motherlands of
democracy rather than in fascist Europe that racial hierarchies first
defined the modern world. It is also where a last-ditch and potentially
calamitous battle to preserve them is being fought today. This "race
selfishness" was sharpened in the late 19th century, as the elites of
the "higher races" struggled to contain mass disaffection generated by
the traumatic change of globalization: loss of jobs and livelihoods amid
rapid economic growth and intensified movements of capital, goods and
labor. For fearful ruling classes, political order depended on their
ability to forge an alliance between, as Hannah Arendt wrote, "capital
and mob," between rich and powerful whites and those rendered
superfluous by industrial capitalism. Exclusion or degradation of
nonwhite peoples seemed one way of securing dignity for those
marginalized by economic and technological shifts. The political climate
was prepared by intellectuals with clear-cut racial theories, such as
Brooks Adams, a Boston Brahmin friend of Roosevelt, and Charles B.
Davenport, the leading American exponent of eugenics. In Australia,
Pearson's social Darwinism was amplified by media barons like Keith
Murdoch (father of Rupert and a stalwart of the eugenics movement) and
institutionalized in a "White Australia" policy that restricted
"colored" migration for most of the 20th century. Anti-minority passions
in the United States peaked with the 1924 immigration law (much admired
by Hitler and, more recently, by Jeff Sessions), which impeded Jewish
immigrants and barred Asians entirely. By the early 20th century,
violence against indigenous peoples, immigrants and African-Americans
reached a new ferocity, and nativist and racist demagogues entrenched a
politics of dispossession, segregation and disenfranchisement. Seeking
to maintain white power globally, Roosevelt helped transform the United
States into a major imperialist power. Woodrow Wilson, too, worked to
preserve, as he put it, "white civilization and its domination of the
planet" even as he patented the emollient rhetoric of liberal
internationalism that many in the American political and media
establishment still parrot. At the post-World War I Paris Peace
Conference, which Wilson supervised, the leaders of Britain, the United
States, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Canada not only
humiliated the many Asians and Africans demanding self-determination;
they also jointly defeated an attempt by Japan, their wartime ally, to
have a racial equality clause included in the Covenant of the League of
Nations. The exposure of Nazi crimes, followed by decolonization and
civil rights movements, generally discredited quasi-scientific racism
and stigmatized overt expressions of white supremacism. In our own time,
global capitalism has promised to build a colorblind world through
economic integration. But as revolts erupt against globalization in its
latest, more disruptive phase, politicians and pundits in the
Anglosphere are again scrambling to rebuild political communities around
what W. E.B. Du Bois in 1910 identified as "the new religion of
whiteness." The intellectual white web originally woven in
late-19th-century Australia vibrates once more with what the historians
Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds termed "racial knowledge and
technologies that animated white men's countries and their strategies of
exclusion, deportation and segregation." Mr. Trump, for instance, has
chosen Australia's brutal but popular immigration policies as a model:
"That is a good idea. We should do that too," he said in January 2017 to
Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister at the time, as he
explained his tactic of locking up refugees on remote islands. "You are
worse than I am," Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull. If right-wing Australian
politicians were among the first to mainstream a belligerent white
nationalism, the periodicals and television channels of Rupert Murdoch
have worked overtime to preserve the alliance between capital and mob in
the Anglosphere. Indulged by Mr. Murdoch's newspapers, writers like
Bernard Lewis, Niall Ferguson, David Frum, Andrew Sullivan and Andrew
Roberts repeatedly urged American neoconservatives after the Sept. 11
attacks to take up the aging white man's burden and quell mutinous
natives. A broad range of figures in the Anglosphere's establishment,
including some of Mr. Trump's most ostentatious critics today,
contributed manure to the soil in which Trumpism flourishes. Cheered on
by the Murdoch press, Tony Blair tried to deepen Britain and America's
"special relationship" in Iraq. Leaders of Australia and Canada also
eagerly helped with the torture, rendition and extermination of black
and brown brutes. Not surprisingly, these chieftains of [[white settler
colonies]{.mark} are fierce cultural warriors; they]{.underline} are all
affiliated with private donors who [[build platforms
where]{.underline}]{.mark} political correctness, Islam and feminism are
excoriated, the [[facts of]{.mark} [injustice and inequality
denied]{.mark}]{.underline}, chests thumped about a superior but sadly
imperiled Western civilization, and fraternal sympathy extended to
Israel, the world's last active settler-colonialist project. Emotional
incontinence rather than style or wit marks such gilded networks of
white power. For [[the Anglosphere originally forged and united by the
slave trade and colonialism is in **terminal
crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark} today. [Whiteness denoted]{.underline}, as
Du Bois wrote, "[the ownership of the earth forever and ever."
But]{.underline} many [descendants]{.underline} of the landlords of the
earth [find]{.underline} [themselves besieged]{.underline} both at home
and abroad, [their authority as overlords, police]{.underline}men [and
interpreters of the globe increasingly challenged]{.underline}. Mr.
Trump appears to some of these powerful but insecure men as an
able-bodied defender of the "higher races." The Muslim-baiting British
Conservative politician Boris Johnson says that he is "increasingly
admiring of Donald Trump." Mr. Murray, the British journalist, thinks
Mr. Trump is "reminding the West of what is great about ourselves." The
Canadian YouTube personality Jordan Peterson claims that his loathing of
"identity politics" would have driven him to vote for Mr. Trump. Other
panicky white bros not only virulently denounce identity politics and
political correctness --- code for historically scorned peoples' daring
to propose norms about how they are treated; they also proclaim ever
more rowdily that the (white) West was, and is, best. "It is time to
make the case for colonialism again," Bruce Gilley, a Canadian academic,
recently asserted and promptly shot to martyrdom in the far-right
constellation as a victim of politically correct criticism. Such [busy
[recyclers of Western supremacism]{.mark}]{.underline}, many of whom
uphold a disgraced racial pseudoscience, remind us that history often
repeats itself as intellectual farce. The low comedy of charlatanry,
however, [[should]{.mark} [not distract us from the **lethal dangers**
of a wounded]{.mark} and swaggering [identity
geopolitics]{.mark}]{.underline}. The war on terror reactivated the 19th
century's imperial archive of racial knowledge, according to which the
swarthy enemy was subhuman, inviting extreme and lawless violence. The
rapid contraction of suffrage rights witnessed in early-20th-century
America is now mimicked by Republican attempts to disenfranchise
nonwhite voters. The Australian lawmaker who recently urged a "final
solution" for Muslim immigrants was only slightly out of tune with
public debate about immigration in Australia. [[Hate crimes]{.mark}
continue to [rise]{.mark}]{.underline} across the United States, Britain
and Canada. More ominously, demographic, economic and political decline,
and the loss of intellectual hegemony, have plunged many long-term
winners of history into a vengeful despair. A century ago, the mere
suspicion of being thrust aside by black and yellow peoples sparked
apocalyptic visions of "race suicide." Today, the "preponderance of
China" that Pearson predicted is becoming a reality, and the religion of
[[whiteness]{.mark} increasingly [resembles a]{.mark}]{.underline}
suicide **[[cult]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Mr. Trump's trade wars,
sanctions, border walls, deportations, denaturalizations and other
11th-hour battles seem to push us all closer to the "terrible
probability" James Baldwin once outlined: that [[the rulers of the
"higher races," "struggling to hold on to what they have stolen from
their captives]{.mark}, and unable to look into their mirror, [will
**precipitate a chaos throughout the world** which, if it does not
**bring life on this planet to an end**, will bring about a **racial
war**]{.mark}]{.underline} such as [[the **world has never
seen**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

#### Thus we endorse diversality -- an orientation that recognizes the hybridity of alternative epistemologies that focuses on building mutual connections to build new forms of international relations centered around recognition and not dominance

So far, [I have focused on politicizing binaries and exposing the
colonial wound]{.underline}. [This is an important step but it imagines
the debate to take place in terms of the colonizer and colonized; **what
is missing is an appreciation of mixed-ness or mestizaje, a social fact
which is integral to theorizing the coloniality of power in the
Americas**]{.underline}. **[Here, we return to the colonial difference
but emphasize the lived experiences of ''transculturation'' and ''border
thinking.'']{.underline}** Particularly in Latin America, the colonial
wound has generated significant indigenous organizations right across
the region, which assert their dignity and political capacity
(Maldonado-Torres 2007; Quijano 2008). In doing so, they reveal the
existence of the ''colonial difference,'' marking it as a space of
political contestation, but this disjucture is not experienced in the
same way by the colonizer and the colonized. [While the colonizer,
installed in a dominant position, views it as a gap of miscomprehension
and disdain, which ''he'' is not obliged to cross,]{.underline} [the
colonized must operate in a world dominated by Occidental institutions,
languages, and rationales]{.underline} (Mignolo 2000: 64--84). **[The
colonized must incessantly negotiate the colonial difference and
reconcile the demands of a colonized reality with cultural meanings
embedded in an indigenous worldview.]{.underline}** [Politicizing this
mestizaje is key to decolonial politics]{.underline}, and Gloria
Anzaldu´a's notion of ''border thinking,'' a Latin American response to
hybridity, offers significant insights (Mignolo 2000: 49--90; Anzaldu´a
2007). Anzaldu´a's vision of hybridity is rooted not in the intricacies
of intellectual debate or psychoanalysis but draws on her real-life
experiences of living between the labels which attach to the binaries so
essential to Occidental thinking. Anzaldu´a grew up and lived on the
US--Mexico border: she was a Chicana feminist daughter of
share-croppers, a Marxist indı´gena mestiza and seventh generation
lesbian citizen of the United States (Keating 2009: 1--15). Living at
the intersection of so many boundaries (geographical, sexual, political,
linguistic, racial) did not leave her feeling incomplete or dismembered,
though; her response was to say: ''They would chop me up into little
fragments and tag each piece with a label. You say my name is
ambivalence?\... Who me, confused? Ambivalent? Not so. Only your labels
split me'' (Anzaldu´a 1984; quoted in Keating 2009: 17). By asserting
her completeness, she demonstrates the fallacy of the labels. Anzaldu´a
borrowed a Nahuatl word to express the space that she inhabited between
these tagged categories: nepantla or (roughly) the place at the broken
edges. She explained the technique of border thinking in one poem:
''Because I, a mestiza, continually walk out of one culture, and into
another, because I am in all cultures at the same time, alma entre dos
mundos, tres, cuatro,\...'' (Anzaldu´a 2007: 99) This vision of human
agency derived from inhabiting border lands serves to disempower the
idea of the border as a stopping point controlled by the state. That the
state which she traversed in real life was the US--Mexico border only
heightens the powerfulness of her critique and the subversive potential
of her work for both IR and the Americas. [Equally important, though, is
the concept of transculturation, which indicates that processes of
hybridity have not only shaped the lives of subaltern groups, but have
also conditioned Whiteness and the Western epistemological project in
(Latin) American society]{.underline} (Pratt 2008). The concept of
transculturation was devised by Cuban anthropologist Fernando Ortı´z in
1940 to understand how Cuban society was constituted. [He focused on the
relationship between slaves and slave owners, understanding that both
had shifted from their native soil and that each was intimately
influenced by the cultural heritage of the other and the experience of
colonialism]{.underline}: [''Each immigrant was uprooted from his native
land in a double movement of adjustment and readjustment, of
deculturation or exculturation and of acculturation or inculturation,
and ultimately transculturation'']{.underline} (Ortı´z 1940: 255,
italics in original, my translation). He was clear that this
relationship of mutual influence was not equal or power-free----how
could it be----but asserted that both the African and the European
communities were full cultural agents, even though they were locked into
a brutal and exploitative relationship (Millington 2007). By imagining
cultural exchange to be a two-way street (albeit on a steep hill),
[Ortı´z highlights hybridity as a social experience of both the
subaltern and the dominant. He urges us to consider transculturation as
part and parcel of society-making, nation-building projects, and look
beyond domination and appropriation to ask how Native American thinking,
experiences, and practices have molded ''the USA'' as a global
actor.]{.underline} **[Following this thinking, resistance to the
coloniality of power therefore involves not only fighting against the
colonizing logic, but also seeking to shake that logic from within by
revealing the hybridity and diversity within what seems to be a unified
and settled settler society.]{.underline}** Border thinking, then, might
elicit insights not only at the ''periphery'' or border but also at the
''core'' of global power, if we are willing to destabilize its
[foundations. A useful strategy which might help to unsettle ''core''
thinking has been proposed by Martinican Edouard Glissant in his Poetics
of Relation]{.underline} (1997). [He sets out an intellectual politics
of diversality]{.underline} (rather than universality) inspired by
Caribbean Creole consciousness**[. Diversality takes the idea of
transculturation a step further by theorizing cultural interchange as
not only a social fact but also a political strategy]{.underline}**.
Diversality assumes the existence of profound difference, but Glissant
argues that ''thought of the Other is sterile without the other of
Thought'' (1997: 154); that is, **[merely accepting that differences
exist is not enough to generate deep change in our thinking. Rather, he
calls for an ''aesthetics of turbulence,'' which breaks assumptions and
allows one's thoughts to be ''prised open'' in order to develop new
imaginaries and fresh linkages between peoples]{.underline}**. The
''other of Thought'' is thus created by confluences in which ''each is
changed by and changes the other'' (1997: 154--5). **[Diversality
involves not only being prepared to recognize difference on an equal
footing but also a willingness to open one's thoughts to ''turbulence''
which will destroy assumptions and rebuild hybrid modes of thinking in
its wake.]{.underline}** The Americas occupies a privileged role in this
theorizing because, as Anzaldu´a, Ortı´z, and Glissant assert, social
(and sexual) mixing is not a ''new'' process but rather it is deeply
embedded in the Americas----in 500 years of colonial encounter and its
resulting hybrid identities. **[A ''mestizo Americas'' approach could
therefore play a crucial role in developing decolonial political
struggle, not only by denouncing the injustice of colonialism but by
prising open, shifting, and hybridizing conventional ways of
understanding international relationships----and International
Relations.]{.underline}** The issue of how this might occur requires
more time and space to explore, but I begin a discussion here by
identifying three questions that a decolonial politics might ask of IR.
1[. What other ways are there to understand the world? (And how might
this influence our thinking about the international?) This question
invites IR to acknowledge diversality. It assumes the completeness,
complexity, and sophistication of non-western ontologies and
epistemologies in a move which should be humbling**. It opens up our
minds to new ways of imagining human existence;**]{.underline} to
imagine time as being circular (King 1993), **[or that land does not
belong to people but people to the land]{.underline}** (Silko 2006), or
that boundaries are delineated by walking ⁄ presence (Larsen 2006), or
that the world is configured not through dualities but threes (Kusch
2010), or that colonialism is an illness (Momaday 1989; Burman 2009).
This work has already started; [Marshall Beier's incisive critique of
conventional IR conveys the immensities of the colonial difference in
his discussion of Lakota life-ways which he contrasts to the
''hegemonologue'' of mainstream IR]{.underline} (2005**[). These
differences might influence understandings of the international, not so
much by adding new ideas but by destabilizing our mode of
thinking----our aesthetics of thought,]{.underline}** as Glissant might
suggest. Encountering fundamental disjunctures of human experience
should convey a sensation of difference experienced as a visceral
confusion and disorientation. **[A decolonial IR project must, then, be
prepared to approach non-occidental worldviews with a mind that is
willing to be made uncomfortable, that is ready not to comprehend, and
that is prepared to feel out of control]{.underline}**. This is not just
an exercise in submission though, because [we can use the sensation of
disorientation to heighten our awareness of the Occidental project and
the contemporary coloniality of power. It helps us to map out the narrow
limits of the Western imaginary and to perceive its contours, its regime
of knowledge, and worldview more profoundly**. An awareness of
diversality shows the limits and fallacies of universal thinking, and by
unsettling our certainties, it generates space for new thought**. 2.
What does IR not know?]{.underline} (And what has this got to do with
the coloniality of power?) [This question highlights the hidden side of
knowledge----ignorance]{.underline}. [It suggests that the chasm of
colonial difference is far too deep and wide to be bridged, which means
that **single-vision understandings of world history or IR cannot
possibly comprehend the experiences and worldviews of
''others''**.]{.underline} Glissant reflects on the academic project and
concludes that ''no matter how many studies and references we
accumulate, we will never reach the end\...; knowing this in advances
makes it possible for us to dwell there. Not knowing this totality \[of
experiences\] is not a weakness. Not wanting to know it certainly is''
(1997: 154). Perhaps counter-intuitively, then, this ignorance brings a
number of intellectual benefits. Firstly, being aware of profound
difference might act as a brake on drawing easy parallels without
listening and thinking very hard first, promoting critical and complex
thinking. Secondly, gaining a sense of just how different difference can
be helps us to perceive the realm of possibilities because it is an
orientation point in a vast galaxy of difference. However, [the purpose
of identifying deep difference is not to label or pin down with words
ideas which are outside the realm of European imagination. Rather, it is
to accept that the chasm cannot be closed----that such ideas are simply
untranslatable into European languages and regimes of
knowledge]{.underline} (Mignolo and Schiwy 2003). That is[, a decolonial
IR must accept its ignorance and learn what it can about the world not
only by studying what is knowable but also by reflecting on what is
beyond comprehension]{.underline}. The caveat reminds us, though, that
this realm of thinking about the international takes place not on a
level playing field of competing worldviews but on a pitch riven with
geohierarchies conditioned by the coloniality of power. **[A decolonial
IR project must foreground the colonial nature of this difference to
expose the injustices that conventional approaches enact in the name of
universalism]{.underline}**. 3. [How might conventional IR be ''prised
open'' by difference?]{.underline} (And how is this linked to the USA?)
This question asks what would happen if IR were to move beyond simply
acknowledging diversality to generate an aesthetics of thinking
Other-wise (Glissant 1997). [This involves recognizing that the chasm of
colonial difference is far from absolute, indeed that it is spanned,
everyday and often, through processes of mestizaje]{.underline}. Thus,
difference should be viewed as a border zone which acts as a space where
new ideas and cosmologies might be imagined, emerging from transcultural
meetings. [One key way in which conventional IR might be opened up by
difference is by refocusing attention on ordinary people's experience of
the international]{.underline}, as Te´treault and Lipschutz propose.
**[This takes on a decolonizing role if the coloniality of power is
highlighted, a move which not only creates awareness of difference but
promotes border thinking----thinking inbetween categories and based on
everyday lived experiences of negotiating coloniality ⁄
modernity]{.underline}**. [Such strategies complement attempts by
Inayatullah and Blaney and many more to destabilize IR's traditional
building blocks such as nation-states, sovereignty, and the binary of
war⁄peace]{.underline}**. [The USA as global actor, as Western beacon,
and as home of the discipline is intimately entangled with
IR]{.underline}**[. **This is why border thinking at the binaried
intersection of the Americas is particularly acute in its capacity to
destabilize conventional thinking because it is a geographical metaphor
for many of the boundaries which set out global hierarchies and help to
structure IR**]{.underline}. [Not least of these is the First World
⁄Third World binary embodied at the US--Mexico border and its
attendants, Whiteness⁄Blackness, and civilization⁄
barbarism.]{.underline} Shifting from thinking about the border itself
to embrace border thinking invites us to step beyond the fence and its
checkpoints to consider the USA as a profoundly hybrid place. **[We move
beyond US hybridity as immigrant melting pot, to focus on mestizaje----a
complex amalgam of settler, Native and African slave descendants whose
relationships are vividly marked by the coloniality of power and the
logics of modernity]{.underline}**. A decolonial IR writing from a
''prised open'' USA not only looks for radical, destabilizing
difference, such as Native American thinking but also recognizes
hybridized connections which generate openings for dialogues. We should
not assume that the USA, like the Cuban slave masters described by
Ortı´z, is not profoundly conditioned by the colonial encounter.
However, such interactions do not occur in a power-free zone. For this
reason, **[a decolonial analysis of hybridity in the international must
vigilantly foreground the presence of inequality, injustice, and the
potential for violence in cultural interchanges conditioned by the
coloniality of power]{.underline}**. Border thinking in this broad
sense[, inclusive of IR perspectives, offers a realm of imagination,
connection and intellectual opportunity from which to rethink and
challenge dominant economic, racial and epistemological
modes]{.underline}. The role of mainstream IR in such re-imaginings of
intergroup relationships is crucial, not least because, as critical
scholars like those cited in this article attest, [conventional IR is a
central mainstay of the unequal global order.]{.underline}

rendering it invisible]{.underline}. To legitimize is to make
legitimate, that is, to justify, reason, or rationalize in accordance
with established or accepted patterns and standards. In other words,
**[the [institutions that shape social norms]{.mark}]{.underline}**---
those seen as social authorities---**[[reproduce]{.mark} symbolic racial
[violence]{.mark} against]{.underline}** ~~American
Indians~~(**[Indigenous peoples]{.underline}**)
**[[through]{.underline}]{.mark}** legal structures, public
**[[education]{.mark}]{.underline}** locations, consumer products,
sports associations, and so on. (pp. 114-115) Supporting students in
detecting and disrupting the dehumanization of Indigenous peoples,
requires first that teachers themselves can recognize the varied ways
media legitimizes racism against Indigenous peoples (Robertson, 2015).
[Given that discourses and narratives circulating in media are often not
only racist in nature but also colonial, detecting and interrupting
legitimized racism will require]{.underline} teachers to be equipped
with both [critical race media literacy]{.underline} (Yosso, 2002), [as
well as anticolonial media literacy]{.underline}. Anticolonial media
literacy builds upon the concept of anticolonial literacy (Sabzalian,
2019a). Akin to "equity literacy," which involves the ability to
recognize, respond, and redress bias, discrimination, and inequity in
education, as well as to cultivate and sustain bias-free educational
spaces (Gorski & Swalwell, 2015, p. 37), [anticolonial literacy involves
"the ability to critically read and counter Eurocentric and colonizing
educational discourses and practices]{.underline}" (Sabzalian, 2019a, p.
202). Preparing teachers to be versed in anticolonial media literacy can
support Native students specifically in developing a "critical race
vocabulary" that affords them opportunities to "name their pain" (Matias
& Liou, 2015, p. 615). More broadly, anticolonial media literacy can
support all students in recognizing and deconstructing dehumanizing
colonial logics in media and generate anticolonial alternatives. **[[We
use the term anticolonial]{.underline}]{.mark}**, following Patel
(2016), **[[to "draw into relief the ways in which settler coloniality
must be known to be countered]{.underline}]{.mark}**," a contrast and
complement to the term decolonial which "should always address material
changes" (p. 7). **[[Anticolonial literacy is an important complement to
decolonial praxis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this article, we make a
more explicit link to the need for media literacy, and its necessary
corollary, critical race media literacy (Yosso, 2002). Though we offered
this Superbowl vignette as an example of the way society and media
sanction ongoing dominant colonial narratives, examples of Indigenous
erasure and dehumanization abound. For example, celebrities and ordinary
individuals alike still wear headdresses (Cordes & Merskin, 2019; White,
2017), and racist renderings of the large-nose caricatures of Chief
Wahoo are plastered in high school gyms (Strong, 2004). Statues of
pioneers, enslavers, and other monuments of white3 supremacy still stand
in cities, though there has been a notable increase in their necessary
removal recently (Attiah, 2020). While it is important that educators
can critically read and counter these explicitly degrading examples,
[educators must also learn to read and counter subtler colonial logics
that surface in media. Media is significant for its role in storing
historical memory, reflecting/projecting identity politics, and
producing and challenging hegemonic discourses. Media are texts that can
be read through their codes and structures that work to produce cultural
myths]{.underline} (Barthes, 1972). Educators must learn to read what is
not explicit or learn to read the erasures in media. Anticolonial media
literacy fosters teachers' ability to detect the way Indigenous peoples
are absent from particular representations, and the larger political
ramifications of these erasures. To be sure, **[[representational
literacy]{.mark} is more important than being able to point at media
texts and discern them as "good"]{.underline}** (politically
correct/humanizing) **[representations or "bad"]{.underline}**
(politically incorrect/harmful) representations; **[it also [involves
recognizing the ways media texts are re-presentations of dominant
cultural ideology and hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Hall, 1997).
Re-presentations help members of society make sense of who they are;
thus, Indigenous scholars advocate for "the reestablishment of
representational sovereignty" or the right for Indigenous peoples to
have a say by producing and consuming texts that are not damaging to our
communities (Lewis, 2006, p. 175). This concept has also been referred
to as "rhetorical sovereignty" in the context of writing (Lyons, 2000),
and "visual sovereignty" in the context of film (Raheja, 2010). To set
the context for anticolonial media literacy, we draw on existing
literature that articulates the need for critical race media literacy.
We complement this body of literature by turning to Tribal Critical Race
Theory (hereafter TribalCrit) (Brayboy, 2005). As a means of fleshing
out TribalCrit's central claim---that "colonization is endemic to
society" (p. 429)---we turn to two Native studies theories to support
teachers in recognizing the varied ways colonial logics surface in
media: firsting, replacing, and lasting offered by Jean O'Brien (2010),
and settler grammars conceptualized by Dolores Calderón (2014). We then
put these concepts to work on specific media texts to model anticolonial
media literacy in practice. Because [anticolonial media literacy
requires moving beyond critique to also seek out and offer students
meaningful and respectful alternatives]{.underline}, we end by
highlighting Debbie Reese's advocacy for "critical Indigenous
literacies" (Reese, 2018). [[Media literacy equips students with tools
to analyze the power of media]{.mark} in society including media
construction, production, consumption [and]{.mark} its
effects]{.underline} (Buckingham, 2013; Kellner & Share, 2005). Beyond
individualized skill sets, **[media literacy
[allows]{.mark}]{.underline}** students to relate to others in their
communities (Jenkins, Ito, & boyd, 2016) and engage in contemplative
practice to assess the power of media in helping achieve **[[social
transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Morell, 2012). In her
foundational article, "Critical Race Media Literacy: Challenging Deficit
Discourse about Chicanas/os," Tara J. Yosso (2002) draws on critical
race theory (CRT) to infuse media literacy with the projects of racial
and social justice. Yosso argues this conjoining, what she refers to as
critical race media literacy (CRML), is necessary as schools and media
both reproduce "delusional ideas" about racism, sexism, and classism (p.
53). Drawing on Freire's conception of literacy that advocates for
providing "students with the tools to not only read the word but also to
read the world," Yosso argues, "CRT can challenge students to critically
'read' the racism, sexism, and classism in entertainment media
portrayals of Chicanas/os--to develop critical media literacy" (p. 54).
Through a series of curriculum sessions, Yosso equipped students with
social science theories, concepts, and language in media, as well as
critical race vocabulary to support them in detecting the ways media
reproduce stereotypes and deficit thinking about Chicanas/os. Yosso
found critical race media curriculum sessions effective "in describing
how media, through repetition of negative portrayals, teach Chicanas/os
that they are inferior to whites, and in turn, whites learn that they
are better than Chicanas/os" (p. 59). Students also linked these
negative media portrayals to "material repercussions for Chicano
communities, including fewer financial aid opportunities and community
support programs" (p. 59). [While CRML "cannot be a magic bullet," Yosso
argued it can "facilitate students becoming critically conscious of
themselves in relation to the structures of power and domination in
their world"]{.underline} (p. 59). CRML has since been taken up by
scholars in generative ways (Hawkman & Shear, 2017; Hawkman & Van Horn,
2019; King, 2017; Lozenski & Chinang, 2019). King (2017), for example,
builds on Yosso's work to illustrate how the Center for Media Literacy's
(CML) "Key Questions for Media Inquiry," fail to "explore the dynamics
of race or provide a racial lexicon" (p. 36). To remedy this, King
revises CML's key question to foster racial literacy (i.e.,
supplementing the question "Who created this message?" with the question
"What are the racially constructed messages conveyed through the news?"
(p. 37). Hawkman and Shear (2017) also build on Yosso's framework to
suggest that teachers guide students through a process of confrontation
(confronting problematic racial representations in media), interrogation
(questioning and critiquing those representations), and navigation
(offering students opportunities to challenge those representations).

literacy is indebted to and builds on this important
scholarship.]{.underline}

#### The desire for strong International Relations is Settler Anxiety -- The constant need to be able to influence the world to control the world feeds into the structure of Colonialism

Studies in the Department of English. Michael R. Griffiths is a literary
scholar whose work focuses principally on settler colonial literatures

Colonial Studies, 305-306, DOI: 10.1080/2201473X.2015.1090522) //Don
Markos

This **[issue of Settler Colonial Studies]{.underline}** marks the
attempt [to think the global adjacent to and, indeed, constituted in
relation to questions of internal colonialism and
settlement]{.underline}. As editors, we implicitly follow a contention
of Scott Morgensen's that settler colonialism is not merely a violent
phenomenon of the colonial periphery, but in fact functions as
constitutive of geopolitics at a global level. As Morgensen puts it,
'[Settler colonialism directly informs past and present processes of
European **colonization**, global **capitalism**, liberal modernity and
international governance]{.underline}. If [settler colonialism is not
**theorized in accounts of** these **formations**, then its **power
remains naturalized** in the world t**hat we engage and in the
theoretical apparatuses with which we attempt to explain
it**]{.underline}**.'**1 Settler **[colonialism]{.underline}**, then, is
[not merely a global phenomenon, it **is also constitutive of the
global**.]{.underline} So many nation states which were founded on
settler colonialism are considered first world nation states, and many
are implicated, through thi[s role, in broader operations of regional
and global neoimperial control of territory and interests.]{.underline}
This is a central premise of many of the contributions to this volume,
from Kevin Bruyneel's analysis of the settler colonial vocabulary that
animates US military incursions in the Middle East to Shiri Pasternak's
analysis of the relation between Canadian multi-national private
resource extraction and the ongoing dispossession of native lands in
Canada to Mark Rifkin's careful geopolitical reading of indigenous
internationalism in the United Nations (UN) [Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous People. If the USA is the most paradigmatic (though not
the sole) instantiation of global 'capitalist-territorialism' (to use
Giovanni Arrighi's phrase), then as Bruyneel asserts elsewhere 'the
persistent reproduction of the American foundational mythos]{.underline}
\[ \... \] serves **[critically in the reproduction and legitimation of
settler colonialism as a structure']{.underline}**, and does so in the
manifest global reach of its neoimperial imprint.2 As such, '**[via the
logic of elimination]{.underline}** \[ \... \] **[and dependent upon
settler colonialism America takes up its imperial stance overlooking the
world.]{.underline}** This image illustrates that one cannot acknowledge
the fact of US empire without acknowledging settler colonialism, and
vice versa'.3 To cite US Empire here, as constituted in relation to its
own history of internal (settler) colonialism and manifest destiny is to
cite an example of this relation that might be explored globally. If
[settler colonialism bears relation to the global, as the US example
illustrates, then global comparisons of such modes of dispossession also
might shed light on the complexity of specific internal settler colonial
experiences.]{.underline} This [issue, then, calls upon scholarship to
address the ideologies that traverse comparable political spaces, of
which a number are surveyed in this issue: Australia, Canada, and
Chiapas, Mexico.]{.underline} From the perspective of a critique of
settler colonialism -- which this approach, grounded in the initial
premise of internal colonialism and the idea of elimination, is uniquely
poised to reveal -- what these spaces have in common is a certain
strange double vision surrounding their self-conception. On the one
hand, [settler nation states stress their liberalism and inclusivity and
on the other, they aim to either repress indigenous presence and
difference, or, alternately to occlude its particularly salient claims
by subsuming this difference under a wider multicultural settlement on
the management of alterity]{.underline}. Here, the more the modernity
and liberalism of the settler state is rhetorically stressed and pushed,
the more it indulges in the repression of an indigenous presence often
imagined as an anachronistic and aliberal residue of the type of
ethnically bound and territorially fixed political cultures that
violently clashed and sunk in our pre-global and pre-modern world. [This
is a second crucial premise of this collection's relation to the
globality of settler colonialism: **liberal multicultural policies act
comparably across multiple sites and spaces as avenues for the
reinstitution of dispossession**]{.underline}. From Melissa Forbis'
analysis of Chiapas to Michael Griffiths' argument about the relation
between race and culture in Australia, **[liberal logics are used to
conceal new and incipient modes of dispossession
globally.]{.underline}**

### L----Progress/Reform

#### Settler Colonialism exists past the act of colonization -- the conceptualization of Natives as the 'Other' gives way for systems to ignore indigenous groups even through progressive legislation

**Veracini 11** (Lorenzo Veracini s a historian and professor at
Swinburne University of Technology's Institute for Social Research. He
is the editor in chief of Settler Colonial Studies and has been a key
figure in the development of the field of settler colonialism. (2011)

Beyond isopolitical relationships, [deep colonizing is also essential to
an understanding of settler colonial phenomena]{.underline}.
Australian-based anthropologist Deborah Bird Rose introduced 'deep
colonizing' in a 1996 article dealing with the position of Aboriginal
women in the context of recent developments in land claims legislation
and indigenous tenure. Aboriginal women, she argued, were being
disempowered by attempts to integrate Aboriginal policy and Aboriginal
structures of governance. Specifically, she noted, women were
effectively prevented from meaningfully contributing to evidence
gathering processes. Supporting evidence sustaining Aboriginal land
claims was premised primarily, if not exclusively, on 'knowledge'
forwarded by Aboriginal men: While it is demonstrably the case that many
formal relations between Indigenous people and the colonizing nation
have changed in the past three decades, as have many of the institutions
which regulate these relations, it is also the case that practices of
colonization are very much with us. More profoundly, [many]{.underline}
of these [practices are embedded in the institutions that are meant to
reverse processes of colonization. A land claim is an excellent
example]{.underline}. [On the one hand it reverses conquest by returning
land to Indigenous people. On the other hand, the marginalization of
women, along with \[invasive\] demands for information, perpetuates the
colonizing practices of conquest and appropriation]{.underline}.
[**[Colonizing practices embedded within decolonizing institutions must
not be understood simply as negligible side effects of essentially
benign endeavours]{.underline}**. **[This embeddedness may conceal,
naturalize, or marginalize continuing colonizing
practices]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Furthermore, it can be difficult to
offer a critique of the colonizing features without calling into
question the whole decolonizing project. Again, land rights offer an
excellent example. If the double binds are not teased apart, and if the
colonizing practices are not separated analytically from decolonizing
institutions, conquest will continue. And if it continues in this form
it will be wearing a mask of benign, or even radical, decolonization
which will make it far more difficult to challenge at all levels. Deep
colonizing is the term I use for this process conquest embedded within
institutions and practices which are aimed toward reversing the effects
of colonization. (Rose 1996) [[An ostensibly progressive
legislation]{.mark} endowed with unprecedented liberating
potential]{.underline} some Aboriginal communities were getting their
land back could have, and [[was having, an oppressive
outcome]{.underline}]{.mark} (Rose's warning was somewhat prophetic[:
the recolonial federal government 'intervention' in the Northern
Territory of the late 2000s, when white men were 'compelled' to
intervene in Aboriginal communities in order to 'save' Aboriginal women
and children, was also premised on the deterioration of Aboriginal
women's political standing and power within their
communities]{.underline} [a deterioration that was not countered by the
land claim legislation and practice that followed the promulgation of
the 1994 Native Title Act]{.underline}).5 **[[Deep colonizing as an
analytical tool identifying a particular dynamic, however, should be
pursued further and applied to all circumstances where a progressive and
decolonizing move for some ends up further compromising the position of
others]{.underline}]{.mark}** (similarly, even if in an entirely
different context she was criticizing the concept of 'Renaissance' Joan
Kelly (1984: xiixiii) famously concluded that 'events that further the
historical development of men, liberating them from natural, social, or
ideological constraints, have quite different, even opposite, effects
upon women'). Moreover, [deep colonizing is an especially necessary
conceptual tool for the specific appraisal of settler colonial regimes:
if a triumphant colonial society is a state of affairs
where]{.underline}, as noted by Partha Chatterjee (1993),
[change]{.underline} the promised equality between colonizer and
colonized [is forever postponed]{.underline} ([on deferral as a colonial
strategy]{.underline}, see also Conklin 1997), [where colonizer and
colonized know and ultimately retain their respective places, a
triumphant settler colonial circumstance, having ceased to be a
dependency of a colonizing metropole, having tamed the surrounding
'wilderness', having extinguished indigenous autonomies, and having
successfully integrated various migratory waves, has also ceased being
settler colonial]{.underline} (Veracini 2010). Colonial formations
proclaim their permanence; settler colonial formations on the contrary
announce their passing. [Since it is primarily aimed at producing the
conditions of its own supersession, settler colonialism routinely
operate via deep colonizing means]{.underline}. That deep colonizing
should not be seen as exclusively characterizing the present condition
of the settler colonial polities should be emphasized[. **[As long as
the decolonization of the settler colonial situation remains unresolved,
settler colonial present and settler colonial past inevitably resemble
each other]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Settler independence is one important
example of deep colonizing. On the one hand, as mentioned, settler
colonial formations are charged with an inherently anticolonial
dimension; they upset the hierarchical structures and organization of
colonial formations. On the other, settler independence a specific type
of decolonization is actually an acceleration of colonizing practices.
Marc Ferro, for example, defines 'colonist independence' as the ultimate
stage of imperial conquest, the 'most advanced stage of white colonial
expansion' (1997: 21213). A settler freedom that is premised on
indigenous dispossession, however, is not a unique circumstance in
which, to paraphrase Kelly, events that further the historical
development of some have quite different effects on indigenous peoples.
Civil rights agendas might be mentioned in this context: when W. E. B.
Du Bois noted, for example, in The Souls of Black Folks that 'the
problem of the color line' would be the critical question of the
twentieth century (1994: 1), he performed simultaneously an act of
anticolonial resistance and an act of suppression of indigenous autonomy
(one could assume that in his estimation the 'indigenous problem' would
not be a problem at all). Similarly, the Subaltern Studies Group has
extensively documented how [anticolonial nationalist stances failed to
represent a variety of marginalized subjectivities. The anticolonial
Indian nationalists could and would not represent
'voiceless']{.underline} [(often indigenous/Adivasi) rural subalterns.
While these anticolonial erasures can be construed as examples of deep
colonizing, and considering that 'eliminationist' shifts in indigenous
policies in settler colonial contexts have been routinely couched in a
humanitarian rhetoric emphasizing equality and emancipation from
controlling legislation, it is not surprising that indigenous militancy
in a multiplicity of settings has repeatedly shown a stubborn reluctance
in engaging with other insurgencies and with state driven emancipatory
programs]{.underline}. Ellinghaus's (2007) comparative work on
'assimilative pathways' in two settler colonial polities highlights
instances of indigenous dispossession framed as 'emancipation' (in other
words, deep colonizing). For their exemplarity, two contemporary
instances of deep colonizing could be mentioned in this context. As
recently noted by Jody A. Bird in an article dedicated to his dealings
with Native American issues, future [US president Barack Obama
repeatedly and powerfully articulated during the 2008 presidential
campaign]{.underline} an ongoing project of democratic inclusion. One
especially memorable (and frequently reproduced) speech epitomised this
logic: [For when we have faced down impossible odds, when we've been
told we're not ready or that we shouldn't try or that we can't,
generations of Americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up
the spirit of a people: Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Yes, we can.It was a
creed written into the founding documents that declared the destiny of a
nation: Yes, we can. It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as
they blazed a trail towards freedom through the darkest of nights: Yes,
we can. It was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores
and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness: Yes,
we can. It was the call of workers who organized, women who reached for
the ballot, a president who chose the moon as our new frontier, and a
king who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the promised
land: Yes, we can, to justice and equality. Yes, we can, to opportunity
and prosperity. Yes, we can heal this nation. Yes, we can repair this
world. Yes, we can.]{.underline} (Quoted in Bird 2009: 23) This powerful
narrative identifies a series of successive emancipatory
enfranchisements: of African Americans, of ethnic migrants, of workers,
of women. Even the 'settler pioneers' are part of this process even they
get to be emancipated. [And yet]{.underline}, as Bird perceptively
points out, [there are no American Indians in this picture]{.underline}.
Indeed, [**[Native Americans are doubly absent]{.mark}**: they are
conspicuously missing from this list of emancipatory passages[, **and
they are erased as an obstacle**]{.mark}: the pioneers who 'pushed
westward' did not move against them]{.underline} (unless we are willing
to consider the Indian nations that occupied the continent as part of an
'unforgiving wilderness'). As such, Bird concludes, as '[the pioneers,
immigrants, slaves and abolitionists progressed towards a destined more
perfect union, **American Indian nations had to be pushed to the margins
and then out of the picture altogether'**]{.underline} (23). Operating
within a system that routinely demands that we forget that the pioneers
were either dispossessing Indians or receiving stolen property
(especially considering that he was in the business of winning a close
election)? Yes, he was. In November 2009 a year after his election
[President Obama invited 500 tribal leaders to a massive
conference]{.underline} the first of its kind [dedicated to developing a
comprehensive new approach in the management of Indian
affairs]{.underline}. His administration is not uninterested in Indian
affairs; this agenda, however, is essentially framed [in terms of
welfare rather than sovereignty]{.underline} (what in Australian
parlance would be referred to as 'practical reconciliation', and in a US
context has been defined by Jessica Cattelino (2010) as 'need-based'
sovereignty).6 While this progressive agenda envisaging yet another
emancipatory passage for US indigenous people remains ultimately
premised on an original disavowal, attempts to address indigenous
disadvantage that fail to recognize the need to decolonize a settler
colonial system of relationships can be understood as deep colonizing.
Besides, indigenous welfare and 'rehabilitation' are about (settler)
benevolence and (indigenous) need, not about inherent sovereign
entitlements (Kauanui 2008: 34). Rehabilitation without reconciliation
isn't rehabilitation. An ocean away, newly elected Australian prime
minister Kevin Rudd's official parliamentary apology to the 'stolen
generations', as noted by Maria Giannacopoulos (2009), who wrote an
insightful typology of Rudd's rhetorical strategies of evasion, provides
another example of deep colonizing (for the text of the apology, see
Rudd 2008). Firstly, she notes, Rudd's apology is strictly about the
theft of children, not the theft of land (as if child removal could be
separated from the system of power relationships in which it happened).
Secondly, by definition, an apology is about saying sorry and about
defending one's actions: '[[Rudd's apology appears to be less about
benefiting Indigenous peoples and more about serving as an exculpation
mechanism for white modes of powe]{.mark}r']{.underline}, she notes. In
the apology, [[the state is both defendant and judge]{.mark}, and as
such it self-prosecutes, [carefully circumscribing]{.mark} the limits of
[critique]{.mark} that may be made [against it]{.mark}]{.underline} [or,
more specifically, that it calculatedly makes against
itself.]{.underline} The apology functions simultaneously as the site of
blame (prosecuted) and as the site of justification (defence).
(Giannacopoulos 2009: 339) In this sense[, [**the apology amounts to a
solipsistic act, where the settler sovereign talks to itself about
itself, reconciling itself with its past**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Moreover, Rudd's apology carefully contains its scope, and is construed
as only applicable in relation to past occurrences. Thus, Giannacopoulos
notes, by 'blaming itself with reference to its past incarnations the
current sovereign controls the parameters of critique whilst also
exculpating itself for liability in the present'; ultimately, [[the
'apology is made by the current sovereign]{.underline} [without the
acknowledgment that those things being apologized for persist in the
present']{.underline}]{.mark} (340). [This narrative shift produces a
situation in which current indigenous grievances are strategically
dismissed: the apology is circumscribed to the past]{.underline}; the
past Rudd is quite explicit about this cannot be changed, and the
present is another story.7 At the same time, [by strictly and explicitly
defining the period covered by the apology]{.underline} specifically,
the years between 1910 and 1970 Rudd [strategically avoids focusing on
both the establishment of settler colonial relations]{.underline} (the
pre-1910 period), and their ongoing current operation (the post-1970
era).8 [As the apology blames 'bad laws' enacted by 'bad parliaments', a
double exculpation takes place: the failure was not settler
colonialism's, and not of those who were personally involved in
delivering and enacting genocidal policies. **[Both the system and the
perpetrators are thus effectively excused (even if it is acknowledged
that both policies and executors were racist)]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Ultimately, **[[since the apology is construed as a generous gift,
'instead of Indigenous people being given something back' it is them who
owe acceptance to Rudd]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Giannacopoulos 2009:
344). Rudd's concluding remarks underscore this peculiar inversion: 'my
proposal is this: if the apology we extend today is accepted in the
spirit of reconciliation in which it is offered, we can today resolve
together that that there be a new beginning for Australia' (Rudd 2008).
Giannacopoulos points out: 'Rudd is making the apology, but only if it
is accepted can his plan succeed. If the future does not shine as Rudd
anticipates it will, it will be the fault of those who have not fallen
into line \[i.e., the Aboriginal people who would not accept the
apology\]' (Giannacopoulos 2009: 345). Rudd's settler repertoire of
evasion thus includes blaming indigenous people for settler
colonialism.9 Reconciliation without compensation isn't reconciliation.

#### Settler Colonialism is not a one-time event, but a structuring logic of elimination constantly manifested in everyday reiterations of our spatial inhabitance and subjective being.

**Rifkin 14** -- Associate Professor of English & WGS @ UNC-Greensboro
(Mark, 'Settler Common Sense: Queerness and Everyday Colonialism in the
American Renaissance,' pp. 7-10)

If nineteenth-century American literary studies tends to focus on the
ways Indians enter the narrative frame and the kinds of meanings and
associa- tions they bear, [recent [attempts to theorize settler
colonialism]{.mark} have sought to **[shift attention from its
effects]{.mark} on Indigenous subjects** [to its implications for
**nonnative political attachments, forms of inhabitance, and modes of
being**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} illuminating and [[tracking the
**pervasive operation of settlement as a system**]{.underline}.]{.mark}
In Settler Colonialism and the Transformation of Anthropology, Patrick
Wolfe argues, "Settler colonies were (are) premised on the elimination
of native societies. The split tensing reflects a determinate feature of
settler colonization. The colonizers come to stay---**[[invasion is a
structure not an event]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (2).6 He suggests that
[[a "logic of elimination" drives settler]{.mark} governance and
[sociality]{.mark}]{.underline}, describing "[the settler-colonial
will]{.underline}" as "a historical force that [ultimately derives from
the primal drive to expansion]{.underline} that is generally glossed as
capitalism" (167), and in "Settler Colonialism and the Elimination of
the Native," he observes that ["[elimination is an **organizing
principle of settler-colonial society**]{.underline} ]{.mark}[rather
than a one-off (and superceded) occurrence]{.underline}" (388). Rather
than being superseded after an initial moment/ period of conquest,
colonization persists since "[the logic of elimination marks a return
whereby **[the native]{.mark} repressed [continues to structure settler-
colonial society]{.mark}**]{.underline}["]{.mark} (390). In Aileen
Moreton-Robinson's work, whiteness func- tions as the central way of u
nderstanding the domination and displacement of Indigenous peoples by
nonnatives.7 In "Writing Off Indigenous Sover- eignty," she argues, "As
a regime of power, patriarchal white sovereignty operates ideologically,
materially and discursively to reproduce and main- tain its investment
in the nation as a white possession" (88), and in "Writ- ing Off
Treaties," she suggests, "[**At an ontological level the structure of
subjective possession** occurs through the imposition of one's
will-to-be on the thing which is perceived to lack will, thus it is
**open to being possessed**]{.underline}," such that "[possession . . .
forms]{.underline} part of **[the ontological structure of white
subjectivity]{.underline}**" (83--84). For Jodi Byrd, the deployment of
Indianness as a mobile figure works as the principal mode of U.S.
settler colonialism. She observes that "[[colonization and racialization
. . . have **often been conflated**," in ways that]{.underline}]{.mark}
"tend to be sited along the axis of inclusion/exclusion" and that
"**[misdirect and [cloud attention from the underlying structures of
settler colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (xxiii, xvii). She argues
that [settlement works through the translation of indigeneity as
Indianness]{.underline}, casting place-based political collec- tivities
as (racialized) populations subject to U.S. jurisdiction and manage-
ment: "[the Indian is left nowhere and everywhere within the ontological
premises through which U.S. empire orients]{.underline}, imagines, and
critiques [itself]{.underline} "; "[[ideas of]{.underline}]{.mark}
Indians and [[Indianness have served as **the ontological ground through
which U.S. settler colonialism enacts itself**]{.mark}]{.underline} "
(xix).

#### The occupation of indigenous land recruits Native bodies on which to write colonial onto-epistemologies, making the annihilation of Native forms of life the aim of colonial world-making through excessive, death-driven violence.

### L----Hegemony

//Don Markos

A further subliminal strategy has been the normative prescription of a
[**"benign" neo-imperial politics**]{.underline} that also goes by a
[**whitewashed or sanitised name**.]{.underline} Thus neorealist
hegemonic stability theory (HST) [**elevates the exercise of
(Anglo-Saxon) hegemony** to the **implicit status of a civilising
mission**]{.underline} (e.g. Gilpin 1981), [while neoliberal
institutionalism does much the same with respect to the role played by
Western international institutions, especially the IFIs]{.underline}
(Keohane 1984). [In both visions, a major rationale of Western hegemons
and their international institutions is to **culturally convert Third
World states along Western civilisational lines**:]{.underline} the very
essence of the old liberal mantra of the civilising mission. [And both
approaches echo the manifest paternalist Eurocentric formula of awarding
**"pioneering" progressive agency to the West** and **"conditional
agency" to the East**]{.underline}. These two terms refer to the point
that [for paternalist forms of Eurocentrism the West is assumed to have
the **"fully rational" capability** to self-generate into
modernity]{.underline} (the "Eurocentric logic of immanence"), [while
the East is said to be **blocked from doing so** on account of its
**"irrational institutions".**]{.underline} [This led to the
**paternalist-imperial formula** in which Eastern development can occur
but **only on condition** that the **rational institutions of the
civilised West** are delivered courtesy of the **benign-paternalist
Western civilising mission**. Thus for HST and Keohane's neoliberal
institutionalism, hegemony and international institutions respectively
come to **replace the terminology of the liberal civilising mission**,
even if these former terms **perform the exact same logic as the
latter**]{.underline}. The route into this alternative reading of HST
lies with the point that [in order to celebrate British and American
hegemony Gilpin is forced to **suspend some of the cardinal axioms of
neorealism**. For a key property of hegemony is that it must secure
world order and development for all states but in the process this
**leads inevitably to the relative decline of the hegemon via the "free
rider problem"**]{.underline}. The immediate problem here is that
neorealism, especially in its "offensive" variant that Gilpin supported
in the period when he constructed HST (i.e. 1975 through 1987), 6
[asserts that states seek to **maximise their relative gains over
others**]{.underline} (Gilpin 1975, 23, 34 -- 6, 85 -- 92). [But it is
clear that in HST **this principle applies to all states bar the
hegemon**.]{.underline} Or, put differently, [in this vision we are
treated to a story in which the leading great power not only **does not
seek to enhance its relative power over others** but instead
**sacrifices its power for the benefit of others**, thereby
**contradicting the cardinal realist axiom**]{.underline} -- that "the
strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must" . Thus in
Gilpin's HST this cardinal realist axiom is precisely inverted: "The
weak do what they can and the strongest does what it must." [That the
hegemon is exceptional is clear, though why it is so is **not
explained** other than through a **circularity** as well as through a
**structural-functionalist mode of reasoning**: specifically, that **the
hegemon self-sacrifices because "that is what hegemons
do"**]{.underline} (i.e. the circularity); and that without the presence
of a hegemon the world economy descends into recession and rising
inter-state competition because the international system requires a
hegemon to promote stability and world order (i.e. the
structural-functionalist assertion). But simply asserting that the
system "requires" a hegemon for ensuring world order and stability
[**does not explain why a leading great power chooses to become a
hegemon in the first place**, especially as **all it can look forward to
is its decline relative** to those that it "helps]{.underline}". In
essence, then, there is no recourse within neorealist logic to explain
the highly anomalous altruistic status that HST ascribes to the United
States in the 1945-73 period or to Britain in 1845-73. Explaining this
gap in the theory requires focussing on the presence of a subconscious
American ethnocentrism and subliminal paternalist Eurocentrism which, I
want to suggest, lies at the very base of HST. That is, US hegemony
reflects the nineteenth-century discourse of "American exceptionalism"
and its accompanying neo-imperialist idiom of America's "manifest
destiny", much as "British exceptionalism" and "manifest destiny"
underpinned the idea of the British Empire. For [the notion of helping
all other states, especially those in the Third World, conjures up the
idiom of the "**civilising mission**" and the "**white man's
burden**".]{.underline} Thus I want to suggest that [within Gilpin's
theory it is precisely this **Eurocentric-imperialist sensibility** that
**underpins the real explanation** for why leading Anglo-Saxon great
powers choose to become hegemons and why they supposedly sacrifice
themselves for the good of others]{.underline}. Still, while my reading
thus far is based on logical deduction, nevertheless [there is a clear
slippage in Gilpin's "positivist play of mimetic universalism" where he
makes **explicit reference to hegemony as a benign imperial civilising
mission**]{.underline}. As is well known, [Gilpin begins by
differentiating hegemons from imperial powers]{.underline}. Although
Gilpin argues that, with the exception of the Soviet Union, the modern
world is governed by the progressive non-imperialist politics of liberal
hegemons whereas the pre-modern world was based on the cyclical and
stultifying/regressive politics of despotic Eastern empires, [this
distinction is problematised by the obvious point that Britain was the
greatest imperial power prior to 1945, as much as **the United States
has been the greatest neo-imperial power in the post-1945 era**. The
critical point is that Gilpin attempts to circumvent this obvious
inconsistency by explicitly resorting, paradoxically, to the
nineteenth-century imperialist trope of the **liberal civilising
mission**.]{.underline} To this end he invokes Karl Marx's paternalist
civilising mission conception whereby modern European imperial powers
transferred capital and technologies to the colonies not to exploit but
to uplift them (Gilpin 1981, 142 -- 3); or again, that the dominant
power helps to create challenging powers. Ironically, as Marx himself
appreciated, one of the greatest forces for diffusion has been
imperialism.... The imperial power has stimulated the colonized peoples
to learn its ways and frequently has taught them advanced military,
political, and economic techniques. (Gilpin 1981, 176) Here, then, we
encounter the key "paternalist-imperial" civilising mission trope, in
which liberal empires take on the guise of a benevolent father who
teaches his children -- both directly and by way of example -- to
embrace and develop what he has already pioneered so that they can grow
up and one day prosper[.]{.underline} Thus in defending his
"non-imperialist" reading of hegemony it seems clear that Gilpin, like
Hedley Bull, is addressing the wrong target. For his assumption is that
imperialism is defined by the exploitation of the weak by the strong.
But in Marx's vision -- as well as that of the paternalist Eurocentric
liberal -- [**imperialism** is conceptualised as a civilising mission
precisely because it entails the West engaging in the "paternalist
uplift**",** rather than the coercive exploitation, of the
East]{.underline}.

### L----Security Commitments

#### **The archive of security commitments [began]{.underline} with the securitization of indigenous peoples**

This union of unions was not authorized under the charters of the member
settlements, which included the newly-created New Haven federation,
other federations of the colony of Connecticut, and the colonies of
Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth. [To govern the union, [the United
Colonies created Articles of Confederation]{.mark} that
[justified]{.mark} its formation [on the grounds that **"hostile Native
American tribes to the west" posed an urgent,**]{.mark} **common
[threat]{.mark} to its members.** They explained: ... whereas we live
encompassed with people of several nations and strange languages which
hereafter may prove injurious to us or our posterity.]{.underline} And
forasmuch as natives have formerly committed sundry insolence and
outrages upon several Plantations of the English and have of late
combined themselves against us. (Pulsifer 1861, 3) ¶ [[Each
colony]{.mark} agreed to maintain its own government and legal order,
but [approved twelve articles designed to govern their common
affairs]{.mark}, including such matters as jurisdiction, procedures for
membership, representation and meeting,]{.underline} and proportionate
shares of the Confederation's defense budget and spoils of war, as well
as the "removal of residents from one plantation to another; policies
towards the Native Americans," or in other words, immigration and Indian
affairs (Pulsifer 1861, 3[). [To aggregate their power, **the colonial
federations swore**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to submit to these Articles,
and thereby[, **to "jointly and severally hereby enter into a
firm**]{.mark} and perpetual **[league of friendship]{.mark}** and amity
**[for offence and defenc]{.mark}e,** mutual advice and succor upon all
just occasions... **for their own mutual safety and
welfare**"]{.underline} (Pulsifer 1861, 3). ¶ Two aspects of this
inter-federation compact seem especially noteworthy in light of the
foregoing discussion. First, the New England Confederation was analogous
to the compacts between individuals that formed its constituent units.
Like them, it announced itself as a mutual defense pact, in light of the
dangers presented by the hostile relations that they had cultivated with
the tribes in the area, or "the state of nature" Locke described.
[**[The purpose of this union was]{.mark}** similarly **[to protect
colonists' security and property in America,]{.mark}** all of which, in
1643, colonists had but freshly claimed. It facilitated colonists'
ability to hold\--but also first to acquire, and then continue to
acquire\--quantities of goods and land from indigenous
people.]{.underline} Another term for this pattern of continuous
creation of property through the acquisition of indigenous lands is
colonial expansion, which the social compact supported at the
inter-group level, as well as the individual level, by making possible
the liberal use of violence in transactions with outsiders. [The
privileges and violence that the social compact distributed placed the
collective threat of violence behind every member of the colonial
community in its acquisitive, extractive, expansionist
endeavors.]{.underline} ¶ Second, the New England Confederation
exemplifies a distinct social compact formation that ordered a
multi-level system of government. [We can thus understand Locke's
narrative as encoding a foundational structural principle that gave rise
to a new society in a broader sense, as well as rethinking its character
as plausibly historically descriptive]{.underline}. As higher-order
social compacts facilitated intergroup cooperation against an
ever-expanding background of trade, or "Promises and Barter for Truck"
and land, the consent that individuals had expressed to form the
lower-order compacts were first once, then twice removed to
representatives of the increasingly large imagined communities. [The
passage of time, or the famous generational problem, did not defeat
actual consent within the federated social
compact]{.underline}---already an abstraction from the stillfeudal
family order\-- as much as spatial, territorial ambition, or expansion
did. [When direct participation became impractical within the government
that held itself to be of, by and for the people, consent became
synecdochal through political representation.]{.underline} ¶ Thus, while
the social compacts founding New England towns and uniting colonial
federations were analogous in form, they also existed in direct relation
to one another and transformed the meaning of consent to political
government. By 1700, the growth and proliferation of federations between
the originally diverse townships formed by civil covenants, which had
determined "where people settled and lived" and "affected virtually all
citizens of seventeenth century New England," resulted in increasing
civil and political uniformity (Weir 2005, 236, 233). The United
Colonies' Articles of Confederation emerged in parallel order with the
later 1754 Albany Plan of Union, an intercolonial pact that Benjamin
Franklin proposed in order to treat with the Iroquois Confederation.
Both preceded the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union ratified
by all thirteen of the original colonies in 1781. ¶ As John Quincy Adams
stated, "The New England confederacy of 1643 was the model and prototype
of the North American confederacy of 1774" (Pulsifer 1861, xiv-xv). In
both of these cases, the parties formed the union without authority or
sanction from the charters given by the Crown, the authority to which
they were supposed to defer. Where the formation of the United Colonies
produced tension within this hierarchical relationship, the United
States pursued independence through the Revolution, indexing the growing
power and appeal of the colonial expansion these unions supported.
Adams, indeed, refuted the colonies' debt of allegiance to the Crown by
identifying natural law as the source of authority for these federal
compacts, writing, "In both cases it was the great law of nature and of
nature\'s God\-- the law of self-preservation and self-defence, which
invested the parties, as separate communities, with power to pledge
their mutual faith for the common defence and general welfare of all"
(Pulsifer 1861, xiv-xv). The law of transnational relations, by his
account, licensed the Union to organize their forces against both
indigenous nations and the Crown, when it allied with the enemies
against whom the colonies had joined forces. ¶ In short, as the
advantages of civil society in the state of nature made social compacts
proliferate across New England, these compacts' intensification of the
state of nature they produced gave rise to a higher-order compact and
the principle of federalism itself, which was finally enshrined in the
Constitution. This emergence of federations signaled the appearance of
rototypical modern state forms, whose consolidation and organization of
force raised the stakes of the omnipresent threat of war in the state of
nature. At this inter-group level, [the comparison we drew earlier
between [compacts]{.mark} and collusion or conspiracy [also translates
as a project Charles Tilly has called **"war risking and state
making."**]{.mark}]{.underline} Drawing from the European, rather than
American context, Tilly describes states as "quintessential protection
rackets with the advantage of legitimacy," and historical war and state
makers as akin to "coercive and self-seeking entrepreneurs" (1985, 169).
However, where Tilly contrasts this image of states as coercive forces
of business against benevolent ideas about the state such as "social
contract" (1985, 169), I have tried to show here how [**[the social
contract is]{.mark} not the opposite but [the essence of the form that
organizes and directs the violence of the state]{.mark} that Tilly
emphasizes**. The historical example of New England]{.underline}, I have
argued, [sheds light on the Second Treatise by illustrating "the place
of organized means of violence in the growth and change of those
peculiar forms of government we call national states]{.underline}"
(Tilly 1985, 170), from the law-founding consolidation of violence of
the first individual and federal compacts, to the new orders of violent
expropriation, contracts and compacts that emerged under the United
States' expansion efforts, which I will explore below. ¶ First, however,
it is worth noting that [the same calculation that incentivized the
states to consolidate their force also motivated them, conversely, to
seek to splinter their enemies' power.]{.underline} Even before the
Revolutionary War, the accumulated pressures of white immigration, land
dispossession and the displacement of tribes were laying the groundwork
for a coalition of Northern and Southern tribes, and such a union seemed
imminent to colonists by the spring of 1774 (Sosin 1967, 85). As the
authors of the Federalist Papers note, [[the states' independent
activities only exacerbated the threat of a full-blown interracial war;
they cite "several instances of Indian hostilities... provoked by the
improper conduct of individual States, who, either unable or unwilling
to restrain or punish offences, have given occasion to the slaughter of
many innocent inhabitants]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Hamilton, Jay and
Madison 1788, 16). During this period, "\[t\]he menace of unsettled
boundaries was everywhere" (Paxson 2001, 48), and the "vast tract of
unsettled territory within the boundaries of the United States" was the
source of "discordant and undecided claims" lingering "between several
of \[the States\]" (Hamilton, Jay and Madison 1788, 34).¶ The creation
of a speculative land market based on the conquest of western lands
would require cooperation between states and with the federal
government, and the formation of a strong counter-union that could face
its enemies in war. To lessen the causes of war that a "disunited
America" would proliferate, [**[the Federalists]{.mark}** therefore
**[argued that a "United America" was necessary to consolidate the power
of the states]{.mark}** in the service of a common aim; a central power
would both constrain and mediate between the states, and between the
states and Indian nations]{.underline} (1787, 13-14, 16). For the
Federalists, [["\[**t\]he utility of the UNION" would be to facilitate
continuing conquest: future dispossession**]{.mark} would relieve member
states of their individual and collective debt, manage internal
unruliness **[by creating a central monopoly on violence]{.mark},** and
allow for surplus accumulation that could become the basis of a powerful
national economy]{.underline} (1787, 6). On the same principle, under
the compact that established the United States, the central government
promptly adopted a policy of exploiting longstanding rivalries and
hostilities between tribes. This divide-and-conquer approach to Indian
Affairs constituted a logical counterpoint to the new, centralized
strength of the Union. Under the authority of the War Department,
General St. Clair, who negotiated separately with the Six Nations and
the Great Lakes tribes, thought he could "set them at deadly variance"
(Smith 1882, 113).42 Congress counseled Indian agents to "deal with each
Indian tribe or nation as separately as possible," and insisted that
"the tribes were to be kept separated so that negotiations would be
easier" (Kades 2000, 1120). ¶

Isopolitical interstate associations are especially relevant to settler
colonial phenomena. [[An isopolitical connection enables the seamless
transfer of people and their rights between separate
polities]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this context, [subjects of one polity
immediately acquire property rights and enjoy unrestricted political
status as they move across jurisdictions]{.underline}. [If settlers can
be defined as founders of political orders]{.underline} (unlike
migrants, who are appellants facing a political order that is already
constituted), people who travel with an inherent capacity to possess
real estate and father children endowed with political rights,
[colonizing metropole and settler locale are united in an isopolitical
relation. [Settlers are]{.mark}]{.underline} indeed [[subjects
who]{.mark}, unlike migrants or other colonized people, [can immediately
exercise commercium and connubium, both necessary elements of all
isopolitical arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline} (of course, not all
settlers depart and arrive autonomously, or are immediately endowed with
political rights; they can, however, be selectively co-opted at a later
stage). Moreover, isopolities, [[one specific type of 'interstate
kinship']{.underline}]{.mark} (Elwyn 1993), [and settler colonies are
especially related: settler colonialism [is]{.mark} inherently about
[the reproduction of 'daughter' colonies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
classical world envisaged a variety of possible relationships between
separate political entities, [including]{.mark}]{.underline}, for
example, isopolity, sympolitical arrangements (when a common federal
citizenship is instituted beside the local one), and **[[symmachy (when
a warring league is established, with a polity automatically engaging in
war as an ally of another]{.mark}).]{.underline}** Not all the
isopolities of the classical world were colonies, but all colonies were
isopolitical (for a discussion of isopolitical relations in the
classical world, see Hammond 1951). We should recover this variety and
utilize it as a conceptual toolbox in an attempt to escape the
constraints of national teleologies and the nation-state. Moreover, even
if these categories may look exotic and anachronistic, we should keep in
mind that the colonizations practised by the Greeks and the Romans
informed in fundamental ways the colonial imaginaries of the European
expansion. The intensity of colonialism's imaginative engagement with
the ancients should not be underestimated. The question of how British
settler nationalisms and metropolitan imperialisms have co-defined each
other while operating concomitantly and in reciprocal tension in a
variety of settings is the subject of an extensive scholarly literature,
and an issue that is periodically approached (and yet rarely resolved).1
The settler nationalisms of the British Empire (and their respective
sub-imperialisms) remain intractably ambivalent: their claims are
routinely premised on their arising simultaneously from the settler
locale and in relation to the originating metropole (see Berger 1970;
Schreuder and Ward 2008). Reflecting on the long-term evolution of the
relationship between Australian nationalism and Britishness, and
convincingly reversing received nationalist and nationalizing
assumptions, Neville Meaney concluded that 'the history of nationalism
in Australia was not one of thwarted Australianness but rather of
thwarted Britishness' (2001: 89). 'Australians had two views of Britain
and the Empire', he noted; 'while they overlapped', they remained
distinct. accommodate double allegiances, an isopolitical union allows
one to be faithful to a relationship; one does not have to choose. At
the same time, **[[isopolitical ties]{.mark}]{.underline}** also
**[[allow for the local settler claim and the metropolitan one
potentially to enjoy equal status; as such, settler colonial formations
fundamentally challenge the hierarchical relationship between core and
periphery that is inherent in colonial and imperial
relation]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. [The distinction between 'settlers'
and 'colonists' as distinct terms and their usage mirrors this shift.
'Colonist', 'colonial' and 'creole' identify people in the context of a
hierarchical understanding of the relationship between metropole and
settler locale; 'settler', on the contrary, expresses a marked degree of
political autonomy]{.underline}. Settlers imagine a non-subordinate
relationship between settler locale and metropole they operate
isopolitically.4 (On the other hand, there is another fundamental
distinction that separates 'colonists' and 'settlers': a 'colonist' is
someone who may or may not be animated by animus returnandi his
intention to stay in the settler locale remains unclear until the
question of whether he is a bona fide settler a determination that only
a settler society would demand forces the issue. A colonist could indeed
be someone bent on accumulating money and returning home, someone who is
not fully committed to the local settler project.) In this context,
Edward Gibbon Wakefield, for example, espoused a 'colonial' conception.
In 'A View on the Art of Colonization' he noted: speaking generally,
colonies and colonists are in fact, as well as in the estimation of the
British gentry, inferior, low, unworthy of much respect, properly
disliked and despised by people of honour here, who happen to be
acquainted with the state of society in the colonies. (Wakefield 1968:
837) **[[Wakefield thus envisaged a hierarchically integrated system
with the colonizing metropole on top, and the settler colonial locales
as its subordinate elements]{.underline}]{.mark}** (however, he was
convinced that the settler locales could be made to look very much like
the metropole and that this could be done immediately in this sense he
proposed that their relationship with the colonizing core be only
marginally subordinate). Of course, 'colonist' and 'settler' as distinct
even if often partially overlapping categories interacted in a very
dynamic context, and their usage and respective meanings underwent
important shifts. As James Belich has recently and persuasively
documented, 'settler' became progressively more important (on
'settlerism', the ideology of the 'settler revolution', see Belich
(2009: 15365); on shifting patterns of perception, see Grant (2005)).
The debates that propelled and accompanied the 'settler revolution'
during the second half of the nineteenth century comprehensively
reinterpreted the relationship between core and periphery. In this
context, the settler locale 4 Greene (2002) also emphasizes this
distinction: 'my use of the term settlers is deliberate', he notes, 'it
has long been employed in the historical analysis of other nations that
arose out of the British Empire (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and
South Africa), because it avoids the dependency implications associated
with the word colonists (metropolitans always considered colonists to be
a category of others)' (251). On the contradiction between Jeffersonian
settlerism and the Hamiltonian 'creole complex', see Goudie (2009was
redefined as a site for possible political regeneration. J. S. Mill, for
example, thought that the colonies he meant the settler colonies could
be sites for unprecedented experimentation (see Bell 2010). Belich is
right in using a terminology that emphasizes rupture and discontinuity.
This was a revolutionary reconceptualization[: whereas according to a
colonial paradigm the settler locale is appropriate only as far as it
resembles the metropole, according to the settler colonial one the
settler locale is appropriate primarily because it is dissimilar to it.
A colonial relationship was thus reconfigured into a settler colonial
one and the imagination became isopolitical.]{.underline} The global
settler 'revolution', in fact, entailed a global isopolitical turn. And
yet, this revolution was grounded in another. The American one had
terminated a sympolitical project and defeated a centralizing
metropolitan effort to ensure sustained metropolitan ascendancy over its
dependencies. Thus, as well as breaking up the first British Empire, the
American Revolution could also be seen as actually reconstituting a new
one in an alternative form. Not for nothing has Eliga H. Gould defined
the second British Empire as a non-unitary collection of polities, 'a
consortium of realms and provinces'. He linked this diversity with the
outcome of the Revolution: parliament, he noted, never again attempted
to tax in a direct manner the settlers of the empire (Gould 1999: 482).
The independence of the North American colonies thus led to a
consolidation of (settler) isopolitical forms within the British Empire;
that isopolitical ties could grow and consolidate both inside and
outside the United States should be emphasized (Belich 2005). The
American Revolution could then be seen as an earlier isopolitical moment
in a consolidating and expanding settler colonial world. The
isopolitical entity that nineteenth-century debates over emigration and
'systematic' colonization dealt with is generally referred to as
'Greater Britain' (even if, as mentioned, isopolitical imaginings
involved the expanding United States as well; see, for example, Kramer
2002; Bell 2007; Belich 2009, esp. 465501). Isopolitics are relevant to
these debates. Influential historian J. R. Seeley, for example, was
explicitly in favour of isopolitical relationships: in his opinion, the
British Empire should do 'what the United States does so easily, that is
hold together in a federal union countries very remote from each other'
(quoted in Gould 1999: 487, n. 50). Froude would argue in very similar
terms (see Bell 2009). Seeley's Expansion of England actually had an
educational purpose; it aimed to describe an 'ethnological unity'
comprising the colonies of settlement, the Caribbean, but not India
because it had been 'conquered' (Seeley 1931). It was Seeley that
popularized 'Greater Britain', but the term had originally been invented
by Charles Dilke (2005). Seeley was based in Cambridge; E. A. Freeman (a
bit later) lectured at Oxford; this was in fact a coherent if not
coordinated effort aimed at rethinking the very nature of empire.
Freeman toured the United States in 18812, and referred to 'brethren in
a higher brotherhood, born of one ancient stock, speaking one ancient
tongue, sharers under different forms in one ancient freedom' (quoted in
Armitage 1999: 437). Sharing 'under different forms in one ancient
freedom' is a key trait of this type of discourse, a formulation that
ultimately amounts to a description of isopolitical ties, where specific
entitlements are transferred to different settings and flexibly
accommodate changing political circumstances. Albert Venn Dicey, one of
the founders of the London School of Economics, eventually explicitly
called in 1897 for the establishment of an 'isopolity' of the English
race (he interpreted it as 'common citizenship' 'isopolity' was probably
only explicitly mentioned at the end of decades of sustained debate
because in many ways it had previously gone without saying). Uniting
Britain and its settler dominions and the United States, this entity was
to be a response to global geopolitical shifts. While Dicey specifically
argued that an isopolity should be merely formalized in order to mirror
already existing conditions, he was clearly imagining a community of
white men: he excluded indigenous peoples from the working of its
proposed isopolity, and suggested that an isopolitical move could be
effectively used against the migration to the United States of a variety
of undesirables (Dicey 1897: 4634, 466). While this framing is a
reminder that settler colonial formations are equally exclusive of
indigenous and exogenous alterities, his proposal did not ultimately
meet with political support. Nation-states were on the rise, but what is
remarkable in this context is that in proposing a union between Greater
Britain and the United States Dicey was actually taking for granted the
sustained isopolitical union of Britain and its settler colonies. Even
if the national paradigm was eventually asserted, the long-lasting
resilience of isopolitical sensibilities as they applied transnationally
to Greater Britain (and the United States) should be emphasized (see,
for examples, Gorman 2002; Lake 2003; Lake and Reynolds 2008). Winston
Churchill eventually wrote an isopolitical History of the
English-Speaking Peoples (see Armitage 1999: 429). [The empire proper
was then dissolving in the context of a model of decolonization that
focused on Westphalian sovereign independence for former colonial
possessions; the Commonwealth, despite the protestations and
recalcitrance of its settler constituents, had been reorganized in ways
that were now including formerly colonized Others]{.underline} (and
enlisting them for the Cold War effort), [but the 'empire of racial
identity' was still showing a stubborn imaginative
resilience.]{.underline} Isopolity (and indeed simmachy these are times
of automatic intervention in foreign theatres) retains contemporary
relevance**[. [The 'special relationship' between Israel and the United
States, for example, is premised on the seamless transfer of people and
their rights across jurisdictions and is underpinned by an extraordinary
imaginary engagement that is in turn sustained by a shared settler
colonial sensitivity]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Veracini 2007[).
Isopolitics should not be seen as solely restricted to the past.
Recovering the isopolitical character of settler colonial imaginaries is
also important because a focus on the tension between 'colonial'
subordination and 'independent' national sovereignty can make settler
colonialism disappear]{.underline}. Both in Canadian and US
historiographies, for example, [a focus on the fundamental rupture
represented by American independence has contributed to making an
appraisal of settler colonial phenomena especially
difficult]{.underline} (it is probably no coincidence that settler
colonialism as a transnational interpretative category is an
Australasian contribution). In the United States it resulted in an
emphasis on accomplished sovereign national independence; in Canada, on
the contrary, it produced an emphasis on a sustained relationship and
institutional connection with Britain. A focus on the anticolonial
struggle against the British occupiers traditionally prevented
'colonialism' from entering the analytical field in the United States,
while in Canada 'colonialism' did not enter the analytical field because
it was by definition something done by someone else. Even the
historiographical revisions introduced since the late 1960s did not
focus on settler colonialism: [in the United States the main argument
was that, although it had been previously denied, US foreign and
internal engagements were actually imperialist]{.underline} (see Kaplan
and Pease (1993), [which reflected authoritatively on two decades of
historiographical revision]{.underline}); in Canada the argument was
that British imperialism was actually Canadian imperialism (see Berger
(1970), which authoritatively initiated two decades of historiographical
revision). The dialectical opposition between rupture and institutional
continuity thus prevented an engagement with settler colonialism as an
interpretative category. [[Without an appraisal of isopolitical
relationships, settler colonialism can disappear from
view.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### L----Fiat

#### The Plan's Mandated "consent" via fiat undermines Native Consent -- which undermines Native Sovereignty recreates a cycle of horror that every Native is sentenced to experience.

CONSENT]{.underline}** A. The [Problem of Lost Revenues In]{.underline}
both [Troubled Waters and The Dark Side of Native
Sovereignty]{.underline}, "**[the problem]{.underline}**" was revenue
lost to Canada. Canada raised the tax on cigarettes to combat teen
smoking in 1989 and then in 199130 and saw [a rapid increase in
smuggling]{.underline}. By 1994, Canada estimated that it had lost \$2
billion (Canadian dollars) in revenue31 and consequently lowered the tax
to combat smuggling. **[The public problem of cigarettes then morphed
from a corporeal concern with the young citizen's body to a public
concern over the nation's economy: "smugglers" were harming not only the
former, but also the latter---the nation's pocketbook.]{.underline}** In
R.J. Reynolds, **[one nation-state]{.underline}** (Canada) [acted as a
person and filed a civil-action suit against an amalgamation of business
interests within another nation-state]{.underline}. The suit was filed
in the defendants' own territory, within their own legal system, in
order to sue for damages under RICO for injuries incurred in Canada.
Canada argued that an amalgamation of U.S. and Canadian cigarette
traders willfully circumvented Canadian taxation by smuggling contraband
tobacco and cigarettes---via the Iroquois from reservation communities
in the Northeast---from Canada, across the international boundary line
for repackaging, and back into Canada, in order to evade Canadian
taxation. In conspiring in these ways and in circumventing Canadian
taxation, Canada argued, the tobacco company R.J. Reynolds and others
"injured" Canadian property and caused additional damages and costs due
to the necessity of investigation and legal proceedings. In [ruling
against Canada by upholding the revenue rule---which states that one
country would not act as an enforcer of the other's laws---the Second
Circuit recognized the sovereign status of foreign nations]{.underline}.
R.J. Reynolds offers an occasion for insight into **[the legal process
of how "empire" is negotiated]{.underline}**, where **[legal and
political territories are acquired and new boundaries and political
subjects are decided through the space of courts.]{.underline}** In
doing so, the terms---and the process---of political recognition are
laid bare for analysis. This is **[a case in empire-building because its
complicated legal reasoning both responds to and effaces, again,
indigenous people's claims of their "aboriginal" right to trade, upholds
and reinforces the singular forms of sovereignty]{.underline}** (even
where distributions in capital deterritorialize sovereignty à la Hardt
and Negri32), [and disables the very possibility of indigenous
participation in a contemporary trade network]{.underline}. In R.J.
Reynolds, the possibility of a third legal system at work was not
admitted into the analysis, [thus solidifying settler sovereignty as
normal, natural, and ultimately just]{.underline}. B. Histories of
**[Failed Consent]{.underline}** In contrast, Mohawks interviewed in the
films spoke of an alternative mapping of territory. Consider this
conversation on transport, place, and the law: Victor Malarek: "S[o
these boxes move out every night and they're headed for the Canadian
side, but look what it says here---'Not for sale in Canada.' Where are
they sold?]{.underline}" Loran Thompson: "[Canuga Hogga territory,
indigenous to the people of this country---the Americas]{.underline}."
Victor Malarek: "[But they end up in Canada]{.underline}." Loran
Thompson: "[Maybe to you they do, maybe to people like you they do, but
to people like me, nationalists of my country and my government, that
word Canada to me is Ganada---a village]{.underline}." Victor Malarek:
"**[When you see this, 'Not for sale in Canada,' . . . you're not
breaking the law?"]{.underline}** Loran Thompson: "[No]{.underline}."33
Thompson's **[arguments speak from Haudenosaunee legal and experiential
history, a history that is punctuated by such exchanges and differential
understandings of place and territory.]{.underline}** Consider the
history embedded in these remarks: You are a cunning People without
Sincerity, and not to be trusted, for after making Professions of your
Regard, and saying every thing favorable to us, you . . . tell us that
our Country is within the lines of the States. [This surprises us, for
we had thought our Lands were our own, not within your
Boundaries]{.underline}.34 The white Man put that there, not us, I don't
know why we have to put up with this bullshit. 35 More than [two hundred
years separate these utterances, yet not much seems to have changed in
the Iroquois perspective concerning the border]{.underline}. The central
point of each lament, although inflected differently, remains the same:
the perception of territory that underpins Iroquois people's right to
cross the border dividing the [United States from Canada is radically
different from that of either nation.]{.underline} These border
utterances speak from the perception of the Northeast as a territory
that belongs to the Iroquois, and as a place that was divided and is
administered without their consent. These narratives speak as well to
the political [relationships that underpin this territory, and to the
difficulty that Iroquois people have had and still have in moving
through the landscape of the Northeast in a manner that is consistent
with their self-perception---and rights---as indigenous nationals of
that territory]{.underline}. Why [is there such a radical difference
between their self-perception and the ways in which Iroquois
border-crossings are administered]{.underline}? Why is there such
incommensurability between Iroquois' perceptions of the treaty
relationship and those of the regimes that now interpret it? What
accounts, then, for the dissonance between Iroquois self-perception and
state-perception? There are several factors at work in these
disjunctions. [The most significant are the different understandings of
the proper relations that Iroquois and settlers have brought to their
interactions through the past two hundred years.]{.underline} These
different interpretations are brought to the fore in Mary Druke Becker's
important article on Iroquois sovereignty through time.36 Iroquois
chiefs deployed the language of treaty---with concomitant notions of
"father" when regarding the British---but did so insofar as these terms
furthered their notion of the relation between the two as one of equals.
Beginning in the late 1670\[\]s, the English and French began seeking
territorial domination over larger and larger areas of land
vis-\[à\]-vis one another. [Each nation argued with the other that the
Iroquois had agreed to become their children or subjects]{.underline}.
The **[Iroquois had agreed to use the Iroquoain term for "father" when
addressing Euro-Americans.]{.underline}** This term was used because
within the matrilineal Iroquois society a father was an indulgent, not
an authoritarian, figure. The term was commonly used among Iroquois
nations and by other Iroquois with whom they were in alliance. It
implied a reciprocal relation in which care and aid were provided. It
was not one which implied subordination.37 These [understandings of the
Iroquois and by the Iroquois are common to the different positioning and
perception of Indians generally through time, and to settler-state
formation and asymmetries of power that allow one perception of
difference to become institutionalized through law, policy, and other
forms of state practice]{.underline}. **[Indian tribes were first
perceived as nations]{.underline}** (hence the model of international
treaty-making which marks the earliest period of their interaction with
the Dutch, French, and English regimes) **[and were then perceived to be
dependant wards who required protection from white unscrupulousness on
the frontier.]{.underline}**38 Iroquois, in particular, have resisted
their interpretive demotion in political affairs; [yet, with the rise of
the "welfare state," many perceive Indians on the Canadian side of the
border as clients]{.underline} (among many others) [who need to be
administered and managed.]{.underline} With this transformation of legal
perception in mind, what then is the basis in law for Iroquois
self-perception, sense of jurisdiction, and movement across the border?
[It is largely the nation-to-nation, or "linking arms,"]{.underline}39
[metaphor of equality among people, reflective of the treaty
relationship, that serves as an interpretive frame for Iroquois
engagements with other nations, be they indigenous or
nonindigenous.]{.underline}40 This is a notion anchored historically in
arguments and deployments of the Two Row Wampum Treaty between the
Iroquois and the Dutch,41 manifest in reminders and interactions that
have been issued in serial engagements in the national and international
arenas over the or repassing with their own proper Goods and Effects of
whatever nature, pay for the same any Impost or Duty whatever.46 [This
explicit right to pass, then, implicitly leaves the legal regimes of
Canada and the United States with the power to define who those Indian
nations are and how that right to pass shall be rendered and
respected]{.underline}. As well, and very critically, the regimes of the
United States and Canada were bequeathed the power to choose whom they
would recognize as members of these communities. [It is prudent now to
map out how these longstanding forms of recognition then speak to local
forms of recognition, and more critically, how they speak to indigenous
notions of citizenship-formation and territory]{.underline}. Connecting
these discourses illuminates how legal interests and designations not
only affect the possibility of movement, but how these interests also
work to define, through identification practices, their own territory
and boundaries.47 **[Such connections may illuminate as well how these
identifications and legal and interpretive acts are reformulated in
practice and how they are not only "resisted," but circumvented, denied,
or ignored.]{.underline}**

#### Settler colonialism operates through temporal technologies of linearity that relegate indigeneity to "primitivity" and "pastness" while locating the "solution", i.e. a radical break from the incomplete conditions of colonialism, as a vanishing endpoint that never arrives -- interrogating settler timelines that infiltrate the structure of debate is a prior question to the post-fiat consequences of the 1AC.

Firstly, Australian [settler colonialism holds on to the postcolonial
image of a single, transformative moment of a radical political break
marking decolonization.]{.underline} While its exact nature is not
specified, [this change will somehow draw a line under the problem atic
colonial relationships of the past and mark the nation's movement into a
newly certain future. Settler colonialism circles around this moment,
variously locating it in the past, the present and the
future]{.underline}. And yet, in settler-colonial formations, [no such
radical break ever seems to come --- 'invasion is a structure not an
event'. The vanishing endpoint that is continually pursued is, in
effect, the moment of colonial completion]{.underline}. That is when
[the settler society will have fully replaced Indigenous societies on
their land, and naturalized this replacement.]{.underline} Secondly,
[the more widely known temporal narrative of postcolonialism is deployed
within settler colonialism in ways that assist this project of full
colonization. The settler-colonial project identifies its own endpoint
with the moment of decolonization. However, decolonization and
settler-colonial completion have very different political
effects.]{.underline} The linear narrative of colonization--decoloniza -
tion--post-colonialism reflects the very specific histories of
subcontinental Asia and Africa. [Applying this post-colonial story of
linear progress to the settler-colonial project is not only inaccurate,
it actually assists the settler-colonial project by obscuring the very
different transformative moment to which it aspires. Merging the moment
of decolonization and the moment of colonial completion, these
narratives can mobilize conservative and progressive settler voices
towards colonial goals.]{.underline} Overall, we seek to open up
discussion of temporal and teleological narratives within
settler-colonial policy-making, and suggest that [we need to contest our
currently unacknowledged stories of the colonial future]{.underline}. By
[seeking resolution through extinguishment, these narratives tend to
foreclose more productive debates about how settler and Indigenous
people might live together differently across time]{.underline}. The
first section of this article considers the relationship between settler
colonialism and time. It gives a brief account of settler colonial -
ism, its relationship to post-colonialism and its sovereign goals. We
then consider the limited scholarship dealing with [time as a political
phenomenon, and argue that political temporality needs to be denat - u
ralized and interrogated]{.underline}. The final part of this section
explores [the temporal technologies of settler-colonial political
formations.]{.underline} The second section of this article is an
attempt to trace some of these ideas in contemporary Australian
Indigenous policy. For heuristic purposes, we identify three recent
policy approaches: reconciliation, neo-liberal contractualism and
intervention. Each of these phases tells particular stories about the
unfolding of settler colonialism through time. We aim to [identify and
interrogate these stories in order to open up a more focused discussion
on the role of political temporality in our colonial
present.]{.underline}

The elimination of Indigenous political difference [Settler colonialism
is a powerful contemporary force that continues to structure
the]{.underline} Australian [state's relationship with Indigenous
peoples and to obscure this structuring]{.underline}. It is distinct
from postcolonialism, which refers to those large sections of the world
that have undergone decolonization by European powers and now face
highly mediated global systems of imperial control.8 Colonial theorizing
has been dominated by scholars from post-colonial contexts, and this has
led to 'an oddly monolithic, and surprisingly unexamined, notion of
colonialism' that operates problematically in relation to Australia.9
[Post-colonial concepts of colonialism assume a moment of transformative
restructuring which has not occurred in settler colonies]{.underline}
such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand. [This locates 'real'
colonialism in the past, and assumes that now policy must deal with the
'legacies', 'heritage' or 'reverberative after math' of colonialism in
today's world --- a language that is powerfully present in]{.underline}
Australian [policy analysis.]{.underline}10 Patrick Wolfe identifies
[settler colonialism as operating through the 'logic of elimination'.
Settlers aim to replace Indigenous peoples on their land, not to simply
exploit natural resources or extract surplus value from Indigenous
labour]{.underline}.11 This means that '[all the Indigenous person needs
to do to get in the way of the settler colonial project is to stay at
home']{.underline}.12 Elimination can be physical, but need not be. [It
can also involve eliminating]{.underline} officially recognized
[Aboriginal people through 'blood quotas', or assimilating them into
white society in ways that sever connections to their
Aboriginality]{.underline}.13 This conception of elimination resonates
with Indigenous observations about the particular disregard that
Aboriginal peoples have been subject to in Australia. Norm Sheehan
claims that (contra post-colonial theory) [Aborigines have not been
positioned as 'the other' but as 'the non-other']{.underline}.14 Irene
Watson points to [the continual 'negation of Aboriginal
identity']{.underline}.15 Lyndon Murphy identifies [all]{.underline}
Australian [social policy as 'terra nullius social policy' because 'it
operates from a premise of nonrecognition']{.underline}.16 However,
while many agree upon the operation of this eliminatory logic, its
object is less clear.17 Is it Indigenous people, Indigenous culture or
Indigenous connections to land? The reason that identifying the
structural target of the settlercolonial logic of elimination is
difficult may simply be that this target shifts. At different historical
points, Australian [policy-makers have defined different targets of
elimination and mobilized the appro - priate policy
strategie]{.underline}s. While independent Aboriginal existence clearly
poses some sort of problem for settler-colonial society, [mem - bers of
that society have always contested the level and aspects of Indigenous
existence that it can tolerate and successfully absorb]{.underline}.18
Recognizing that this logic is always in operation, and is always
directed at some aspect of Indigenous existence, seems to capture an
important dimension of settler-colonial policy-making. Govern - ments
since the 1800s have used the language of 'the Aboriginal Problem'.19
[While the definitions of the specific nature of this problem rapidly
change, there is an underlying recognition that the existence and
character of Aboriginal people constitute some sort of ongoing political
difficulty and that 'government, rather than citizens, is expected to
"do something about it"']{.underline}.20 Using this approach it is
possible to identify patterns in policymaking without searching for the
definitive structural target of the logic of elimination. Patrick Wolfe
identifies [the Indigenous connection to land as particularly
threatening to settler-colonial society,21 and others have also traced
recurring policy attempts to sever these connections]{.underline}.22
This is because [in Western polities land is simultaneously a physical
commercial resource and a marker of the boundaries of sovereign
authority]{.underline}; land is also territory. [Sovereignty is
understood to mean supreme and indivisible authority over all within a
territory]{.underline}.23 Therefore, [the existence of independent or
unknown Indigenous polities within territorial boundaries automatically
exposes colonial sovereignty, and hence the contemporary
settler-colonial project itself, as incomplete.]{.underline} However, we
identify another aspect of Aboriginal existence regularly targeted for
elimination, at once more limited and more expansive: Indigenous
political difference.24 [Indigenous people continue to be framed as a
political problem, even in instances when they are permanently
dispossessed of their traditional lands. Indigenous political difference
that cannot be contained or expressed within the confines of the settler
state cannot be tolerated by the settler-colonial project, even if this
project can absorb some elements of Indigenous society, culture and even
land ownership. There are a number of ways to eliminate Indigenous
political difference: by physically eliminating Indigenous people; by
severing their physical connections to lands that lie at the heart of
their political systems; by breaking down families and communities; by
drawing Indigenous polities into the state and reforming them; and by
entering into explicit, contractual exchanges (such as treaties) which
publicly erase the political distinctions between colonizer and
colonized.]{.underline} Patrick Wolfe argues that, overall, '[settler
colonialism is an inclusive, land-centered project that coordinates a
comprehensive range of agencies, from the metropolitan centre to the
frontier encampment, with a view to eliminating indigenous
societies']{.underline}.25 However, identifying the target of the logic
of elimination as political difference allows a more nuanced
understanding of contem porary Australian Indigenous policy-making[. A
number of settler-colonial policy strategies, such as
self-determination, work by investing resources in Indigenous peoples
and cultures. There is a tendency among analysts towards identifying
these in clusive policies as somehow less colonial than obviously
assimilatory strategies such as the Northern Territory
Intervention.]{.underline} In the years before the Intervention, for
example, Wolfe claimed that settler colonialism in Australian seemed
'mercifully' to be in abeyance (although not thereby a thing of the
past).26 Alternatively, we would argue that [self-determination policies
can constitute 'the most successful practices' of settler-colonial
political assimilation.]{.underline}27 [By separating Indigenous culture
and community from Indigenous political existence, and supporting and
absorbing the former while erasing the latter, self-determination and
more radical liberal strategies, such as treaty-making, work towards the
com - pletion of settler colonialism.28 By achieving definitive
'reconciliation' and permanently resolving questions of sovereign
authority in the settler state's favour, such strategies seek to erase
the political differences of Indigenous peoples and pursue
the]{.underline} (perhaps impossible) [project of fully consummating
settler ownership and legitimacy.]{.underline} However, we commonly
understand these to be decolonizing political projects, and focus our
critical attention on more easily identifiable colonial 're-eruptions'
such as the Northern Territory Intervention. If settler colonialism
truly is a structure not an event, [identifying Indigenous political
difference as the target of the logic of elimination allows us to trace
its presence throughout all phases of contemporar]{.underline}y
Australian Indigenous [policy-making.]{.underline} Emphasizing this
analytical shift from Indigenous society to Indigenous political
difference partly comes from our attempt [to extend the debate on
settler colonialism into political theory and policy
analysis]{.underline}. Mainstream Australian [political
scholars]{.underline} have generally [avoid]{.underline}ed [the
productive]{.underline} (if sometimes acrimonious) internal [debate
around their own implication in Indigenous--settler
politics]{.underline} that has occurred in other fields, such as
anthropology.29 Here, we rearticulate settler-colonial concepts in the
terms of our own discipline of political studies --- sovereignty,
polity, policymaking, liberalism and consent --- as an invitation to
other political scholars to consider the ramifications of the
settler-colonial model.

#### NATO is an organization structured by colonialism. From Kosovo to the AFF the construction of narratives of "urgency" and "humanitarian necessities" justifies NATOs colonial ambitions and reentrenches an international order that is structurally positioned against those it claims to help.

colonialism,"]{.mark}]{.underline} borrowing from Naomi Klein's
conception of "disaster capitalism."5 In Klein's vocabulary**[,
"disaster" [refers to the vulnerable condition of a populace]{.mark}
wherein it is [unable to express its popular will]{.mark} against
undemocratic economic neoliberal reforms, usually due to its focus on
survival and recovery following a widespread crisis. Disaster
[colonialism in Kosovo,]{.mark} I argue, was a project, one which
[needed the fabrication of a "disaster,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (based
on the historical event of the 1999 War of Independence) **[for a series
of international organizations [to establish missions that would
proliferate following the end of the war.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
conflict between [Kosovo and Serbia over the ownership of territory was
seized by the international community as a "disaster," catalyzing a
self-justifying mechanism that foreclosed the expression of popular
democratic will in post-conflict Kosovo. [Without]{.mark}]{.underline}
the watchword of **[["disaster,"]{.mark} I claim, [the interventions in
Kosovo, by]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark}, the UN, and the European Union (EU)
[would not have been possible.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Understood in this
way, [disaster colonialism is a programmatic, top-down method of
building a state following a crisis that undemocratically implements
techniques of governance imported by a colonizing power, bypassing the
will or the consent of the populace.]{.underline} By **[[manufacturing a
"disaster"---which declares a populace no longer capable of deciding the
future]{.mark} of their government or the shape of their own
society----the international community was able to [format a legal,
economic, and political system in Kosovo that served the interests of a
Western, liberal-democratic power structure.]{.mark} Disaster
colonialism, then, attempts to diagnose the ways in which a foreign
governing body is established, exercised, and multiplied in post-crisis
situations using universally accepted norms of international human
rights discourse to justify the wide-scale modeling of a society to
serve not so much the interests of the governed, but rather the
interests of the global order.]{.underline}** In the case of Kosovo, the
1999 **[[NATO intervention began the project of disaster
colonialism]{.mark} by claiming a stake in the future of
Kosovo.]{.underline}** The UN continued the project for eight years via
direct governance over Kosovo. After Kosovo declared independence in
2008, the UN transferred the remainder of its authority to the EU which
utilized indirect methods of control----financial imperatives, [Kosovo's
lack of alternative sources of growth and aid----to finalize the mission
of disaster colonialism.]{.underline}6 The origins of international
involvement in Kosovo did not begin with NATO, but the **[[NATO
intervention allowed for the colonial mission to take
place.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It [established that the conflict was out
of the control of Milošević, Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova, the KLA,
and other regional actors. As it had done in Bosnia-Herzegovina only a
few years prior, the international community coalesced around the new
governance and peacekeeping project: Kosovo.]{.underline} Thousands of
international staff members relocated to the new missions in Kosovo in
the direct aftermath of the destruction from the 1999 war. Many Kosovar
Albanians as well as Kosovar Serbs faced extreme brutalities during the
war, including murder, assault, rape, and forced removal as part of the
ethnic cleansing campaign. It was in this environment that the UN and
other organizations stepped into Kosovo. UNMIK, the OSCE mission, the EU
mission, and the permanent NATO presence combined to create the longest
and most expansive trusteeship mission in history.7 [Kosovo as a
post-conflict site gave the international community a center to focus
their operations. For organizations like the EC/EU, state-building was a
new field in which they could test their power and efficacy. If the
post-conflict missions in Kosovo could be successful in creating a
European-oriented, stable state, the international organizations could
gain greater reputation and power in their global
endeavors.]{.underline} Each major international organization was placed
into separate spheres of operation termed "pillars." Pillar I,
"Humanitarian Affairs," originally fell under the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) and was responsible for the return and replacement
of refugees; Pillar II, "Civil Administration," was run by the UN and
consisted of daily administrative management of the territory; Pillar
III, "Democratization and Institution Building," was led by the OSCE;
Pillar IV, "Economic Reconstruction," fell under the jurisdiction of the
EU.8 Each partition of tasks made clear the primary objectives of UNMIK
in terms of the type of society it aimed to create in Kosovo: a human
rights-respecting, bureaucratic, and democratic government (UNHCR, UN,
OSCE) as well as an investment-friendly market economy (EU). [This level
of state-building had not been undertaken before by the UN, making
Kosovo the site of the largest modern experiment in government planning
and control.]{.underline} The ["disaster" of the 1999 [war provided the
grounds for this colonial experiment,]{.mark} the [purpose]{.mark} of
which [was to prove the efficacy and hegemony of the liberal-democratic
humanitarian style of "good governance" and
development.]{.mark}]{.underline} In this paper, I will trace the points
in which the UN's disaster colonialism, administered by technocratic
governance experts, reveals the costs of occupation, the collateral
damage that is part of the state-building mission, and the tensions
between expert rule----even from a human rights-centered organization
like the UN----and democracy. The International Commission on Kosovo's
2000 report on the [Kosovo crisis found that the [intervention was
"illegal but legitimate...]{.mark} because the intervention had the
effect of liberating the majority population of Kosovo from a long
period of oppression under Serbian rule."]{.underline}9 The
**[[uncertainty surrounding the legality and morality of NATO's
actions]{.mark} in Kosovo was [quelled by]{.mark} this [consensus,
paving the way for]{.mark} the [international community's colonial
project to establish its roots in Kosovo.]{.mark}]{.underline}**10 The
UN was able to establish UNMIK without request from Kosovo, bypassing
its traditional [insistence on consensual missions due to the "urgency"
of the post-conflict situation which made its power as a humanitarian
organization necessary, at least according to the international
community.]{.underline}11 It is my argument that UNMIK's [administration
was fundamentally colonial: the international community worked to
control and shape the people and society of Kosovo, implementing Western
governance and economic styles, while working against and around the
very systems that they implemented. The difference between the
colonialism of "old" and the disaster colonialism of the UN in Kosovo is
that the UN's hypocrisy between its rhetoric and action was due to its
prevailing belief in its own mission rather than an ulterior motive to
attain economic wealth.]{.underline} Those in charge of UNMIK and
international organizations in Kosovo could accept the fact that many of
their policies went against European and international legal
conventions----some costs were necessary, according to their logic, in
order to build a stable state for the people of Kosovo. It is this
axiom, I argue, which guided UNMIK and other missions in Kosovo and
which made colonialism possible as a humanitarian system of governance
in the 21st century. The NATO intervention in Serbia and Kosovo was
officially terminated on June 9, 1999 when NATO and the FRY government
signed the Kumanovo Technical Agreement in Kumanovo, Macedonia. [The
document created a framework for dispelling Serb troops from Kosovo and
for the establishment of a NATO security presence in the
province.]{.underline}12 However, in terms of addressing the roots of
the territorial conflict, the agreement was much weaker than the
agreement at Rambouillet. Milošević rejected the Rambouillet Agreement
before the war began largely because of its proposal that a referendum
on the issue of independence would be carried out after three years of
foreign international intervention in Kosovo. The Kumanovo Agreement
focused more on the establishment of international administration rather
than on questions popular will or sovereignty. Prior to international
intervention, the KLA aimed to gain national sovereignty and
independence for Kosovo; this was, however, irreconcilable with the
goals of the North Atlantic organizations. As Ray Murphy writes, ["The
ultimate goal of the KLA was independence, but this was inconsistent
with European Union and United States policy. The latter considered that
political autonomy and guaranteed minority rights formed the only
internationally acceptable solution to the status of
Kosovo."]{.underline}13 The Kumanovo Technical Agreement focused on the
security apparatuses in Kosovo, stating that a UN mission would be
deployed under a Security Council resolution and that all Yugoslav
military forces would be removed from Kosovo's territory and air space.
[The agreement established NATO's sole authority over the use of force
in Kosovo, banning any return of the Yugoslav and/or Serbian
militaries.]{.underline} The following day, the UN would establish sole
governing authority in the region. On June 10, 1999, the UN Security
Council (UNSC) adopted Resolution 1244 under Chapter VII of the UN
Charter.14 Article 11 of the Resolution gave UNMIK its main objectives:
11. Decides that the main responsibilities of the international civil
presence will include: (a) Promoting the establishment, pending a final
settlement, of substantial autonomy and self-government in Kosovo,
taking full account of annex 2 and of the Rambouillet accords
(S/1999/648); (b) Performing basic civilian administrative functions
where and as long as required; (c) Organizing and overseeing the
development of provisional institutions for democratic and autonomous
self-government pending a political settlement, including the holding of
elections; (d) Transferring, as these institutions are established, its
administrative responsibilities while overseeing and supporting the
consolidation of Kosovo's local provisional institutions and other
peace- building activities; (e) Facilitating a political process
designed to determine Kosovo's future status, taking into account the
Rambouillet accords (S/1999/648); (f) In a final stage, overseeing the
transfer of authority from Kosovo's provisional institutions to
institutions established under a political settlement; (g) Supporting
the reconstruction of key infrastructure and other economic
reconstruction; (h) Supporting, in coordination with international
humanitarian organizations, humanitarian and disaster relief aid; (i)
Maintaining civil law and order, including establishing local police
forces and meanwhile through the deployment of international police
personnel to serve in Kosovo; (j) Protecting and promoting human rights;
(k) Assuring the safe and unimpeded return of all refugees and displaced
persons to their homes in Kosovo;15 Resolution 1244 was the basis of the
UN's power in Kosovo. It ensured that the functions of Kosovo's society
as well as the design of its future would be in the hands of
international staff. The scope of the mission was unprecedented; with no
clear terminating clause, UNMIK would be responsible for both
administration over Kosovo as well as the facilitation of the
territorial dispute.16 [[In]{.mark} the span of [two days, Kosovo lost
local authority to self-govern]{.mark} as well as establish its own
armed forces. The Resolution was seen as the ex post facto endorsement
of the NATO intervention----the subject of legal and ethical debates on
foreign intervention and sovereignty among international law
experts----by the UNSC which had not initially approved the
intervention.17 However, some scholars of international law who did not
accept the [humanitarian premise of the NATO intervention also
questioned the legal validity of post-intervention involvement in
Kosovo.]{.mark}]{.underline} They argued that the Kumanovo Agreement,
which Resolution 1244 refers to as part of its legal basis, was made in
violation of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which states
that "a treaty is void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat
or use of force in violation of the principles of international law
embodied in the Charter of the United Nations."18 The crux of the
critical argument centered on the use of unsanctioned force by NATO
which was in violation of the UN Charter. Legal debates notwithstanding,
the UN mission was able to expand its legal and executive reach after
the passage of Resolution 1244.

### L----Linear Time

#### Settler colonialism mobilizes temporality itself in service of the consummation of white settler sovereignty -- this operates through liberal narratives of progressivism that rely upon a vanishing endpoint of a "better world" achieved through the completion of the project of settler modernity. Normative debate is structured by the imperative of forward motion that locates the plan as a transformative break with colonial society that relegates the backwardness of indigeneity to the past and envisions a settler utopia in its place.

Time, decolonization and colonial completion Critical geographers use
Foucault's insights to unsettle modern understandings of space as a
fixed environment in which politics takes place. Instead, they show that
political projects construct, naturalize and respond to particular
spatial understandings.30 In relation to Indigenous policy, critical
analysts are quick to identify these political deployments of space.
SuvendriniPerera, for example, shows that [policy-makers represent
remote Indigenous communities as 'set apart from the body of the nation,
and as the locus of unspeakable violence and abjection'.]{.underline}31
As part of the discourse of the Northern Territory Intervention, [the
metaphor of the distant frontier --- or vulnerable centre --- is
pervasive. Remote Aboriginal communities prescribed for Intervention are
para - digmatically referred to in media reports as 'remote Aboriginal
societies', 'this other Australia', 'the remote world' and as 'a
distinct domain'.]{.underline}32 [[Unsettling dominant understandings of
time is]{.mark} equally [important]{.mark}]{.underline}. In his work
'The End of the Passing Past', Walters aims to [['think about change in
ways that refuse the obligation to side with]{.mark} or against
[continuity... and resist the temptations of progressivism and
reductionism]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}.33 He draws on Bruno
Latour's examination of [[the modern temporal
imaginary]{.underline}]{.mark}, and his denat - uralizing of modern
political timelines: [[We have never moved either forward or backward.
We have always actively sorted out elements belonging to different
times]{.underline}.]{.mark} We can still sort. It is the sorting that
makes the times, not the times that make the sorting.34 [This
interrogation is especially useful in relation to understanding settler
colonialism and Indigenous policy-making.]{.underline} Barry Hindess,
Elizabeth Povinelli and N. Sheehan, for example, reflect on Western
temporal constructions of Aboriginality and indicate how these relate to
liberal political agendas. Barry Hindess argues that
[[liberalism]{.mark} tends to [locate different cultures in its own
past]{.mark}, even when they coexist with liberal societies in the
present.35 [Indigenous groups]{.mark}, in particular, [are located prior
to the transformative moment of sovereign agreement,]{.mark} which in
turn is read as [an indication of their incapacity to enter into this
superior, rational political future]{.mark}.]{.underline} Norm Sheehan
maintains that [settler colonialism]{.underline} in Australia [is deeply
invested in these kinds of temporal logics:]{.underline} In contrast to
previous colonial contexts which tended to focus on constructing
difference based on inherent racial traits [the antipodean designation
as primitive defines this specific other as non-other]{.underline}. The
antipodean aborigine is by definition from [[the origin of (all) mankind
which positions this primitive as an earlier]{.mark} and therefore
[lesser version of European self]{.mark}]{.underline}.36 Elizabeth
Povinelli briefly makes a similar point in her analysis of recent
Australian Indigenous policy: [\[E\]ven as liberalism came to accept its
fate as a culture among other cultures it differentiated the tense and
orientation of its cultural difference from other cultures. [The West as
a general idea would claim the future and claim the potentiality of
individuals and assign the past and the constraint of individuals to
others]{.mark} --- or, it would recognize that these were the values of
[non-liberal cultures]{.mark}.3]{.underline}7 She refers to these
patterns of political temporal positioning as ['technologies of
temporali]{.underline}ty'. Drawing together the work of Walters,
Hindess, Sheehan and Povinelli, it becomes apparent that
[[colonialism]{.mark} does not just take place in time. It [constructs
narratives of time,]{.mark} in ways that [create particular political
relationships in the present, and attempts to move itself]{.mark}
through time [to a certain political future]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the
remainder of this section, we compare [the temporalities of
post-colonial and settler-colonial political formations,]{.underline}
and argue that [both [anchor themselves to]{.mark} some sort of
[transformative 'endpoint'.]{.mark} This radical political break
[separates a problematic past from a completed future and]{.mark}, in
settler-colonial societies, [involves]{.mark} a strange assemblage of
ideas about [decolonization, revolution, full colonization and sovereign
exchange]{.mark}.]{.underline} The term post-colonial implies 'the
notion of a movement be - yond';38 'the "post" in "post-colonial"
suggests "after" the demise of colonialism, it is imbued, quite apart
from its user's intentions, with an ambiguous spatio-temporality'.39 In
a number of former colonies (both extractive, such as India, and
settler, such as Algeria), the formal colonial project has indeed ended.
The term postcolonial captures something about the complex political
realities of these nation-states today. A dramatic, and often violent,
moment of structural decolonization separates these state's colonial
pasts from their post-colonial presents. However, even in relation to
those nations which have undergone such institutional transformations,
scholars contest the use of the term. Ella Shohat suggests that it
erases the ongoing structural imperialisms that persist: 'How then does
one negotiate sameness and difference within the framework of a
"post-colonial" whose "post" emphasizes rupture and deemphasizes
sameness?'40 Some scholars use the term neocolonialism to indicate
political continuity, and to contest the understanding that critical
post-colonial work seeks to put out minor spot-fires of inequality left
by 'real' colonialism.41 If the temporal narrative of post-colonialism
is problematic in relation to former extractive colonies, it is
altogether inaccurate when applied to ongoing settler colonies such as
Australia. Yet post-colonial scholarship has dominated international
academic \[T\]he lack of historical specificity in the 'post' leads to a
collaps - ing of diverse chronologies ... It equates early independence
won by settler colonial states, in which Europeans formed their new
nation-states in non-European territories at the expense of Indigenous
populations, with that of nationstates whose indigenous populations
struggled for inde - pendence against Europe.42 Australia has not, and
most probably will not, undergo the kind of institutional transfer of
control to the Indigenous population that could justify the application
of the term post-colonial. And yet it is quite common to see Australia
identified as a post-colonial or decolo nizing nation in cultural
studies, literary theory and policy analysis.43 One of the greatest
contributions of the emerging field of settler-colonial studies is the
fact that it provides clear conceptual tools to articulate exactly why
it is that nations like Australia and Canada should be understood
differently. However, it is important not to overstate the uniqueness of
settlercolonial studies in Australian scholarship. Critical Indigenous
the - orists are carrying on their own conversation regarding Australian
colonial conditions, and have long contested the relevance of the term
post-colonial. Irene Watson, for example, argues: I understand the
contemporary colonial project as one that has continued unabated from
the time of the landing and invasion by the British in 1788 ... the
Australian state retains a vested interest in keeping the violence
going, and the inequalities and iniquities that are maintained against
Aboriginal peoples for the purpose of maintaining the life and
continuity of the state. A question the Australian state is yet to
resolve is its own illegitimate foundation and transformation into an
edifice deemed lawful. Within this unanswered questionable structure the
Australian state parades as one which has obliterated the 'founding
violence' of its 'illegitimate origins' and 'repressed them into a
timeless past'.44 Aileen Moreton-Robinson instead uses the term
post-colonizing, capturing the ambiguous and shifting temporal
technologies deployed in settler-colonial Australia. These new
conceptual models have grown productively out of the object of our
study: the postcolonizing world we inhabit. Our respective geographical
locations are framed by nation states such as the USA, Canada, Australia
and New Zealand where colonization has not ceased to exist; it has only
changed in form from that which our ancestors encountered.45 While
settler-colonial studies proceeds from a conceptual distinction between
extractive and settler colonialism, Indigenous scholarship is based in
the lived experiences of ongoing colonization.46 Settlercolonial studies
would benefit from connecting to this existing academic conversation
that runs parallel to and intersects with its own ideas in important
ways. In particular, it draws attention to ongoing Indigenous
contestation of colonial projects, and counters the tendency towards
totalizing, structural accounts of settler colonialism. As Watson
observes: Today our voices are still talking while the colonial project
remains entrenched and questions concerning identity politics, and the
'authentic native' are constructed and answered by those who have
power.47 Up to this point, we have been drawing together points made by
other scholars. [Settler colonialism has an ongoing, structural
temporality, which is generally unacknowledged and contrasts with the
linear colonialism--decolonization--post-colonialism
narrative]{.underline}. However, we suggest that [[the application of a
unidirectional, progressive temporality to the settler-colonial context
is]{.mark} not just an analytical mistake, but a ['technology of
temporality']{.mark}.]{.underline} This conception is taken up within
the settler-colonial project in ways [[that work towards the
consummation of settler sovereignty.]{.mark} The borrowed notion of a
'radical break' is variously located in settler colonialism's past,
present or future. By harnessing the decolonizing resonances of this
concept of colonial transforma -]{.underline} [tion, [the
settler-colonial project obscures t]{.mark}he very different political
effects of [its own 'vanishing
endpoin]{.mark}]{.underline}[t'.48]{.mark} What is this vanishing
endpoint, which seems to lurk in all of our imaginations, our policy
projects and our political debates? [Instead of the moment of
decolonization, it is the moment of full colonization --- or rather, it
is both, because [in this imagined moment colonial relationships will
dissolve themselves and settler authority will be
naturalized]{.mark}.]{.underline} This transformative event is both [an
impossible colonial dream, [premised on the disappearance of Indigenous
political difference]{.mark}, and a concrete political project that
[justifies all manner of tactics in the present.]{.mark}]{.underline}
But what are the political con - sequences of such a preoccupation? And
do Indigenous participants in the colonial relationship seek the same
kind of resolution and dissolution? Significantly, [the [Western
colonial narrative of transformational change maps
onto]{.underline}]{.mark} [another Western imaginary --- [the moment of
sovereign transformation]{.mark} encapsulated in the social
contract.]{.underline} This is [the moment that a group of people
transition from collective social 'status' into individualized freedom
and contractual person - hood.]{.underline}49 It is also the [movement
out of a constraining 'history' into an atemporal, rational
present.]{.underline} As Hindess argues, [liberalism con - signs its
Indigenous contemporaries to its own past, and imagines this location in
the past to be 'a kind of moral and intellectual failure', revealing the
incapacity and disinclination to enter into a social contract and join
the present.]{.underline}50 Therefore, [[the movement through time, via
a radical transformative moment, is also the developmental movement from
incapacity to capacity]{.mark}. An unstable but productive dichotomy
emerges between, on the one hand, Indigenous political
difference-incapacity-status-injustice-lack of sovereignty, and on the
other, colonial completion-capacitycontract-freedom-sovereign inclusion.
These oppositions are separated by an image of a single, interchangeable
and undefined threshold --- the transformative event. [This temporal
narrative belongs to]{.mark} both progressive and conservative
articulations of [the settler-colonial
future]{.mark}]{.underline}[;]{.mark} the settler colonial endpoint is
variously positioned as an inevitable global trend,51 a past achievement
yet to be fully recognized,52 and a future goal for which Aboriginal
people must prepare.53 As Povinelli notes, these conceptions are not
only temporal, but also teleological: \[T\]hese tenses are in turn
articulated to other discourses of time and event such as teleological
discourses that apprehend events 'as the realization of an already given
end or telos and eschatological discourses that wait for 'extreme' or
'ultimate' moments and events which immediately precede or accompany
'the end of history' and 'its reversal into eternity'.54 [The
transformative event is positioned as part of an inevitable and
inescapable trajectory]{.underline} (although it may be consistently
deferred or delayed). [In this way, [the eventual legitimacy and
stability of the settler-colonial project is always-already assumed.
Through this a priori assumption, settler colonialism is able to
entrench and sustain itself on the basis of its eventual
demise]{.mark}]{.underline}. The following section traces the appearance
and temporal location of this settler-colonial end - point in recent
Australian Indigenous policy phases.

#### Indigeneity exists in a temporal regime antagonistic to that of the settler state -- the genocidal violence of the past accumulates in the present and ensures that the benevolent future offered by the settler state will never arrive. The politics of reformism is a ruse of consent that consigns native being to a perpetual state of half-life \-- vote negative to reject debate's progressive linearity -- what good is incremental transformation to the one who expects to die tomorrow ?

This is our time: death and the future Throughout Born in Flames,
countless members of the Women's Army declare: "This is our time." The
time of the revolution was not the time to abolish anti-blackness, white
supremacy, and heteropatriarchy. It was a time that left behind and
captured poor (queer) women of color through the progress of democracy
and equality. In this way, "[our time" and state time are two
antagonistic temporalities of violence]{.underline} in the film. As
James Scott argues, [[the modern state's utopian aim is to reduce the
disorderly and chaotic social order under its purview]{.mark} into a
mirror of the administrative knowledge central to its observations and
governance. The state works to produce temporal and spatial
intelligibility with the goal of [manufacturing the orderly
administration and regulation of the nation's population]{.mark},
resources, and infrastructure. By disrupting and dismantling spaces,
populations, and epistemologies that are illegible to its regimes of
knowing and governance, the modern state creates a utopia of visibility
and legibility that is open to policing and control]{.underline} (Scott
1998, 82). The management of time is central to this process. "[Our
time" is what the state seeks to capture]{.underline}. In Born in
Flames, [state time extends and expands the violence of the past, while
"our time" is a temporal regime that exceeds and undoes state
time.]{.underline} Again, Fanon proves useful for understanding these
differences. In The Wretched of the Earth, Fanon describes a "time lag,
or a difference of rhythm, between the leaders of a nationalist party
and the mass of the people" (Fanon 1963, 107). According to Fanon, [the
rank and file of [anti-colonial rebellions demand the complete]{.mark}
and utter immediate d[estruction of the forms of power that render them
"more dead than alive,"]{.mark} while both colonial and nationalist
governments attempt to manage, temper, and restrain the demands of those
who have no more time to give to the promises of a future that is always
coming, but never arrives]{.underline} (51). For example, in the film,
[[the state promises that "in the future" there will be jobs, an end to
sexual violence, and racial and gender equality]{.underline}.]{.mark}
But for Fanon[, [the "hopeless dregs of humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}"
(or the wretched of the earth) [are filled with an "uncontrollable rage"
and thus [exist in a temporal regime apart]{.mark} f]{.underline}rom
that of the party or the nation. This is [a [time of intensity and
immediacy]{.mark}]{.underline} ("the slaves of modern times are
impatient"), [where [the future of the present as it is means no future
at all]{.mark}]{.underline} (74). Like the financial, epistemological,
and racialized legacies of slavery Baucom sees intensifying in our
current moment, [Fanon diagnoses [the future of colonialism as the
accumulation of the social, biological, and living death of the native.
The native lives a death in life produced by the racism of slavery and
colonialism.]{.mark} [The future's horizon is the accumulation of past
forms of racial terror and violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this way,
Baucom and Fanon draw connections between race and time that are crucial
to questions of queer futurity. The relationship between race, gender,
death, and the future is central to the immediacy and spontaneity of the
Women's Army and is foundational to the film's critique of the future.
We can 44 S. Dillon turn to the Fanonian-inspired prison writings of
George Jackson to further explore the relationship between death, race,
and the future. In his 1972 text Blood in My Eye, published shortly
after he was shot and killed by guards at San Quentin prison, Jackson
writes of racism, death, and revolution: Their line is: "Ain't nobody
but black folks gonna die in the revolution." [This argument completely
overlooks the fact that we have always done most of the dying, and still
do: dying at the stake, through social neglect or in U.S. foreign
wars.]{.underline} The point is now to construct a situation where
someone else will join in the dying. If it fails and we have to do most
of the dying anyway, we're certainly no worse off than before. (Jackson
1972, 6) Here, Jackson argues that the social order of the United States
is saturated with an anti-blackness that produces, in the words of Ruth
Wilson Gilmore, "the state-sanctioned or extralegal production and
exploitation of group-differentiated vulnerability to premature death"
(2007, 28). Jackson's text is littered with a polemic that links race
and death in a way that preemptively echoes Michel Foucault's
declaration that racism is the process of "introducing a break into the
domain of life that is under power's control: the break between what
must live and what must die" (Foucault 2003, 254). When Jackson,
Gilmore, and Foucault define race as the production of premature death,
they make a connection between race and the future. Race is the
accumulation of premature death and dying. For Jackson, [race fractures
the future so that the future looks like incarceration or the premature
death of malnutrition, disease, and exhaustion. [The future was not the
hopefulness of unknown possibilities. It was rather the devastating
weight of knowing that death was coming]{.mark} cloaked in abandonment,
neglect, incarceration, or murder]{.underline}. In other words,
according to Jackson, death was always and already rushing towards the
present of blackness. In the last line of No Future: Queer Theory and
the Death Drive, Lee Edelman similarly connects the future to premature
death when he references the murder of Matthew Shepard. He writes:
"Somewhere, someone else will be savagely beaten and left to die --
sacrificed to a future whose beat goes on, like a pulse or a heart --
and another corpse will be left like a mangled scarecrow to frighten the
birds who are gathering now, who are beating their wings, and who, like
the death drive, keep on coming" (Edelman 2004, 154). For Edelman, the
future will necessarily continue to produce a world that is unlivable
for queer people. In this way, the polemics of black liberation and
Edelman's anti-social thesis share an affinity around the theorization
of the future as overdetermined by premature death, yet they diverge in
how they imagine death's relationship to race and power. For Edelman,
the future looks like repetition of the death of Matthew Shepard (a
white gay man), while for Jackson, it looks like the premature death of
incarceration, the ghetto, and chattel slavery's haunting contortion of
the present. In other words, the state and anti-blackness were central
to the anti-sociality of the black liberation movement. Within Jackson's
analysis, the state is the primary mechanism for unevenly distributing
racialized regimes of value and disposability. Following the writing of
Fanon, Jackson argued that for this relationship to be abolished: "The
government of the U.S.A and all that it stands for, all that it
represents, must be destroyed. This is the starting point, and the end"
(Jackson 1972, 54). Jackson's polemic crescendos when he describes the
future he desires: Women & Performance: a journal of feminist theory 45
We must accept the eventuality of bringing the U.S.A to its knees;
accept the closing off of critical sections of the city with barbed
wire, armed pig carriers criss-crossing the city streets, soldiers
everywhere, tommy guns pointed at stomach level, smoke curling black
against the daylight sky, the smell of cordite, house-to-house searches,
doors being kicked down, the commonness of death. (Jackson 1972, 55) If
the past and present have produced the accumulation of the premature
death of black people, then Jackson imagines [the complete undoing of
the social order as the way out of temporal capture. [The future of the
social order means no future, and so the future must come to an
end]{.mark}.]{.underline} Fanon similarly imagines [the relationship
between the native and the future of the social order: "[They won't be
reformed]{.mark} characters [to]{.mark} please colonial society,
[fit]{.mark}ting [in with the morality of its rulers]{.mark}; quite on
the contrary, they take for granted the impossibility of their entering
the city save by hand grenades and revolvers"]{.underline} (Fanon 1963,
130). Here, [[the invitation to the safety and security]{.mark} of the
city]{.underline} (or the social order as it is[) [is an offer to
continue a life that is a half-life.]{.mark} Possibility comes from a
starting point that is an end.]{.underline} In her writing from
captivity, Angela Davis articulates this logic in relationship to the
prison. In the 1971 essay "Political Prisoners, Prisons, and Black
Liberation," Davis argues that the sole purpose of the police was to
"intimidate blacks" and "to persuade us with their violence that we are
powerless to alter the conditions of our lives" (39). Davis theorizes
the violence of police and prisons as pervasive and unrelenting.
Throughout the essay, Davis names the complicity between an
anti-blackness as old as liberal freedom and new forms of penal and
policing technologies that emerged in the 1970s in response to political
upheaval and insurrection. Davis calls for the abolition of what she
terms the "law-enforcement-judicial-penal network" in addition to
arguing for the construction of a mass movement that could contest the
"victory of fascism" (50). Yet, in line with the political imaginaries
at the time -- an imaginary articulated by Born In Flames -- Davis
wanted more than an end to the prison and the violence of the police.
Like other early black feminist writing[, Davis did not just call for
the overthrow of one form of state power so that a new one may take its
place. Instead, Davis implied that the social order itself must be
undone]{.underline}. For Davis, the prison was not the primary problem.
[The prison was made possible by the libidinal, symbolic, and discursive
regimes that actualized the uneven institutionalized distribution of
value and disposability along the lines of race, gender, and sexuality.
Davis called for the total epistemological and ontological undoing of
the forms of knowledge and subjectivity that were produced by the racial
state. I]{.underline}n short, hope, for Davis, meant that the prison
could not have a future, and more so, that a world that could have the
prison would need to end as well. Critically, Jackson did not understand
the end of the future of the social order as particularly different from
his present because "I've lived with repression every moment of my life,
a repression so formidable that any movement on my part can only bring
relief" (1972, 7). Jackson's understanding of the future arose from his
critique of reform. Derived from his correspondence with Davis, Jackson
argued that the essence of fascism was reform or more specifically
"economic reform" (118).11 Every reform that modified or improved the
operations of global capitalism and white supremacy only extended the
life of the 46 S. Dillon social order. And the life of the social order,
according to Jackson and Fanon, is parasitic on the control,
exploitation, incarceration, and premature death of black people[. [The
creation of a new world could not rely on "long term politics" because
patience, reform, and change meant nothing to "the person who expects to
die tomorrow"]{.mark}]{.underline} (10). For Jackson, [the future is a
time those without a future cannot risk. The future was not coming and
so the present could not wait. [The temporal break between those without
a future who demand this is "our time" and the time of the state that
declares your time is the future]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} is most
striking in the final scenes of Born in Flames. Towards the end of the
film, the president of the United States delivers a national televised
address to announce a new reform that will pay women for housework.
Simultaneous with the announcement, a cadre of the Women's Army storms
the state-run TV station and interrupts the president's address with a
video that exposes the imprisonment and murder of their leader, Adelaide
Norris. Norris was murdered, in part, because of how she understood the
relationship between time and violence. This is evident in internal
discussions within the Women's Army concerning the use of violence. When
Hilary Hurst and Norris, the two leaders of the Women's Army (according
to the FBI), discuss the role of violence in the actions of the Women's
Army, they have competing visions of the relationship between time and
violence. When Hurst tells Norris, "The reality of having to deal with
taking up arms, Adelaide, is really heavy, I mean whether we can accept
or be responsible for the potential violence thrust upon us, from our
own violence thrust out \..." Norris simply replies, "I'm telling you
it's already happening. It's here. It's that time."12 Norris's response
invokes two forms of violence. First, she implies that the state
violence Hurst is concerned will come if they take up arms has already
arrived (indeed Norris will be imprisoned and murdered within a few days
of this conversation). She also indicates that the time is right to
intensify their efforts through the deployment of violence. The time is
right for counter-violence, because state violence is already the past,
present, and future. Norris mobilizes a black feminist analytic where
there is no outside to the forms of violence, terror, and subjugation
produced by white supremacy, anti-blackness, and heteropatriarchy. As a
queer black woman, Norris does not encounter violence in isolated
moments of exceptional transgression. Space nor time will bring relief
because there is no contingent relationship between blackness and
violence (Wilderson 2010, 88). This fact leads to a politics of
impatience, immediacy, and spontaneity by the Women's Army. [When the
future is not relief, but intensification and accumulation, then the
present is all that is left. "Our time" is a time of the present, an
anticipatory time that sees the no future of the future as it
is.]{.underline}

#### Settler colonialism operates through a logic of constant deferral that locates indigeneity as "vanished", or an atemporal relic of the past cast aside in service of a settler modernity -- the 1AC's commitment to progressive development as a method of redress for colonial violence is nothing more than a cacaphony of assimilative liberalism that drowns out "backwards" indigenous thought in favor of settler misappropriation.

[The work of contemporary Indigenous critical theorists evidences a
collective refusal to be erased, a demand for attention to the ways in
which many academic (and non-academic) concepts and discourses ignore
the experiences and concerns of Indigenous peoples.]{.underline} It is
vital, therefore, to first [recognize and situate the manifesting of a
body of Indigenous critical theory and Indigenous-led scholarly
communities as existing within the academic infrastructure supported and
regulated by the white settler nationstate.]{.underline} With this
reality in mind, the proliferation of Indigenous studies programs and
the work of Indigenous critical theorists, as such, may be generally
observed as acts of resistance. Chickasaw critical theorist Jodi Byrd
refers to what she terms [[the "deferral" of Indigenous peoples'
experiences and concerns within]{.mark} the prominent threads of
critical theory within [the (settler) academy.36]{.mark} An attending to
Indigenous concerns and experiences in discourses such as human rights,
postcoloniality, or sustainability rarely occurs]{.underline}, if it can
be said that it has ever occurred in a substantial or sustained way**[.
These [continual deferrals operate as a means by which the white settler
academy]{.mark}, again itself understood here as [an adjunct of the
wider capitalist settler societies in which it is embedded, can avoid
confronting the fundamental contradictions and violence underlying the
very condition of settler colonial societi]{.mark}]{.underline}**es. As
Byrd writes, "indigenous peoples are located outside of temporality and
presence, even in the face of the very present and ongoing colonization
of indigenous lands, resources, and lives."37 According to Byrd, [one of
the more prominent means of such acts of deferral is [the assignment of
Indigenous peoples and their concerns and experiences to the
past.]{.mark} This acts [to relegate of Indigenous peoples to a state of
invisibility and irrelevance in the contemporary
world]{.mark}.]{.underline} Colonial narratives represent Indigenous
peoples [as having vanished or [as]{.mark} having otherwise been passed
by as part of [a linear and teleological notion of human
development]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [[allows
for]{.underline}]{.mark}, and indeed perpetuates, [[deferrals
from]{.mark} direct and sustained [contention with the genocidal
violence of settler colonialism by understanding colonization to have
always-already taken place. **Settler colonialism is**
]{.mark}**therefore [understood as complete, with Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} and their nations, cultures, languages, knowledges,
governance structures, and spiritualities [viewed as]{.mark} mere
[remnants pushed to the margins, as contradictions that require
(temporary) managemen]{.mark}t.** These narrative deferrals also often
involve an imposed notion of "authentic" Indigeneity to have been
fundamentally and irrevocably lost at some point in the
past.]{.underline} The supposed loss of authenticity [furthers a sense
of the inevitability of Indigenous peoples' assimilation into settler
society.]{.underline} This to say that **[if Indigenous peoples ceased
to be authentically Indigenous at some point in the past, then their
capacity to be recognized by settler societies as fully human, and as
Indigenous nations, rests primarily on their assimilation, the
termination of the their Indigenous identities.]{.underline}**
Obviously, this operates, in part, as a means of deferring [engagement
with the enduring and ongoing genocidal character of settler
colonialism. This includes, but is not limited to, the ongoing
reservation and reserve system, the gendered and sexualized violence,
and the mass settler state interventions into Indigenous communities
(e.g. the removal of children from their families).]{.underline}
Furthermore, [the ongoing legacy of broken treaties between the
erstwhile colonial metropoles, the settler nation-states that Byrd
refers to as "breakaway settler colonialisms," and Indigenous nations,
requires the subsuming of Indigenous peoples within the settler
nation-state, undermining Indigenous sovereignties and denying
Indigenous nationhood.]{.underline}38 While it appears that, to date,
the largest non-Indigenous audience for much of contemporary Indigenous
critical theory has been in area studies and critical studies of race,
gender, and sexuality, the work of Byrd in Transit of Empire offers a
wide-ranging set of critical interventions, aimed at postcolonial and
poststructural scholarship, as well as cultural studies. Byrd's
arguments focus on the construction of the notion of what she calls
"Indian" and "Indianness," which, in some ways mirror Anishinaabe writer
and theorist Gerald Vizenor's similar characterization of the "Indian"
as an imposed nonIndigenous caricature. For Byrd **[[the "Indian"
...becomes a site through which U.S. empire orients and replicates
itself by transforming those to be colonized into "Indians" through
continual reiterations of pioneer logic]{.underline}]{.mark}**s, whether
in the Pacific, the Caribbean, or the Middle East.39 Thus, for Byrd,
"indigenous peoples must be central to any theorizations of the
conditions of postcoloniality, empire and death-dealing regimes that
arise out of indigenous lands."40 Similarly[, Byrd also situates the
deferrals of Indigenous concerns in the proliferation of
postructuralism, arguing that Indigenous peoples become an "absent
referent" on which much contemporary postructural theory is constructed.
She argues, "...the Indian is simultaneously, multiply, a colonial,
imperial referent that continues to produce knowledge about the
indigenous as "primitive" and "savage" otherness within postructuralist
and postcolonial theory and philosophy."41]{.underline} According to
Byrd, [even in critical theories that interrogate hegemonic
constructions of colonial modernity]{.underline} and which implicitly or
explicitly acknowledge the dichotomization of modern versus pre-modern
cultures or "civilizations," [[there is a tendency to locate Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} in the past---[as]{.mark} though the [pre-modern
peoples]{.mark} were all [killed or assimilated:
vanished]{.mark}.]{.underline} Byrd argues ...**[[indigeniety as an
ontological prior challenges postcolonial and critical theories because
it serves as a significant parallax view---]{.underline}]{.mark}**though
certainly not the only one---[along the baseline of colonialism through
which [to trouble the dialectical processes that underwrite colonialist
hegemonies]{.mark}]{.underline} of racializations and normativities.,
subjectivities and subjectifications.42 The goals of the Transit of
Empire are thus to critically intervene in existing nonIndigenous
discourses with the intention of compelling attention to the
contemporary presence and experiences of Indigenous peoples and a
critical recognition of the effects of the naturalized deferrals of
ongoing lived contemporary concerns of Indigenous peoples. [Byrd is
claiming that a caricatured Indian as subhuman is continuously
redeployed as the means of the "transit" of American imperialism, but
also that the Indian as pre-modern-and-vanished is deployed as the
alternative to hegemonic notions of modernity in critical
theory.]{.underline} Byrd also proposes **[a conceptualization of
"[cacophony"]{.mark} as means of understanding [how liberal
multiculturalism defers Indigenous concerns]{.mark} in part v[ia "the
noise of competing claims, recognitions, and
remediations.]{.mark}"]{.underline}**43 Here she is naming [the
["contradictorily hegemonic and horizontal struggles]{.mark}"
[within]{.mark} contemporary [multicultural settler nation-states as
a]{.mark}nother [means of deferring the concerns of Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}.44 Byrd's argument is for an attending to
the ways in which [[the efforts at rights and recognition from the
nation-state]{.mark} has the consequences of [pit]{.mark}ting
[marginalized populations against one another]{.mark} in a competition
that has the effect of further marginalizing and [reinforcing]{.mark}
the [deferral]{.mark}s of Indigenous concern]{.underline}s. In doing so,
Byrd's Transit of Empire represents one of the foremost contemporary
examples of contemporary Indigenous critical theory explicitly
positioned as critical interventions within non-Indigenous discourses.

The above analysis suggests that rather than disputing where the nation
and Indigenous peoples should be located relative to the moment of
colonial transformation, [it may be more productive to contest this
temporal narrative altogether.]{.underline} Instead, [we might ask [how
and why policy-makers come to have the authority to locate Indigenous
lives in settler time]{.mark}.]{.underline} More importantly, [we can
begin to understand and contest the impacts of these continual temporal
classifications of Aboriginality on Indigenous lives, and to consider
whether there might be ways that settlers and our structures can engage
more appropriately and mindfully with Indigenous peoples and with
Indigenous political difference.]{.underline} If settler colonialism is
indeed a structure rather than an event, and [[the moment of radical
break function]{.mark}s at least partly [as a colonial technology of
temporality,]{.mark} then [the quest for (re)solution of the colonial
relationship through a significant decolonizing event is brought into
question.]{.mark}]{.underline} The political challenges we face in
Australia are reconfigured as part of an ongoing task involving the
identifi - cation of the ways this structure shapes our shared
existences, and of finding ways of living together better. Paul McHugh
argues that there are often two simultaneous approaches to colonizing/
decolonizing tools such as a treaty and native title.85
[Settlers]{.underline}, even progressive settlers, [approach them as
one-off and definitive moments of change, capable of [erasing a
problematic past and regulating a new and certain
futur]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark}. For many Indigenous peoples, he
suggests[, [they are instruments in a toolbox of strategies to manage
the ongoing relationship between settler and Indigenous
residents.]{.underline}]{.mark} Rather than seeking to end this
encounter, many have sought rather to make it more just, sustainable and
compatible with diverse Indigenous aspirations. As we have suggested,
[the ways in which [academic and political approaches mobilize timelines
of colonial completion may foreclose more productive debates about
coexisting and interrelating across time]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Utopian narratives are a methodological tool of settler modernity that forwards progressive rationality as a means of rationalizing and reconstituting the genocidal project of the New World \-- indigeneity is constructed as the constitutive "other" to the unified social desire built around Western progressive rationality

[There is a claim, repeated often in utopian studies discourse, which
holds that the past thirty plus years of neoliberal globalization have
contributed to a growing sense of pessimism, which accounts for an
alleged dystopian turn.]{.underline} That is, the content of what Lyman
Tower Sargent terms "social dreaming" is said to have turned
nightmarish.14 The potential for utopia is thought to be increasingly
unavailable. Instead, it is argued that [dissatisfaction with the
trajectories of a globalizing society has resulted in the popularity of
cautionary, pessimistic expressions of "what ought not be" understood
here as dystopia, literally "the bad place."]{.underline} While
recognition of the prevalence of dystopian expressions of warning may
appear reasonable and substantially accurate, [it must also be
recognized that any notion of social dreaming is not monolithic or
singular. Utopias, conceived of as social dreaming or expressions of
desire for a better way of being, are here understood to be
fundamentally social.]{.underline} As such, [they are plural, enabled or
constrained by context. Moreover, the historical specificities of
culture, place, and of existing hierarchical social stratifications each
have a substantive impact on who comes to be included, collapsed within,
or entirely excluded from the implicit "we" or, alternatively, "they"
embedded in each expression of utopia, or dystopia for that
matter]{.underline}. It follows that [the content and character of
utopias are educated, and co-emergent]{.underline} with the location and
processes of socialization. Similarly, [the ability to realize desires
for a better way of being]{.underline} is also educated. And, perhaps
more crucially, [the selfconfidence of an individual or group of
individuals to realize desires for a better way of being is also
educated.]{.underline} Given existing social inequalities, [elites are
clearly positioned to anticipate utopia, to demonstrate willful striving
towards the potential concrete realization of their utopian
propositions, in contrast to those in subordinate social
positions.]{.underline} This notion of the education of desire emerges
from the work of Miguel Abensour and Levitas, and may be considered
alongside and, in many ways, as drawing upon Ernst Bloch's related
concept of docta spes, or the education of hope. Using the above example
of the alleged dystopian turn, it is certainly the case that there are
those who do not, in fact, maintain dystopian outlooks on the merits of
neoliberal globalization. To the contrary, for some, the contemporary
condition may represent the substantial realization of utopia, an "end
of history," which only requires refinement rather than wholesale
reconstitution. However, accepting the premise of pervasive dystopianism
at the current trajectory of global society, it is also necessary to
acknowledge a variety of existing bases for such dystopianism. These may
be antithetical to one another, fundamentally troubling the potential
for a revitalization of utopianism. [Conceived of as social dreaming or
expressions of (social) desire for a better way of being, utopias as
proposals appear doomed to an inevitable failure. It seems impossible to
construct a unified "we," without stepping outside of history and
neglecting the realities of difference. Utopia]{.underline}, or more
accurately, eutopia ("the good place") for some [appears to be
inescapably dystopian,]{.underline} or, minimally, less-than-eutopia,
for others. Recognition of this apparently inexorable condition,
however, is the basis of Levitas' re-conceptualization of [utopia as
method]{.underline}. Here [utopia operates as an educative heuristic, as
an enduringly and emphatically dialogical, processual, provisional, and
critically-self-reflexive "imaginary reconstitution of society."
Proposals for a better way of being effect an estrangement from the here
and now, allowing for a remove that facilitates critical "archaeologies"
of the historical present.]{.underline} Simultaneously, the
"architectural" construction, the alternative proposal to the here and
now, is subject to judgment. [Whether described as social dreaming or
expressions of desire for a better way of being, the social dimension to
utopia as method may facilitate critical understandings of power, of
hierarchies of difference, of relationships of domination and
oppression: it may constructively educate desire.]{.underline}15
Clearly, scholarly conceptualizations of utopianism as a transhistorical
and intercultural meta-category facilitate comparative study. Equally
clear is the existence of social dreaming, expressions of desire for a
better way of being, or "texts both in the West and outside it that
pre-date More's Utopia that describe a non-existent society identifiably
better than the contemporary society."16 However, I agree with Krishan
Kumar's contention that "utopia proper" ought be differentiated as "the
modern utopia that was invented in Europe in the sixteenth century."17
More's Utopia, published in 1516, invented the word "utopia," (often
translated as "no place" or "the good place \[which is\] no place") and
the etymology is itself reflective of a historically- and
culturally-bounded conceptualization and expression of desire.18 [The
notion of a "no place" as a transcendental "good place," apart from the
immanent sphere of existence, reveals a culturally-specific epistemology
and ontology.]{.underline} Moreover, Utopia is indeed a profoundly
settler colonial text. Put another way, [Utopia articulated a
narrative---a distinctively utopian narrative---which operated in a
variety of ways to rationalize to the genocidal project of the settler
colonization of the socalled New World.]{.underline} Following Kumar and
others, [I also situate utopia as a decidedly modern phenomenon, or,
more precisely, as co-constituitive with the creation of early modern
narratives, in particular conceptions of a utopian settler modernity.
The condition of white supremacist settler colonialism that
characterizes what is now understood as Canada and the US was
prefigured, in part, by the narrative proposal put forth in More's
Utopia. Furthermore, the utopian traditions of the white settlers of
Canada and the US have been, and largely continue to be marked by the
naturalization of white settler colonialism within their imaginary
reconstitutions of society. The social dreaming of white settlers of
Canada and the US has]{.underline} most often implicitly, but at many
times explicitly, [excluded Indigenous peoples and racialized
non-Natives from their proposals for a better way of being.]{.underline}
Thus, [utopia as a distinct cultural and historical phenomenon has
operated to educate the social dreaming of the peoples who have come to
live within the white settler colonial societies of Canada and the US.
The potential of unsettling utopia]{.underline}, or put another way,
[centering Indigenous decolonization and ending white supremacy in
proposals for a better way of being, requires addressing the
contributions that utopia has made to inspire and sustain the
naturalized condition of white supremacist settler colonialism in what
is now Canada and the United States.]{.underline}

#### The development discourse inherent in the 1AC's political project is a weapon of epistemic genocide used to dehumanize and antagonize indigenous communities while valorizing expropriation and instrumentalization \-- utopianism is the tool through which the settler replaces the native via the construction of stolen lands as a "blank slate" upon which an ideal society can be built.

This dissertation begins with the first body chapter concerned with
contemporary Indigenous critical theory, tracing several key theoretical
concepts to establish the critical framework used to intervene in
utopian discourses. Primarily I am concerned with demonstrating how
Indigenous scholars have endeavored to establish what Robert Warrior
(Osage) has termed Indigenous "intellectual sovereignty," while,
importantly, avoiding notions of a romanticized, fossilized authentic
Indigeniety. In particular, I draw on Byrd's work to highlight the
potentialities associated with Indigenous studies' engagement with
postcolonial, poststructural and cultural studies, such that Indigenous
critical theory is both potentially enriched by and a contributor to
critical theories. Following Lina Sunseri, I locate the [contemporary
assertions of Indigenous nationhood as an affirmation of Indigenous
peoplehood apart from the development discourses of modernity, progress,
and rationality that were used to dehumanize and disenfranchise.
Indigenous communities.]{.underline} I also engage with concepts drawn
from Indigenous literary studies, including the work of Grace L. Dillon
(Anishinaabe) to locate what she terms "Indigenous Futurisms" and
"Indigenous Science Fiction." It is from this basis in Indigenous
critical theory and literary studies that I turn in the second chapter
to a close reading of More's Utopia. Here I develop [the notion of
utopian settler modernity and trace the pre-figurations of white settler
colonialism, including the emergent valourization of labour and
instrumental rationalization of landas-resource, as well as the
(proto)racialization of human difference as one of the means utilized by
More to conceptualize turning Abya Yala into the Modus Novus, the
remaking of the New World into a "no place," a blank slate available for
projecting notions of the ideal commonwealth.]{.underline} Ultimately, I
argue that [Utopia serves as a clear touchstone for colonialist
discourses that, in many ways, persist to this day even amongst the most
ostensibly radical utopian fiction.]{.underline} I then turn to emergent
discussions in utopian studies regarding notions of the "postcolonial
utopia" and utopianism from outside the West. I engage with prominent
conceptualizations of utopia and utopian theory, including that of
educative desire in the work of Miguel Abensour, Ernst Bloch, and Ruth
Levitas. Here I am concerned with [gaps in utopian studies discourse
that has heretofore neglected Indigenous peoples and appears predisposed
towards the sort of "add-and-stir" inclusion that Hall's re-articulation
explicitly seeks to avoid.]{.underline} I raise the question of the
efficacy of notions of postcolonial utopias to describe Indigenous
peoples' desires for making a better world and, ultimately, raise the
issue of the appropriateness of "utopian" language and discourses given
their clear relationship with colonialism. In the fourth chapter I
survey recent examples of utopian literature created by white settler
authors, noting the apparent evidence of desire for indigeneity. I
develop the notion of settler ecotopianism to describe [the utopian
narratives of white settlers that generally involve the instrumental
appropriation of Indigenous culture as means of escape from the
alienation experienced by the urban industrial white settler
society.]{.underline} I engage with a variety of utopian texts ranging
from Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward to Ernest Callenbach's Ecotopia
to the novels of Ursula K. Le Guin, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Starhawk.
My central focus in this chapter is [the simultaneous desire for an
indigenous future combined with the naturalized evasion of decolonial
concerns.]{.underline} I then turn to a discussion of [contemporary
Indigenous sf (speculative fiction) as a means of exploring the
re-articulation of utopia in light of the concerns and experiences of
Indigenous peoples.]{.underline} I draw on the work of both Byrd and
Dillon to demonstrate the emergent scholarship on Indigenous sf as
distinct from but also in some ways congruent with the category of
"postcolonial." Ultimately, I argue the [decolonial Indigenous Futurisms
articulated in the Indigenous sf of Leslie Marmon Silko, Daniel Heath
Justice, and others ought be understood as simultaneously proffering an
immanent critique of the modern utopian tradition, while utilizing
aspects of its conventions to do so.]{.underline} I also discuss how the
mixed identities of some authors, including Nalo Hopkinson and Zainab
Amadahy provide for a rich basis for transgenre narratives that
simultaneously engage Indigenous and postcolonial themes, alongside, for
example, ecological and feminist concerns. Ultimately, I argue that
today's social dreaming is increasingly subjected to dynamic, educative,
and intersectional critical analyses that evokes Byrd's notion of
"cacophony," and portends further complexity, humility, and
relationality for the human and the other-than-human alike.

#### Conceptualizations of utopia are complicit in the universalizing logics of Western progressivism -- resolution demands a perpetually incomplete "pursuit of the ideal" that necessitates the repetitive elimination of indigeneity, the "primitive" and "anti-utopian" other, in service of colonial modernity's emergence.

The experience of contact between the European newcomers and Indigenous
peoples was broadly diverse and was inflected by the respective
metropoles' own circumstances, especially in relation to their
experiences of contact with non-Europeans. Consequently, there were a
variety of disparate ways in which the European metropoles conducted
their respective colonial endeavors.23 Ultimately, however, [where
[Europeans sought to establish]{.mark} what were conceived of as
decidedly [modern and utopian colonies]{.mark} in the New World,
[Indigenous peoples and their land-based spiritual, epistemological, and
ontological orientations were]{.mark}, broadly speaking, [narratively
represented as bygone, primitive, or pre-modern---as indicative of
anti-utopia]{.mark}]{.underline}. It follows that [such narratives
contributed to [justifications for]{.mark} attempts at [subjugating or
eliminating Indigenous peoples via dislocation]{.mark}]{.underline}
(forced removal from traditional lands), [[annihilation]{.underline}
(]{.mark}murder), [[and assimilation]{.underline}]{.mark} (strategies
for bringing the Indigenous "up" or "forward" to the level of the
European standard or incorporating them as new category of person in the
case of the mestizo in Spanish colonies). While the pre-contact
narratives of desirable social change of both Europeans and Indigenous
peoples are an important consideration---among other things, they may
facilitate an understanding of the bases for evolution and change
resulting from contact--- it is also crucial to recognize the imposition
of such supremacist narratives immediately inspired corresponding
Indigenous narratives of Indigenous resistances. Furthermore, contact
between the Indigenous and the European impacted the self-conceptions of
both. From 1492 to the present day, narratives created by both
Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples living in what is now Canada and
the US continue to necessarily involve substantial degrees of
co-creation and enduring dynamism. To date there are relatively few
direct, specific, substantive Indigenous scholarly engagements with
discourses of utopia. However, the late historian John Mohawk (Seneca)
offers one notable critical treatment in his Utopian Legacies: A History
of Conquest and Oppression in the Western World.24 Here Mohawk offers a
conceptual distinction between notions of "utopia" and what he refers to
as the Western "pursuit of the ideal."25 Mohawk understands utopianism,
as he conceives it, to have existed "since antiquity in most if not all
of the world's cultures," and to "propose that there has existed, now
exists somewhere, or could exist in the future a perfect society, an
existence in which all human needs are satisfied, all problems are
solved, and everyone's life is fulfilled."26 Utopianism, Mohawk
maintains, is related but distinguished from what he argues is ["[the
pursuit of the ideal," a]{.underline}]{.mark} ["theme in Western
culture" which "[articulates all reasonable human beings]{.mark} who
have access to an adequate base of information [will pursue an identical
concept of what is]{.mark} ideal or [good]{.mark}."]{.underline}27
[Western utopianism]{.underline}, according to Mohawk[, "is dominated by
a certainty that an ideal world is possible, that [such a world would be
in the best interest of all human beings, and its conception and
production will inevitably be the product of Western
thought]{.mark}."]{.underline}28 Consequently for Mohawk**[, [Western
utopianism]{.mark} historically operated and continues to [operate as a
self-aggrandizing and humanist ideology based in futureoriented notions
of modernity and progress, which]{.mark}, crucially, [never fully
arrive--- therefore providing a basis for]{.mark} its ongoing and
[continual renewal]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In contrast, Mohawk writes of
"many ancient societies, \[where\] utopias were envisioned as located in
a distant past when human beings and nature existing harmoniously in
blissful unity."29 Moreover[, as a consequence of the oppression imposed
by Western utopianism, Mohawk's brief discussion of the utopianism of
Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island is based in notions of an idealized
pre-colonial past, one that explicitly rejects notions of transcendental
progress]{.underline}: ...North American Indians were, with few
exceptions, coerced or driven by military force from their ancestral
lands. These Indians saw the fowl, fish, and animals of their homelands
driven to near extinction; their people decimated by disease; and their
land made off limits to them by a relentless invader. For them, [utopia
would be a place where all things lost would be restored and the
material culture of their ancestors could be enjoyed]{.underline}.30
Mohawk's articulation of this notion of Indigenous utopianism is
decidedly a form of "paradise lost" that could be recognized as
essentializing insofar as it is interpreted as a call to a "return" to
an Indigenous cultural ideal. However, Mohawk later describes
traditional Haudenosaunee stories ... of the past depicting a time when
people were clear about the desires of the spirits who created life on
the earth, and found a sense of security and grace in that knowledge.
Among the Iroquois myths is a story of human beings becoming forgetful
of their obligations for the great good fortune of the gift of life;
when this happened, unhappiness, misfortune, and anomie befell them.
Therefore, ceremonies of thanksgiving are given by the people to the
Creator of Life so they will always remember to be grateful. But, the
story continues, someday in the future people will once again become
forgetful, the earth itself will grow old, and life will change.
Iroquois cosmology is in a sense utopian, but the utopia---the perfect
world---is in a shrouded and very ancient past during which the
relationship between human beings and the spirits who support life was
very strong and cooperative, and even the animals and birds participated
along with human beings in the continuous drama of life. As time passed,
according to this myth, things changed and continue to change. Even
before the European expansion and the end of the fifteenth century and
long before the beginning of the Age of Extinction at the end of the
seventeenth century, Iroquois storytellers described a perfect age in
the distant past and urged the necessity of carrying on traditions to
preserve as much of the relationships and knowledge of those times as
possible in a present that was becoming ever more distant from that
utopia.31 So, while Mohawk states "all societies have had their utopian
dreams," [he is explicit in characterizing [Western utopianism as
progressive, universalizing, implicitly anthropocentric, and continually
renewing a sense of modernity]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the same time,
[he offers a radically different understanding of [an Indigenous
utopianism that is traditional and embedded within a wider earth-based
cosmology]{.mark}.]{.underline} Mohawk approaches these concerns as a
historian and so his referencing of notions of "pluralism" as an
alternative anti-colonial, quasi-utopian project is understandably
brief. While he avoids a more direct and explicit evocation of what he
might hold personally as an ideal or utopian vision, he does assert that
"\[to\] the degree a people or nation can be taught to respect the
principles of pluralism and tolerance, the prospects of militias
committing slaughters and armies participating in wholesale ethnic
cleansing are diminished."32 The growing body of contemporary Indigenous
critical theory reflects the development of varied concepts, discourses,
and practices that are indicative of the diversity of their respective
backgrounds and experiences.33 Therefore, I wish to recognize the
dangers of appearing to collapse Indigenous narratives surrounding
settler colonialism, Indigenous decolonization, or those otherwise
concerned with proposing alternatives to the modern utopian tradition of
white settlers. I wish to emphasize that Indigenous critical theories
and their narrative proposals cannot be reduced to singular concepts,
discourses, or practices that may have the effect of appearing to
condense a vital diversity of thought and practice. Moreover, as I
discuss below, Indigenous critical theorists and their narrative
proposals ought not be reduced to mere alternatives or counters to those
of the settler colonial societies they are now situated within. Just as
there is danger in reducing the diversity of Indigenous thought to
singular concepts, discourses, or practices, there is a similar
problematic in a reductive understanding of Indigenous critical theories
and narrative proposals as merely defensive or reactive in their
inspiration and articulation.

The Prison Industrial Complex (PIC) is a global phenomenon. Women
worldwide, and especially poor women of colour are the fastest growing
prison population and practices of imprisonment are implicated in
upholding racialized, sexualized and classed hierarchies of power
(Davis, 2003; 2005; 2012; Sudbury, 2005; 2008; Gilmore, 2007). At the
same time this has garnered very little attention in a discipline whose
founding narratives claim the Prison and Prisoner as their own. The
significance of a growing carceral apparatus for questions of safety,
well-being and global justice have seen little meaningful engagement in
orthodox IR. On one hand, the reality of the PIC---a central formation
within the global system---has yet to be engaged from outside a critical
political economy tradition. On the other hand, critical IR's engagement
with imprisonment has largely been confined to an emphais on various
modes of detention, surveillance and new governance practices, while
less work has focused on more mundane practices of incarceration as a
feature of colonial relations, and especially settler Ph.D. Thesis -- J.
Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 25 colonial states
within empire.12 In this chapter I argue that the prison and prisoner
are foundational to, and yet eclipsed by IR, and that the failure for IR
to 'see' imprisonment has much to do with its inability to see (settler)
colonialism. In the Canadian context, this requires taking seriously how
Canada's own history of employing systems of confinement as an everyday
tool and strategy of settler colonial governance has largely been taken
for granted by IR and the broader discipline of Political Science.
Beginning from this starting point my aim is to show how the global
political economic and state-making implications of these practices of
punishment and carcerality are organized through gendered, racialized,
sexualized and classed hierarchies that are reproduced and even
transformed through these efforts. This means that I understand the
[prison and prisoner as categories that are upheld by white supremacy
and heteropatriarchy within global capitalism. 13 This chapter will
begin by examining the lineage of one of IR's founding metaphors, the
Prisoner's Dilemma, to consider the work it does to order and discipline
IR's]{.underline} relationship to practices of imprisonment through
claims to universalism and rationality, which serve as methods to
"resolve" social conflict through the use of force. I trace its deeper
intellectual commitments and lineages to modern liberal thought in order
to consider the purpose and role of prison and punishment within the
settler state, arguing 12 Here I am informed by Tuck and Yang's (2012)
discussion of internal and external colonialism where they argue that
neither fully accounts for settler colonial contexts. They state,
"Settler colonialism operates through internal/external colonial modes
simultaneously because there is no spatial separation between metropole
and colony" (p. 5). McCoy, Tuck & McKenzie (2017) point out that these
are not mutually exclusive, especially as many settler states colonize
other lands. 13 As stated in the introduction, this project also begins
from the starting point that reproductive work is a terrain of struggle
that must be taken seriously as the necessary underpinning of a
transnational political economy of carcerality and carceral space. Ph.D.
Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 26 that
the utility of imprisonment rests on its embeddedness within the social
contract and methods of coercion and non-consent. In addition to
providing insight into the extent to which the prison and prisoner are
substantively under theorized in the field, by connecting the prison and
prisoner to orthodox international and political theory, I argue [that
the [prison and prisoner are indispensable to an imperial and settler
colonial project]{.mark}, because they are [integral to the theft of
people's bodies, land, and labour through practices of
criminalization]{.mark}]{.underline}. This lends insight into how
practices of imprisonment, as well as settler colonialism are
substantively under theorized in the field. By examining the political
philosophical foundations of imprisonment in social contractarian
thought I show that the utility of the prison and prisoner and their
corresponding logics resides in their attempt to hide and naturalize the
violence required to maintain an international order reliant on the
theft of bodies and lands. In doing so I establish connections between
land, labour, criminalization and punishment, which links the histories
of settler colonialism with the production of carceral space in order to
understand the prison and prisoner as central to an imperial and
colonial project through how it is required to reorganize relationships
between bodies and lands. By establishing [the [foundations of IR's
ontological investment in prison and punishment as a method of resolving
conflict]{.mark} we can more easily access [assumptions about whose
security, economic interests, well-being and ways of being are to be
secured and whose can be criminalized]{.mark}.]{.underline} Finally,
this chapter will begin to explore how to make sense of the
land-labourpunishment and criminalization nexus within global context.
There has been a number of important works that provide postcolonial
critiques of the imperial foundations of modern Ph.D. Thesis -- J.
Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 27 political thought.
My aim in this chapter is to build on them in order to help to make
sense of the relationship between the production of carceral space and
settler colonialism. Equally, in the chapters that follow, I provide a
more sustained analysis of how these relationships and struggles took
shape in what would become Canada. Thus, though tracing these histories
in the global context is important, the historical context of a
particular place and the land matter a great deal in how contemporary
carceral projects can be realized, as well as how methods of
criminalization continue to be used as strategies to suppress and quell
these longstanding struggles that seek to disrupt their place within
empire, and through that attempt to envision and build worlds otherwise.
Unpacking and Interrogating the Prisoner's Dilemma in IR The prison and
prisoner have been marked with a conspicuous level of presence and
absence in the discipline of International Relations (IR). [Game theory,
and the Prisoner's Dilemma in particular, are [central tenets of
rational choice models]{.mark} in the discipline.]{.underline} The use
of game theory became more pronounced in fields outside of economics in
the latter decades of the last century and as part of a larger
positivist [[tradition within IR]{.underline}]{.mark} and Political
Science. What IR knows as the prisoner's dilemma has come a long way
from the initial intentions and questions of RAND Researchers, Merrill
Flood and Melvin Dresher (Poundstone 1992, 106). Flood and Dresher hoped
to understand why, if cooperation yielded higher payoffs, would rational
actors choose selfdefeating strategies? The 'pair of prisoners' story
was actually added later to provide a Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis
McMaster University -- Political Science 28 narrative structure to the
model (Marks, 2004).14 Through [its widespread deployment in
IR]{.underline} it has become more emblematic of a desire to explain and
predict the behavior of states as units of analysis and as a method of
determining the impact of those outcomes. The way rational choice
perspectives have been taken up in IR [[fails to recognize]{.mark} and
grasp the very real presence of the [global terrains of
imprisonment]{.mark} and a growing carceral apparatus]{.underline}, and
demonstratively [does not consider them as a worthwhile and serious
phenomenon of study.]{.underline} In this sense, there persists a
curious level of visibility and invisibility when it comes to
understanding the prison and prisoner in IR that intersects theoretical,
empirical and methodological terrains. There has not only been a failure
in recognition, [but a gap in taking seriously its role in informing and
reproducing contemporary relations of power in global
politics]{.underline}. Presented as a hypothetical test ground for
mathematical models and theory building within rational choice
perspectives, the prisoner's dilemma is a formative metaphor in
theorizing and producing the international (Marks, 2004).15 The dilemma
can be understood as a both a narrative strategy, or metaphor, as well
as a model used to organize and predict the actions of rational actors
in international politics based on judging and responding to the
strategic moves of another in order to achieve maximum payoff. Similar
to the other metaphors of game theory, the narrative argues that each
rational actor will make decisions that are in their best interest in
order to receive the 14 As Marks (2004) explains is not actually
required for the 'dilemma' to manifest since game theory was never
intended to replicate anyone's lived experience. 15 For an elaborated
discussion of the role of metaphors in IR, see Metaphors of
Globalization: Mirrors, Magicians, Mutinies (2008). Ph.D. Thesis -- J.
Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 29 greatest reward.
These approaches have sought to use the prison among other visual
imagery as an illustrative scenario to demonstrate the validity and
viability of the mathematical models rational choice theories are
premised on for the purpose of prediction and explanation. The result is
that that [[assumptions about how prisoners rationally choose their
self-interest over collective cooperation]{.mark} for mutual benefit can
help to predict the behaviors of states]{.underline}. The narrative says
that two prisoners have committed a crime and have been caught,
separated, and offered a deal from police that they cannot consult each
other on. If one of the prisoners confesses to committing the crime
while the other does not, the partner that has confessed will go free
while the other that has not will go to jail for ten years. If both
prisoners confess both will go to prison for five years, and if each
prisoner denies, then both will go to prison for six months. Drawing on
this scenario Realists have endeavored to show that in situations [where
there is instability, or when there is mistrust and information and
communication is limited, the actor will logically choose
[self-interest]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[reward at the expense of
mutual benefit]{.mark} and cooperation,]{.underline} whereas Liberals
have been more apt to demonstrate that cooperation is possible and
conflict is not the inevitable outcome (Krasner, 1983; Keohane, 1984;
Stein, 1990). According to this model, our understanding of states and
global structures are reduced to outcomes of conflict (anarchy) and
cooperation (order) where states jockey to acquire gains and minimize
losses, and where relative strategic success becomes defined in these
terms.16 [Perhaps [the most well-known adoption of this model in IR is
**Deterrence Theory**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 16 For a thorough critique
of the limits of Game Theory and the Prisoner's Dilemma see Marks
(2004). Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political
Science 30 Situated within a Realist framework deterrence theory states
that in order to avoid the worst-case scenario, it may be in an actor's
best interest to defect even if it produces some consequences that are
undesirable. The rationale for this is that, as outlined, these
consequences will be better than an alternative scenario in which the
other actor defects and we are left with more severe consequences
(whether in the form of nuclear fallout or a longer sentence). This
strategy is intended to create the conditions to avoid unwanted wars
and, in situations of international crises, acting first is considered a
strategic move to avoid the worst consequences (Jervis, 1976).17 As
Snyder states, "\[t\]he central characteristic of the game is that,
although the parties could enjoy mutual benefits by cooperating, the
logic of their situation forces them into conflict and mutual loses"
(1970, p. 67). Importantly, in this framework each actor will want to be
first to confess even if they will still be punished, since this will
still mean less punishment over all.18 What questions does the
Prisoner's Dilemma raise and attempt to resolve for IR? Here it is worth
noting that the conditions within which states must act are ones of
constraint---a detail that is both crucial for the model to work and
exemplified fittingly in the use of the metaphor of the prison. [[For
Liberals,]{.mark} the prisoner's dilemma narrative [implies the
possibility of]{.mark} negotiation and [cooperation through "collective
security"]{.mark} achieved through [international agreements and
institutions]{.mark} (Snyder, 1971), and [shared norms]{.mark}.
However[, in reality power is not shared equally.]{.mark}]{.underline}
This means that although both Realist and Liberal interpretations
suggest that their frameworks seek to preserve security 17 For example,
as is the case with the security dilemma, arms races and Mutually
Assured Destruction (Snyder, 1971; Jervis, 1976). 18 Snyder (1971)
explains that within Realist thought this instability is generated from
the international system itself, whereas within Liberalism it is
generated by uncertainty about opponents' intentions. Ph.D. Thesis -- J.
Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 31 and diminish
violence overall, there are a number of assumptions at play that ensure
the prison and prisoner cannot be substantively engaged as sites of
study in international politics[. Both [Realists and Liberals
ignore]{.mark} that the very [presence of the prison and police]{.mark}
already [assume the use of force as necessary to manage societal
conflict. Deterrence theory illustrates this]{.mark}]{.underline} and
therefore it should come as no surprise that the idea of the prison
would be subject to similar disciplinary conditioning. In a framework
that already assumes the use of force and constraint, it is notable that
the idea of [[punishment can become conceived of as a necessary evil or
the least violent alternative to minimize and reduce overall harm within
a conflict driven and constantly shifting international state
system]{.mark}.]{.underline} Here it becomes evident that beyond a
narrative or metaphor that becomes applied to the international realm,
the prisoner's dilemma is about producing and sustaining certain logics
and practices of IR, which rest on both the material, discursive and
knowledge production practices of carcerality. These are the same logics
and narratives that eclipse the prison and prisoner as an analytical
site in the field. [These [narratives of conflict or cooperation share a
positivist epistemology and a "belief in the universal rationality of
economic logic]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} (Waltz, 1979, as quoted in
Ling, 2002, p. 115). Realists like Jervis (1970, p. 73) have aspired
["to [preserve the international system and the signals that lend
it]{.mark} greater [predictability]{.mark}"]{.underline} since it is
this predictability that [they claim will enhance the model's function
overall]{.underline}. For instance, claiming this will be achieved when
"the actors value the system, prefer long-run over short-run gains, and
have more in common than conflicting interests" (Jervis, 1970, p. 73).
This means that the Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster University --
Political Science 32 system functions better when everyone buys in to or
trusts the rules of the game through the punishment and reward system.
But as Agathangelou and Ling (2009, p. 15) expose, strong states that
set "the rules of the game" that other states must then play by. They go
on to say, "\[s\]hould compliance fail to ensue, or\[...\] outright
violation occur, the Self \[i.e. strong states\] must discipline the
Other" (2009, p. 15). Of course, [the Prisoner's Dilemma was never
intended to model human interaction or experiences though it undeniably
has implications for how we act, experience and create our worlds. [It
has come to reproduce assumptions about human nature]{.mark} in
constrained conditions as extended and embodied by states in ways that
[deny the complexity and vast range of human experience within and
beyond prison walls]{.mark} (Marks, 2004).]{.underline} Marks aims to
rectify this by compiling a more accurate representation of prisoners
and their experiences to build a more useful and exemplary metaphor for
IR.19 As much as I concur that the metaphor of the prison shapes our
actions and our worlds, prison is not simply a metaphor. An
understanding of it as such, though certainly opening a valuable vantage
point from which to examine prison from a more nuanced, institutional
and empirically rigorous standpoint, does a disservice to those for whom
it is daily reality and fails to bring us to a more politicized
understanding of the global system of incarceration that helps to stitch
the fabric of the contemporary neoliberal capitalist world order. That
is, the prisoner's dilemma is not only problematic because of the
artificial limits imposed by the payoff structure and the ways this
translates to the international 19 His Constructivist commitments lead
him to this important argument, but it is also these same commitments
that limit the extent of his critique. I am supportive of Marks' desire
to include prisoners' experiences and to consider what a more sustained
analysis of the prison system would yield us in global politics. See for
example Der Derian (1998). Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster
University -- Political Science 33 (Marks, 2004), but because [it [takes
for granted the full set of power relations that produce the prison
itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}20 So despite the desire to shine a
spotlight on the work outside the discipline that seriously complicates
otherwise simplistic notions of prisons as institutions and the people
within them[, it fails to help us recognize the substantively material
and ideological work that prison and prisoners do for us in global
politics, or bring us closer to a more inclusive or transformative
vision of justice.]{.underline} Thus, I approach this in a way that does
not take the prison as a political-economic institution, set of
practices and logics for granted, and which aims to make more explicit
its role in sustaining global inequities and hierarchies advanced
through colonialism, capitalism, and militarization. Another way of
saying this is that the prison and prisoner have been glossed over in IR
for many of the same reasons as settler colonialism. One of the
implications of taking the Prisoner's Dilemma seriously as a set of
competing, though not substantively different logics, is that we can
begin to see their deep and intertwined history with imperial thought.
The focus of this dissertation is to examine what is exposed about
settler colonialism when the prison and prisoner are made visible and
unpacked as a feature of its inner workings. In particular, the specific
ways that coercion and the use of force feature in the prisoner's
dilemma, as constituted through claims to universalism and rationality,
indicates that the category of the prisoner is also crucial to the
formation of racial hierarchies of superiority and inferiority. In doing
so this work follows a tradition 20 So, although the use of force has
already been assumed, the prison is likened to the international system
and intended to illustrate a set of limited conditions that states face
in making decisions about how to act within the international structure
of states in order to produce the greatest number of rewards. If the
state in question acts in ways that promote their self-interest as
defined by the rules and norms of the international system they will
reap rewards. This means punishment becomes a method to condition
behavior towards the rules and norms of the system, as well as the
interests of particular states. Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster
University -- Political Science 34 of challenging the idea that
narratives can continue to be reproduced in mainstream IR literatures as
a substitute for analyses of power (Grovogui, 2001). As Grovogui
claims[, often [such "hermeneutics \[of race\]" depends on understanding
"that Africa has served as the counterpoint to the European trajectory
in order to provide a justificatory trope for the ontology of
international relations, morality, hierarchies, and structures of
authority and legitimacy"]{.mark}]{.underline} (p. 426, 427). This can
also be said for the Americas and the complimentary, but distinct role
that Indigenous peoples were scripted within the civilizational
narratives of empire (Beier, 2002). Geeta Chowdhury and Sheila Nair
(2002) argue [for [the interrogation of the power asymmetries and
hierarchies]{.mark} that uphold states and their position [within a
global system,]{.mark} as well as the ways that the [imperialist
juncture and its related historical processes]{.mark} feature so
prominently in these productions.]{.underline} Such an entry point
unpacks [questions of "the state, sovereignty, order and anarchy" in
order to consider how [the discipline's mainstream, is premised on an
understanding of power that privileges hierarchy, "rationality," and a
predominantly Eurocentric worldview]{.mark}, thus [mystifying the ways
in which states and the international system are anchored in social

further, bringing these social relations to light requires moving beyond
critical approaches in order to account for the intersectionality of
these erasures so as to theorize power in IR (Chowdhry & Nair, 2002).

Political Science 35 Thus, though the state has been interrogated in
critical perspective,21 there remain important connections to the
material and discursive ordering and operation of power made possible
through (in)formal institutional, policy and socio-legal practices and
arrangements and their enforcement. The ways the power relations of the
prison must be erased in IR also gives us insight into the ways in which
colonialism, and especially settler colonialism, must also be

intervention that foregrounds an analysis of power and the ways colonial
hierarchies work alongside methods and practices of settler colonial law
and institutional formation in order to make possible the prison and
prisoner as institutions, practices and categories of subjectivity on
which settler colonialism and empire relies. [When we take [imprisonment
for granted, we hide a crucial strategy and means by which colonial

[state-making.]{.mark}]{.underline} For settler states, the deployment
of these logics has profound implications for the terms on which
inclusion and exclusion are conceived. In the case of the Prisoner's
Dilemma, it [produces a limited and clearly defined set of choices,
punishments and payoffs]{.underline}. In this way, although the use of
force has already been assumed, the prison is likened to the
international system and intended to illustrate a set of limited
conditions that states face in making decisions about how to act within
the international structure of states in order to produce the greatest
number of rewards. If the 21 Chowdhry and Nair (2002) provide a detailed
discussion of the gaps in critical IR scholarship in pages 6- 10. Ph.D.

in question acts in ways that promote their self-interest as defined by
the rules and norms of the international system, they will reap rewards.
In such a framework, [punishment additionally [becomes a method to
condition behavior towards the rules and norms of the
system]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as [a means by which dominant power
extends itself over the bodies and lands of others]{.underline}.22
Therefore, the logics which underpin this invisibility take for granted
the use of force at the same time that they deny the invasive and
transnational methods of governance that were required to make
colonialism and settler colonialism possible.23 This is enabled by how
the state is taken for granted as a unit of analysis, as others have
argued elsewhere.24 However, I want to suggest that when we consider the
ways these methods have implicated the prison and prisoner in IR it is
possible to gain insight into how the struggle to get colonialism and
settler colonialism seen in IR is also compounded by the inability to
see the prison and prisoner as well. This means that it becomes
difficult to separate practices of imprisonment from colonial and
imperial projects historically and on an ongoing basis. Arguably, [the
[prisoner's dilemma rests on much more longstanding ontological and
epistemological commitments]{.mark} in modern liberal thought regarding
the centrality of the use of force to good government and
governance]{.underline}, as well as the ways these philosophies have
often been [[naturalized and obscured through their application within
IR]{.underline}.]{.mark} Despite their differing levels of willingness
to engage with questions of power and 22 Marks (2004, 113) has also
shown, both prisoners and states have the ability to affect and alter
the circumstances or conditions in which conflict or cooperation occur
to demonstrate that the international system is not in fact a fixed
reality. 23 This is reproduced when, for example, a game theory model is
deployed to give an account of the scramble for Africa. 24 See for
example, Walker (1997), Campbell (1998). Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis
McMaster University -- Political Science 37 violence, both Realists and
Liberals take the prison as an institution and set of practices for
granted: the reality of the prison and prisoner are assumed in the
question itself. The implication of this is that practices of
imprisonment as well as the prison and prisoner remain invisible and yet
absolutely central features and figures in global politics. Marks
identifies that, "what matters most in the application of game theory in
international relations theory is not the unique imagery inherent in
each game's underlying metaphor but how all the games taken in their
entirety convey the same picture about what international relations is
about" (2004, p. 35-36, emphasis original). This is true; however, I
would like to both broaden and add specificity to this statement by
suggesting that the prisoner's dilemma can be further unpacked by
establishing how it is premised on and works alongside other deeply
established ontological commitments and erasures in the field. In the
following section I [read the Prisoner's Dilemma as [a set of logics
with deeper roots in modern political
thought]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and as adding insight into
understanding the ways in which abstraction and erasure of the prison
and prisoner have become enshrined in IR. By doing so I believe we can
gain greater insight into the specific ways prison and prisoners have
become both central to and absent in the discipline. Punishment and

as a deterrent for future violations. But what can be gained by
examining the role of punishment, constraint, and coercion within these
frameworks? In this section I examine the role of punishment and
property in social contractarian thought to highlight that their
co-constitution has been under theorized. Paying particular attention to
the role of punishment, I show [how claims to rationality and
universalism continue to structure [processes of criminalization along
racialized, gendered, sexualized and classed lines.]{.mark}]{.underline}
I argue that [[ways of being in relation to land and labour perceived as
deviant become criminalized]{.underline}]{.mark}, which subsequently
provides the grounds for coercion and non-consensual inclusion, as well
as the means by which the use of force is normalized against particular
populations. Examining these relations indicates a more comprehensive
lineage of erasure in how the prison and prisoner ensure punishment and
criminalization as central strategies of the settler state within
empire. [Thomas Hobbes' [conception of the "state of nature" works
alongside]{.mark} and informs the Prisoner's Dilemma]{.underline}
narrative to establish [[claims about human nature under anarchy and the
behavior of states in an anarchic system.]{.underline}]{.mark} As Marks
(2004) identifies, in the same ways Realists establish anarchy as the
central problem of IR through the use of Hobbes' 'state of nature,' they
also make implicit assumptions about the prison. Namely, that despite an
overarching and imposed structure, they are anarchic, violent and
primitive--- attributes that are easily scripted onto prisoners
themselves. Though these assumptions are not widely shared beyond the
mainstream of the field, they are difficult to escape and still inform
the basis of the most powerful schools of thought within IR alongside
other such metaphors (Marks, 2004). Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster
University -- Political Science 39 The Hobbesian story of human life in
the state of nature as being "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short"
(1981\[1651\], 186), is well known and not without problems in the way
that it has been central in theorizing sovereignty and upholding the
order/anarchy divide on which orthodox IR theories have been premised
(Walker, 1993; Beier, 2002). [For Hobbes, [the state of nature is one of
perpetual insecurity because under conditions of scarcity human beings
will always need to seek their own self-preservation and causing the
security dilemma to ensue]{.mark}]{.underline} (Walker, 1993). As Walker
claims, Among (proto bourgeois) individuals, Hobbes argues, structural
relations of insecurity demand a superior sovereign for an ordered
polity to be constituted. Hence, the powerful resolution of the relation
between sovereign individuals and sovereign states through a contract
that is both freely entered into and yet necessitated by structural
conditions. (Walker, 1993, p. 93). [This conception of human nature
[necessitates a sovereign or Leviathan]{.mark}, since peace and order
are impossible without]{.underline}. Walker suggests that Hobbes
provides a way of negotiating claims of autonomous individuals with a
political community since, ...\[A\]ccounts of consent, participation and
representation that came to be articulated as a way of holding apart,
yet also reconciling, the claims of supposedly autonomous individuals
with the claims of obligation to a broader collective, the community of
citizens, the people, the nation, the state. (1993, p. 147-148) Beyond
the fact that reconciling freedom with sovereign authority under
capitalism naturalizes the acceptance of subjugation and asymmetrical
relations of power, I want to suggest that Hobbes' account be understood
as one which argues that the social contract must be entered into under
conditions of constraint. [This is not only because [structural
conditions naturalize social hierarchy]{.mark} but because
[consent]{.mark} as described by Hobbes, [is actually about coercive
"agreement."]{.mark}]{.underline} John Locke on the other hand,
understood life in the state of nature, though Ph.D. Thesis -- J.
Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 40 insecure, to be
relatively calm, cooperative and pleasant, so long as everyone followed
the rules. Locke argues that though the state of nature is one of
equality and liberty, it is not one of license as "no one ought to harm
another in their life, health, liberty or possessions" (1980\[1690\], p.
9). Similarly, to Hobbes, Locke naturalizes his own conceptions of
reason, morality, property and punishment through using the state of
nature as a rhetorical device that adopts his theorizations about
political society. Locke's conceptions of property have been shown to be
of central importance in understanding his theorizations "since the
creation of property and its preservation constitute the foundation of
the state of nature and civil society respectively" (Arneil, 1996, 60).
At the same time, the question of punishment is actually one of the
first subjects addressed in Locke's discussion of the state of nature,
where punishment and property are already married. Hobbes' understanding
of punishment follows rather predictably from his ideas of power,
authority, order and obedience. Punishment is an action permitted by the
sovereign in the event that the law is violated, since the right for
security has been surrendered to the sovereign. Likewise, where there is
no law, there is no crime: ... that the Civil Law ceasing, Crimes cease:
for there being no other law remaining, but that of Nature, there is no
place for Accusation; every man being his own Judge, and accursed onely
by his own Conscience, and cleared by the Uprightnesse of his own
Intention. Then therefore his Intention is Right, his fact is no Sinne:
if otherwise his fact is Sinne; but not Crime. \[...\] That when
Sovereign Power ceaseth, Crime also ceaseth: for where there is no
Power, there is no protection to be held from the Law; and therefore,
everyone may protect himself by his own power: for no man in the
Institution of the Sovereign Power can be supposed to give away the
Right of preserving his own body; for the safety where of all
Sovereignty was ordained. But this is to be understood onely of those,
that have not themselves contributed to the taking away of the Power
that protected them: for that was a Crime from the beginning (Hobbes,
1985\[1651\], p. 337) In other words, there is a hierarchy of violence
and crime is only possible when there is a law to violate. Even though
in the state of nature the use of force can be used against Ph.D. Thesis
-- J. Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 41 another for
self-preservation, the difference is that no one has an obligation to
submit. At the same time Hobbes locates the making of sovereignty in the
preservation of life in the state of nature. When the law is broken his
position is that the state has no obligation to uphold the social
contract with criminals since they, as the initial violator of the law
(the social contract), become enemies of the state (Brettschneider,
2007). This is consistent with his position that the punishment for many
crimes should be the alienation of citizenship.25 Since criminality
depends on a "defect in Reasoning" and is "Of the Passions" (Hobbes,
1985\[1651\], p. 339, 341), unreasonableness is a criterion of
criminality and vice versa. Though Hobbes projects that since rational
and reasonable men enter into the contract on agreement, this ignores
the structural conditions of constraint that make up the state of nature
and necessitate the sovereign. Thus, when violators of the law are
inevitably accused of unreasonableness and the punishment justified,
this is simply an extension of the coercion and violence that is
naturalized in the state of nature and foundational to the contract
itself. Although Hobbes and Locke come to different conclusions about
the conditions and circumstances with which citizens authorize the just
use of force in society, I argue that both try to reconcile freedom with
conditions of constraint. Hobbes attempts to reconcile freedom and right
with supreme and excessive sovereign authority under 25 Brettschneider
(2007) also points out that not all social contractarians take such an
extreme position. He says, "Whereas Hobbes labels criminals "enemies"
outside the social contract, contractualist justification views even the
worst offenders as citizens and requires that the coercion they face be
reasonably acceptable to them" (2007, p. 181). Ph.D. Thesis -- J.
Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 42 capitalism to
achieve peace and order, whereas [Locke attempts to settle it with a
form of [collective agreement]{.mark} that claims to be more measured in
the use of force, but [still rests on the naturalized marriage of
property and punishment]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Therefore, both Hobbes
and Locke argue that the social contract must be coercively entered into
in different ways.]{.underline} This means that political community and
state formation are about non-consensual relations even on their own
terms.26 According to Brettschneider (2007), social contractualism is a
not a theory of actual consent, since "\[c\]ontractualism aspires to be
a theory of legitimate coercion" (p. 182). He goes on to argue that,
"Never is a state more coercive than when it punishes, \[making\]
punishment a paradigmatic example\[...\] contractualism hopes to
justify." I however want to suggest that the criteria of assessing the
extent to which social contract theory attempts to legitimate coercion
may be more effectively perceived by looking to the more insidious forms
of its operation and contractualism's core assumptions. Of course, the
moment of punishment lends crucial insight into the operation of power
and authority because of the explicitness with which personal, physical,
emotional, and psychological boundaries are violated, but this moment is
connected, and indeed made possible by the earlier erosion of autonomy
and freedom through coercion, constraint and non-consent. Likening the
state of nature and the role of punishment for Hobbes and Locke to
Realist and Liberal revisions of the Prisoner's Dilemma suggests that
more baggage may 26 Those with the option to enter in to even this
coercive agreement included white bourgeois men with an interest in
maintaining their security of person and property. Ph.D. Thesis -- J.
Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 43 be at play than an
understanding of game theory alone makes room for. If the question the
prisoner's dilemma suggests is not if force will be used, but when and
how (to what degree), I want to suggest that referring to Hobbes and
Locke can give us some indication about the underlying assumptions that
are necessary to answer this question. By making the case for the right
to punish as foundational to order and good government, the assumption
of punishment by force is certainly not exclusive to IR alone, but to
Political Science more broadly. In this sense, the concepts of conflict,
cooperation and order become illuminated, since punishment resolves any
tension, or non-cooperation towards these ends. For Realists and
Liberals alike power and cooperation through coercion is the answer that
the prisoner's dilemma provides for IR. This is not simply present when
the law has been violated but has a foundational purpose in the
formation of political society informed by social contract traditions.
Despite the fact that Realists have selectively drawn on Hobbes for
theory building purposes, the state of nature metaphor has become
established in the field by the theoretical mainstream. Drawing from the
work of Peter Hulme and Ludmilla Jordanova, Beier (2002) points out that
social contract theorists relied on accounts from European travelogues
of the "New World" to formulate the ontological basis of their
theories--- namely their conceptions of the state of nature.27 Though
Locke's articulation of the state of nature differed from his
predecessor, both rested on many of the same racist and Eurocentric
ideas (Beier, 2002). If Hobbes has been a staple influence in the
discipline's mainstream theoretical debates, it is not to say other
conceptions of the state of nature 27 See for example, Farr (2008).
Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 44
have not come to bear. Acknowledging Hobbes' regard among Realists and
others alike should be read within a broader context of the discipline's
indebtedness to the foundational assumptions of social contractarian
thought and the Westphalean state system, as well as the ways even
critical approaches within the field take this foundational colonial and
racist violence for granted.28 Locke's ideas about the state of nature
may not have been as readily picked up by IR theorists; however, as
others have pointed out, Locke was involved in colonial missions himself
and his work has been shown to make arguments that provide much of the
intellectual groundwork that formed modern Liberal thought and that
would justify colonial conquest in the Americas (Tully, 1993; Arneil,
1996; Hsueh, 2006; Farr, 2008). Locke is also instructive here because,
though he shares with Hobbes a propensity in [drawing on [gendered and
racist interpretations of the "New World" and its
inhabitants,]{.mark}]{.underline} we can read his argument as a
political-economic one explicitly because of [the [centrality that
property takes in his theorizations]{.mark}.]{.underline} In their
naturalizing of contractarian theories of property, both Locke and
Hobbes' [claims about the state of nature also served to [diminish the
life ways of the Indigenous peoples]{.mark} of the Americas]{.underline}
(Nichols, 2005). In other words, social contract theory provided both
[the [justification for their]{.mark} indigenous [removal and the means
by which this could be accomplished]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In
his piece, The Colonialism of Incarceration, Nichols (2014) indirectly
follows 28 For example, this has become especially prevalent in the post
9/11 era where, in an attempt to draw attention to the profound
violation of civil, political and human rights, a large body of critical
scholarship reproduced the notion that extending rights makes it
possible for the liberal democratic state to regain its moral and just
status. This in effect serves to erase the violence at its foundations
and within ongoing practices and institutions. Ph.D. Thesis -- J.
Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 45 on this point to
argue that it is for this reason that Indigenous claims provide a
critique of practices of imprisonment that are based on a different
normative foundation than other over-incarcerated racialized populations
in the Americas. Despite the accuracy of the statement that critical
prison studies has "insufficiently attended to the centrality of
colonialism to the origins, scope, scale, and legitimation techniques of
carceral power in North America," he does not develop an analysis of
carceral power that takes account for its transnational dimensions and
therefore replicates its domestication within the bounds of the state.29
Thus, though he is able to take account for the role of imprisonment in
dispossession, through this framework we none the less lose access to a
way of understanding relationships between punishment and property as
ones that rest beyond territorialized sovereignty. This changes our
understanding of carcerality itself. An analysis of property without
acknowledging punishment presents a partial image of Locke's
theorizations and what we can infer from them about the way dominant
power became secured. For Locke (1980\[1690\], p. 19), anything that
occurs in nature could be possessed by adding one's labour to it for its
improvement: "Whatsoever then he removes out of the state of nature that
hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined
to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property." As
scholars have shown, Locke's notion of property---specifically the
conceptualizations of land and labour that it relies on---have a number
of deeply 29 This would in turn alter the distinctions he outlines in
his formulation of the critique that Indigenous peoples' claims provide
about carceral power, including whether it can be contained to the
notion of critique. Similarly, though Nichols' (2014) discussion
challenging the difference between the logic of war and social
pacification is helpful and a discussion to which I hope this project
contributes, we miss a chance to explore the role that capitalism plays
making a more nuanced theorization of violence and carcerality
necessary. Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political
Science 46 problematic implications for Black and Indigenous peoples
(Armitage, 2004). These assumptions include viewing slaves as property
(i.e. owned labour that could be used as a tool to accumulate property
for the owner), and Indigenous peoples as part of the state of nature
(since they were considered as having no government or recognizable way
of working and thus owning the land).30 This latter move was
particularly useful to Locke and his involvement in colonial settlement
in the Carolinas, since it produced both an economic and ethical
justification for English colonialism in the Americas, and land theft in
particular (Arniel, 1996).31 Locke highlights that land---the earth
itself---"is the chief matter of property" and makes clear the
superiority of European ways of working the land (i.e. agriculture,
cultivation, enclosure) and relating to the land (a hierarchical and
asymmetrical relationship in which white men own and control land,
labour and all that comes from it) (1980\[1690\], p. 21, emphasis
original). The fact [that [Indigenous peoples' lifeways were not
understood as meeting this criteria]{.mark} was utilized to provide the
intellectual [justifications for delegitimizing Indigenous claims to the
]{.mark}]{.underline}[land]{.mark} where they have resided since time
immemorial. [Informed by the doctrine of terra nullius]{.mark}, these
ideas contributed to the depiction of Indigenous lands vacant and empty,
or as Bonny Ibhawoh has put it, "that aboriginal land was in effect no
man's land and that by conquest and "improvement," European settlers
could make legitimate claims to them" (Ibhawoh, 30 Locke makes these
claims by both using Amerindians as examples to justify this theory of
property and diminish any indigenous claim to land through this
framework (Arneil, 1996). 31 Though the emphasis in this project is on
the Canadian context, at this moment in history the Carolinas were
embedded in the British imperial project. Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis
McMaster University -- Political Science 47 2013, p. 8; Weaver, 2003).32
Although enclosure has been documented as one of the primary tools of
extending colonialism in the Carolinas (Arneil, 2006), this would not be
possible without the first move of universalizing settler claims and
rationalizing settler possession via terra nullius and hierarchies of
value which ascribed European ways of relating to land as superior. 33
Though Locke's state of nature is less popular among orthodox IR, it is
necessary for understanding the economic rationality that is assumed by
them. For Locke, the state of nature not only provides the justification
for a more responsible or measured version of sovereignty in comparison
to Hobbes, but at its center is the necessity of a centralized authority
to uphold preconceived moral and political standards for the right to
punish and the right to property. It is made clear in his claims about
the state of nature that both are crucial in forming the foundations of
political society, yet this relationship seems to be sorely under
theorized.34 For Hobbes and Locke criminality is a major criteria of
assessing reasonableness because, as previously mentioned, those who
break the law are understood to do so because they do not possess the
capacity to reason.35 It is on these 32 Terra Nullius was a legal
doctrine whereby i[ndigenous lands were [constructed as unoccupied or
'empty space' as a means of facilitating European occupation]{.mark} and
theft]{.underline} (Ananya, 1996; Stewart-Harawira, 2005). Whereas terra
nullius was used in the case of colonization of North America as
justification for land theft, in the scramble for Africa it was used to
refer to whether a territory was occupied by other Europeans and
ultimately "served the role of international law in prescribing ways to
avoid conflict between rival European powers" (Ibhawoh, 2013, 6; Keal,
2002). I will discuss the specificity of terra nullius in the context of
Canada in Chapter 3. 33 For example, requiring Amerindians to erect
fences around their land and to provide land allotments and boundaries
to settlers (Arneil, 1996). 34 It is beyond the scope of this project to
fully theorize the relationship between punishment and property in
social contractarian thought. My intent is to point out this omission in
order to establish some of the intellectual foundations for the presence
and absence of prison, punishment and settler colonialism in the
discipline of IR. 35 In addition to the power relations previously
outlined, the connection that is established in social contractarian
thought between criminality and reason also maps on to ableist
discourses as well. Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster University --
Political Science 48 grounds that it becomes possible to identify when
the use of force is normalized as justifiable, acceptable, rational and
measured. In short, when the mundane use of violence by the state is
both made invisible and naturalized. [The ways in which Liberal
conceptions of punishment become secured through Locke's formulations of
political society are telling precisely because they, alongside
property, provide [justification for criminalization, slavery and
Indigenous erasure and land theft]{.mark} in the Americas]{.underline}.
If Indigenous life ways were made to be null and void and if the "New
World" was a blank space, then there was never any room or purpose for
Indigenous peoples and knowledge on the way to progress, according to
Locke. Without mixing one's land and labour in what resembled European
agriculture, proof of right would be difficult to establish (Arneil,
1996). Thus, this was part of the political and economic justification
for why Indigenous peoples of the Americas were argued not to own the
land on which they lived. In light of the under examined connections
between the naturalization of punishment alongside property in social
contractarian thought, it is instructive to consider how ideas of
private property (and the assumptions of land and labour on which they
rely) require enclosure, objectification and possession through the
control and/or criminalization of undesirable people and deviant ways of
life. Locke's theories about labour are equally important here, since
his writings indicate that not all human beings are afforded life in the
same ways. Since human beings could become property according to Locke,
his theories simultaneously produce an intellectual justification for
slavery alongside that of the land theft required for settler
colonialism. If criminality is determined based on the acceptability of
particular ways of being Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster University
-- Political Science 49 and relating to land and labour, and not only
when breaking the law, then the practice of criminalization is connected
to law, but not solely grounded in it.36 And given charges of
irrationality and inadequacy, we can also see how diffuse the idea of
"reasonableness" and "rationality" is. For Hobbes, Locke and other
social contract theorists criminality is a major criterion of assessing
reasonableness because those who break the law must be without critical
faculties to understand that they are challenging authority and "asking"
to be punished. It is on these grounds that the use of force is deemed
as required since those who are irrational cannot cooperate or respond
to dialogue. As such, force becomes justifiable, acceptable, and
naturalized. [The [IR orthodoxy has done very well to draw on the "state
of nature"]{.mark} and its corresponding assumptions as described by
Hobbes and Locke to make claims about the international state

to the development of the modern western state.]{.underline} The depth
with which these analogies and their suppositions permeate the
discipline is part of why they come to matter when reading the
Prisoner's Dilemma. [Examining their role in the intellectual and

a much longer lineage of utilizing assumptions about the necessity,
purpose and centrality of punishment by the privileged in the service of

The additional context reading Hobbes and Locke provide is to suggest
that questions of land and labour, through questions of colonialism and
imperialism, are in fact central to how violence, constraint and
coercion is constitutive the of the international system, and yet must
continually be hidden and erased. Reading Punishment and Criminalization
as Features of Settler Colonialism Instead of treating punishment as
secondary to other concepts like freedom, right and equality, Andrew
Dilts (2012, p. 60) asks what we can learn from Locke's Second Treatise
of Government from the point of view of the centrality of punishment? He
points out that it is especially the social contractarian cannon of
political philosophy that presumes "the seeming inevitability of
punishment" in order to ground and operationalize its conceptions of the
social contract and natural rights, since they "have no empirical
referent" (Dilts 2012, p. 58-59; McBride, 2007, p. 122). The usefulness
of punishment for Liberalism according to McBride lies in the way it
serves as an instrument "to establish itself as a political order"
(Dilts, 2012, p. 59). The logical purpose of punishment resides in being
able to produce criminality in contrast to innocence, and therefore its
power lies in its confounding and slippery qualities, so much so that
even those who seek to deal with this as a central feature of Locke
minimize the tensions it raises or attempt to resolve the contradictions
punishment presents (Dilts, 2012). [The utility of the question of
punishment for Locke is in the ways it comes to embody [the inherent
instability and unknowability of political life.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[This excess and instability is [displaced onto the criminal]{.mark} in
order [to make possible the production of stable subjects with the
ability to enter into the social contract]{.mark} on the grounds
established (Dilts, 2012). In other words, the production of stable
subjects is only possible [against those who are not: criminals, savages
and other degenerates.]{.mark} By making criminals, (Dilts primarily
discusses the figure of the thief), [to carry the "burden of danger and

with the label and identity of criminal, which simultaneously allows us
to know them by their past actions while controlling the uncertainly
imposed by the future threat they necessarily must embody. [This [threat
of unknowability]{.mark} and risk of theft and violence, [having the
potential to spiral out of control in the state of nature, is what
necessitates]{.mark} Locke's [foundational claim for the
commonwealth]{.mark}]{.underline}, since it is grounded only through
making the distinction between the State of Nature and State of War and
"the attempt to stabilize the unstable right to punish" (Dilts, 2012, p.
62). In this conceptualization of crime as the use of force and as
subjugation the thief is likened to tyrannical power and argued to
produce an existential threat to one's property and oneself
simultaneously. 37 [Whereas in the state of nature acts of crime may
easily veer into a state of war through reciprocal punishment and
slavery, within the commonwealth civil society is maintained when a
crime has ended since at that moment the use of force has ceased and it
becomes possible to categorize the offense and 37 [Tyranny is defined as
the use of force without right]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this sense, the
thief becomes indistinguishable from the murderer and crime is an act of
war within the state of nature (Dilts, 2012). Ph.D. Thesis -- J.
Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 52 determine
proportionality (Dilts, 2012). Society therefore becomes restored in the
just use of force in the form of punishment. Slavery is intimately tied
to Locke's logic and rationality of punishment as a liberty of the
transgressed, since a transgressor may remain under their master's power
indefinitely.[38 [The slave,]{.mark} according to Locke, was someone who
[was "biologically alive" but without the "rights and powers" of
humanity]{.mark}]{.underline} (Norris 2005, as referenced in Dilts,
2012). This echoes Rousseau's own crude articulation: "In taking an
equivalent of his life, the victor did not spare it: instead of killing
him unprofitably, he killed him usefully" (Rousseau as quoted in Dilts,
2012, p. 67). Indeed, for Locke[, [the unstable position of punishment
and slavery within the State of Nature provide the drive for civil
society]{.mark}.]{.underline} Here it is worthwhile to note that it is
in this context of having no resolution to justified punishment and
slavery that a government must exist to restrain the right to punish
criminals and identify aggressors in exchange for protecting one's life,
liberty and property: "\[t\]his is done by producing the criminal as
necessarily beyond reason, as animalistic and dangerous, and
constitutively defining the obedient subject as rational, innocent, and,
above all, free" (Dilts, 2012, p. 72). Thus, the Lockean project was
already about the production of subjects devised to determine who is a
rational actor by nature, 38 Dilts argues that, Proportional punishment,
on these terms, has no boundaries, and generates the disorder and chaos
that characterizes the State of Nature. While the possibility of crime
might make the State of Nature unstable and dangerous, the practice of
punishment makes it unacceptable. As suggested by Farr, Locke's argument
in favour of slavery follows a "just war" tradition emphasizing action
(2008) and in this sense differs from naturalistic accounts (1980).
Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 53
but also through the foundational act of punishment.39 This
determination marks out the conditions of inclusion for both bodies and
land. The rational actor is the only fully human figure in Locke's
framework. The slave and property-owning white man's innocence is
secured at a rate higher than all else in this account and by virtue of
criminalizing deviants. Therefore, the work of punishment is that the
criminal must not just be managed in light of their actions, but for a
way of being (Dilts, 2012). It is exactly this 'way of being' that makes
space to consider how [[the identity of the criminal maps on to the
other identities that become vilified]{.mark} through claims to
rationality which racial, gendered, classed, sexualized and colonial
hierarchies have already been established in relation to. These figures
are either [incapable]{.mark} (i.e. deficient) [or uncooperative]{.mark}
(i.e. unwilling) [to enter into the social contract on the terms set
out]{.mark}, and [therefore must be coercively included through
performing distinct roles]{.mark} that are constructed to legitimate its
existence: [the slave, the Indian, the criminal]{.mark}, and so
on.]{.underline} What this demonstrates is that it is also the
substantive difference in the claims to land and labour other ways of
being suggest [that [threatens the legitimacy of the
contract.]{.mark}]{.underline} But beyond thinking about this as
exclusion from the social contract, criminalization presents the means
by which both labour and land, (property in addition to territory), are
required through methods of coercion and extraction to make the
capitalist settler state possible. Recalling Audra Simpson's (2017, p.
20) words at the outset of this chapter: 39 This included, "Lunaticks
and Ideots," children, "Innocents," "Madmen" etc. Criminals are also
referred to as "wild Savage Beasts"---as animals, which places them in
the state of nature and with others who never leave nature (Locke,
1980\[1690\], p. 34). On this point, we can begin to contextualize the
relationship between criminality, madness and ableism, and how it
overlaps with other relations of power through claims to rationality.
Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science 54
"For Native people, this ruse of consent marks the inherent
impossibility of that freedom after dispossession, a freedom I argue is
actually theft." Simpson exposes how claims Indigenous people are free
through inclusion are impossible and untrue, because of the theft of
Indigenous bodies and lands on which the settler state rests. Thus, the
social contract is made possible by legalized theft, (and the continued
erasure of that theft), both at its founding and in perpetuity---though
it can never be acknowledged as such---at the same time that punishment
provides the mechanism by which claims that challenge any such reality
as legitimacy become criminalized, managed and contained through the
explicit use of force. Colonial Carceral Erasures This reading
highlights that Realist and Liberal uses of the Prisoner's Dilemma
through claims to universalism and rationality actually serve to make
invisible the role and function of the prison and prisoner within IR.
Constructivists, like Marks, may be able to question how these
institutions and subjectivities produce the international, but they do
not offer a way to interrogate the prison and prisoner as providing the
material requirements of land and labour that has driven and continues
to compel imperial and colonial expansion in the current moment.
Critical scholars in IR, though directing attention to imprisonment and
carceral space, often do so in a limited way that often reproduces this
same erasure of land and/or labour in varying capacities.40 In order to
avoid this in this project I strive to take account for the role of the
prison and prisoner, 40 I will elaborate on this discussion in Chapter
2. Ph.D. Thesis -- J. Jurgutis McMaster University -- Political Science
55 and [thus a reading of [carcerality and criminalization]{.mark}, at
an imperial juncture that [rests on the widespread theft of bodies and
labour through the transatlantic slave trade and external forms of
colonization]{.mark}, at the same time that it birthed forms of settler
colonialism that require the theft of land that continue today in ways
that cannot be captured in an extractive model.]{.underline} [Doing so
requires a refusal to take the prison and prisoner as a political
economic institution, form of subjectivity, set of practices, and logics
for granted, and aims instead to make more explicit its role in
sustaining global inequities and hierarchies advanced through
colonialism, capitalism, and militarization]{.underline}. The ways the
power relations of the prison are eclipsed in IR gives us a great deal
of insight into how the power relations of settler colonialism are
elided as well. The use of force is not only present during the act of
punishing the prisoner, as the Prisoner's Dilemma seems to imply. Here
we can recall that the prisoner who does not cooperate or act within the
terms set out for them receives the harshest punishment in the form of a
ten-year sentence. Social contract theory gives us insight into the ways
claims to universalism and rationality undergird cooperation through
legitimate coercion, while providing the grounding necessary to disavow
the use of force and non-consensual forms of inclusion. These claims
also ensure that the making of criminal subjectivity is informed by
racialized, gendered, sexualized and classed hierarchies of power. [This
means that [contrary to the story the Prisoner's dilemma supplies for
IR, punishment and the use of force are not exceptional actions
introduced periodically or where necessary in order to diminish
violence. Rather,]{.mark} [violence in the form of the theft of bodies
and lands are necessary for the myth of sovereignty, global capitalism,
and the making states within the international system
itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, you cannot steal people's bodies,
labour and land without carcerality. But because the [[imperial and
colonial power relations must necessarily seize bodies and land as
property or as targets of elimination]{.mark},]{.underline} these
erasures are in fact (settler) colonial ones which are continually
evidenced in the ways carceral institutions are required to manage the
relationships between bodies and land.41 Examining the political
philosophical foundations of imprisonment in social contractarian
thought shows how practices of punishment and criminalization become a
method of erasing and "resolving" social conflict within 'the
international,' as well as settler state contexts. In doing so land,
labour, criminalization and punishment are mutually constituted in ways
that link the prison and prisoner as central to an imperial and colonial
project. By establishing the foundations of IR's ontological investment
in prison and punishment as a method of resolving conflict we can more
easily access assumptions about whose security, well-being and life ways
are secured through innocence and whose ways of being must be
criminalized. We have reason to interrogate the unquestioned status of
the prison and prisoner as a central institution and figure in IR, as
well as the roles they play in society and in our lives. Indeed, the
very presence of the prison, its foundational assumptions, and status as
an uncontested and under examined institution in IR can be understood as
ones to ensure conditions of the international system continue to be
founded on colonial violence and maintained though forceful constraint
in the contemporary moment. Settler states continue to rely on the
production of criminality and carceral space in order to redefine and
reorganize relationships between bodies and lands. These ongoing
histories are ones that must be historicized in place in order to fully
unpack the lineage of settler state and capitalist expansion in ways
that illuminate how carceral logics, imprisonment and the production of
carceral space developed as a settler colonial governance strategy on
Turtle Island. In the end, the Prisoner's Dilemma can tell us very
little about prison and prisoners as an everyday occurrence in IR. It
can tell us little about how and why so many poor and racialized people
are killed or in an increasingly privatized and expanding global prison
system, or why it is predominately poor and racialized women who are
increasingly criminalized or at the very least made to bear the entire
burden of work and grief when their loved ones are. Prisoners cannot be
conceived as citizens and workers, or even on their own terms and both
the land on which prisons are built and the ways in which bodies, labour
and resources are organized in order to re-constitute power and
accumulate wealth and profit can be linked to ongoing settler colonial
projects within political systems that still embody assimilationist,
genocidal and master-slave narratives, even if not explicitly. Asking
questions of the prison and prisoner in this way is central to moving
towards a transnational and decolonial feminist engagement with
questions of imprisonment and carceral space, which is the subject I
turn to in Chapter 2. There I will draw on feminist interventions in
global politics and IR to further theorize the relationship between
land, labour and criminalization for the purpose of working towards a
reading of imprisonment and carceral space that relies on ongoing
colonial violence.

[Defining 'normality' and 'abnormality']{.underline} The first step in
interrogating white male privilege is to illuminate white maleness. This
may seem obvious, but most white males do not actively think of
themselves in those terms. White males tend to think of themselves as
just people. [The [dominant]{.mark} racial and gender [discourses in
Western societies tend to powerfully bind whiteness]{.mark} and
masculinity [to]{.mark} assumed claims of [realness]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Halberstam 2002: 353). For example, in his work on whiteness, Richard
Dyer (1997) begins by examining how white people are imagined within
white cultural production. He argues that while other people are raced,
white people are self-represented as being just people. 'This
[[assumption that white people are just people]{.mark}, which [is not
far off saying that whites]{.mark} [are people whereas other colours are
something else,]{.mark} is endemic to white culture']{.underline}
(ibid.: 2). The often unreflective claim to be just a person is an
attempt to define the bounds of normality. Such self-representations are
both a manifestation of power and an assertion to power. As Dyer notes,
'there is no more powerful position than that of being "just" human. The
claim to power is the claim to speak for the commonality of humanity.
Raced people can't do that -- they can only speak for their race'
(ibid.: 2). Often unreflectively, white males simultaneously seek to
define what is normal and speak for humanity. Admittedly, this is not a
particularly novel insight. Simone de Beauvoir observed in The Second
Sex: 'Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of
men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse
with absolute truth' (1952: 161). This obliviousness to gender and, I
would argue, race is achieved because white males often assume that
whiteness and maleness have little meaning. To refer back to Bourdieu,
the social capital white males enjoy given their race and gender is
largely invisible. As Harlon Dalton claims, such a disposition is
largely 'the natural consequence of being in the driver's seat' (Dalton
1995: 109). But this invisibility does not mean there is a failure to
discuss white males as subjects. Most of the time white males speak
about nothing else. Because white males frame the conversation in terms
of people in general, however, they are everywhere in representation but
rarely recognized as such (Dyer 1997: 3). This is a convergence of the
simultaneous privileges of race and gender. Whites, in general, and
males, in particular, often fail to recognize their own subject
positions while seeking to represent all of humanity. At its root, this
particular manifestation of white male privilege is about the power to
define and lay claim to normality. The normal is the product of
discursive practices, and the discourses defining normal in world
politics privilege the white male subject position as the human one.
[[Within]{.mark} the academic discipline and practice of [IR]{.mark},
one can see [a lengthy tradition of North American and western European
white males writing about world politics from their own subjective
position]{.mark}]{.underline}. Interrogating white male privilege 53 In
doing so, they are both [drawing from [the dominant discourses from
which they are privileged]{.mark} and also actively [reproducing and
entrenching those discourses]{.mark} through their habitus.]{.underline}
That is, they are both products of discursive systems and active agents
in the maintenance of those systems. To take but one simple example,
[much of IR theory relies on [assumptions about human
nature]{.mark}.]{.underline} These assumptions about human nature are
manifested in myriad ways: [from [the myth of the stag hunt to various
imagined state-of-nature scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}. But in
virtually all these cases, the actors are [[expressions of idealized
white male subject positions.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Introducing [race,
gender or class]{.mark} into the mythical stag hunt narrative, for
example, [produces a much more complicated and open story and, as such,
a more varied discussion of human nature]{.mark}]{.underline}. Feminist
theorists working within the IR discipline have done an excellent job of
exposing the privileged yet hidden male subject positions in traditional
IR texts. For example, J. Ann Tickner's engagement with Hans J.
Morgenthau's Six Principles of Political Realism is an excellent study
in how one IR theorist wrote from within a specific narrow
structural/linguistic frame of masculinity, while claiming to generalize
out to all people and humanity. As Tickner pointed out, the list of six
principles 'is a partial description of international politics because
it is based on assumptions about human nature that are partial and that
privilege masculinity' (1988: 433). In some ways, the target is too
easy, since Realists are so explicit in their claims to objectivity and
universalism. There is a lack of self-awareness, since given the
assumption that they are just people they can generalize from their own
historical experiences and cultural values that are internalized and
unquestioned. Thus, Realists like Morgenthau can claim to speak of and
for people and humanity while other interpretations are
characterized/categorized as being gendered, racialized, cultured and/or
classed. This is not an exclusive characteristic of Realism but is
representative of most IR theories in general, since Tickner's tactic
could be reproduced in countless white male theorists, from Kant to
Keohane, Machiavelli to Marx.3 The normalizing discourses of whiteness
and masculinity have enabled definitions and concepts that privileged
this narrow segment of the world's population to become accepted as the
norm within IR theory and practice, such as power, the state, civil
society, security, and so forth. These concepts are placed at the centre
of our intellectual project, which often means that females and
non-whites must employ them if they are to be taken as serious IR
scholars. Moreover, the meanings and Two 54 normative values attached to
these concepts are discursively bound to and typically nurture the needs
and interests of the privileged white male subject position and dominant
norms of masculinity. While this clearly has important implications for
the construction of theory, it also has significant methodological
repercussions. That is, white male privilege is not only embedded in our
structures of knowledge, it also delineates acceptable systems of
inquiry (Ackerly et al. 2006; Cohn 1987). Stephanie Wildman and Adrienne
Davis observe, 'The characteristics and attributes of those who are
privileged group members are described as societal norms -- as the way
things are and as what is normal in society. This normalization of
privilege means that members of society are judged, and succeed or fail,
measured against the characteristics that are held by the privileged.
The privileged characteristic is the norm; those who stand outside are
the aberrant or "alternative"' (1996: 14). This is extremely relevant
for IR theory, particularly in its normative manifestations. For that
reason, let me offer a few examples. Given the privileging of white male
subject positions in the dominant discourses (doxa), the habitus
generated by many IR theorists, who are predominantly white males, tend
to create a system of dispositions positing their historical experiences
and cultural values as the norm for the international community. As
such, an idealized image of the Westphalian state serves as the norm.
This is clearly articulated in the vast literature on state failure and
state capacity. Taking an idealized North American/ western European
state as the norm, much ink has been spilled about how and why many
non-white experiences with the state are aberrant. Rarely does this
literature engage in critical self-reflection, exploring how the assumed
norm is the product of subjective experiences, values and imaginations.
Thus, we are presented with a towering mass of work on failed or failing
African states, for instance, but rarely is the assumed norm troubled or
its racial and gender underpinnings exposed (Dunn 2001).4 In its most
pronounced manifestations, this body of literature contains dangerous
policy prescriptions. Often policies are constructed to make the
non-white, non-male other more like us -- for their own good. As Peggy
McIntosh has observed, 'whites are taught to think of their lives as
morally neutral, normative, average, and ideal; thus, when we work to
benefit others, it is seen as work which will allow "them" to be more
like "us"' (2005: 110; see also Eng and Kazanjiian 2002). Of course, it
would be a mistake to assume it is always the goal to make others like
us. A good deal Interrogating white male privilege 55 of energy has
historically gone into the project of constructing and violently
policing the boundaries between us and the deviants who challenge
accepted understandings and practices of whiteness and masculinity. For
example, during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the racist
and sexist discourses operating in western Europe engendered acts of
colonial conquest and domination (McClintock 1995; Lindqvist 1992).
Today, in its liberal humanitarian articulation, constructions of
alterity have contributed to violent interventionist wars in Iraq and
the Balkans. Informing these policies is a manifestation of white male
privilege: white North American and western European male IR scholars
and practitioners claiming to speak for all humanity because they
believe their race- and gender-informed experiences and values are the
norm. One can see this pattern repeated throughout mainstream IR
theory[. [Democratic Peace Theory is firmly constructed on an artifice
produced by race-,]{.mark} [gender- and class-informed subject
positions]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Ido Oren (2002) argues in Our Enemies
and US, American political science in general, and the scholars
advancing the idea of democratic peace in particular, are [informed by
the [dominant discourses]{.mark} in which their own subject positions
[are privileged]{.mark};]{.underline} in the case of Democratic Peace
Theory, this has [r[esulted in a fluid and historically contingent
understanding of democracy shaped by America's experience and its
historical rivalries.]{.underline}]{.mark} The gap in Oren's otherwise
damning critique is his failure to adequately expose the racial and
gender components so clearly present in the political science
scholarship he investigates. The development sub-field of IR is also
representative of how scholars operate under the assumption that their
subject position is the norm and that they can speak for all humanity.
One can see this within the modernization school, with its explicit
attempts to make the non-white world more like the white one. But it is
equally true for the neoliberal approaches to development, with their
subjective agendas obscured behind claims of universalism. While
neoliberalism is in principle gender and race neutral, R. W. Connell
notes there has been a 'sharp remasculinization \[and racialization\] of
political rhetoric and a turn to the use of force as a primary
instrument in policy' (2005: 1815--16). Neoliberalism functions as a
form of masculinity politics, and '\[m\]any mainstream policies (e.g.,
in economic and security affairs) are substantially about men without
acknowledging this fact' (ibid.: 1816). What is at play here is not
merely the ability of white males to define the parameters of normality,
but also the inability of white male IR theorists to deal with the
problems that arise in the way they construct difference. Two 56 Naeem
Inayatullah and David Blaney eloquently explore what they see as Western
culture's ongoing inability to deal with cultural difference in their
International Relations and the Problem of Difference (2004). Drawing on
the work of Tzvetan Todorov (1984), Inayatullah and Blaney claim that,
since the discovery of the Americas, Western culture has engaged the
other through a double movement: 'difference becomes inferiority, and
the possibility of a common humanity requires assimilation' (2004: 10).
In the first move, difference is regarded as the complete absence of
commonality, which opens up the possibility of conquest, enslavement and
eradication. The second move recognizes commonality, but only as a
precursor to assimilation. The possibility of recognizing the other as
both the same and different has yet to be realized. Inayatullah and
Blaney chart this inability to deal with cultural difference through the
foundational texts of IR to the neo-modernization approaches of
contemporary IR, most notably in the literatures on liberal peace
theory, global civil society and pluralistic global community (ibid.:
1116--21). The protagonist in Inayatullah and Blaney's narrative is
Western IR, but I would suggest the that fact that all the theorists
they cite are white males is not immaterial.5 While I wholeheartedly
agree with their critique, I would suggest that putting a finer point on
Western IR's inability to deal with cultural difference is both a
manifestation of white male privilege and a mechanism for obscuring and
maintaining that privilege. Inayatullah and Blaney's discussion of the
problem of difference and the double movement of conquest/assimilation
brings to mind Herman Melville's classic novella Benito Cereno. The
protagonist is an American male captain who stumbles on to a ship that,
initially unbeknownst to the American, has been taken over by the slaves
it was transporting for trade. The story unfolds as the captain
gradually sees the blacks he initially sees as docile and inferior
childlike creatures who inspire both his pity and a desire to uplift
become, in his eyes, bloodthirsty murderers and crazed killers. As Toni
Morrison (1997) has pointed out, it is precisely this transformation of
slaves from simple, friendly and childlike creatures deserving our help
and sympathy into irrational violent monsters which displays the full
spectrum of the racist gaze. The first impulse is one of assimilation
(like contemporary neo-modernization IR theories), while the second is
one of conquest and eradication, like traditional colonially informed
understandings of power politics. Both positions deny the possibility of
strategic, rational, calculated and intelligent action by those believed
to be different from us. Melville's narrator Interrogating white male
privilege 57 is blind to his racism because it flows from his habitus,
just as with most scholars. Like Melville's narrator, white male
scholars fail to see that the structures of power, in terms of both the
structuring structures and the structuration of practices highlighted by
Bourdieu, leave them in a position of privilege, from which they define
what is normal and judge others who fail to meet that norm.

### L----Water

#### The affirmative is a hydrocolonial project that projects desires of dominance onto water.

Hofmeyr 17\[Isabel Hofmeyr is a Ph.D, 1992, University of the
Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, "ACLA FORUM: OCEANIC ROUTES

Literature, <https://doi.org/10.1215/00104124-3794549>\]

Another register in which to cast these themes, and indeed to think
across them, is the neologism **["hydro-colonial."]{.underline}** The
possible meanings of the term could include (1) **[colonization by means
of water (various forms of maritime imperialism); (2) colonization of
water (occupation of land with water resources, the declaration of
territorial waters, the militarization and geopoliticization of oceans);
and (3) a colony on water (the ship as a miniature colony or a penal
island).6 If modulated to "hydro-imperialism," the neologism could point
to the relation of the naming and labeling of oceans to maritime
empires.]{.underline}** In all of these usages, the preix hydro points
to a material (or hydro-material) turn in recent Oceanic Studies that
grapples with the seaness of the sea. The suixes --- whether colonial or
imperialism --- signal an ainity with postcolonialism so crucial to the
Southern regions we engage, while both terms in their entirety declare
an intention to shift the intellectual center of gravity away from a
purely land-focused one. The provocations collected in this forum
straddle these "oceanic" and "routes" themes while exploring
hydro-colonial poetics. The paper by Ashley Cohen takes an
eighteenth-century transoceanic perspective that sutures the Atlantic
and Indian Oceans, two arenas normally kept apart (the irst versus the
second British empire; the plantation economy versus trade and commerce;
the realm of "race" versus that of "caste"; Christian versus Muslim;
West versus East). Instead, as she shows, these [theaters were imagined
as a continuous imperial sphere of the Global Indies: "everything east
of Europe . . . the East Indies and everything west of Africa . . . the
West Indies." This worldview, "in which India and the Americas are
consistently thought together,"]{.underline} produced literary igures,
itineraries, and tropes that are unrecognizable today: slaves who could
be both African and Indian, the "black poor" made up of both Asian
lascars and destitute Africans in London. Cohen demonstrates the new
alignments that come into view by [factoring in oceans and oceanic
regions, showing how tracing the routes immanent in literary texts and
cultural artifacts can lead us to uncover historical "meta-geographies"
that both structure conceptions of the world and help bring these worlds
into being.]{.underline} Meg Samuelson begins a move from routes towards
the ocean itself, arguing for littoral literature, coastal form, and an
amphibian aesthetic. Her focus is on two writers concerned with the
South-East African Indian Ocean coast: Mia Couto from Mozambique and
Abdulrazak Gurnah, a British-Zanzibari writer. Both writers develop a
[hydro-poetics of the coast that unsettles the binaries of colonial and
postcolonial rule. They do this by relecting thematically and formally a
shifting "ecotone" of a shore --- depicting it not as simply a meeting
point of sea and land but as a site for an eddying of cultures and a
complex more-than-human environment in its own right.]{.underline} The
view from the littoral, Samuelson proposes, "levers open continental
categories" and ofers new models for world literature. [Pushing against
an entrenched colonial mapping of the oceans and its cultural legacies
in supposedly postcolonial times, and bringing us into the ocean through
the languages and epistemologies of island peoples living there, Alice
Te Punga Somerville takes a radical Oceania perspective to raise
far-reaching questions about what we and others have described as an
originally Atlantic Studies-based oceanic turn in literary scholarship,
as well as the nature of Oceanic Studies in general. Our existing
oceanic labels (in this case "the Paciic") are imperially imposed,
turning vast bodies of waters into blank and abstract spaces, a mode of
imperial cartography that promotes the association of "land with
presence, water with absence."]{.underline} From the perspective of
Oceania's deep [Indigenous presence, she suggests that there is no need
for a "'turn to the sea' . . . because we were already there."
Hydro-poetically, this long-standing Indigenous engagement with the sea
produces a series of forms and sensibilities that Te Punga Somerville
tracks, arguing that engagement with this (here, largely Māori) writing
is crucial to a "decolonial" Oceanic Studies.]{.underline}

materiality of the sea to emerge as an agential force while
simultaneously buoying postcolonial and Indigenous perspectives to the
surface.**]{.underline} Read in this light, 3/11 literature takes on a
global significance. In addition to lamenting the staggering loss of
life, the novels and poems produced postFukushima view the
nuclearization of the [Pacific as a continuation of Japanese and
American colonization.]{.underline} These texts show how [governmental
oversight and failure to proactively respond to climate
change]{.underline}--related disaster resulted in environmental
injustice---where the fallout of 3/11 had specific consequences for poor
Japanese and Japanese women, whose [bodies have been metaphorically and
literally altered.]{.underline} This [essay navigates these
hydro-colonial channels while placing them within the broader backdrops
of material ecocriticism and globalization studies.4]{.underline} I
begin by forging connections between hydro-colonial nuclearization and
global racial capitalism as depicted in Ruth Ozeki's A Tale for the Time
Being (2013), which has emerged as the preeminent "American" novel in
response to 3/11.5 For Ozeki, both [racist and deracializing aspects of
hydrocolonialism are mitigated through entanglements with nonhuman
animals and objects.]{.underline} I establish this theoretical
groundwork before examining poems from Roripaugh's 2019 collection
Tsunami vs. The Fukushima 50, demonstrating how imagery of irradiation
and toxicity present a posthuman response to the 3/11 disaster, global
hydro-colonialism, and the ongoing climate crisis. Colonial Catfish:
Folkloric Rectifications to Hydro-Colonialism in Ruth Ozeki's A Tale for
the Time Being Ozeki's A Tale for the Time Being begins when Ruth, a
novelist living on the coast of British Columbia, discovers a Japanese
lunch box washed ashore, carried across the Pacific by the drift of
oceanic gyres. Inside the box rests the diary of Naoko Yasutani, a
Japanese schoolgirl living in Tokyo. Ozeki's narrative leaps between
these dual protagonists, crossing expanses of space and time in the
process.6 As Ruth reads the journal, more of Nao's story is revealed:
how she set out to write the life story of her great-grandmother Jiko, a
Buddhist nun, but was distracted by rampant bullying at school and her
father's depression and suicidal ideation. Meanwhile, the act of reading
Nao's journal raises questions for Ruth about the nature of writing,
memory, and time. These dual narratives take place before and after the
Tohoku earthquake with the disaster serving as a nondiegetic event that
occurs outside the time of the novel, yet the disaster haunts the lives
of both Ruth and Nao. For Ruth, the act of reading Nao's diary is an act
of recovery, in which she is able to bring both narratives to a
satisfying resolution even as the aftermath of the 3/11 disaster is
ongoing with some bodies never discovered and the long-term effects of
the fallout remaining to be seen. Recent years have seen a number of
analyses of the novel through the critical lenses of Asian American
literature, Pacific Rim scholarship, and transpacific discourse. In
Ocean Passages, [Erin Suzuki describes how "transpacific" has become
shorthand for studies of Asian and Asian American diaspora while the
broad geographical swath cut by Pacific Rim studies can enact the same
homogenizing of Indigenous persons and those from smaller Pacific
islands of which the term "Asian American" itself is
emblematic.]{.underline} Suzuki praises Ozeki for rendering the [Pacific
Ocean as a site of "submerged and belated histories that have been
ignored or occluded by the capital-driven structures of contemporary
transpacific politics, economy and policy" (2021, 1).]{.underline} This
reading coalesces with Michelle Huang's (2017), which focuses on Ozeki's
depiction of the 80,000 tons of floating plastic called the Great
Pacific garbage patch, which lies at the center of the very gyres that
prompt the transpacific journey of Nao's diary.7 In imbricating
environmental devastation, cult[ural erasure, a disproportionate impact
upon raced bodies, and capitalist extraction, these existing readings of
A Tale for the Time Being underscore the human and material costs of
globalization]{.underline}. However, they do not explicitly address 3/11
or the symbolism of irradiation as **[a hydrocolonial
by-product.8]{.underline}**

## ALTS

#### Thus we endorse diversality -- an orientation that recognizes the hybridity of alternative epistemologies that focuses on building mutual connections to build new forms of international relations centered around recognition and not dominance

So far, [I have focused on politicizing binaries and exposing the
colonial wound]{.underline}. [This is an important step but it imagines
the debate to take place in terms of the colonizer and colonized; **what
is missing is an appreciation of mixed-ness or mestizaje, a social fact
which is integral to theorizing the coloniality of power in the
Americas**]{.underline}. **[Here, we return to the colonial difference
but emphasize the lived experiences of ''transculturation'' and ''border
thinking.'']{.underline}** Particularly in Latin America, the colonial
wound has generated significant indigenous organizations right across
the region, which assert their dignity and political capacity
(Maldonado-Torres 2007; Quijano 2008). In doing so, they reveal the
existence of the ''colonial difference,'' marking it as a space of
political contestation, but this disjucture is not experienced in the
same way by the colonizer and the colonized. [While the colonizer,
installed in a dominant position, views it as a gap of miscomprehension
and disdain, which ''he'' is not obliged to cross,]{.underline} [the
colonized must operate in a world dominated by Occidental institutions,
languages, and rationales]{.underline} (Mignolo 2000: 64--84). **[The
colonized must incessantly negotiate the colonial difference and
reconcile the demands of a colonized reality with cultural meanings
embedded in an indigenous worldview.]{.underline}** [Politicizing this
mestizaje is key to decolonial politics]{.underline}, and Gloria
Anzaldu´a's notion of ''border thinking,'' a Latin American response to
hybridity, offers significant insights (Mignolo 2000: 49--90; Anzaldu´a
2007). Anzaldu´a's vision of hybridity is rooted not in the intricacies
of intellectual debate or psychoanalysis but draws on her real-life
experiences of living between the labels which attach to the binaries so
essential to Occidental thinking. Anzaldu´a grew up and lived on the
US--Mexico border: she was a Chicana feminist daughter of
share-croppers, a Marxist indı´gena mestiza and seventh generation
lesbian citizen of the United States (Keating 2009: 1--15). Living at
the intersection of so many boundaries (geographical, sexual, political,
linguistic, racial) did not leave her feeling incomplete or dismembered,
though; her response was to say: ''They would chop me up into little
fragments and tag each piece with a label. You say my name is
ambivalence?\... Who me, confused? Ambivalent? Not so. Only your labels
split me'' (Anzaldu´a 1984; quoted in Keating 2009: 17). By asserting
her completeness, she demonstrates the fallacy of the labels. Anzaldu´a
borrowed a Nahuatl word to express the space that she inhabited between
these tagged categories: nepantla or (roughly) the place at the broken
edges. She explained the technique of border thinking in one poem:
''Because I, a mestiza, continually walk out of one culture, and into
another, because I am in all cultures at the same time, alma entre dos
mundos, tres, cuatro,\...'' (Anzaldu´a 2007: 99) This vision of human
agency derived from inhabiting border lands serves to disempower the
idea of the border as a stopping point controlled by the state. That the
state which she traversed in real life was the US--Mexico border only
heightens the powerfulness of her critique and the subversive potential
of her work for both IR and the Americas. [Equally important, though, is
the concept of transculturation, which indicates that processes of
hybridity have not only shaped the lives of subaltern groups, but have
also conditioned Whiteness and the Western epistemological project in
(Latin) American society]{.underline} (Pratt 2008). The concept of
transculturation was devised by Cuban anthropologist Fernando Ortı´z in
1940 to understand how Cuban society was constituted. [He focused on the
relationship between slaves and slave owners, understanding that both
had shifted from their native soil and that each was intimately
influenced by the cultural heritage of the other and the experience of
colonialism]{.underline}: [''Each immigrant was uprooted from his native
land in a double movement of adjustment and readjustment, of
deculturation or exculturation and of acculturation or inculturation,
and ultimately transculturation'']{.underline} (Ortı´z 1940: 255,
italics in original, my translation). He was clear that this
relationship of mutual influence was not equal or power-free----how
could it be----but asserted that both the African and the European
communities were full cultural agents, even though they were locked into
a brutal and exploitative relationship (Millington 2007). By imagining
cultural exchange to be a two-way street (albeit on a steep hill),
[Ortı´z highlights hybridity as a social experience of both the
subaltern and the dominant. He urges us to consider transculturation as
part and parcel of society-making, nation-building projects, and look
beyond domination and appropriation to ask how Native American thinking,
experiences, and practices have molded ''the USA'' as a global
actor.]{.underline} **[Following this thinking, resistance to the
coloniality of power therefore involves not only fighting against the
colonizing logic, but also seeking to shake that logic from within by
revealing the hybridity and diversity within what seems to be a unified
and settled settler society.]{.underline}** Border thinking, then, might
elicit insights not only at the ''periphery'' or border but also at the
''core'' of global power, if we are willing to destabilize its
[foundations. A useful strategy which might help to unsettle ''core''
thinking has been proposed by Martinican Edouard Glissant in his Poetics
of Relation]{.underline} (1997). [He sets out an intellectual politics
of diversality]{.underline} (rather than universality) inspired by
Caribbean Creole consciousness**[. Diversality takes the idea of
transculturation a step further by theorizing cultural interchange as
not only a social fact but also a political strategy]{.underline}**.
Diversality assumes the existence of profound difference, but Glissant
argues that ''thought of the Other is sterile without the other of
Thought'' (1997: 154); that is, **[merely accepting that differences
exist is not enough to generate deep change in our thinking. Rather, he
calls for an ''aesthetics of turbulence,'' which breaks assumptions and
allows one's thoughts to be ''prised open'' in order to develop new
imaginaries and fresh linkages between peoples]{.underline}**. The
''other of Thought'' is thus created by confluences in which ''each is
changed by and changes the other'' (1997: 154--5). **[Diversality
involves not only being prepared to recognize difference on an equal
footing but also a willingness to open one's thoughts to ''turbulence''
which will destroy assumptions and rebuild hybrid modes of thinking in
its wake.]{.underline}** The Americas occupies a privileged role in this
theorizing because, as Anzaldu´a, Ortı´z, and Glissant assert, social
(and sexual) mixing is not a ''new'' process but rather it is deeply
embedded in the Americas----in 500 years of colonial encounter and its
resulting hybrid identities. **[A ''mestizo Americas'' approach could
therefore play a crucial role in developing decolonial political
struggle, not only by denouncing the injustice of colonialism but by
prising open, shifting, and hybridizing conventional ways of
understanding international relationships----and International
Relations.]{.underline}** The issue of how this might occur requires
more time and space to explore, but I begin a discussion here by
identifying three questions that a decolonial politics might ask of IR.
1[. What other ways are there to understand the world? (And how might
this influence our thinking about the international?) This question
invites IR to acknowledge diversality. It assumes the completeness,
complexity, and sophistication of non-western ontologies and
epistemologies in a move which should be humbling**. It opens up our
minds to new ways of imagining human existence;**]{.underline} to
imagine time as being circular (King 1993), **[or that land does not
belong to people but people to the land]{.underline}** (Silko 2006), or
that boundaries are delineated by walking ⁄ presence (Larsen 2006), or
that the world is configured not through dualities but threes (Kusch
2010), or that colonialism is an illness (Momaday 1989; Burman 2009).
This work has already started; [Marshall Beier's incisive critique of
conventional IR conveys the immensities of the colonial difference in
his discussion of Lakota life-ways which he contrasts to the
''hegemonologue'' of mainstream IR]{.underline} (2005**[). These
differences might influence understandings of the international, not so
much by adding new ideas but by destabilizing our mode of
thinking----our aesthetics of thought,]{.underline}** as Glissant might
suggest. Encountering fundamental disjunctures of human experience
should convey a sensation of difference experienced as a visceral
confusion and disorientation. **[A decolonial IR project must, then, be
prepared to approach non-occidental worldviews with a mind that is
willing to be made uncomfortable, that is ready not to comprehend, and
that is prepared to feel out of control]{.underline}**. This is not just
an exercise in submission though, because [we can use the sensation of
disorientation to heighten our awareness of the Occidental project and
the contemporary coloniality of power. It helps us to map out the narrow
limits of the Western imaginary and to perceive its contours, its regime
of knowledge, and worldview more profoundly**. An awareness of
diversality shows the limits and fallacies of universal thinking, and by
unsettling our certainties, it generates space for new thought**. 2.
What does IR not know?]{.underline} (And what has this got to do with
the coloniality of power?) [This question highlights the hidden side of
knowledge----ignorance]{.underline}. [It suggests that the chasm of
colonial difference is far too deep and wide to be bridged, which means
that **single-vision understandings of world history or IR cannot
possibly comprehend the experiences and worldviews of
''others''**.]{.underline} Glissant reflects on the academic project and
concludes that ''no matter how many studies and references we
accumulate, we will never reach the end\...; knowing this in advances
makes it possible for us to dwell there. Not knowing this totality \[of
experiences\] is not a weakness. Not wanting to know it certainly is''
(1997: 154). Perhaps counter-intuitively, then, this ignorance brings a
number of intellectual benefits. Firstly, being aware of profound
difference might act as a brake on drawing easy parallels without
listening and thinking very hard first, promoting critical and complex
thinking. Secondly, gaining a sense of just how different difference can
be helps us to perceive the realm of possibilities because it is an
orientation point in a vast galaxy of difference. However, [the purpose
of identifying deep difference is not to label or pin down with words
ideas which are outside the realm of European imagination. Rather, it is
to accept that the chasm cannot be closed----that such ideas are simply
untranslatable into European languages and regimes of
knowledge]{.underline} (Mignolo and Schiwy 2003). That is[, a decolonial
IR must accept its ignorance and learn what it can about the world not
only by studying what is knowable but also by reflecting on what is
beyond comprehension]{.underline}. The caveat reminds us, though, that
this realm of thinking about the international takes place not on a
level playing field of competing worldviews but on a pitch riven with
geohierarchies conditioned by the coloniality of power. **[A decolonial
IR project must foreground the colonial nature of this difference to
expose the injustices that conventional approaches enact in the name of
universalism]{.underline}**. 3. [How might conventional IR be ''prised
open'' by difference?]{.underline} (And how is this linked to the USA?)
This question asks what would happen if IR were to move beyond simply
acknowledging diversality to generate an aesthetics of thinking
Other-wise (Glissant 1997). [This involves recognizing that the chasm of
colonial difference is far from absolute, indeed that it is spanned,
everyday and often, through processes of mestizaje]{.underline}. Thus,
difference should be viewed as a border zone which acts as a space where
new ideas and cosmologies might be imagined, emerging from transcultural
meetings. [One key way in which conventional IR might be opened up by
difference is by refocusing attention on ordinary people's experience of
the international]{.underline}, as Te´treault and Lipschutz propose.
**[This takes on a decolonizing role if the coloniality of power is
highlighted, a move which not only creates awareness of difference but
promotes border thinking----thinking inbetween categories and based on
everyday lived experiences of negotiating coloniality ⁄
modernity]{.underline}**. [Such strategies complement attempts by
Inayatullah and Blaney and many more to destabilize IR's traditional
building blocks such as nation-states, sovereignty, and the binary of
war⁄peace]{.underline}**. [The USA as global actor, as Western beacon,
and as home of the discipline is intimately entangled with
IR]{.underline}**[. **This is why border thinking at the binaried
intersection of the Americas is particularly acute in its capacity to
destabilize conventional thinking because it is a geographical metaphor
for many of the boundaries which set out global hierarchies and help to
structure IR**]{.underline}. [Not least of these is the First World
⁄Third World binary embodied at the US--Mexico border and its
attendants, Whiteness⁄Blackness, and civilization⁄
barbarism.]{.underline} Shifting from thinking about the border itself
to embrace border thinking invites us to step beyond the fence and its
checkpoints to consider the USA as a profoundly hybrid place. **[We move
beyond US hybridity as immigrant melting pot, to focus on mestizaje----a
complex amalgam of settler, Native and African slave descendants whose
relationships are vividly marked by the coloniality of power and the
logics of modernity]{.underline}**. A decolonial IR writing from a
''prised open'' USA not only looks for radical, destabilizing
difference, such as Native American thinking but also recognizes
hybridized connections which generate openings for dialogues. We should
not assume that the USA, like the Cuban slave masters described by
Ortı´z, is not profoundly conditioned by the colonial encounter.
However, such interactions do not occur in a power-free zone. For this
reason, **[a decolonial analysis of hybridity in the international must
vigilantly foreground the presence of inequality, injustice, and the
potential for violence in cultural interchanges conditioned by the
coloniality of power]{.underline}**. Border thinking in this broad
sense[, inclusive of IR perspectives, offers a realm of imagination,
connection and intellectual opportunity from which to rethink and
challenge dominant economic, racial and epistemological
modes]{.underline}. The role of mainstream IR in such re-imaginings of
intergroup relationships is crucial, not least because, as critical
scholars like those cited in this article attest, [conventional IR is a
central mainstay of the unequal global order.]{.underline}

#### The alternative is incommensurability -- decolonization is a project that requires the repatriation of indigenous lands, the abolition of slavery and property, and the dismantling of the imperial metropole.

not-seeing is morally convenient but avoids an important feature of the

The many critical pedagogies that engage emancipatory education, place
based education, environmental education, critical multiculturalism, and
urban education often position land as public Commons or seek
commonalities between struggles. Although we believe that "we must be
fluent" in each other's stories and struggles (paraphrasing Alexander,
2002, p.91), we detect precisely this lack of fluency in land and
Indigenous sovereignty. Yupiaq scholar, Oscar Kawagley's assertion, "We
know that Mother Nature has a culture, and it is a Native culture"
(2010, p. xiii), directs us to think through land as "more than a site
upon which humans make history or as a location that accumulates
history" (Goeman, 2008, p.24). The forthcoming special issue in
Environmental Education Research, "Land Education: Indigenous,
postcolonial, and decolonizing perspectives on place and environmental
education research" might be a good starting point to consider the
incommensurability of place-based, environmentalist, urban pedagogies
with land education. ● The urban as Indigenous (Bang, 2009; Belin, 1999;

incommensurability **[[Incommensurability is an acknowledgement that

**[Settler colonialism fuels imperialism all around the

salt, so will be water. Settler sovereignty over these very pieces of
earth, air, and water is what makes possible these imperialisms. The
same yellow pollen in the water of the Laguna Pueblo reservation in New
Mexico, Leslie Marmon Silko reminds us, is the same uranium that
annihilated over 200,000 strangers in 2 flashes. The same yellow pollen
that poisons the land from where it came. Used in the same war that took
a generation of young Pueblo men. Through the voice of her character
Betonie, Silko writes, "Thirty thousand years ago they were not
strangers. You saw what the evil had done; you saw the witchery ranging
as wide as the world\" (Silko, 1982, p. 174). In Tucson, Arizona, where
Silko lives, her books are now banned in schools. Only curricular
materials affirming the settler innocence, ingenuity, and right to
America may be taught. In "No", her response to the 2003 United States
invasion of Iraq, Mvskoke/Creek poet Joy Harjo (2004) writes, "Yes, that
was me you saw shaking with bravery, with a government issued rifle on
my back. I'm sorry I could not greet you, as you deserved, my relative."
Don't Native Americans participate in greater rates in the military?
asks the young-ish man from Viet Nam. **["Indian Country" was/is the
term used in Viet Nam, Afghanistan, Iraq by the U.S. military for 'enemy

without blinking, "There was a point before folks had left, before we

code name for bin Laden." Elmer Pratt, Black Panther leader, falsely
imprisoned for 27 years, was a Vietnam Veteran, was nicknamed
'Geronimo'. Geronimo is settler nickname for the Bedonkohe Apache
warrior who fought Mexican and then U.S. expansion into Apache tribal
lands. The Colt .45 was perfected to kill Indigenous people during the
'liberation' of what became the Philippines, but it was first invented
for the 'Indian Wars' in North America alongside The Hotchkiss Canon- a
gattling gun that shot canonballs. **[The technologies of the permanent
settler war are reserviced for foreign wars, including boarding schools,
colonial schools, urban schools run by military
personnel.]{.underline}** It is properly called Indian Country.
Ideologies of US settler colonialism directly informed Australian
settler colonialism. South African apartheid townships, the kill-zones
in what became the Philippine colony, then nation-state, the
checkerboarding of Palestinian land with checkpoints, were modeled after
U.S. seizures of land and containments of Indian bodies to reservations.
The racial science developed in the U.S. (a settler colonial racial
science) informed Hitler's designs on racial purity ("This book is my
bible" he said of Madison Grant's The Passing of the Great Race). The
admiration is sometimes mutual, the doctors and administrators of forced
sterilizations of black, Native, disabled, poor, and mostly female
people - The Sterilization Act accompanied the Racial Integrity Act and
the Pocohontas Exception - praised the Nazi eugenics program. Forced
sterilizations became illegal in California in 1964.

#### Indigenous struggle can use technology to create international movements against settler society

**Cleaver 98** (The Zapatista Effect: The Internet and the rise of an
alternative political fabric, Harry M. Cleaver, Journal of International
Affairs Vol. 51, No. 2, Technology and International Policy: Essays on

[The role of the Internet in the international circulation of
information on the indigenous rebellion in Chiapas developed quickly and
has continued to evolve]{.underline}. Early on, [the Internet provided a
means for the rapid dissemination of information and organization
through preexisting circuits, such as those which had been created as
part of the struggle to block the NAFTA, or those concerned with Latin
American and indigenous issues]{.underline}. **[These [networks
existed]{.mark}]{.underline}** primarily **[[at an international
level]{.underline}]{.mark}**, mostly in computer-rich North American and
Western European countries. News reports on radio and television were
complemented by first-hand reports in cyberspace from a record number of
observers who flooded into Chiapas with hitherto unseen alacrity, as
well as from more analytical commentators who could voice their opinions
and enter into debates more quickly and easily in cyberspace. [These few
circuits were rapidly complemented by the creation of specialized lists,
conferences and web pages devoted specifically to Chiapas and the
struggle for democracy in Mexico]{.underline}. The breadth of
participation in these discussions and the posting of multiple sources
of information has made possible an unprecedented degree of verification
in the history of the media. [Questionable information can be quickly
checked and counterinformation posted with a speed unknown in either
print, radio or television. Instead of days or weeks, the norm for
posting objections or corrections is minutes or hours]{.underline}. It
is important to note that the EZLN has played no direct role in the
proliferation of the use of the Internet. Rather, these efforts were
initiated by others to weave a network of support for the Zapatista
movement. Although there is a myth that Zapatista spokesman
Subcommandante Marcos sits in the jungle uploading EZLN communiques from
his laptop, the reality is that the EZLN and its communities have had a
mediated relationship to the Internet. The Zapatista communities are
indigenous, poor and often cut-oft not only from computer communications
but also from the necessary electricity and telephone systems. Under
these conditions, EZLN materials were initially prepared as written
communiques for the mass media and were handed to reporters or to
friends to give to reporters. Such material then had to be typed or
scanned into electronic format for distribution on the Internet. Today,
there are dozens of web pages with detailed information on the situation
in Chiapas specifically and the state of democracy in Mexico more
generally Several widely used news and discussion lists devoted to the
daily circulation of information and its assessment are available. These
various interventions operate from many countries and in many languages,
and they are all the result of work by those sympathetic to the rights
of indigenous peoples and to the plight of the Zapatistas. Some of these
efforts were launched in Mexico. [For example, the \"chiapas-l\" list is
run through computers at the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) in
Mexico City The Zapatista National Liberation Front (FZLN)16 operates
both a list (\"fzln1\") and a series of voluminous multi-lingual web
pages carrying news and documents regarding the negotiation process in
Chiapas and more general discussions in Mexico]{.underline}. Other sites
have originated outside of Mexico. The first unofficial FZLN webpage,
for example, was implemented through the Swarthmore College web server
in Pennsylvania.17 More recently, **[[the Zapatistas have begun
to]{.mark} craft their missives and [adapt their public
interventions]{.mark} as they have grown [to]{.mark} better understand
the effectiveness of the Internet in [making their voices heard,
communicating with supporters and forging new
alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Today, through the
intermediation of the FZLN or other friendly groups and individuals[,
**[Marcos and the EZLN regularly send messages to others around the
world, including, for example, messages to a European-wide demonstration
in Amsterdam against Maastricht and unemployment, to an Italian
gathering in Venice against regional separatism or to a conference of
media activists in New York]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In these
communications they make their position on various issues known and seek
to create or strengthen ties with far away groups. The Internet is also
playing an increasingly central role in particular organizing efforts
initiated by the EZLN. While its role was limited in the formation of
the meetings of the National Democratic Convention in 1994 and 1995,
which drew together a wide variety of groups from all over Mexico, [[the
Internet was employed to a greater extent in the subsequent national and
international plebiscites. The Zapatistas used the Internet in those
cases to seek feedback from their supporters regarding the direction
their political struggle should take]{.mark}.]{.underline}l8 During the
plebiscites, most participants in Mexico voted at booths set up
throughout the country by Alianza Civica, a well-respected pro-democracy
Mexican NGO. In addition, some 81,000 foreigners from 47 countries took
part, mostly via the Internet.l9 According to Alianza Civica, total
participation in Mexico was over one million persons.20 [The most
dramatic organizational efforts in which the Internet has played a
central role are the joint cooperative efforts between the Zapatistas
and other social movements linked to them. These efforts have included
the organization of large-scale meetings in response to the January 1996
Zapatista call for continental and intercontinental \"encounters\" to
discuss, among other things, contemporary global neoliberal (capitalist)
policies, methods of elaborating a global network of opposition to those
policies and formulas for interconnecting various projects for
elaborating alternatives]{.underline}. The result of these organizing
efforts included: a series of continental meetings in the spring of
1996;21 an intercontinental meeting in Chiapas in the summer of 1996;
and a second intercontinental meeting in Spain in the summer of 1997.
Through extensive E-mails and a small number of intermittent,
face-to-face meetings, possible approaches to the organization of
discussion were debated, agendas were hammered out and logistical
arrangements were made. The results were stunning. [Thousands came to
the continental meetings-3,000 to the intercontinental meeting in
Chiapas and 4,000 to the intercontinental reunion in Spain. Grassroots
activists from over 40 countries and five continents attended both
intercontinental meetings]{.underline}. Without the Internet, this
turnout would never have been possible. It is only recently that such
encounters have become regular features on the margins of meetings
organized by supranational institutions like the United Nations[. **[It
has usually been governments]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, not poor
villages of indigenous peoples, [that have had the means to organize
such gatherings. The Zapatistas, however, successfully organized these
encounters on a scale that far exceeded anyone\'s expectations,
and]{.mark} this fact alone [warrants close attention by those
interested in the evolution of international
politics.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Prefer the critique's impact. There's a [cognitive bias]{.underline} to downplay settler violence.

[For many North Americans, reflecting on and analysing their role as
settlers]{.underline} in colonial nations2 -- and about their
relationship to place in this context -- [is a fundamental
challenge]{.underline}. The [liberal discourse]{.underline} of equality
often [denies that racism is a systemic or everyday
problem]{.underline}, promoting instead a "'national story' of
benevolence and generosity" (Srivastava 2005, 35). Srivastava suggests
that Canadians operate within "[contemporary]{.underline} national
[discourses]{.underline} of tolerance, multiculturalism and nonracism"
that [mask ongoing racialized conflicts]{.underline} (35). Addressing
the racialized structure of society is profoundly challenging because
Canadian and [American moral identity is]{.underline} so [tied up in a
vision of equality]{.underline}, a vision [that]{.underline}, like all
national visions, "[requires]{.underline} not only sameness and
communion but also [forgetting difference and oppression]{.underline}"
(Benedict Anderson, in Srivastava 2005, 39). This vision of sameness and
nonracism is fundamental to the vision that the Canadian government
sought to uphold in Esgenoôpetitj, and that the Michigan government used
to frame its emergency manager laws. Confronting the racism inherent in
North American relationships with Indigenous peoples requires
confronting fundamental questions about the history and legitimacy of
the colonial states of Canada and the US. Taiaiake Alfred, an Indigenist
academic, argues that most **[Settlers are in denial]{.underline}**.
[They know that the foundations of their countries are corrupt, and they
know that their countries are "colonial" in historical terms, but they
still refuse to see and accept the fact that there can be no rhetorical
transcendence and retelling of the past to make it right without making
fundamental changes to their government, society, and the way they
live]{.underline} \... **[To deny the truth is an essential cultural and
psychological process in Settler society]{.underline}**. (2005, 107)
Many settlers know Canada/the US as their only home, and wonder, as some
of the people I interviewed in Burnt Church did, why they must pay for
the sins of their forefathers. [But the problems inherent in settler
relationships with Indigenous peoples are not only historical; they
exist in individual, social, and political **lives in the
present**]{.underline}. [The **fundamental discomfort** of reflection
on]{.underline} race and [racism makes it difficult for many to reflect
upon their shared position in the colonial present]{.underline}.

Satellite population and orbital security [[Over 6000]{.mark} military,
scientific and commercial [satellites]{.mark} have arrived in Earth's
orbital space to take on a key role in advancing global production,
distribution and consumption of media content]{.underline}.3 Designed to
perform specific tasks[, they have been disseminated across different
orbital altitudes; Low Earth Orbit has been mostly occupied by the earth
observation, remote sensing, communication and reconnaissance
satellites, Medium Earth Orbit by those used for global positioning,
Geosynchronous Orbit by broadcasting satellites and High Earth Orbit has
been increasingly utilised for their disposal]{.underline}. More than
1200 of them are currently operational;4 **[[arrayed around the planet
as if to imprison it under omniscient technical armour, they provide a
major logistic backbone for governmental practices that
expedite]{.underline}]{.mark}** what Deleuze (1992) [**[identified as
the 'society of control]{.underline}**']{.mark}[, extending Foucault's
ideas about 'disciplinary societies' onto the contemporary context of
automated, multifaceted systems of ubiquitous global
surveillance]{.underline}. Yet at the same time, [**[satellites are
themselves besieged by the same systems of control that they make
possible]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Their conduct in space is subjected to
exhaustive diagnostic management via specialised schemes such as The
United States Space Surveillance Network and the European Space
Agency's]{.underline} (n.d[.) Space Surveillance and Tracking program,
similar projects led by other states and space agencies, and independent
expert groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists]{.underline}.
**[[The orbital constellation of satellites necessitates another
security layer around the global apparatus of biopolitics -- the control
of its control infrastructure, forging a double-bind diagram of
networked governance.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Satellite control is guided
by the perspective of Space Situational Awareness (SSA), which, although
central to orbital logistics, is thus far without an official definition
(Kaiser, 2014). In essence, [SSA is concerned not only with observation
and surveillance of satellites as a way of knowing details of their
orbital position, but also with collecting, aggregating and analysing a
wide range of types of data about all objects and events in orbital
space as a reference point from which to estimate the best courses in
their management]{.underline}. One of the many descriptions of [[the SSA
postulates it as the pursuit of 'a comprehensive knowledge of the
population of space objects, of the space environment, **and of the
existing risks and threats**]{.mark}**'**]{.underline} (European
Security and Defence Assembly, 2009). While suggestive of the
biopolitical agenda of securing human activities in the orbital milieu,
this formulation symptomatically reveals a turn towards object-oriented
governance: SSA focuses upon the 'population of space objects'. On one
hand, the term 'space object' is a legal classification of all
human-made items placed in outer space, a nomenclature introduced by the
OST and elaborated in the Liability Convention from 1972, which gives
their legal owners exclusive rights to control and interfere with them.
On the other[, [the phrase 'population of space
objects']{.underline}]{.mark} -- an expression which is customarily used
in expert vocabulary surrounding SSA5 -- [[signposts a repositioning of
the human-centered en masse purview of biopolitics to incorporate a
population of technologies]{.mark}. The biopolitical use of the term
'population' originally specifies a mass of living humans; however, with
its application to the assemblage of human-made satellites, biopolitics
in outer space becomes central to attempts to manage a population whose
bodies are neither human, not animate, but that of
technology]{.underline}. [This twofold satellite logistics which focuses
upon both singular 'space objects' and a collective 'space population'
to assess multiple variables that determine their productive capacity
and manage risks associated with their occupation of orbital space,
reinforces regimes of satellite management which operate parallel to
that of humans.]{.underline} At both its administrative and executive
levels, [the governance of satellites regulates their material presence
in space, managing their distribution, traffic, operations and
decommission]{.underline}. Satellite launches require technical and
procedural compliance with national and international protocols[.
Information about each satellite is stored in the United Nations
Register of Space Objects Launched into Outer Space that functions as an
inventory of their births and deaths, and while apparently excluding
undisclosed missions]{.underline},6 acts as an (always incomplete)
global census on satellite population. [Activities of satellites are
continuously examined, evaluated and upheld via a multifaceted
management system termed Tracking, Telemetry and Control]{.underline}
(TT&C). TT&C enables ground control centres to monitor satellites via
sensors and on-board computers with which they are equipped,
telemetrically measure their 'health' by determining the 'condition and
performance of various subsystems such as fuel status, attitude and
output of solar panels', and adjust their trajectories, configurations
and functions (U.S. Army Space Division, n.d.). Within satellite
logistics, authority over each satellite is restricted to its owners and
allows for its individual proprietary control, [but [the overall
population of satellites is seen as a shared matter of global
security]{.underline}]{.mark}[, which necessitates [cooperative
collection]{.mark} and exchange of data between space agencies,
commercial and space experts and enthusiasts.]{.underline} There is a
range of satellite tracking software and databases, some with restricted
access such as the US Space Surveillance Network that only provides data
to subscribed governmental and commercial parties, and others which are
freely available online such as the UCS Satellite Database or the
website Heaven Above that enable the public to monitor the movement of
satellites. Taken together, **[[these examples of logistical inscription
and calculated management suggest attempts to institute a global system
of networked satellite control which corresponds with the twin-poled
organisation of power over life]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It
simultaneously centres on an individual satellite (aiming to diagnose
and restore its health and discipline its conduct in order to maximise
its productivity) and their entire population (overseeing its
demographic distribution and circulation and seeking to uphold its
'public health').7

#### The 1ac's drive to emerge into space is built off of American 'transcendence' -- the way in which America centers itself as the centre while expanding is military and social project of imperial control 

**Sage 14** (Sage, Daniel (2014). Daniel Sage is a professor at the
Institute of Geography and Earth Science, University of Wales. How Outer
Space Made America: Geography, Organization and the Cosmic Sublime (1st
ed.). Routledge. <https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315587189>) // JLHS AA

In the preceding eight chapters I have argued that [some of the unique
qualities of outer space---vastness, Otherness, sublimity, timelessness,
spacelessness---are]{.underline} just as [integral to extra-terrestrial
projections of US geopower]{.underline}, as its well-known capacity
(Arendt, 1963; Cosgrove, 2001; Dickens and Ormrod, 2007; Dolman, 2001;
Macdonald, 2007[) to function as an Archimedean high point to monitor
and control the surface, and atmosphere, of the Earth]{.underline}.
While the focus of my study has been the United States, and more
specifically NASA, [the implications of this cosmic projection of
geopower]{.underline}---the American transcendental state---[are global
in reach]{.underline}, [from enabling and shaping imperialistic
ideologies]{.underline} (Chapters 1-3 and 7) [to fuelling the extension
of technocratic managerialism]{.underline} (Chapter 4-6 and 8). What is
more, [messianic hope in America remains a global commodity,
consumed]{.underline}, for example, [through]{.underline} the
internationally franchised Star Trek television episodes and films
(Penley, 1997: 98-99), [multinational 'Space 2.0' corporations, like
SpaceX]{.underline} (Chapter 6)[, worldwide audiences to the addresses
of American presidents]{.underline} (Chapter 6) and global tourist
attractions like the National Air and Space Museum and Kennedy Space
Center Visitor Complex (Chapter 7). These global circulations suggest
that [while my empirical focus in this study has been on the
extra-terrestrial assemblage of the American transcendental state, as
viewed from within the borders of the US, the salience of my analysis is
geo-political]{.underline}. **[[The development of the American
transcendental state through space exploration must also be viewed as an
integral component of a far older geopolitical project---the production
of an American identity defined in terms of the transcendence of limits,
whether technological, economic, spiritual or territorial, enabling the
moral aggrandizement of the past, present and future of a horizontal
strata of sovereign territory and its peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(McDougall, 1997; Noble, 2002; Nye, 1994; O'Brien, 1988; Ricard, 1999;
Stephanson, 1995). Over the last decade or so, a growing number of
scholars, including geographers, have turned their attention to how
[[messianic-exceptionalist visions of America]{.mark} as the 'Promised
Land' of 'Chosen People' [have inflected various imperialistic projects
including]{.mark}: the pursuit of democracy through [military
intervention]{.mark} in the 'global south]{.underline}' (Anthony,
2008[); the [technocratic 'greening']{.mark} of Western global
capitalism]{.underline} (Singer, 2010); [the building of a ['culture of
war']{.mark} in foreign polic]{.underline}y (Marsella, 2011), the
circumvention of international institutions (Agnew, 2006);
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} most prominently perhaps, George W. [Bush's
'war on terror' where [invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq]{.mark} became
justified as a 'cosmic struggle between good and evil']{.underline}
(Agnew, 2006: 183; see also Barkun, 2010; Dijink, 2006; Strum, 2010;
Wallace, 2006[). All of this work indicates two points:
first,]{.underline} [the enduring Apocalyptic influence of
dispensational pre-millennialism]{.underline}1 [on both interventionist
and isolationist currents within American (geo)politics]{.underline}
(Strum and Dittmer, 2010: 18); a[nd secondly, the rise of a religious
cosmology that **positions America at the moral, geographical, and
spiritual, centre of the universe**]{.underline} (Strum, 2010: 150). My
analysis of American spaceflight adds to this body of work on religion
and geopolitics by drawing attention to five less discussed conduits of
this pious vision of American geopower: (i) the secular---museums,
family theme parks, systems management; (ii) the sublime---astronomical
artwork, Moon landings and distant Nebula; (iii); the profane---Nazi
slave labor camps, technocratic patriarchy, and dead astronauts; the
technological (iv)---rocket production lines, O-rings, electrical
wiring; and (v) the revolutionary---female astronauts, May 1968, and
Richard Feynman. Analytically, these diverse registers suggest the
utility of working with a broader, less explicitly spiritual, set of
theoretical assumptions, to address the cosmological aspects of American
geopolitics. [This is why I mobilized the concept of the 'American
transcendental state', rather than 'deified nation']{.underline}
(O'Brien, 1988: 41) within this study. [This deliberately hallucinogenic
sounding term captures some sense that the messianic-exceptionalistic
projection of American geopower is a more diffusive, experimental,
fantasmic, embodied, and ostensibly secular, affair, than conveyed
within much discursive analysis of the religious undercurrents
inflecting American geopolitics]{.underline} (for example Agnew, 2006;
Dijink, 2006; Strum, 2010; Wallace, 2006). I would like to suggest now
that there is another benefit in bringing together these diverse
practices under a broader analysis of the American transcendental state:
their common geography becomes all the more obvious. That is, all these
practices involve thinking, doing or resisting, celestial transcendence
as an apparatus of American geopower; hence they can all be rightly
considered 'vertical geopolitics' (Elden, 2013; Graham, 2004; Graham and
Hewitt, 2013). [This label has developed to identify a body of work
addressing how [the circulation of American geopower involves]{.mark}
more than two-dimensional geographies of area]{.underline}. [It
currently includes analyses of; drone warfare]{.underline} (Gregory,
2011); [aerial bombardment]{.underline} (Graham, 2004); police
helicopters (Adey, 2010); **[[satellite
surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Macdonald, 2007) **[[and satellite
drone navigation and targeting]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Gregory, 2011).
Elden (2013: 40) explains that ['vertical geopolitics' is mostly
focussed upon how state political technologies allow diverse populations
to be measured, calculated, controlled and killed, 'from above', and
occasionally 'from below']{.underline} (for example Elden, 2013; Graham
and Hewitt, 2013). [By contrast, the vertical orientation I have adopted
here, while related, is different. Specifically, I have described how
aspects of the projection of American identity, geopower, and territory,
also involve a vertical spacelessness---a deterritorialization---a
potential collapse into sublime, cosmic, insignificance; in short,
rather than the 'view from above', the perspective I have traced has
been a 'view into the above']{.underline} (and back). In part,
therefore, my study can be considered a response to Elden's (2013)
recent question: 'How would our thinking of geo-power, geo-politics and
geo-metrics work if we took the earth; the air and the subsoil;
questions of land, terrain, territory; earth processes and
understandings of the world as the central terms at stake, rather than a
looser sense of the 'global?' (p49) I propose we add to this list
celestial entities, including the Moon (Chapter 3), the Martian surface
(Chapter 6) and the Eagle Nebula (Chapter 7), as well as God (Agnew,
2006; Dittmer and Strum, 2010; Strum, 2013). Thus, perhaps we should be
cautious of Elden's (2013b) rather geocentric call 'about how
geopolitics might be thought as earth-politics rather than simply a
synonym for global politics' (p59). Instead, it might be more useful to
bear in mind Deleuze and Guattari's (1988: 101) argument that [even
absolute deterritorialization]{.underline}---something akin perhaps to
the mathematical cosmic sublime of Kant (Nye, 1994: 7-8)---[always
involves reterritorialization]{.underline}(s). Recall how Charles
Bonestell (Chapter 2), William Clancey (Chapter 6) and the National Air
and Space Museum (Chapter 7), respectively, and persuasively, associated
vistas of the Moon, Mars and the Eagle Nebula with the American West,
and by extension locate America at the centre of God's universe (Boime,
1991; Stephanson, 1995). This analysis of American spaceflight also
sheds light on seldom acknowledged connections between religious and
vertical geopolitics and technocracy[. The relation between critical
analysis of geopolitics]{.underline} (O Tuathail, 1996) [and
technocratic management]{.underline} (Alvesson, 1987), [remains
remarkably undeveloped]{.underline}. Arguably this lacuna says more
about the disciplinary separation between critical security studies and
organization studies (Grey, 2009) than the various intellectual cross-
fertilizations between organization studies and human geography (Clegg
and Kornberger, 2006; Dale and Burrell, 2008; Parker, 2013).
Nevertheless, there are, as Grey (2009) maintains, clear resonances:
Indeed it could said that, in the same way that **[[the development of
security studies in particular, and organization studies to an extent,
was shaped by geo- politics of wars both hot and cold, so too many
current and future directions be in part a reflection of developments in
contemporary geo-politics]{.mark}]{.underline}** (p31). Some
**[[organizational practices are]{.underline}]{.mark}** of course, very
much [**[on the 'front line' of practical
geopolitics]{.underline}**;]{.mark} that is, they comprise the 'the
foreign policy bureaucracy' (Ó Tuathail and Dalby, 1998: 4) **[t[hrough
which geographical concepts are deployed to aid 'conceptualization and
decision making' in 'everyday foreign policy']{.mark}]{.underline}** (O
Tuathail, 1999: 110). **[Examples here include the work of the US Air
Force, the CIA]{.underline}** (Central Intelligence Agency) and the UK's
Foreign and Common Wealth Office. There are also a host of other
**[organizations that no doubt influence how practical geopolitics is
produced, from]{.underline}** **[security analysts like the RAND
Corporation to global defense contractors like McDonnell
Douglas]{.underline}**. However, analysis of the relationship between
organizational and geopolitical practices remains embryonic. For
example, Anderson's (2011) study of urban counter- insurgency and
Gregory's (2011) of drone warfare, do no more than merely infer that the
rise of the 'networked organization' is reworking the projection of
American geo-power. Correspondingly, two organizational studies of the
military only hint that, for example, masculine discipline (Godfrey et
al., 2012) and team identities (Corona and Godart, 2010) shape and are
themselves shaped by grand geopolitical narratives like the 'war on
terror'**[. But [the imbrication of geopolitical and organizational
practice can also be more subtle and much less militaristic---concerning
the anticipation and cultivation of geopower through shared national
identities,]{.mark} that is 'popular geopolitics']{.underline}** (O
Tuathail, 1999: 110). [Here, the connection to organizational practices
is no less significant, yet invisible in the literature]{.underline}.
[NASA offers a good example: from its inception, the space agency
developed increasingly refined technocratic techniques that aligned
people and machines to naturalize the pursuit of a popular geopolitics
wedded to American geopower. Viewed in this way, imperialistic geopower
and technocratic-managerialism are interwoven forces; hence the present
study suggests the richness of more sustained critical analysis of
organization and geopolitics.]{.underline} However, I am all too aware
that in stressing the widespread application of this concept of the
America transcendental state to understand American geopower--- and,
concomitantly, the fecundity of bringing together analyses of religion,
verticality and now technocracy within critical geopolitics---I run the
risk of constructing a totalizing, monstrous, edifice. The reader might
rightly ask at this juncture, paraphrasing Nietzsche, have you not gazed
into the cosmic abyss of American geopower for too long; are you not
also reifying American geopower in the cosmos rather than challenging
it? Indeed, throughout the preceding chapters I made reference to a
rather singular sounding concept of the 'American transcendental state'.
But, as in the introduction, I must stress again here, that I took this
decision for reasons of analytical clarity rather than to suggest I have
revealed an independent, singular, definite and a priori reality (Law,
2006), some essence akin perhaps to what Agnew (2006: 184) refers to as
'Americanism'. Instead, within each chapter I have traced the
progressive assemblage of [[the American transcendental
state]{.mark}---that [is]{.mark}, nothing less than the divinely
sanctioned, exceptional, and messianic, right and duty, of America, and
its leaders in its name]{.underline} (Wallace, 2006: 225), **[[to
command cosmic space and time by evoking forces of 'good' and 'evil',
'us' and 'them']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Agnew, 2006; Strum, 2010). But
the immutability of this cosmic vision (Strum and Dittmer, 2010;
Wallace, 2006) belies the transformative, fragmented, heterogeneous
components that sustain it, across landscape artwork, through Kennedy's
Moon Speech, to the O-rings of Space Shuttle Challenger. Throughout this
study I have suggested countless relations through which this vision is
not only produced (Dijink, 2006; McDougall, 1997; Noble, 2002; Nye,
1994; Ricard, 1999; Stephanson, 1995; Wallace, 2006) but circulated,
maintained, resisted, repaired, transformed, and experimented with. How
then to conceptualize this heterogeneous, but obdurate, cosmic being?
Latour's actor-network theory (1987; 2005; 2012) is useful to an extent
here; first, [we can conceptualize the transcendental state as an
'immutable mobile' that 'ends up traversing the universe' by 'pay\[ing\]
for each transport with a transformation']{.underline} (Latour, 2013:
127); [it is 'not displacement without transformation but displacement
through transformation]{.underline} (Latour, 2005: 223); second, the
transcendental state can be understood as offering a prophetic, but
partial, 'panorama' of the 'world \[cosmos\] to be lived in' (p189)
which must then, in turn, be: \... carefully situated inside one of the
many Omnimax theatres offering complete panoramas of society---and we
now know that the more thrilling the impression, the more enclosed the
room has to be[. **[\[American\] Society is not the whole 'in which'
everything is embedded, but what travels 'through' everything,
calibrating connections and offering every entity it reaches some
possibility of commensurability]{.underline}**]{.mark}. (p242) Read
against Latour's concepts of the 'immutable mobile' and the 'localizable
panorama' it is easy to see why my analysis of American transcendental
state has involved mapping circulations within as well as beyond our
lives. And this is a political move too, because it suggests that
opportunities to test and resist the American transcendental state are
closer to hand than we might think. As revealed in Chapter 8, a great
deal of effort is required to keep the transcendental state circulating
because the heterogeneous conduits it passes through---electrical
wiring, teleconferences, flight readiness reviews, budget decisions and
O-ring joints---are capricious and experimental; that is, affective.
Other Chapters acknowledged similar fragility accompanying the
assemblage of the transcendental state, including; the partially-owned
Declaration of Independence (Chapter 1), the globally unifying Earthrise
photograph of Apollo 8 (Chapter 3) and the rusting rockets on display in
the gardens of the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex (Chapter 7). Now
located within this chain of heterogeneous transformations, what
strategies might aid us in purposefully transforming this now confined
totality? Or put differently, how might we engage outer space to resist
this cosmic deification of America (O Brien, 1988)? In concluding this
study, I propose three techniques but no doubt there are many more.
First, we can expose the void at the heart of this
messianic-technocratic projection of geopower (Wallace, 2006). This
approach was evidenced in Chapter 1 by Derrida's (2002) deconstructive
reading of Declaration of Independence. Derrida (2002) emphasizes how
signing the Declaration in God's name entails no democratic ownership
over America's future, in outer space or elsewhere. Across the
development of American spaceflight, the perils of messianic, free-
floating, notions of 'Progress', 'Exploration,' 'Frontier' and 'The
Future' are all too apparent, not least for NASA itself. Lester and
Robinson (2009) suggest the emergence of this critique within the
American space policy community: We should accept that "exploration" is
a multivalent term, with many meanings, some of which are contradictory,
and all of which have historical precedent. For too long we have looked
at the history of exploration selectively, seeking to find the
antecedents which justify our own vision of exploration: as science, as
human adventure, as geopolitical statement. This is a definitional fight
which cannot be won. Space policy must acknowledge the multiple visions
for space exploration, developing a clear-eyed metric of value which
avoids the vagaries of lofty "exploration-speak", If the merits of human
exploration of the Moon and Mars are primarily symbolic and
geopolitical, what are these goals worth in terms of federal funding? I
am unconvinced by the economically instrumentalist conclusions made by
Lester and Robinson (2009) about putting a value upon even NASA's
'softer' geopower, but the general caution about harnessing nebulous
messianic mythologies to advance American space exploration is valuable.
Of course the problem is this tradition of finding our God in the cosmos
is long-established as Olsson (2007) suggests via this retelling of the
Babylonian creation epic, Enuma elish: Marduk is the Lord of lords \...
Hail to the Chief! Fifty were his names, so numerous that if ever
attacked he could always hide behind another alias. Never catchable as
the specific this or that, always on the move as an ambiguous this and
that \... Ungraspable multiplicity. \... In this mist-enveloped region
of religion naming is the name of the game, an exercise in ontological
transformations where earthly people appear as projections of heavenly
gods, social relations as signs in the sky. \... a signified meaning
searching for its own coordinates (Olsson, 2007: 23). Perhaps a more
modest approach is required: we should simply resist the urge to name,
and tame, the cosmos as a Whole, by naming a celestial Godhead in it
that we claim for ourselves (Wallace, 2006) but cannot ever fully own.
'Evil is the disaster of a truth when the desire to force the naming of
the unnameable is unleashed . \... Evil is not disrespect for the name
of the other, but rather the will to name at any price' (Badiou, 2004:
115-6; original emphasis). Challenging the cosmic aggrandization of
America might therefore imply some attempt to resist naming our
God/Future/Progress in the cosmos. Put simply, this all too easy act of
cosmic de/reterroritalizaiton is too crude, too undemocratic, too
costly. A second, related, strategy which can be adopted to resist the
American transcendental state was discussed within Chapter 3; this is
the capacity to push transcendence to another plane or refuge---to
follow one line of flight of cosmic deterritorialization and then
re-territorialize the Earth in a panorama that starts with a common
human experience, rather than those of any particular nation/
God/future. The aim of this strategy is to mobilize a cosmic imagination
that can register something of the shared experience of being human. In
Chapter 3 I discussed how the Earthrise photograph from NASA's Apollo 8
mission have stimulated new cosmic imaginations---including 'spaceship'
Earth (Cosgrove: 2001, 257-262; Henry and Taylor, 2009; Ward, 1964),
Noetic science (Benjamin, 2003: 60-61), global political ecologies
(Connolly, 2002)---that defied nationalistic appropriations by inferring
a human transcendence. However, as the American author Kurt Vonnegut
explains such a transcendental image of humanity, emptied of territorial
divisions and difference, is not itself without risk: 'Earth is such a
pretty blue and pink and white pearl in the pictures NASA sent me. It
looks so clean. You can't see all the hungry, angry earthlings down
there---and the smoke and sewage and trash and sophisticated weaponry'
(Vonnegut cited in Burrows, 1998: 423). Similarly, Deleuze and Guattari
(1988) suggest we should always remain sceptical that
de-territorialization is a progressive act on its own: 'Never believe
that a smooth space will suffice to save us' (p500). A third strategy is
to augment different affects amid the assemblage of the American
transcendental state. As described in Chapter 8, **[[the American
transcendental state depends upon the cultivation of confidence in
technocracy allied to an affective becoming hopeful---a positive
openness to the future as life enhancing---orientated around the
transcendence of America in cosmic space and
time]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But, as Anderson (2006), explains, becoming
hopeful does not necessarily need to operate in this transcendental
manner: hopefulness can also emerge not to ward off suffering, but
through every day sorrows, through diminishment of the body's potential
to affect and be affected. Consider, for example, how Dotty Duke refused
to discuss her fears and anxieties with her astronaut husband as she
kept the 'house in order and \[took\] out the garbage' (Duke
1990---Chapter 5). Dotty Duke epitomizes a different kind of becoming
hopeful---a capacity to remain open-ended about the future in a life
enhancing manner through diminishment---devoid of discussion of a better
future in Earth or in the cosmos; this is hope that challenges 'the easy
equation between transcendence and a future elsewhen or elsewhere in
favor of an imminent transcendence from within vectors of diminishment'
(Anderson, 2006: 749; for more analysis of immanent transcendence
related to Space see Smith, 2009: 211). Another affect which is useful
in short-circuiting the hopeful assemblage of the transcendental state
is boredom. Anderson (2004) describes boredom as the moment when the
'"forgetting" intrinsic to habit has been momentarily incapacitated. It
is the unravelling of habit, a sudden realization of the again' (p743).
Boredom depresses the life enhancing capacity of ourselves to be open to
the future, engendering stillness and slowness of thought-action in
space- time, where, as Anderson (2004) puts it, the capacity to
experience the 'not yet' (p749) is suspended. The evolution of American
spaceflight might appear to some the antithesis of boredom, but, as
Jorgensen (2009) suggests, the American humanization of outer space has
gone hand in hand with endless repetition (of middle America): The
August 1969 Life Special Issue, released to commemorate the landing,
wants to produce sympathetic accounts of the astronauts. It is filled
with glossy, high color photographs of the astronauts not only mastering
outer space, but their domestic spaces as well. Neil Armstrong bakes
pizza, Buzz Aldrin jogs through the suburbs, and Mike Collins prunes his
garden. These images resonate with outer space itself, as the astronauts
use tools in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments. The
spatula and shears the astronauts use to cook lamb curry and prune roses
with resemble the objects they hold while walking the moon, these being
a laser reflector, seismometer and solar wind sheet (p179). There is no
hopefulness on offer in Jorgensen's (2009) reading of American
spaceflight. Instead the boredom experienced in the cosmic repetition of
middle America signals despair: 'Apollo 11 represented an America that
had become unhinged by its own technocracy, its middle class lifestyle,
and television' (p188). Jorgensen (2009) is not, of course, alone in
identifying aspects of spaceflight repetitive, even boring. As the
emergence of the Teacher in Space program demonstrated (see Chapter 8),
NASA itself has historically attempted to introduce elements of
excitement, even increased risk, to engage a global audience. Yet, of
course, a balance has always had to be struck, as Parker (2009) explains
of Apollo: 'Everything was supposed to be boring, because boredom meant
no surprises, and hence the possibility of the adventure in some sense
rested on its denial' (p326). Although fleeting, boredom is surely an
unavoidable ingredient in NASA's technocratic confidence, but when
focused and channeled, it does suspend hope in the cosmos as a better
place, perhaps providing an opportunity for us to pause and register
something of the sublime Otherness of Space, where we concurrently
repeat and differ ourselves into infinity: 'Media representations of
space travel turn the vastness of space into the similitude of
domesticity, as human familiarity comes to stand in for the infinite. At
the same time, the domestic attains the dimensions of the infinite, and
in turn becomes strangely unfamiliar to the television viewer'
(Jorgensen, 2009: 179). **[These three techniques of cosmo-political
intervention---refusal to name, human transcendence, and sensitivity to
new affects---are all worthy of greater attention, especially when they
can be connected up to, and interfere with, the assemblage of the
American transcendental state.]{.underline}** Clearly not all of those
involved directly in the development of spaceflight will want or be able
to practise these techniques. Nevertheless **[even among this group
these techniques are intended to offer greater receptivity to new
cosmographical imaginations which move beyond the cosmic aggrandization
of messianic-imperialistic-technocratic impulses. If we have entered the
Cosmic Age where all territorializing assemblages, all States, now
derive vital energy from the Cosmos]{.underline}** (Deleuze and Guattari
(1988: 342**[), then the imperative becomes not to simply do
cosmopolitics]{.underline}** (Latour, 2005) **[but rather which
cosmo-politics do we want to pursue?]{.underline}** My favoured vision
of a Geography of Space is one where this question is endlessly asked
but never answered with absolute confidence.

#### Environmental monitoring systems place indigenous groups on the backburner only ensuring their erasure.

avenues for First Nations to ensure treaty rights are considered in

[[While the cold war might be a distant memory]{.mark} to many people in
the world, today its effect on society is still being felt[. Russians
are still villainized]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [Western]{.mark} **and
particularly US [media]{.mark}**]{.underline} from movies to local news.
[From popular news station Fox News constantly presenting news stories
from Syria]{.underline} about the Russian troops bombing and attacking
Syrian rebel strongholds focusing more on the Russian government
involvement within the conflict and less the Syrian government which it
supports (McKay, 2019), [to constant reporting on Russian meddling in in
the US elections of 2016]{.underline} (Pappas, 2018) [showing them as
masterminds manipulating elections and governments around the
world]{.underline}. **[[This idea of stereotypes and norms which
persists after war or in this case the cold war, can be attributed
to]{.mark} what Johan Galtung Calls negative peace [the idea that
violence does not end when the peace is signed between nations but
instead lives on in the form of cultural violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Galtung, 2013, pp 173). Cultural violence is according to Galtung the
aspects of culture who promotes or make direct and structural violence
acceptable. [This culture comes in]{.underline} many forms such as
[media]{.underline} in general (Galtung, 2013, pp 41). **[In a sense
[this means that media can be used to create an environment where
violence is justified and feels right to the
perpetrator]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With this idea of negative peace it
could be argued that while at the moment the [[stereotypes and
ideas]{.underline}]{.mark} which are spread by the media might seem to
be passive and neutral, used for entertainment and not for war, they
[[can easily be turned into]{.mark} something negative creating an enemy
image which is **[one of the requirements for armed conflict to be
justified]{.mark}**]{.underline} according to Louis Oppenheimer (2003,
pp 2). While this study does not deal with this problem directly, by
highlighting these forms of cultural violence it brings awareness of
their existence making it possible for them to be further debated and
researched in future papers. [This thesis is also highlighting the
relationship which at times is forgotten between media, public culture,
and politics and that everything can be political.]{.underline} This
theme is explored in the book War, Politics and Superheroes: Ethics and
Propaganda in Comics and Film by Marc Di Paolo (2011). [Di Paolo
explores how different political discourses and ideas show up in comics
and films. From stories such as Batman fighting against Osama Bin Ladin
to Superman fighting the KKK]{.underline} (2011, pp 49, 138). [His book
shows us that entertainment [media can be influenced by politics both
reflecting]{.mark} important political [discourse's]{.mark} [but also
important political events such]{.mark} as]{.underline} the Punisher
being influence by **[[Middle Eastern conflicts and the Vietnam
war]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Di Paolo, 2011, pp 115). This means that all
entertainment media can be influenced in the same way, from films to
video games making the studying of entertainment media important as to
understand how and what political discourses are spread by video games.

#### From Geronnimo to Gernoimo EKIA settler memory frames the native as the eternal enemy. The projection of nativity onto the modern enemy of the US is a part of the collective settler memory that pursues the elimination of the other while reliving fetishized moments of settler colonial violence. This logic is embedded in engagements with foreign enemies deemed as threats by the US that become the racialized punching bag of the US' settler colonial tendencies and a continuation of the US' settler colonial project abroad.

American statism," Settler Colonial Studies,

[To see the way in which settler memory connects the dots from Geronimo
to Bin Laden as it concerns American state practices I now examine the
relationship between colonial and imperial statist violence]{.underline}
as articulated in a book published in late 2011, in the wake of the Bin
Laden assassination. The book's title is Wanted Dead or Alive: Manhunts
from Geronimo to Bin Laden. The book's author is Benjamin Runkle, a
Harvard trained political scientist who was a US Army captain in the
Iraq War, worked as a speechwriter for the National Security Council
during the W. Bush Administration and also worked as a staff member for
the House Armed Services Committee. In 2014, he was program director for
the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, and the
organization's motto is 'Securing America, Strengthening Israel'. Runkle
is thus **[both a product and an agent of US liberal colonialism and its
imperial articulations,]{.underline}** and he provides here an insider's
perspective on the production and purposes of American statism,
expressed as much habitually as consciously. The book's first sentence
offers a call to contemporary memory: 'It is both a cliché and an
understatement to say that Tuesday, 11 September 2001, is a day that
will forever be etched into the memory of all Americans who lived
through it.' 22 The [historical chapters begin with the 'Geronimo
Campaign' and then focus on the US military's effort to 'hunt' down, in
order, Emilio Aguinaldo of the Philippines in 1901 near the end of the
Philippine-American war, Mexican Revolutionary General Pancho Villa from
1916--1917, Panamanian leader Manual Noriega in the late 1980s, Mohammed
Farah Aideed of Somalia in the early 1990s, and then Saddam Hussein, Abu
Musab Al-Zarqawi, and Osama Bin Laden in the early twenty-first century.
**As is clear, all eight of these targets of American state violence are
racial and ethnic others to the white settler American somatic
norm.**]{.underline} As well, [all eight stem from nations or regions
shaped by colonialism and imperialism,]{.underline} and each in their
particular way [offered forms of resistance to US state imperatives, a
number of whom were direct or indirect allies of the USA at some point
in time. **To draw these similarities is not to defend or easily
analogize any of these figures in terms of their individual politics,
practices, and ideologies, but to place their targeting in the context
of the development of American statism that is premised upon colonialist
and imperialist practices, institutions, and violence.**]{.underline}
The fact that Runkle starts this narrative with Geronimo is itself no
coincidence. [It speaks to the necessary power of history and memory in
the production and legitimation of American liberal colonial statism and
US imperialism.]{.underline} Runkle is as an advocate for the American
state practice of what he calls 'manhunts', proposing that 'strategic
manhunts will be increasingly attractive to future policymakers'. As
well, he bemoans the way in which 'the individuals targeted by US forces
are often sanitized and romanticized by history, while the "quiet
professionals" who protect us are often forgotten'. 23 Runkle also
argues that manhunts are 'not assassinations,' because the essence of
the latter is its 'treacherous nature, which includes the use of violent
force during peacetime by covert personell. Conversely, strategic
manhunts use at least some overt deployment of uniformed forces acting
under an established chain of command.' 24 Here Runkle's perspective
reflects and re-iterates American statist practices in their
constitutive relationship to settler memory, from someone trained in an
elite US educational institution, deployed in combat in the US military,
and who worked in two of the three federal branches. From his insider's
viewpoint, Runkle's perspective is helpful because he offers an acute
assessment of US liberal colonial practices in at least two respects.
First, I would argue that [Runkle is correct that those who are deemed
to be the outlaws to the American state do, at times, become
transformed, 'sanitized and romanticized,' although not by history, but
in and through the politics of collective memory.]{.underline}
Interestingly, though, of the eight 'manhunt' targets discussed in his
book, it is really only Geronimo who has gone through this mnemonic
transformation to such a significant degree, and maybe to a lesser
extent Pancho Villa. But by my reading the other figures are either
forgotten for the most part (Aguinaldo), or are in no evident way
romanticized (Noriega, Aideed, Hussein, bin Laden) in American political
culture. It is really **[Geronimo alone who epitomizes this form of
mnemonic transformation,]{.underline}** and in that respect it is a
distinctly settler form of memory, one which seeks to transform him into
a heroic but tragic figure who represents both the development of and
resistance to colonialism, but thereby also stands **[mnemonically as
the tamed, defeated product of US settlement.]{.underline}** In other
words, [Geronimo's persistent place in settler memory stands as evidence
of US occupation being a settled matter and how it became so, with the
'manhunt' form standing here as an historical event that legitimates and
sutures the practices of organized statist military actions as key
components of contemporary settler colonial assemblage.]{.underline}
Secondly, while I disagree with Runkle's parsing of assassination versus
strategic manhunt in an ethical sense, politically he offers what I deem
to be an accurate, insider's understanding of the purposes and practices
of American statism when he claims that strategic manhunts are
historically persistent, institutionalized, overt state functions, not
rogue, covert, or atypical operations. 'Strategic manhunts' and
operations of their ilk are not the exceptions to the functioning of
statism. They are the [statist rule for a liberal political community
built upon colonial conquest and maintained through settler violence,
law and memory. I would include the execution of the Dakota 38 and the
massacre at Wounded Knee as two other such examples -- two among many we
can locate -- that need to be remembered not as rogue exceptions to
liberal statist practice, but rather as the rule of liberal colonial
statism and US political development. **They are not outside or at odds
with statism, they are statism in practice.**]{.underline} With regards
to the invocation of Geronimo's name, then, it is not a minor matter
that Runkle's narrative begins with Geronimo the historical person and
ends with the killing of Bin Laden under the codename Geronimo. Rather,
it **[points to the necessary role of settler memory in iterating and
legitimating the purpose of statism in a liberal colonial context such
as the USA. To invoke the name 'Geronimo' is to first call forth the
violence of and resistance to colonial conquest and in American lore the
settler victory over Indigenous peoples, and then to connect it
mnemonically to the colonialist and imperialist practices of
contemporary American statism.]{.underline}** And the role of settler
memory here is more powerful, more constitutive of settler ideology, by
the likelihood that [the association of Geronimo with Bin Laden, while
not random,]{.underline} was likely more a product of the work of
habitmemory than recollection-memory. [As deployed here, settler memory
habitually reminds the American population that the cold, violent state
remains the vengeful defender of yore, and that the work of statist
dispossession -- of land, of life, of identity -- goes on, and must do
so. In this regard, 'Geronimo EKIA' is a prime example of a settler
mnemonic that turns violent statist practices into unifying gestures
linking past conquests to those of the present, and back
again.]{.underline} We can [see efforts to make this wider linkage clear
in more radical political critiques that were articulated in the
aftermath of the Bin Laden assassination.]{.underline} These critiques
did not speak in language of multiculturalism or recognition, but rather
in the discourse of colonialism. For example, on the show Democracy Now,
Anishinaabe writer and activist Winona LaDuke offered her analysis,
stating: [The reality is that the military is full of native
nomenclature. You've got Black Hawk helicopters, Apache Longbow
helicopters. You've got Tomahawk missiles. The term used when you leave
a military base in a foreign country is to go 'off the reservation, into
Indian Country'. So what is that messaging that is passed on? **It is
basically the continuation of the wars against Indigenous
people.**]{.underline}25 And Suzan Harjo, in an interview separate from
her appearance at the Senate hearing, offered a similar reading to
LaDuke's, arguing that the use of Geronimo's name shows **['how deeply
embedded the "Indian as enemy" is in the collective mind of
America'.]{.underline}** 26 I agree with their assessments, but would
also add that what we see here, as we can with the many other examples
of these forms of identity appropriation, is that the work of settler
memory is [fundamental]{.underline} to the reproduction and legitimation
of settler colonial assemblage through a relationship to the past that
is not about forgetting. It is a powerful form of national remembering.
Conclusion In the contemporary era, I would include politics itself as
among the facets of existence that settler colonialism colonizes. That
is, settler colonial assemblage defines and seeks to bound that which is
legitimately subject for debate and contestation as it concerns the
distribution and role of power, identity, interest and institutions.
Before one can even ask the question of settler colonial violence,
dispossession, and appropriation, the question may be rendered moot,
outside the bounds of legitimate, or realistic, politics. In this light,
my suggestion here is that the response to such appropriations as that
of Geronimo's name should not be to ask the White House for an apology,
and thus concede the status of this statist institution. Instead, the
association should be embraced, in one key respect. [To embrace the
association is not to stand in alliance with Osama Bin Laden or Al Qaeda
at all or the US military, but rather to re-assert the fact that
Geronimo was, indeed, an enemy of American statism and settler
colonialism.]{.underline} It is to maintain the political posture of
friend versus enemy, and to render as important and necessary the status
and actions of what political theorist Joel Olson called the zealot or
fanatic as an important political category that holds out the
possibility for more radical transformation of the political order.27
**[It is to say that the use of Geronimo's name is not simply the sign
of an absence of respect or sensitivity for Indigenous people, but is
more evidence of the active presence of settler colonial assemblage in
the specific form of US liberal colonialism.]{.underline}** In sum, in
critiquing the problem with the Codename Geronimo case, we should seek
to avoid either reproducing a politics of recognition and multicultural
discourse or diagnosing it as a sign of collective amnesia, as if only
people knew all the 'facts' of history things would be fine, or better.
Rather, in this regard, LaDuke and Harjo get it right I believe in
emphasizing the persistent posture of American warfare against
Indigenous people. While this is a difficult framework to ponder, it is
the appropriate one for a decolonizing, unsettling politics which
insists on drawing clear lines for and against settler colonialism. In
this sense, [the unsettling response here is to put settler memory front
and center as an active contemporary practice, in which Geronimo's name
is utilized by the US military because the invocation of his legend
habitually calls forth -- possibly unlike any single figure in
US-Indigenous history -- the appropriative violence of settler colonial
conquest that fundamentally shapes, as an active verb in the
twenty-first century, the political development and status of American
liberal colonialism.]{.underline}

[recognising Indigeneity beyond the Americas, [Mays frames Black
Indigeneity as an analytic that allows connection between contemporary
African American cultural expressions and belonging and
Africa.]{.mark}]{.underline} This belonging is generated through
cultural practices, but is complicated when [[claims to land and
reparations assume the unimpeded futurity of the settler state as
undergirding these claims]{.mark}.]{.underline} Mays' [engagements with
Black Indigeneity remind us of the necessity of working through multiple
and contextually-grounded frames of analysis and
claim-making.]{.underline} As Vimalassery et

explain, "when settler colonialism is deployed as a stand-alone analytic
it potentially reproduces precisely ... effects and enactments of
colonial unknowing", that is, a refusal to know how colonisation has

"Colonial unknowing" also speaks to "the artificial impasse" in academic
scholarship, and citational practices. We argue that these acts of
unknowing also permeate scholarship. [[Citizenship and the categories of
the white supremacist state, for instance, foreclose the possibility of
Indigeneity for both enslaved Africans and

context specific.]{.underline} In her work with Indigenous women

describes how the Indigeneity of migrants is erased when they cross the
border into the US and are categorised as Guatemalan or Mexican
nationals: "The erasure of Indigenous migrants' identity as Indigenous
people is one in a long series of technologies used by settler states to
eliminate Indigenous people, and as scholars we should not participate
in reifying settler-imposed national borders in ways that facilitate
such erasures". Building on
Coulthard's ([2014](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1111/anti.12830#anti12830-bib-0012))
"grounded normativity", Byrd gives us the language of arrivants,
subverting settler-enslaver categories with a more generous reading of
land and its ability to enable movement. [Byrd's "grounded
relationalities" acknowledges Black and Indigenous people's relation to

casually disregarded. **[[Reductions limit our understanding of the

#### Revolutionary acts of indigenous resistance and black resistance must work together to combat the colonial structure as a collective movement of struggle

[On October, 4, 2013 Herman Wallace, an Afrikan Freedom Fighter, died in
the United States after being held in solitary confinement for 42 years.
On October 7, 2013, Indigenous groups joined in an international day of
action, to "proclaim the importance of indigenous sovereignty" and to
mark the 250th anniversary of the Royal Proclamation: a document claimed
to be both a foundational recognition of Indigenous rights in Canada and
"a British declaration of ownership."Two separate days and two seemingly
disconnected struggles. [In order for our stories not to die in the
silences that separate them, our movements must]{.mark} [move
toward]{.mark} what Pamela Palmater has called [the "fundamental change
that is needed to keep the status quo from killing our people." **We
must flip the script of our seemingly isolated struggles by connecting
the pathways that transcend colonial borders**]{.mark}, and by
reflecting on the strategies we are employing in our shared struggles
for freedom]{.underline}. The rallying cry of the Idle No More movement
first surfaced online in November 2012. Since then little has changed.
Bill C-45 --- the Orwellian Jobs and Growth Act against which the
movement first arose --- has become law. The 13-point Declaration of
Commitments that ended Chief Theresa Spence's hunger strike has yet to
be implemented. The Harper government refuses to support a national
inquiry into murdered and missing Indigenous women. On October 7th, UN
Special Rapporteur James Anaya was finally allowed to enter Canada to
begin his inquiry. Where are we, as the Indigenous peoples of Turtle
Island, since the first wave of actions swept across public
consciousness? Herman Wallace was released three days before his death.
After 42 years of imprisonment, Federal Judge Brian A. Jackson ordered
his release on a technicality because women were excluded from the jury
in his trial. The release said nothing about the contradictions of a
legal and penitentiary system built on slavery and genocide, holding
captive an Afrikan activist fighting for the freedom of his people. To
mitigate the tragedy of Wallace's passing, many have tried to find
comfort in the notion that he might have found peace and freedom in
death. [But in what state are our struggles if we somehow find reprieve
in death?]{.underline} BEAUTIFUL, BUT THE STRUGGLE ISN'T SO LOVELY
\[A\]s architects of discourse and as builders of a movement, what do we
know about the bottom of the barrel? How is that place of knowledge,
clarity, injustice and violence reflected in our work? What everyday
choices would we make if we were accountable to that place?--- Alexis
Pauline Gumbs Colonialism, displacement, and the violence of the state
has Afrikan communities under continual siege. [The bottom of the barrel
for Afrikans is a place of abject poverty, alienation from ancestral
histories, and a place where every 28 hours an Afrikan person in the
United States is murdered.]{.underline} The everyday survival of
Afrikans, in a world that sees us as valuable only in terms of profit
margins, is a revolutionary act in and of itself. **[But we must
constitute our revolutionary struggles beyond just
survival.]{.underline}** What everyday choices are we making as Afrikan
communities? [What structures of governance are we creating or
replicating? How do these structures affect our fight for
self-determination?]{.underline} Afrikan communities are in a state of
emergency. Our [people are being killed in the name of ensuring the
growth of capital and, by extension, the systems of white supremacy that
embody its cultural hegemony. We are seeing these patterns from Haiti to
the Congo. The continual subordination of Afrikans is the basis on which
white supremacy flourishes.]{.underline} There is an inherent
contradiction in the fact that Afrikans' continue to seek refuge from
this violence by imagining our freedom within the state. As Sem Mbah and
I.E. Igariwey put it in their book, African Anarchism, "electoralism in
Africa \[and the Diaspora\] is merely a diversionary tactic used to mask
the transfer of power from one group of exploiters to the other. The
fact that countries such as Congo, Ethiopia, Angola, Mozambique, and
Malawi have lately installed multi-party electoralism is evidence that
it leads to nothing really new." As architects of discourse and builders
of movements, it is imperative that we shift our political paradigms and
begin to act on alternatives that can provide for the material needs of
Afrikan peoples, without further tightening the chains of our
oppression. **[[Our self-determination cannot be confined to systems of
governance that require us to always be hungry in order to
function.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Kai Barrow calls [this]{.mark}
contradiction "**[raw opposition]{.mark}**" --- **[a space that is
created when people fighting to be free must navigate the reproduction
of oppressive systems: "this contradiction creates a "raw opposition"
that is explosive]{.mark}**]{.underline}... As organizers, our challenge
is to identify the nature of our raw opposition and build/create within
the space between oppression and freedom. [We are charged with entering
the space of raw opposition with clarity, precision, and analysis,
passion, energy, and generosity." The choices we make as organizers, if
we were responsible to the explosive raw opposition, must incorporate
anti-authoritarian alternatives.]{.underline} **[[Our appeals to the
state are precisely what allowed our Afrikan Freedom Fighters to sit in
solitary confinement for 42 years to find freedom only in
death]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Our appeals to the state have gone
unanswered.]{.underline} We must do things differently. We must, as
C.L.R. James put it in his History of Pan-African Revolt, turn away
"from protests by asking for reforms, to protests by revolutionary
action." WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE CALL-TO-ACTION BECOMES THE ACTION ITSELF?
[The Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island must also turn away from the
endless cycles of protests and appeals to the state, by seeking new
forms of revolutionary action]{.underline}. Before the glazed-eyed
apathy of our media-haze became a stupor-induced refrain of endless
proclamations, calls-to-action, proposed mobilizations and incessant
repetitions of demands, there was movement. [Indigenous people have long
refused to be idle in the face of ongoing colonial violence. Our
resistance remains a precondition of our survival. And though our
organizational networks have expanded through the recent upsurge in
Indigenous activism, existing colonial power structures remain intact.
Indigenous resurgence continues to be met with equal and opposing force.
How are we enacting new forms of struggle in the face of state violence
and corporate coercion? The persistent survival of Indigenous nations
has long been perceived by settler society as inherently outmoded,
savage and obstructive. Yet **the seeds of our strength can be found in
the occluded spaces of this narrative of domination**. Indigenous
peoples' collective capacity to obstruct, to interrupt and ---
substantively --- to break from the destructive force of the colonial
status quo, constitutes much of our "raw opposition" and regenerative
political power.]{.underline} Our strength is constituted in a
pre-colonial Indigenous nationhood that remains rooted in our homelands
and territories, manifest in our laws, ways of life and traditional
systems of governance. Our power predates the state's official
revisionist histories. Indigenous nationhood exceeds the limits of the
settler imagination. The legacy of the Idle No More movement is to have
given renewed voice to this disruption. When the movement exploded into
public consciousness with the full force of our repressed histories of
resistance, our struggles were made visible: colonial Canada was laid
bare. And when thousands of our people lined the halls of parliamentary
buildings, malls and public spaces, our multiplicity coalesced,
powerfully, into the unitary force of a determined presence. We were
many as one. But emergent fault lines became visible in the silences
that followed. While some fight for decolonization, others continue to
pursue ideals of justice and freedom defined by settler paradigms of
state-based rights and recognition. Our movement has succumbed to new
forms of stasis. We have been coerced into accepting the false promises
of fulfilled treaty partnerships, revenue sharing agreements, Royal
Proclamations, and United Nations declarations. Networks of Established
Activism, and an accompanying phalanx of settler sympathizers, have
infiltrated our movements at every turn. And this defanged form of
contention is now performed through re-purposed protests, marches and
re-branded public demonstrations. The "Indigenous rights revolution" has
become a mechanical spectacle. Yet, facing this crisis of credibility,
[the rhetoric of sovereignty continues to be called upon to designate
all forms of Indigenous political action. Sovereignty is proclaimed with
every neoliberal utterance of selfhood, public declaration of presence,
and aphoristic status update.]{.underline} What happens when the
call-to-action becomes the action itself? Declarations of revolution
remain trapped in their own enclosed rhetoric --- abstracted from action
and severed from the very doing and becoming that are necessary for us
to produce alternative "possible futures". Action becomes the production
of affect, divorced from the more urgent project of transforming the
material conditions of colonization that have produced our oppression in
the first place. And as the recent crisis in Elsipogtog demonstrates,
**[[every assertion of Indigenous autonomy that disrupts the flow of
capital sparks a new round of state violence and
repression]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "THE LOUDER MY VOICE THE DEEPER THEY
BURY ME" Our organizing demands clarity of purpose in our actions in
order to mutually reinforce our shared struggles, as peoples and
nations, seeking to reorder our world. Actions that do not move us
closer toward these objectives have to be jettisoned. If we can accept
that raw opposition exists in the silences between battle cries and
spectacularized public sentiments, we can recuperate the power of a
potential found in interstitial disruptions of state-made memories. [If
we accept the current corporate form of Indigenous activism and Afrikan
electoralism as the basis from which to articulate our political
demands, we will encounter a form of colonial bondage which dictates
that the struggle for freedom be waged in terms that are already
accepted by state institutions.]{.underline} What does this freedom look
like? As George Manuel reminds us, "They say freedom has no colour. It's
pure white". Our survival as Afrikan peoples and the Indigenous peoples
of Turtle Island will be determined by how well we are able to build
movements not for the sake of their own motion, but with the capacity to
conceive and enact transformations of our existing political
institutions. The textures of this transformation will require us to
weave our resistance with fabrics of creativity and accountability.
[**[These dreams of freedom mean that our acts of resistance are
inextricably linked]{.mark}**]{.underline} as Afrikan peoples and
Indigenous Peoples of Turtle Island. But fundamentally, [**[what this
means is that we need to seriously, purposefully and with urgency begin
look to each other --- not to the state]{.mark} ---** for our
self-determination. As Kuwasi Balagoon put it, "freedom is a habit" we
need to start practicing.]{.underline}

[If this scholarship charts global extensions of US security concerns,
how is this assemblage of security and war theorized?]{.underline} Reyna
(2016) draws on a Marxist structuralist view of global socioeconomic
inequalities and contradictions. [He makes a case both for the
globalization of US warfare and for its imperial character from the
early beginnings of the United States since its independence in
1783.]{.underline} But he focuses in detail on the period from 1945 to
2014[. The most recent decades are described in terms of the
"situational fixation" on oil and terror]{.underline} (Reyna 2016, p.
309). For instance[, the US war in Afghanistan was an attempt to defeat
the Taliban and al-Qaeda, where they formed from elements of the
US-supported anti-Soviet mujahideen movement.]{.underline} But, for
Reyna, it is also [part of the "scramble" for Caspian oil that started
in the 1990s.]{.underline} Because this area was landlocked, "Central
Asian \[oil\] wars have actually been fought outside the Caspian Basin
in areas suitable for pipelines," [namely in Afghanistan and Pakistan,
as well as Kosovo]{.underline} (Reyna 2016, p. 412). Force is a central
category in Reyna's approach. But it is a complex construct because its
use is simultaneously the mark of a given system's expansion and
entropy. [Elites' **structural dispositions produce d´elire---a
constitutive anxiety that leads to violent action** where and **when,
for this elite, "peace fails" but which in turn does not resolve but
exacerbates socioeconomic and political contradictions.** In
Afghanistan, despite changing tactics and deploying new military
technologies, including drones, the US military intervention failed on
both oil and counterterror fronts]{.underline} (Reyna 2016, pp.
419--23). It is [such a failure that engenders what Besteman (2017)
terms a "security empire": the "imposition" of multiple security
regimes, in Somalia as her case in point, that are managed from the
outside.]{.underline} These **[security regimes are constituted through
the imperial logic of the US domestic concerns but with unintended
consequences.]{.underline}** She argues that it was the [US foreign
policy toward Somalia after 9/11 that enabled the emergence of Al
Shabaab as an effective anti-Western terrorist group]{.underline}
(Besteman 2017, p. 411)[. This action, in turn, made suspect, and thus
vulnerable, Somalian refugees in the United States]{.underline}. In
short, **[the incoherence and multiplicity of these security regimes
are, in fact, generative of the opposite: "spaces of uncertainty, fear
and violence"]{.underline}** (p. 405). This view stems from Foucault's
(2003) understanding of the foundational role of security for the modern
biopolitical state. If Reyna focuses on [security elites as agents who
decide on going to war, this perspective is about governance regimes
over various populations that are continuous across "multiple and often
interlocking spatial scales" that branch out from body, family,
neighborhood, city, and region to the national and the global and, in
turn, generating these spatial scales themselves]{.underline} (Gluck &
Low 2017, p. 285). There is a homology between these ¨ spaces and
scales, but it is relative. This perspective does not constitute a
"Russian doll model of a fixed and nested hierarchy" but one of
criss-crossing flows, linkages, and horizontal networks (p. 285; see
also Fawaz & Bou Akar 2012, Goldstein et al. 2010). It is also
hierarchical; its relatively homologous base is to ensure, however
improbably, that there is no violence, whereas its top is to ensure that
it can exercise violence. [We see a Weberian monopoly of legitimate
violence distributed unevenly in these spaces---hence the concept of
"empire" in the singular rather than that of multiple "empires." A
military isomorphism developed along these spatial scales]{.underline}
(Pretorius 2008) in what one may call security metrology, but of course
it is not for all kinds of arms. A relative homol[ogy may blur the
distinction between domestic and international states of security, but
other distinctions are clear: There are constitutive acts of warfare
that some agents, such as Reyna's elites, can legitimately do and that
others cannot and should not.]{.underline} Hardt & Negri (2000) identify
the Christian concept of the just war in the face of the enemy that
represents a moral as well as a military threat as underpinning this
monopoly of violence. But it is Agamben (2005) who had been influential
in linking these forms of governance and specific means of warfare.
Drawing on Schmitt's Political Theology, he highlighted the
extralegality as a conceptual foundation of sovereignty, making it
possible to address ethnographically the new reality of war, e.g., the
unaccountability of its brutality, subcontacting, violations of human
rights, use of foreign territories for prisons and violent
interrogation, etc. This approach has been useful for understanding the
beginning of the War on Terror. But both this war's duration and its
geopolitical effects---some revealed by the ethnographies of war that I
discuss here and some that are still to be explored---challenge the
analytic developed by Agamben. First, this perspective assumes a
singularity of the concept of sovereignty. Here, the work of Asad (2007)
on suicide bombing is suggestive of alternative views of sovereignty as
well as of dangers of reading such alterity through a Euro-American
lens, whether Orientalist or Agamben-inspired. Not all contemporary
forms of citizenship are grounded in the distinction of z¯o¯e and
bios---of bare or "natural" life versus "full" or "good" life. Not all
contemporary forms of sovereignty have a legalistic
foundation---specifically, the Roman law to which [the state of
emergency is a state of exception.]{.underline} Kalinin argues that the
contemporary language of the Russian state is Bakhtinian as it draws on
the notion of the outside that is nonfinalizable and thus unaccountable
but not exceptional. He exemplifies this concept of the nonfinalizable
with a statement of Russia's Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu about the
presence of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine: "It's very difficult to
look for a black cat in a dark room, especially if there's not any cat.
And it's\...stupid to look for a cat \[there\], if the cat is smart,
bold and polite" (Kalinin 2017, p. 5). This statement simultaneously
denies and admits, jokes and does not joke. The phrase "polite people"
has become a euphemism for Russian troops in Crimea during its 2014
annexation. Second, in the hybrid peace that has emerged as a result of
this warfare and global security regimes, these different forms of
sovereignty are mutually constituted. [The argument that Besteman (2017)
makes with regard to Al Shabaab in Somalia as engendered by US foreign
policy is applicable to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
(ISIS).]{.underline} The comment by Sergey Shoigu that Kalinin discusses
is intended for a domestic audience. But if it implies at all the issue
of international legitimacy of recent military interventions, it is only
to question who exactly is the sovereign who decides on exceptions. In
turn, Vladimir Putin's geopolitical statements beginning with those from
his speech at the 2007 Munich Security Conference consistently called
into question the legitimacy of Western interventions from Kosovo to
Iraq and Libya. But he also used these interventions to shape his own
idiom of Russian sovereignty and its zone of influence (Russkii
mir)---and not just to take Western interventions as a mark of a "new
normalcy," to borrow a 2001 phrase from US Vice President Dick Cheney,
and not just to assert that the "theater of operations" that this "new"
normalcy inaugurates (Masco 2014, pp. 7--8) is not a single-actor stage,
but also to ground it in the narrative of the "old" normalcy of the
Soviet and Russian imperial legacies. Third, the ethnography of war that
I have discussed has raised doubts about whether this view of
sovereignty is not contingent on "Schmittean politics" in which both
sovereignty and security are territorially bound. Masco makes this point
by drawing on the political philosopher [Carlo Galli: Globalization is
the epoch in which the State no longer protects its citizens from
external turbulence. The principle of protego ergo obligo ("protection,
therefore obedience") was the load-bearing column of modern politics,
but in the global age, anything can happen anywhere, at any moment,
precisely because the State no longer filters disorder from the external
environment (terrorist acts, migratory flows, the movement of capital)
and is no longer capable of transforming it into internal
peace.]{.underline} (Galli 2010, p. 158, cited in Masco 2014, pp.
35--36). [Yet even if the state's goal remains this filtering of
disorder, this simply cannot be achieved by a global extension of
domestic security.]{.underline} As Gusterson (2016) demonstrates,
**[drone warfare and global surveillance technologies, while creating a
global panoptic space, are not accompanied by a territorial rule aimed
at transforming this gaze into disciplinary power. These technologies of
global vision are deployed to guard security within select red lines and
to do so by pointed and "nomadic" interventions (see on this further
below).]{.underline}** However, the recent shape of [the "external
environment" to which Galli refers is not simply global. It constitutes
distinct territorial patterns of sources of danger and targets of
military interventions.]{.underline} For instance, Reyna grounds the
decision of US security elites to go to war in what he calls "Shultzian
Permission." This principle takes its cue from US Secretary of State
George Shultz's comments about one of the occasions when the Reagan
administration resorted to violence: "If nothing else worked, the use of
\[military\] force was necessary" (Reyna 2016, p. 45). War is a certain
time when politics fails. However, this is not just time but also space.
George Shultz's case in point was not the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics (USSR) but Grenada and Panama. Politics has not (as yet)
failed in the relations between nuclear powers and in relations between
nuclear powers and strong nonnuclear states, such as Turkey. The United
States does not conduct undeclared drone warfare against Russia or
China. [There are places, however, where one can afford to have politics
fail and where one can also afford significant enemy casualties while
reducing one's own to a minimum.]{.underline} This worldview is
entrenched geopolitically as well as culturally and assumes a
hierarchical division of spaces and populations. It was this that
Schmitt (2006) has put as nomos: order that constitutes order, an ordo
ordinans or "order of ordering" (p. 78). In other words, I argue that
the analytical purchase of a "Schmittean politics" looks different if it
does not privilege Schmitt's Political Theology and The Concept of the
Political but incorporates his other writing as well.

#### Now is the time to rethink the way we think about outer space by shifting to an indigenous engagement with it

Indigenous Engagement with 'Space' \[image omitted\] \"River of Souls\"
by Carl Gawboy (as published in Indian Country Today, 4/2/16) I want to
now turn our attention towards the possibilities that exist regarding
Indigenous engagement with outer space. After all, the timing could not
be more urgent to do so---we are now at a point where after generations
and generations of building the myth that America was built out of
nothing, we are now ready to resume the project of extending the reach
of American military and economic might in space. To be fair, there are
plenty of advances that can be made scientifically with a renewed focus
on space exploration. However, history shows us that [[space exploration
has been historically tied to military hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark},
and there is nothing in Mr. Trump's temperament or attitude towards a
re-engagement with space that suggest that his push toward the stars
will be anything different. A sustained conversation needs to be
had---will this exploration be ethical and beneficial to all Americans?
One potential avenue of [[Indigenous involvement comes through the
active involvement of Indigenous peoples and Indigenous perspectives in
space exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course. This involvement can
be possible through viewing outer space through a 'decolonial' lens, for
instance. [Astronomers]{.underline} such as Prescod-Weinstein and
Walkowicz [have spoken about the need to [avoid replicating colonial
frameworks of occupation and use of space]{.mark}]{.underline} when
exploring places such as Mars, for example (Mandelbaum, 2018). The rise
of logics of resource extraction in outer-space bodies have led to
engagements by other academics such as Alice Gorman on the agency and
personhood of the Moon. Collaborations between Indigenous people and
space agencies such as NASA help provide the Indigenous perspective
inside space exploration and the information that is gleaned from it,
with implications both in space and on a Earth that is dealing with
climate crisis (Bean, 2018; Bartels, 2019). Another potential avenue of
engagement with Indigenous methodologies and epistemologies related to
space comes with engaging with Indigenous thinkers who are already
deeply immersed into explorations of Indigenous 'space' here on
Earth---the recent works of Indigenous thinkers such as Waziyatawin
(2008) Leanne Betasamosake Simpson (2017), Natchee Blu Barnd (2018) and
others provide a unique viewpoint into the ways that Indigenous peoples
make and remake space---perhaps this can provide another blueprint for
how we might engage with space beyond Earth. And that is just the work
that exists within the academic canon. [In[digenous people have always
been engaged with the worlds beyond the Earth, in ways that often stood
counter to accepted 'settler' conventions of space exploration]{.mark}
(Young, 1987). In one example, when asked about the Moon landings,
several Inuit said, \"We didn\'t know this was the first time you white
people had been to the moon. Our shamans have been going for
years.]{.underline} They go all the time\...We do go to visit the moon
and moon people all the time. The issue is not whether we go to visit
our relatives, but how we treat them and their homeland when we go
(Young, 1987: 272)." In another example, turning to my own people[, the
Ojibwe, we have long standing cultural connections to the stars that
influence storytelling, governance, and religious tenets]{.underline}
(CHIN, 2003). This engagement continues through to the present day, and
points to a promising future. [A new generation of Indigenous artists,
filmmakers, and writers are beginning to create works that place the
Indigenous individual themselves into narratives of space travel and
futurity, unsettling existing settler notions of what our future in
space might look like]{.underline}. As Leo Cornum (2015) writes,
"[[Outer space, perhaps because of its appeal to our sense of endless
possibility, has become the imaginative site for re-envisioning how
black, indigenous and other oppressed people can relate to each other
outside of and despite the colonial gaze]{.mark}."]{.underline} \[image
omitted\] (Photo Credit: Indigenous Education Institute) These previous
examples should serve as a reminder that the historical underpinnings of
our great national myth are built upon shaky intellectual ground---we
need to be honest about this. America did not just spring forth out of
nothing; it came from the brutal occupation and control of Native lands.
Despite the best efforts of the settler state, Native people are still
here, we still exist and make vital contributions to both our tribal
communities and science. We cannot expect Donald Trump to turn his back
on the national myth of what made the United States the United
States---in his mind, this is the glorious history of what made America
great in the past. And it should serve as no surprise that Trump and
others wish to extend this history into outer space. Even when Trump's
days in the White House are over[, [the settler colonial logics that
underpin our engagement with land on Earth will still loom large over
the ways that we may]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[engage with
outer space]{.mark}.]{.underline} But for those of us who do work in
Indigenous geographies and Indigenous studies, [it becomes even more
vital that we heed the calls of Indigenous thinkers inside and outside
formal academic structures, validate Indigenous histories, and push to
deconstruct the American settler myth and to provide a new way of
looking at the stars, especially at a crucial moment where the settler
state turns its gaze towards the same.]{.underline} \[i\] While this
essay focuses on an American context, I highly recommend reading Alice
Gorman's piece "The cultural landscape of interplanetary space" for some
examples outside of the United States, such as the British/Australian
Woomera rocket range and its effects upon Aboriginal peoples.

#### Settler colonialism is an [essentialist framework]{.underline} -- in its desire to simplify the Native/Settler binary, it reproduces [epistemological whiteness]{.underline} and undermines Indigenous knowledge

**Andersen 9** (Chris, Associate Professor of Native Studies at Alberta,
"critical indigenous studies From Difference to Density", Cultural
Studies Review, Vol. 15 No 2 2009, pg. 80-100) //Don Markos

**[Champagne's abstraction]{.underline}**, imprecision and internal
contradictions **[make it difficult to produce definitive conclusions
about his work]{.underline}**. However, **[Indigeneity-as-different
constitutes a major staple of his argument and even a sympathetic
reading requires some agility to avoid the essentialism which grounds
it.]{.underline}** My point is this: Champagne's argument that the
'**[continued [emphasis on ho]{.mark}w race and [ethnic identity in
mainstream institutions]{.mark} tends to overshadow the less well
understood perspectives of an Indigenous paradigm [grounded in the
cultures]{.mark}, sovereignty, identities, land, and nation building [of
indigenous peoples'42]{.mark} [loses its relevance if it fails to
include a precise explanation of what the]{.mark} latter [terms
mean]{.mark} and how they differ from 'race' and 'ethnic
identity'.]{.underline}** **[His repeated [failure to delineate them
leaves little analytical purchase to deal with the complexities of being
Indigenous]{.mark} in modern, Western societies, either with respect to
how we identify ourselves, how we critique dominant, whitestream
representations or how we employ Western discursive authorities in our
daily struggles]{.underline}**. For example, **[Champagne proposes
that]{.underline}** '\[i\]mproving existing theories or categorizations
\[of Western disciplines\] will involve significant revision, and it is
doubtful that existing theories can conceptualize or explain the
cultural, land, self-government, and col- onial histories of Indigenous
nations';^43^ and further, that '**[[most]{.mark} current [theories do
not provide powerful enough tools for explaining the Indigenous
experience]{.mark}']{.underline}**.^44^ **[One of many questions which
arise from such statements]{.underline}**, of course, **[is the extent
to which Indigenous studies]{.underline}**---which must necessarily
**[place itself within the same academic relations of power that shape
'Western' disciplines]{.underline}**---**[can under any circumstances
cash the kind of cheque Champagne is writing on its
behalf]{.underline}** (more on this in part three). Of more immediate
concern: **[given that [Native studies must operate within the forms of
power and]{.mark} associated [conditions of possibility]{.mark} that
characterise other academic disciplines, what allows it to step outside
in ways the other disciplines cannot? For Champagne]{.underline}**, it
is our valorisation of Indigenous epistemologies. Given the centrality
of his criticism of Western concepts, his positioning of their central
terms deserves to be quoted in their full length, pre- cisely because
they explicate the conceptual bases from which he launches his critique
of Western disciplines: race: 'Race and critical race theories focus on
marginalization of socially conceived racial groups and provide
critiques of dominant group methods of oppression and control \...
**[[the focus of race and critical race theories tends to assume
achievement of equality and inclusion into US
society]{.underline}]{.mark}** as a primary goal.

#### Sweeping theories of radical indigenous ontological difference ignore the [nuances]{.underline} of [actual struggles]{.underline} that [strategically repurpose settler categories]{.underline} 

**Rosenow, 19**---Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Oxford
Brookes University (Doerthe, "Decolonising the Decolonisers? Of
Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy and Beyond," Global
Society, 33:1, 82-99)

Despite the force and importance of this argument, I have felt slightly
uneasy when reading those conclusions. [[Focusing on **radical
ontological difference**]{.mark} can **easily [lead]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} a **romanticised [reification]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} other
peoples' [difference]{.mark} that is **[in danger of ignoring
actual]{.mark} political [struggles]{.mark}** [and **demands on the
ground**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Cusicanqui argues, [[those]{.mark}
struggles **[might]{.mark} very well [emerge]{.mark}** [out of an
"**indigenous modernity**", **rather than**]{.mark} **an
[insistence]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the **right to one's
[difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By this she means that [[some
Indigenous people]{.mark} aim to **[formulate a hegemonic
vision]{.mark}** for how to structure a society that is **[valid for
everyone]{.mark}** (Indigenous **AND** non-Indigenous)]{.underline}:
they work for a society that is in their "image and likeness",
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[**use modern notions** such as
"**citizenship**"]{.mark} for this purpose, [rather than
**rejecting**]{.mark} **the latter [as irreconcilable]{.mark} with one's
own world**]{.underline}.39 By contrast, [some]{.underline} North
American Indigenous [intellectuals call for an Indigenous
"**resurgence**" that, **rather than seeking hegemony**, altogether
**turns away from seeking recognition** by wider (colonial)
"society"]{.underline}. As Leanne Betasamosake Simpson points out, [in
such "resurgent mobilization ... there is **virtually no room for white
people**".]{.underline} 40 But my unease was also emerging from
something else, which is what I want to focus on in this article: the
problem that encounters and conflicts are yet again made sense of within
overarching structures of knowledge production rather than cultivation
(despite the intention to do otherwise). As de la Cadena herself makes
clear in the quotation above, what is encountered as "different" is
inevitably described "in forms that I could understand" (my
emphasis)---even whilst simultaneously recognising that one's
description does not capture what the encountered practices actually do.
Sense-making, for de la Cadena, takes place at what could be called two
levels: At a first level, there is the inevitable process of making
sense of an alienating affective experience on the spot, from within
one's own framework of understanding the world. At a second level, then,
de la Cadena attempts to make legible her grappling and
not-understanding in the context of a book for an academically literate
and interested audience---in other words, in the writing-up of her
ethnographic research. In Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's case, given
that their articles do not aim to make an empirical contribution,
sense-making takes place at what could be called a third level: what is
drawn upon is the understanding that emerged out of the ethnographic
work of others, which is brought into conversation with various bodies
of theoretical work in order to make a conceptual contribution. This
takes place via the coining of central concepts and the outlining of
all-encompassing frameworks that are meant to help us understand the
analytical, normative and political consequences of their argument for
scholarly work more broadly. The ontological encounters of others are
used to delineate the merits of ontological encounters in general, in IR
and beyond. This objective leads to a particular way of developing and
structuring a generic argument that makes it difficult to move beyond
sense-making frameworks that are necessarily geared towards settling all
those unsettling and disconcerting experiences that were the focus of
the articles in the first place. [This is]{.underline} also [the problem
of some **central decolonial work**]{.underline}. Drawing on Edouard
Glissant, Mignolo, for example, critiques the "requirement of
transparency" that forms the basis for understanding in Western social
science scholarship. He argues for [the "**right to opacity**" of those
located on the **other side of the colonial difference**]{.underline}.41
But this claim sits at odds with his simultaneous desire to write a new,
all-encompassing history of "the modern/colonial world system". 42 And
like in Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's articles, terms such as
"pluriversality"43 or "diversality"44 [are coined in order to have a
(**one!**) concept for a **similarly all-encompassing solution** to
domination]{.underline}. While de la Cadena is critical of her own
"anxiety to understand coherently (with which I meant clearly and
without contradiction"), and while she points out how [this]{.underline}
"was often out of place", 45 Mignolo as well as Rojas and Blaney and
Tickner [seek to place]{.underline} such [anxiety in **yet another
coherent framework** that **holds everything together**]{.underline}.
The question arises whether this can be any different in scholarly work
that is not directly based on ethnographic research itself, and which
can therefore not lay claim to a direct experience of ontological
controversies. This has become an important question for my own
(likewise third-level) work on anti-GMO activism. My work to date has
primarily aimed at making a conceptual contribution, and has relied on a
conversation between the ethnographic research of others and various
bodies of conceptual work, including decolonial and "ontological turn"
literature.46 But as I have already indicated in relation to de la
Cadena's work, when writing up their research for academic purposes,
even those who have directly experienced ontological encounters find it
hard to resist the tendency to conclude their work with stringent,
overarching, coherent conclusions that the Westerneducated reader can
grasp and "take home". In the next section, I will draw on two
anthropological ethnographic texts that are significant for research on
the GMO controversy to show how this works. The two texts that will be
analysed in the next section engage with the GMO controversy in Paraguay
and Mexico respectively, and they have stood out for me in the way they
manage to convey a sense of unease and grappling with ontological
encounters and conflicts. However, as the next section will show, they
as well end up providing a framework and conclusions that can
accommodate and make sense of the encountered ontological difference. 3.
Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy According to Susana
Carro-Ripalda and Marta Astier, much of the research that is carried out
in relation to the question of what smallholder producers in the Global
South truly think of (and say about) agricultural biotechnology is
unable to grasp the "ontological incompatibility" that exists between
the experienced human/nonhuman relations in small-scale agriculture on
the one hand, and the logic that underlies genetic engineering (GE) on
the other.47 This is precisely because most social research is itself
grounded in the crucial modern/colonial nature-culture divide: the
former can only be known through scientific means, while the latter can
be known through the study of social/cultural/political practices.
Knowledge about nature is about establishing "facts", which are either
true or false (i.e. nature as "one" is either correctly or incorrectly
represented), while knowledge about culture is about studying meaning,
which is necessarily (due to the existence of different cultures)
multiple. The question of whether GMOs do or do not pose a "factual"
danger consequently lies outside of the remit of the social sciences,
which therefore focus on the social dimension of statements that are
made about nature. But as Kregg Hetherington's reflections on his own
anthropological research journey in Paraguay make clear, this tacit
signing-up to modern ontology can lead to difficulties in understanding
the reality of the people one is interested in.48 Coming from a position
in which he took for granted the scientific distinction between (proven)
"fact" and "error", Hetherington explains how he "translate\[d\]" the
claims of the leader of a local peasant movement49 (Antonio) about the
truth of (GM) soy "killer beans" into something else: Until this point,
I had approached ethnography as an extended discussion with and about
humans, and I was less interested in beans than I was with what Antonio
said about them ... To be blunt, Antonio kept pointing at the beans, and
I kept looking at him ... I was comfortable saying that this was a
figure of speech, a kind of political rhetoric, or even to claim that
this is what Antonio believed, all of which explicitly framed 'la soja
mata' (soy kills) as data for social analysis, rather than analysis
itself worthy of response.50 However, Hetherington points out that not
believing in the truth of the killer bean did not prevent him from
"participating in Antonio's knowledge practices". 51 Becoming involved
in the anti-soy bean activism of the peasants, Hetherington became "part
of the situation" that made the killer bean turn into a crucial agent in
a court case that was brought against two soy farmers for the murder of
two activist peasants. As a result, killer beans became transformed into
a matter of national concern. Crucially for Hetherington, participation
involved more than joining the situation in spite of his lack of belief:
it led to him becoming immersed in a relation with both peasants and
beans that started to have a physical impact on him---in de la Cadena's
words, he indeed became "partially connected": 52 Beans didn't scare me
at first. Indeed, as a foreigner to the situation that gives rise to
killer beans (a Canadian no less), giant fields of soy were a familiar,
even a comforting sight. But it took only a few months with Antonio for
me to start feeling the menace from those fields. Soon, the sweetish
smell of glyphosate, recently applied, and especially the corpselike
smell of 2, 4-D mixed with Tordon, could ruin my appetite and make me
expect to see people emerge from their homes to show me pustules on
their legs and stomachs.53 Similar observations are also found in
Carro-Ripalda and Astier's contribution to the 2014 Agriculture and
Human Values symposium on the challenges of making smallholder producer
voices being heard in relation to agricultural biotechnology.54 While
most of the contributions to the symposium concentrate on how to tease
out smallholders' "real" voices in the most effective way, Carro-Ripalda
and Astier critically reflect on their own perceived failure to become
knowledgeable about smallholders' voices in their research on GM maize
cultivation in Mexico. It was through ethnographic fieldwork in rural
areas in Central Mexico, in-depth structured interviews, focus groups,
participant observation and, finally, a National Workshop in Mexico City
with over 50 stakeholders (including smallholder producers) that
Carro-Ripalda and Astier attempted to get a better sense of what the
actual voices of peasants in the GM controversy were trying to convey.55
However, particularly the final workshop, which aimed to create
conditions under which Mexican smallholder producers could speak on
their own terms about GM maize cultivation, "unwittingly reproduced the
conditions of exclusive, techno-scientific and regulatory spaces". 56
The public discourse that centres on questions of safety, science,
possibilities of regulation and problems of potential contamination, and
which is upheld by both GM maize proponents and antiGMO activists,
dominated the workshop debate. Even when present smallholders raised
different concerns, the discussion always returned to the previous, main
ones, as if those who had spoken differently "had not spoken at all".
The way that smallholders could articulate "their perceptions, ideas,
and desires" was thereby "severely limited". 57 Carro-Ripalda and Astier
are focused on the dominance of one particular (techno-scientific,
regulatory) discourse that, they maintain, disabled smallholder voices
engaged in different discourses from speaking up or, when speaking, from
being heard. In other words, smallholders were unable to adequately
represent their own understanding of what is at stake in the GM maize
controversy in Mexico. Considering what I have pointed out in the
previous section, based on Rojas, difference is thereby transformed into
an epistemological, rather than an ontological one: Carro-Ripalda and
Astier's argument is implicitly based on the assumption that, under the
right conditions, difference can be translated into something that can
be communicated to, and discussed with, other stakeholders. But the term
"ontological incompatibility" that the authors themselves use indicates
there is something else at play, which cannot easily be translated: the
nature of the relation of smallholder producers to their "land, seed,
crop, climate ... as told and understood by themselves"; the "central
place" that Maize continues to occupy in Mesoamerican pre-Hispanic
cosmology, and "the social and cultural significance" that goes along
with that.58 Carro-Ripalda and Astier's emphasis on the problem of the
dominant discourse, and the overarching Mexican structures of domination
this discourse is related to (such as the "neoliberal vision of the
Mexican agricultural future"59), makes it occasionally difficult to
understand what the problem of "ontological incompatibility" really is
about. At the end of the article, the place of the smallholder producers
whom they have engaged seems once again clearly delineated and knowable:
at stake for smallholders are, Carro-Ripalda and Astier argue, "their
lives as maize cultivators, their pride in their craft and knowledge,
and their ceremonially demanded right to information, choice and access
to their 'own resources'". It is not just about "retaining 'traditional'
ways of agriculture", as the anti-GMO movement maintains, but also about
claiming "political, economic and socio-cultural rights."60 Though this
certainly adds a significant dimension to the debate, it indeed simply
seems to add to, rather than radically challenge, the frameworks that
are conventionally used in the anti-GMO debate, as well as the
frameworks that focus on how to bring out and represent other people's
"voices" in a better way. Is this simply unavoidable when it comes to
the production of academic knowledge through/in academic writing? As
already indicated in the previous section, academic writing pursues by
definition the objective of enhancing knowledge and providing improved
insight into a certain situation. In its very structure, an academic
piece of work aims to resolve and settle, rather than to dislocate, to
destabilise, or to provide discomfort. Carro-Ripalda and Astier's
article is meant to render legible their own encounter of ontological
difference for an academic audience. Is it possible for the reader to
dig below these representational strategies, and to relate more directly
to their encounter of what they themselves call ontological
incompatibility? And which has led them to brand their final workshop,
in a quite un-academic way, as a "failure"? There are a few places in
the article in which their inability to put into words and arguments all
of "the complexity of experiences, relations and reasons that bind
people to maize"61 is more obvious. Becoming attuned to this complexity
is linked to the authors having to become at least "partially
connected"---to yet again use de la Cadena's phrase---to the relations
they attempt to trace. It is interesting, for example, that
Carro-Ripalda and Astier talk about "voices" as going beyond the
semantic level, as conveying something acoustically, and as requiring a
form of listening that shies away from asking pre-given questions. It is
also interesting that some of that took place when they literally walked
together with their interlocutors; precisely as it is emphasised by
Blaney and Tickner:62 Despite the shortcomings of the workshop ... we
felt that that, through our research on the ground, we had engaged with
male and female farmers, heard about their perspectives on GM and their
visions of a rural future, and accompanied them to work in milpas and
markets. So, what do smallholder farmers' voices sound like? What
meanings did they convey to us? We will provide here but a few of those
sounds and meanings ... 63 Despite returning to the idea of voices as
conveying "meaning" in this quote, meaning is related to sounds, to
walking together, to particular places with their own sounds, smells,
and colours. The sample of actual "voices" Carro-Ripalda and Astier then
choose to present yet again invoke an intricate sense of the
relationality of farmers and nonhumans: It is a joy to plant, getting
hold of the maize, of a beautiful cob which is pleasant, to go to the
harvest, to look at pretty cobs, all regular. Because this is what
sustains me. You can see the difference in the seeds straight away ...
You need to look at the cob and as soon as I grab it I see the
difference. It is the person who knows the seed the one who chooses it
\[for replanting the following year\].64 By contrast, GM maize is
associated by the smallholders whom Carro-Ripalda and Astier cite with
feelings of "artificiality, estrangement and distrust towards the
created object (the GMO) in itself, not only because of deep ontological
considerations ... but because of the political and economic motives
which are 'assembled' into it."65 Although the authors make a
distinction between ontology and politics/ economics here, their
invoking of the "assemblage" precisely shows how the latter becomes part
of ontology itself, and then (as in the case of Hetherington) impacts on
the sensual, bodily connection with the maize. Understanding the
relation between "things" in this way allows for an analysis of power
and domination that has at least the potential of moving beyond
pre-given frameworks; strategically suspending them in order to "sharpen
\[the\] analysis of exactly how power operates, how relations are made
and undermined, and with what consequences". 66 Genetically modified
maize is a problem because it is part of particular Mexican neoliberal
visions and strategies, but in the context outlined by Carro-Ripalda and
Astier, that vision is not only (and not even primarily) made sense of
through given frames of knowledge, such as Marxist theories of the
exploitation of labour, but sensually, through the way it disrupts the
(physical) pleasure and joy that has sustained the
farmer-maize-assemblage so far.67 GM technology externalises the maize
from farmers and estrange them from their ways of life; and it is only
through this externalisation that GM maize becomes perceivable as a
potential source of "contamination", as a danger against which farmers
need to "defend" their seeds.68 Now, some might counter that the
previous paragraph in practice only provides a fancy repackaging of the
two well-rehearsed arguments brought forward by many anti-GMO activists:
(a) that the problem of GMOs is an intrinsic property that makes it
"unsafe" (which activists try to scientifically prove), and/or (b) that
the fundamental problem of agricultural biotechnology is that it
estranges farmers from their traditional, ancestral way of life, that it
allows for their exploitation, and that it provides a further foothold
for neoliberal visions of how the world should be ordered. Both
arguments are grounded in modern ontology: the first goes down the route
of science (contesting "facts" about the "nature" of GMOs on the basis
of science itself), while the second goes down the "social" route by
either making a case for the need to respect cultural multiplicity, or
for the need to prevent economic exploitation. Some activists make use
of all of these routes and arguments. Famous environmental activist and
intellectual Vandana Shiva, for example, determines the alienating
character of the GMO to be an intrinsic property, while at the same time
depicting smallholder producers as intrinsic "'reservoirs' of local or
indigenous knowledge or as 'natural' conservators of biodiversity
through their traditional practices". 69 According to Carro-Ripalda and
Astier, this "unwittingly reinforce\[es\] images of smallholder
producers as passive, timeless and voiceless."70 This leads to precisely
the sort of romanticised reification of "difference" that I have
critiqued in the previous section of this article---paradoxically, in
this case, on the basis of an ontology that is deeply modern, as it
regards both "things" and "people" as ontologically stable and
classifiable. By contrast, the authors of the two texts I have analysed
in this section trace ontological encounters that cannot be contained by
the nature/culture dichotomy. There is no pre-given (social) theory of
neoliberalism and global power relations that dictates how the "voice"
of the farmer needs to be made sense of. There is also no pregiven
understanding of the "factual" (scientific) nature of GMOs. The notion
of radical difference that comes up in these two texts emerged from
precisely the "misunderstandings" that the encounter of ethnographers
with "other people" and their relations brought to the fore; but
importantly, it did not make any clearer to the ethnographer what the
"stuff" that grounded the misunderstandings is actually composed of.71
Yet, somewhat paradoxically, despite all this emphasis on
misunderstandings, incompatibility, grappling, failure, and critical
self-reflection of one's own assumptions---at the end of the day what is
left for the readers (at least if they do not explicitly focus on the
"ethnographic excess" found in the writings) is the impression that they
know more about "stuff" than they did before: that they understand the
situation better, that new knowledge has been produced, that the object
of analysis is more transparent than it has been before. How can this
subjugation of the encountered ontologically difference to academic
strategies of comprehensive sense-making avoided (if at all)? This
article itself is now coming up to what would normally be a
conclusion---i.e. the treacherous waters of nailing its contribution to
knowledge. Given that this article is yet again another "third-level"
engagement with questions of ontology and decoloniality, the question is
whether there is any way to avoid this pull of hegemonic modes of
academic knowledge production. Rather than providing a conclusion and
reiterate the core argument that the article has made, I will attempt to
finish this piece by raising even more questions, and by providing some
further reflections. 4. Turtles all the Way Down: (Further) Reflections
on What Questions to Ask The pull of hegemonic systems of academic
knowledge production is difficult to avoid. This is the case even in
writings that are directly based on ontological encounters and
controversies, and that reflect on the displacement that encountering
different ontologies has entailed. But as I have indicated, this problem
is even more pronounced in writings---like my own---that provide what I
have previously called "third-level" sense-making of ontological
encounters. The contribution of third-level analysis is usually a
conceptual one, which makes it by definition veer towards the general
and abstract rather than the concrete. In relation to the literature on
decolonial thought and the ontological turn, this becomes manifest in
three different (yet interrelated) ways: first, in the desire to provide
an understanding of ontology that enables a conceptualisation of the
former as multiple. Drawing on the work of Mario Blaser and Eduardo
Viveiros de Castro respectively, Rojas and Blaney and Tickner argue that
ontology can be thought of as multiple if reality is understood as
always being "enacted" or "performed". 72 This is what Blaser calls an
understanding of ontology as "materialsemiotic": one that defines
reality as "always in the making through the dynamic relations of hybrid
assemblages". 73 Pinpointing it like this is inevitably geared towards
answering the question of what reality as such, in general is about.
Secondly, there is an ambition to coin the general normative-political
project that arises out of this understanding with a singular concept,
such as the pluriverse. Thirdly, arguments about ontological
multiplicity and the emancipatory-decolonial political projects that
arise out of its recognition are written for an audience of a particular
discipline, such as IR: the aim is to provide a wholesale, general
rethinking, or, indeed, "reconstruction" of the latter.74 What sort of
questions drive conceptual work into that direction, and what desire "to
know" underlies the questions? According to Cherokee philosopher Brian
Yazzie Burkhart, for Native Americans "the questions we choose to ask
are more important than any truths we might hope to discover in asking
such questions". 75 By contrast, Western knowledge is always (at least
in the mainstream) propositional knowledge: "knowledge of the form 'that
something is so'". Here, knowledge cannot be verified by referring to
direct experiences: "there must be something underlying them and
justifying them". 76 Burkhart gives the example of the "routine
response" given by "Western people" to Indigenous accounts of creation:
"In \[one\] account, the earth rests on the back of a turtle. The
Western response to this account is simply the question, 'What holds the
turtle?'" This question makes no sense to the Native storyteller,
because the truth of the story lies in the paths to rightful action that
it outlines, rather than what it has to say about the "reality" of the
world. But when the Westerner insists on the question, the answer
finally is: "'Well, then there must be turtles all the way down'."77
Equating Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's work with European mainstream
(hence analytic) philosophy seems, at first glance, incredibly unfair.
After all, those authors precisely advocate the cultivating of knowledge
by direct awareness or acquaintance in exactly the way that Burkhart
identifies as typical for Native Americans. But on the other hand, the
framework that circumscribes their emphasis on the need for
"concreteness" is still an abstract one that wants to answer the
question of how things really are and should be: enacted, performed,
pluriversal, ... The point is not whether this argument about reality
and politics is right or wrong. The point is to recognise that it is
driven by particular questions that might make no sense in the context
of other intelligence systems, but that need to be addressed in an
academic article in order to make a conceptual argument compelling,
convincing and original for an audience that primarily sits (whether it
likes it or not) within a Western, colonial, hegemonic system of
knowledge production.78 And even when the contribution to knowledge
production is not primarily conceptual, as in the "second-level" work
that I have analysed in the previous section in relation to the GMO
controversy, the final argument that is made (e.g. about peasants'
economic and cultural rights) is yet again lucid and comprehensible to
an audience that seeks to comprehend "stuff" within modern parameters.
Where to go from here (particularly as a white, European scholar)? As
suggested by Tucker, one way might be to engage in much more direct,
ethnographic research, which would enable more direct experience of
ontological encounters. Despite previously-mentioned problems of even
that research not going far enough, there is without doubt more space
for providing a sense of grappling and dislocation if the originality of
a piece of work is not purely grounded in the conceptual contribution it
aims to make. However, not every scholar is able--- body-, context- or
funding-wise---to spend extensive periods of time in different places,
and the ethical and political pitfalls of researching "radical
difference" through fieldwork with---but often rather on---others have
been pointed out by Indigenous scholars numerous times.79 But even for
those unable or unwilling to do more primary, empirical research, there
is space to push the boundaries of what can and should be written about
(and how). For decades there have been attempts to provide "innovative"
platforms, for example at conferences, to talk about "stuff" in
different ways (e.g. through storytelling or artistic practices; not at
least by e.g. Indigenous peoples themselves80). However, these
"innovations" are still at the margins, and they will most likely never
be able to compete with acknowledged knowledge production outlets such
as journal articles and scholarly books. But even within the latter,
there is always at least some space to push for more open-endedness,
more reflection on the author's embodied positionality, more
auto-critique, more uncertainty and grappling (even if this is based on
reading about the ontological encounters of others). Although this sort
of embodied self-reflection on a writer's "situatedness" (which in my
own case means being "on the colonising side of a divide"81) has
obviously been advanced by many critical scholars for decades (including
feminists and post- as well as decolonial scholars), this article has
hopefully shown that [there is still (**always**) a **need to go
further**, in order to **more fundamentally challenge hegemonic**,
**modern/colonial modes** of knowledge production]{.underline}. The
sense of unease that I have outlined in section two was particularly
strong when reading conclusions that were geared towards making
recommendations for the discipline of IR, or for "international
politics", as such. [[Aiming to **make generic conclusions for**
]{.mark}**entire disciplines**, **political fields**, or [global
"**issues**" **pushes**]{.mark} **the generality** and
**[abstraction]{.mark}** of a contribution **even [further
away]{.mark}** [from an **advocacy of the
concrete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why, and to whom, does it matter
whether IR, as a discipline, or international politics, as object of
study, becomes more pluriversal or not? What are the actual benefits of
the concept of the pluriverse in the first place? Or to pick up the
theme of this special issue: why does it matter whether IR is, or should
move into, a mode of affirmation rather than critique?82 Why is this a
good question to ask---and for whom? [[This]{.mark} is **not just a
theoretical problem**, but it [has **real-life consequences for
actually-existing decolonial struggles**. The desire for **making a
generic argument** about relational ontologies]{.mark} and a pluriversal
politics [**harbours the danger of making a huge variety of demands**
and **struggles**]{.mark} **that often exist [in tension]{.mark}** and
**contradiction** [with each other
**commensurable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous demands for the
repatriation of "their" land might be at odds with the social justice
demands for redistribution and "the commons". 83 For Blaney and Tickner,
decolonial thought is commensurable with not just the ontological turn
literature, but also feminist and other critical interventions.84
Mignolo and Arturo Escobar advocate a transnational fight for global
justice and are enthusiastic about the potential of global movements to
achieve that aim together.85 Like Mignolo, Rojas explicitly draws on the
World Social Forum slogan "Another world is possible" as well as the
Zapatistas slogan of "a world where many words fit" to make her case
about the need for a pluriversal understanding of
emancipatory-decolonial politics.86 [While]{.underline} it can be argued
that [[this]{.mark} problem of **seeing all these struggles** and
**demands as commensurable** [goes back to a **lack of actual engagement
with particular** ]{.mark}**decolonial [practices]{.mark}** and
**battles**]{.underline}, what I have argued in this article is that
[[it is also related to]{.mark} the problem of **how** and [**what sort
of knowledge is produced** and **valued** in the Western academy:
knowledge that is **abstract**, **generic**, and **applicable beyond a
specific context**]{.mark}. Knowledge that is **driven** by the desire
to **know what is**.]{.underline} Knowledge that desires to know what
holds the turtle---all the way down.

#### Liberal democracy is self-reflexive and good

//Don Markos

Reflections on liberalism's future Current [international political
trends are complex and still in flux.]{.underline} History shows that
[there are no iron laws of democratisation]{.underline}, and [dominant
political dynamics can prove strikingly changeable]{.underline}. The
easy triumphalism of the liberal democracy agenda in the 1990s was
misplaced. However, [much [criticism]{.mark} now **[risks
over-shooting]{.mark}**]{.underline}.18 [The [Bush]{.mark}
administration [provided an easy dog to kick]{.mark}.]{.underline} But
[its excessive awfulness skewered the nature of conceptual
debate]{.underline}: **[[critical theory has become]{.mark} as [lacking
in self-reflexivity as the 'liberal imperialism' it everywhere
sees]{.mark} and excoriates]{.underline}**. A nuanced view is warranted
of the 'democracy backlash'.19 [[We should be attentive to a **lack of
flexibility**]{.mark} **in the conceptualisation of
democracy**.]{.underline} The consideration of a variety of models is
necessary and desirable. However, [the [evidence does not sustain the
suggestion that the most serious problem]{.mark} with democracy
promotion today **[is an excess of the 'liberal']{.mark}**]{.underline}
in liberal democracy. Indeed, in many places quite the reverse is true.
[[The most worrying problem is]{.underline}]{.mark} not practitioners'
lack of willingness to consider varieties of democratic institutions,
but **[[the lack of priority attached to advancing core liberal
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[As Western powers decline, this trend
is likely to deepen]{.mark} in the future]{.underline}. [Liberalism will
increasingly be on the back foot]{.underline}. In this sense, [[those
that assume that liberalism is dominant **risk lagging behind**]{.mark}
**the policy curve**.]{.underline} Dahl's definition of democracy may be
partial and narrow, but [can we really not say with confidence that it
is better than the authoritarianism that the West is still propping up
under the guise of respect for 'local values']{.underline}? Moreover,
the 'liberal overdose' argument is curious to the extent that since the
end of the 1990s a central thrust of debate common to development,
security and governance circles has been 'the rediscovery of the state'.
[[The stress on core liberal political norms is]{.mark} today
**[under]{.mark}- not over-[played]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It continues
to be the centrally important area where local reformers look to the
international community for support]{.underline} -- most commonly, in
vain. Deliberations over precise institutional configurations and
second-generation reforms are of a lesser order of importance. Michael
McFaul observes that some debates about the intricate sequencing of
reform and different varieties of institutional pathways look
incongruous, as the US can today do little to influence such details,
but rather simply back core democratic values.20 Yet it still hesitates
to do so, for all the standard commentary on US 'liberal imperialism'.
[[Liberal internationalism is]{.mark} still de-[legitimised **by
the**]{.mark} **pervasive [assumption that it is concerned]{.mark}
primarily [with mobilising military force]{.mark} in support of
democratic values;**]{.underline} it must be made clearer that
**[[military power is]{.mark} simply [anathema to the]{.mark} standard
[day-to-day agenda of democracy support]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
There are different levels of critique, which risk elision. One thing is
to argue that [[Western powers should support]{.mark} core [liberal
democratic principles]{.mark}]{.underline}, then from this base work to
build into their policies a concern with social equality, participation,
deliberation and religious identity. It would be entirely convincing to
argue that, while democracy promoters have advanced, they could and
should be doing more in this direction. But [it is quite another thing
to suggest that such aims should be supported against or instead of core
liberal norms]{.underline}. In practice, [[what many]{.mark} critics
appear to [advocate is]{.mark} not a cumulative combination, but [a
dilution of the liberal component]{.mark} in favour of other
forms]{.underline}. [They betray a core inconsistency: [they dislike
democracy promotion for being]{.mark} overly [intrusive, but]{.mark}
then **[advocate modifications that would make it more]{.mark}, not
less, [intrusive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is because most suggested
'alternative forms of democracy' breach the line between process and
substantive policy outputs -- they advocate particular ends, not just a
type of policy-making means. The concrete examples of European policies
demonstrate that it is hardly credible to 'accuse' Brussels of being an
unthinking citadel of blinkered liberalism. Indeed, in this author's
experience, conversations with policy-makers reveal this to be akin to
an almost unmentionable L-word. When so much doubt and ambivalence now
suffuses democracy support strategies, it is unconvincing to admonish
the latter for being uniformly, heavily prescriptive. Donors' tendency
to see democracy through the prism of their own political systems still
often surfaces. But in terms of the way that the 'democracy' in
democracy support is defined conceptually it would seem somewhat
redundant now to warn donors of the dangers of heavily-prescriptive
institutional templates. [[There is]{.mark} some evidence of the
**[self-reflexive policy-learning on]{.mark} the part of [democracy
promotion practitioners]{.mark}** that many critics assume is entirely
lacking]{.underline}. Indeed, [genuine doubt over the most suitable
paths forward has reached the point where some actors' policies are
reduced to immobilism.]{.underline} The problem is that while
policy-relevant knowledge has accumulated, it has done so in an ad hoc
fashion and has not been systematised into common or comprehensive new
approaches.21 The influences on democracy strategy of academic
traditions are eclectic. If we were to trace the philosophical roots of
European good governance and democracy support policies, it is simply
not the case that Locke prevails over all else. The breadth of democracy
assistance programmes goes way beyond the Schumpeterian. The stress on
the role of the state and the existential identity-value of the
political community found in many current policy initiatives finds
resonance (if unconsciously) in thinking that historically stood as the
antithesis to political liberalism. Such a line can be traced from
Aristotle's view of the political community as a biological organism; to
Rousseau's insistence that the general will embodies a mystical,
spiritual collective identity of the political community above and
beyond the will of the majority; through to Hegel's system centred on
the state as the organic embodiment of collective interests and
identity, the 'absolute' within which the individual finds his very
meaning. This is not to say any such strand of thinking would capture
entirely the ideas that inform today's foreign policies. However, the
pertinent point is that the underpinnings of these policies can be seen
in writers who were in combat with Lockean liberalism. The standard
European discourse on equality being more important than formal
political democracy has a direct echo in (politically) anti-liberal
Rousseau. Concerns over the 'tyranny of the majority' that inform
power-sharing strategies in post-conflict situations have a long line of
antecedent philosophers who inveighed strongly against the will of the
majority, from Aristotle through even to Kant (who was concerned with
the republican separation of executive and legislation but certainly not
with augmenting popular power against the aristocracy). Even Benthamite
radical utilitarianism shines through, in its concern with a strong rule
of law to restrain individual freedoms and ensure greater equality in
the furtherance of collective interests. If any modern philosopher is
the thinker of choice for today's discerning Eurocrat it is Habermas,
not the classic liberals. In general, deliberative democracy has been
most widely advocated as a means of situating abstract cosmopolitan
universalism within concrete and varied social settings.22 And all this
is quite apart from the more obvious cases of cynical realpolitik that
take their cue from the more violent illiberalism of Machiavelli and
Hobbes.23 [It is self-evident that liberal democracy now shares the
conceptual field with rivals in a way that it did not in the 1990s. This
may provide for vibrant debate and much-needed
selfexamination]{.underline}. But [it does not necessarily mean that
alternatives have superior legitimacy. [Allowing]{.mark} analytic [space
for a wider variety of]{.mark} forms and definitions of [democracy
**does not mean that**]{.mark} **[sovereign]{.mark} democracy,
[Islamic]{.mark} democracy, [tribal]{.mark} democracy [or Bolivarian
democracy are]{.mark} necessarily [superior or more in tune]{.mark} with
local demands**]{.underline}. [With the West accused of being
overly-prescriptive of a liberal form of democracy, [it would be
**subversive of the critique to jump straight into**]{.mark}
**advocating [other]{.mark} pre-cooked [forms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It
should be remembered that [a form such as social democracy is **just as
'Western' in it origins as liberal democracy:**]{.underline} [there is
no reason a priori to assume that it corresponds more closely to 'local
demands' in the way that is routinely and rather uncritically
suggested]{.underline} (however one may oneself desire socially
democratic outcomes). [If the ascendance of conceptual competitors can
add]{.underline} usefully [to the parameters of desirable political
reform]{.underline}, **[[it is not incompatible]{.mark} with this [that
they should]{.mark} at the same time [sharpen the West's defence of core
liberalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Critical
theorists]{.underline}]{.mark} skate a thin line: they [issue pleas for
a rethinking of democracy]{.underline}, but scratch beneath the surface
**[and what they really [lionise is undemocratic state-led
development]{.mark}]{.underline}**; [theirs is in fact not a genuine
concern with reconceptualising democracy so much as a pretty wholesale
questioning of the democracy agenda,]{.underline} dressed up in softened
discourse. [A central pivot of many such critiques is the criticism of
liberalism's teleological arrogance.]{.underline} But this centres too
much on one influential book published at one rather distinctive moment
in time24; liberalism more broadly and properly understood is not
teleology. Moreover, many writers argue against teleology and
prescription but then in the next breath confidently assert that social
democracy must be a superior and more acceptable form of democracy
outside the West and one which has a more sustainable long-term future.
This may be the case, but [they have no philosophical justification for
saying so without replicating the very same methodological features they
profess to dislike in 'liberal' tenets]{.underline} -- and thus
contradicting themselves. Clearly, more debate about different forms of
political representation would be healthy. [Allowing space for a
plurality of routes to and types of political reform would sit well with
the core spirit of democracy]{.underline}. However, while more
flexibility and open mindedness are still required in democracy
promotion, [there is a risk of being unduly defensive about the virtues
of liberal democracy's core tenets]{.underline}. **[[The problem]{.mark}
in many places of the world is [the absence of liberalism's core
values]{.mark}, not their excess]{.underline}**. Vigilance in the need
for democracy's reconceptualisation is indeed merited. But [[it would be
a muddled reasoning that took this]{.mark} to provide a case [for the
wholesale pull back from the]{.mark}]{.underline} (already anaemic)
[[support for liberal democracy's notion of]{.mark} fundamental
political [rights]{.mark}.]{.underline} We need more fully to understand
local demands. But [there is an automatic assumption routinely made that
such demands are for more diverse, anti-liberal political
forms]{.underline}. This may in many places be the case, but the
evidence must be assembled. One cannot simply assert this as if it were
axiomatic to the emerging world order; there is no reason for supposing
a priori that this is a natural outcome of the rebalancing of
international order. [[The evidence that exists
points]{.underline}]{.mark}, again, [[to a]{.mark} more nuanced
conclusion: **a [demand for the essential tenets of liberal
universalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [made relevant to and expressed
through the language and concepts of local cultures and
histories]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} A growing focus within
political philosophy has been on 'capabilities': negative liberal
freedoms need to be deepened but also combined with the locally-rooted
capabilities that ensure their effective realisation.25 The central
thrust of Locke's liberalism was anti-dogmatism and prudence. The irony
-- and, for anyone concerned over democracy's health, the tragedy -- is
that international support for a supposedly liberal democratic agenda is
today associated with exactly the opposite of these values. [[It is the
non-dogmatic spirit that liberalism must work to recover]{.mark}:
[liberal democracy]{.mark} as a system that]{.underline} (simply)
[[creates space for a variety of different local
choices]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Advocates and opponents of liberalism are
trapped in a circular debate over this matter]{.underline}: [while core
liberal freedoms are required to make such local choices]{.underline},
critics insist that those very liberal rights are themselves a
corruption of local autonomy. [[The imperative is not for liberalism to
cede to other creeds, but to work towards squaring the circle that has
always existed]{.mark} at its heart: [that is]{.mark}, [liberalism
is]{.mark} in its very essence [the rejection of utopian political
design]{.mark}]{.underline}, yet, if not pursued with care, it can
appear as an unbending utopia. This defines its challenge: can
liberalism stand convincingly as an anti-utopian creed whose own
propulsion requires courageous normative conviction? Can it strike the
Rawlsian balance of deepening a plurality of values without descent into
relativism?

### State Good

#### Their understanding of the state as [unified]{.underline}, [immutable]{.underline}, and [inevitably dangerous]{.underline} to Indigenous actors creates a [pessimism trap]{.underline} that [stifles]{.underline} Indigenous agency and activism. 

**Lightfoot, 20**---associate professor in First Nations and Indigenous
Studies and the Department of Political Science, University of British
Columbia, Ojibwe (Sheryl, "The Pessimism Traps of Indigenous
Resurgence," *Pessimism in International Relations*, Chapter 9, pp
162-170, SpringerLink)

[Pessimism Trap 2: The State is **Unified**, **Deliberate** and
**Unchanging** in Its Desire to **Dispossess**]{.underline} Indigenous
Peoples [and **Gain Unfettered Access** to Indigenous Lands]{.underline}
and Resources

[In other words, colonialism by settler states is a **constant**, **not
a variable**, in both **outcome** and **intent**]{.underline}. Further,
the state is not only intentionally colonial, but it is also unifed in
its desire to co-opt Indigenous peoples as a method and means of
control.

In 2005's Wasase, Alfred presents the state as unitary, intentional and
unchanging in its desire to colonise and oppress Indigenous peoples
noting, 'I think that the only thing that has changed since our
ancestors first declared war on the invaders is that some of us have
lost heart'.22 Referring to current state policies as a
'self-termination movement', Alfred states, 'It is senseless to advocate
for an accord with imperialism while there is a steady and intense
ongoing attack by the Settler society on everything meaningful to us:
our cultures, our communities, and our deep attachments to land'.23

Alfred's Peace, Power, Righteousness (2009) also argues that the state
is deliberate and unchanging, stating quite plainly that 'it is still
the objective of the Canadian and US governments to remove Indians, or,
failing that, to prevent them from benefitting, from their ancestral
territories'.24 Contemporary states do this, he argues, not through
outright violent control but 'by insidiously promoting a form of
neo-colonial self-government in our communities and forcing our
integration into the legal mainstream'.25 According to Alfred, the state
'relegates indigenous peoples' rights to the past, and constrains the
development of their societies by allowing only those activities that
support its own necessary illusion: that indigenous peoples today do not
present a serious challenge to its legitimacy'.26

Linking back to the aim of co-option, Alfred argues that while the
state's desire to control Indigenous peoples and lands has never
changed, the techniques for doing so have become subtler over time.
'Recognizing the power of the indigenous challenge and unable to deny it
a voice', due to successful Indigenous resistance over the years, 'the
state has (now) attempted to pull indigenous people closer to it'.27
According to Alfred, the state has outwitted Indigenous leaders and
'encouraged them to reframe and moderate their nationhood demands to
accept the fait accompli of colonization, (and) to collaborate in the
development of a "solution" that does not challenge the fundamental
imperial lie'.28

In a similar vein, Coulthard's central argument is centred on his
understanding of the dual structure of colonialism. Drawing directly
from Fanon, Coulthard finds that colonialism relies on both objective
and subjective elements. The objective components involve domination
through the political, economic and legal structures of the colonial
state. The subjective elements of colonialism involve the creation of
'colonized subjects', including a process of internalisation by which
colonised subjects come to not only accept the limited forms of
'misrecognition' granted through the state but can even come to identify
with it.29 Through this dual structure, colonial power now works through
the inclusion of Indigenous peoples, actively shaping their perspectives
in line with state discourses, rather than merely excluding them, as in
years past. Therefore, any attempt to seek 'the reconciliation of
Indigenous nationhood with state sovereignty is still colonial insofar
as it remains structurally committed to the dispossession of Indigenous
peoples of our lands and self-determining authority'.30

Concerning the state in relation to Indigenous peoples on the
international level, Corntassel argues that states and global
organisations, for years, have been consistently framing Indigenous
peoples' self-determination claims in ways that 'jeopardize the futures
of indigenous communities'.31 He claims that states frst
compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating lands and
resources from political and legal recognition of a limited autonomy.
Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of Indigenous
peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and legal
entitlement framing by states deemphasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek self-determination.
Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has concluded that states are
deliberate and never changing in their behaviour. With [this
move]{.underline}, Corntassel [**limits** and actually **demeans
Indigenous agency**, **overlooking** the reality that **Indigenous
organisations themselves** chose the **human rights framework** and
**rights discourse** as a target sphere of action **precisely because**,
as was **evident** in earlier struggles like **slavery**, **civil
rights** or **women's rights**, these were **tools available to them**
that had a **proven track record of opening up new possibilities** and
**shifting previous state positions** and **behaviour**. Indigenous
advocates also **cleverly realised**]{.underline}, by the 1970s, [that
the **anti-discrimination** and **decolonisation frames** could be
**used together against states**. States did, **in no way**,
**nefariously impose a rights framework** on Indigenous peoples. Rather,
Indigenous organisations and savvy Indigenous political actors
**deliberately chose** to frame their self-determination struggles
**within the human rights framework** in order to **bring states into a
double bind** where they **could not credibly claim** to adhere to human
rights and claim that they uphold equality while **simultaneously
denying Indigenous peoples' human rights** and leaving them with a
**diminished** and **unequal right of self-determination**]{.underline}.
But, because he is caught in [the pessimism trap of **seeing the state
only as unified**, **deliberate** and **unchanging**]{.underline},
Corntassel [**overlooks** and **diminishes** the clear story of
**Indigenous agency** and the **potential for positive change** in
advancing self-determination in a multitude of ways]{.underline}.

[Pessimism Trap 3: **Engagement** with the Settler State is
**Futile**]{.underline}, if Not Counter-Productive

[Since the state always intends to **maintain**, if not **expand**,
**colonial control**]{.underline}, and is seeking to co-opt as many
Indigenous peoples as possible in order to maintain or expand its
dispossession and control, [it is therefore **futile**]{.underline}, at
best, [and]{.underline} actually [**dangerous** to Indigenous existence
to engage with the state]{.underline}. Furthermore, [**all patterns of
engagement** will lead to **co-optation** as the state is **cunning**
and **unrelenting** in its desire to co-opt]{.underline} Indigenous
leaders, academics and professionals in order to gain or maintain
control of [Indigenous peoples]{.underline}.

Alfred argues, in both his 2005 and 2009 books, that any Indigenous
engagement with the state, including agreements and negotiations, is not
only futile but fundamentally dangerous, as such pathways do not
directly challenge the existing colonial structure and 'to argue on
behalf of indigenous nationhood within the dominant Western paradigm is
self-defeating'.32 Alfred states that a 'notion of nationhood or
self-government rooted in state institutions and framed within the
context of state sovereignty can never satisfy the imperatives of Native
American political traditions'33 because the possibility for a true
expression of Indigenous self-determination is 'precluded by the state's
insistence on dominion and its exclusionary notion of sovereignty'.34
Worst of all, according to Alfred, when Indigenous communities frame
their struggles in terms of asserting Aboriginal rights and title, but
do so within a state framework, rather than resisting the state itself,
it 'represents the culmination of white society's efforts to assimilate
indigenous peoples'.35

Because it is impossible to advance Indigenous self-determination
through any sort of engagement with the state, Coulthard also advocates
for an Indigenous resurgence paradigm that follows both his mentor
Taiaiake Alfred but also Anishinaabe feminist theorist Leanne Simpson.36
As Coulthard writes, 'both Alfred and Simpson start from a position that
calls on Indigenous peoples and communities to "turn away" from the
assimilative reformism of the liberal recognition approach and to
instead build our national liberation efforts on the revitalization of
"traditional" political values and practices'.37 Drawing upon the
prescriptive approach of these theorists, Coulthard proposes, in his
concluding chapter, five theses from his analysis that are intended to
build and solidify Indigenous resurgence into the future:

1\. On the necessity of direct action, meaning that physical forms of
Indigenous resistance, like protest and blockades, are very important
not only as a reaction to the state but also as a means of protecting
the lands that are central to Indigenous peoples' existence;

2\. Capitalism, No More!, meaning the rejection of capitalist forms of
economic development in Indigenous communities in favour of land-based
Indigenous political-economic alternative approaches;

3\. Dispossession and Indigenous Sovereignty in the City, meaning the
need for Indigenous resurgence movements 'to address the interrelated
systems of dispossession that shape Indigenous peoples' experiences in
both urban and land-based settings'38;

4\. Gender Justice and Decolonisation, meaning that decolonisation must
also include a shift away from patriarchy and an embrace of gender
relations that are non-violent and refective of the centrality of women
in traditional forms of Indigenous governance and society; and

5\. Beyond the Nation-State. While Coulthard denies that he advocates
complete rejection of engagement with the state's political and legal
system, he does assert that 'our efforts to engage these discursive and
institutional spaces to secure recognition of our rights have not only
failed, but have instead served to subtly reproduce the forms of racist,
sexist, economic, and political confgurations of power that we initially
sought...to challenge'.39 He therefore advocates expressly for 'critical
self-refection, skepticism, and caution' in a 'resurgent politics of
recognition that seeks to practice decolonial, gender-emancipatory, and
economically nonexploitative alternative structures of law and sovereign
authority grounded on a critical refashioning of the best of Indigenous
legal and political traditions'.40

Corntassel also demonstrates the third pessimism trap, that all
engagement with the state is ultimately futile. For the most part,
however, Corntassel's observation is that the UN system operates like a
reverse Keck and Sikkink 'boomerang model' and 'channels the energies of
transnational Indigenous networks into the institutional fiefdoms of
member countries', by which an 'illusion of inclusion' is created.41 He
argues that, in order to be included or their views listened to,
Indigenous delegates at the UN must mimic the strategies, language,
norms and modes of behaviour of member states and international
institutions. Corntassel fnds that 'what results is a cadre of
professionalized Indigenous delegates who demonstrate more allegiance to
the UN system than to their own communities'.42 In his final analysis,
he charges that the co-optation of international Indigenous political
actors is highly 'effective in challenging the unity of the global
Indigenous rights movement and hindering genuine dialogue regarding
Indigenous self-determination and justice'.43

Finding that states deliberately co-opt and provide 'illusions of
inclusion' to Indigenous political actors in UN settings, Corntassel
comes to the same conclusion as Alfred concerning the futility of
engagement, arguing that because transnational Indigenous networks are
'channeled' and 'blunted' by colonial state actors, 'it is a critical
time for Indigenous peoples to rethink their approaches to bringing
Indigenous rights concerns to global forums'.44

Imagining a Post-Colonial Future: Pessimistic 'Resurgence' Versus
the Optimism and Tenacity of Indigenous Movements on the Ground

[All of these]{.underline} writers [advocate **Indigenous resurgence**,
through a combination of **rejecting**]{.underline} the current
reconciliation politics of [**settler colonial states**, coupled with a
**return to land-based Indigenous expressions** of governance as the
**only viable**, '**authentic**' and **legitimate path** to a better
future for Indigenous peoples, which they refer to as
**decolonisation**]{.underline}. While inherently critical in their
orientation, these three approaches do make some positive and productive
contributions to Indigenous movements. They help shed light on the
various and subtle ways that Indigenous leaders and communities can
become co-opted into a colonial system. They help us to hold leadership
accountable. They also help us keep a strong focus on our traditional,
cultural and spiritual values as well as our traditional forms of
governance which then also helps us imagine future possibilities.

As I have pointed out here, however, [all]{.underline} three theorists
[are]{.underline} also [**caught** in the]{.underline} same three
[**pessimism traps**: **authenticity versus co-option**; a vision of the
state as **unified**, **deliberate** and **never changing** in its
desire to **colonise** and **control**; and a view of engagement with
the state as **futile**, if not **dangerous**, to Indigenous sovereignty
and existence]{.underline}. When combined, [these]{.underline} three
pessimism [traps]{.underline} aim to [**inhibit Indigenous peoples'
engagement** with the state in **any process** that could potentially
**re-imagine** and **re-formulate** their current relationship into one
that could be **transformative** and **post-colonial**, as envisioned by
the **UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples**.
The]{.underline} pessimism [traps]{.underline} together work to
[**foreclose any possibility** that there could be **credible openings
of opportunity** to negotiate a **fairer** and **just relationship** of
co-existence with **even the most progressive state
government**.]{.underline}

[This]{.underline} pessimistic approach [is **not innocuous**. By
**overemphasising structure** and granting the state an **enormous
degree of agency** as a **unitary actor**, this]{.underline} pessimistic
approach [**does a remarkable disservice** to Indigenous resistance
movements by **proscribing**, from **academia**, an **extremely narrow
view** of what Indigenous self-determination **can** and **should mean**
in practice. By **overlooking** and/or **discounting Indigenous agency**
and **not even considering the possibility** that Indigenous peoples
**could themselves be calculating**, **strategic political actors** in
their own right, and vis-à-vis states, the pessimistic lens]{.underline}
of the resurgence school [**unnecessarily**, **unproductively** and
**unjustly limits the field of possibility** for Indigenous peoples'
decision-making, thus **actually countering** and **inhibiting
expressions of Indigenous self-determination**. By
**condemning**---**writ large**---**all Indigenous peoples** and
**organisations** that wish to **seek peaceful co-existence** with the
state, **negotiate mutually beneficial agreements** with the state,
and/or who have **advocated on the international level**
for]{.underline} a set of **[standards]{.underline}** that can provide a
positive guiding framework [for Indigenous-state relations, the
pessimistic lens]{.underline} of resurgence [**forecloses much potential
for new** and **improved relations**, in **any form**, and is **very
likely** to lead to **deeper conflicts** between states and Indigenous
peoples, and potentially, even **violent action**]{.underline}, which
Fanon indicated was the necessary outcome. [The pessimism
traps]{.underline} of the resurgence school [are therefore]{.underline},
likely [**self-defeating** for all but the **most remote** and
**isolated Indigenous communities**]{.underline}. Further, [this
approach is **quite out of step** with the **actions** and **vision of
many Indigenous resistance movements** on the ground who have been
**working for decades** to advance Indigenous self-determination, both
**domestically** and **globally**, in ways that **transform the colonial
state** into something **more just** and may eventually **present
creative alternatives** to the Westphalian state form in ways that could
**respect** and **accommodate Indigenous nations**]{.underline}. Rather,
[it aims to **shame** and **blame** those who wish to **explore
creative** and **innovative post-colonial resolutions** to the colonial
condition]{.underline}.

[The **UN Declaration**]{.underline} on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(the Declaration or UN Declaration) was adopted by the General Assembly
in 2007 after 25 years of development. The Declaration [is
**ground-breaking**, given the **key leadership roles** Indigenous
peoples played in **negotiating** and **achieving** this
agreement]{.underline}.45 Additionally, for the first time in UN
history, the rights holders, [Indigenous peoples, **worked with states**
to develop an instrument that would serve to **promote**, **protect**
and **affirm Indigenous rights**, both **globally** and in **individual
domestic contexts**.]{.underline}46

[Many **Indigenous organisations** and **movements**, from **dozens of
countries** around the world, were **involved in drafting** and
**negotiating** the UN Declaration and are now **advocating for its full
implementation**, both **internationally** and in **domestic** and
**regional contexts**]{.underline}. In Canada, some of the key
organisational players---the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee),
the Assembly of First Nations, and the Union of British Columbia Indian
Chiefs, or their predecessor organisations---were involved in the
drafting and lengthy negotiations of the UN Declaration during the
1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In the United States, organisations like the
American Indian Law Alliance and the Native American Rights Fund have
been involved as well as the Navajo Nation and the Haudenosaunee
Confederacy, who represent themselves as Indigenous peoples' governing
institutions. From Scandinavia, the Saami Council and the Sami
Parliaments all play a key role in advancing Indigenous rights. In Latin
America, organisations like the Confederación de Nationalidades
Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE) and the Consejo Indio de Sud America
(CISA) advocate for implementation of the UN Declaration. The three,
**[major transnational Indigenous organisations]{.underline}**--- the
World Council of Indigenous Peoples, the International Indian Treaty
Council and the Inuit Circumpolar Council---[were all **key members** of
the drafting and negotiating team for the UN Declaration,
and]{.underline} the latter two, which are still in existence,
[**continue their strong advocacy** for its full
implementation]{.underline}.

Implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
requires fundamental and significant change, on both the international
and domestic levels. Because implementation of Indigenous rights
essentially calls for a complete and fundamental restructuring of
Indigenous-state relationships, it expects states to enact and implement
a signifcant body of legal, constitutional, legislative and policy
changes that can accommodate such things as Indigenous land rights,
free, prior and informed consent, redress and a variety of
self-government, autonomy and other such arrangements. [States are **not
going to implement** this multifaceted and complex set of changes **on
their own**]{.underline}, however. [They will require **significant
political** and **moral pressure to hold them accountable** to the
**rhetorical commitments** they have made to support this level of
change. They will also require **ongoing conversation** and
**negotiation** with Indigenous peoples along the way, lest the process
becomes **problematically one-sided**. Such processes ultimately require
**sustained political will**, **commitment** and **engagement** over the
**long term**, to reach]{.underline} the end result of [**radical
systemic change** and Indigenous state relationships grounded in
**mutual respect**, **co-existence** and **reciprocity**. This type of
fundamental change requires **creative thinking**, **careful
diplomacy**, **tenacity**, and]{.underline} above all, [**optimistic
vision**, on the part of Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. The
**[pessimistic approaches]{.underline}** of the resurgence school
[are]{.underline} ultimately [of **little use**]{.underline} in these
efforts, [other than as a **cautionary tale** against state power, of
which the organisational players are **already keenly
aware**]{.underline}. Further, by [**dismissing** and **discouraging all
efforts at engagement** with states, and]{.underline} especially with
[the **blanket accusations** that all who engage in such efforts are
'**co-opted**' and not '**authentically**' Indigenous]{.underline}, the
resurgence school [actually creates **unnecessary negative feelings**
and **divisions** amongst Indigenous movements who should be **pooling
limited resources** and **working together towards better
futures**]{.underline}.

#### The state is [inevitable]{.underline}---engaging the state doesn't necesarilly mean endorsing it---they devolves politics into a dogmatic void that the right will fill

**Choat, 16**---PhD in Political Science at Queen Mary University of
London, member of the Political Studies Association, Senior Lecturer in
the School of Economics, Politics, and History (Simon, "Marxism and
anarchism in an age of neoliberal crisis,"
<http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/32233/1/Choat-S-3223-AAM.pdf>)

The anarchist critique of Marxist organisational forms is unconvincing,
then, because it does not acknowledge the diversity of Marxist
approaches and it tends towards a theoreticism that sees a linear,
causal, and continuous line from theory to practice. Nonetheless, there
are significant differences of strategy between anarchism and Marxism:
it is just that these are less to do with organisation as such, and are
much more broadly to do with differing attitudes toward politics and the
state. Although **[[some]{.underline}]{.mark}** (though by no means all)
**[anarchists]{.underline}** have supported formal political
organisations, with rules, membership criteria, and even internal
discipline (Schmidt and van der Walt 2009: 247-263), they
**[have]{.underline}** traditionally **[[rejected]{.mark} [any]{.mark}
[engagement]{.mark} with the state -- whether it be voting, demanding
legal rights or protections, forming political parties, or attempting
the revolutionary seizure of government -- [on the basis]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} such [engagement]{.mark} [can]{.mark} [only]{.mark}
[end]{.mark} [up]{.mark} [replicating]{.mark} the oppressive
[hierarchies]{.mark} that they are fighting: either it will lead to new
forms of dictatorship and bureaucracy]{.underline}** (such as developed
in the Soviet Union); **[or]{.underline}** it will lead to parliamentary
**[reformism and]{.underline}** hence **[merely reinforce existing
structures and relations of power. If Marxists support]{.underline}**
(qualified) **[engagement with the state and even the formation of
political parties]{.underline}**, however, **[it is not because they
think that centralised hierarchies are desirable or inevitable, but
because they begin from a different understanding of
politics]{.underline}**. They argue that **[the]{.underline}**
**[anarchist]{.underline}** **[[abstention]{.mark} from state politics
[denies us the most effective means]{.mark} of political action: [we
disempower ourselves rather than the state]{.mark} when we refuse to
engage with it. [Making demands]{.mark} on the state [does not]{.mark}
necessarily [entail an]{.mark} [endorsement]{.mark} of the state, any
more than the demands that are made by employees during a strike are an
endorsement of the employer or of the system of
wage-labour]{.underline}** (Marx 1988). Anarchists themselves have at
least implicitly recognised the efficacy of political engagement by
occasionally supporting the policies of certain governments and even
participating in elections (Engels 1988; Franks 2012: 216). More than
this, **[abstention from state politics is not a genuine option: whether
we like it or not, [we are all already involved]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[state politics, because]{.mark} [we are]{.mark} all [always]{.mark}
already [submitted]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [state]{.mark} [power]{.mark},
control, and oppression.]{.underline}** Anarchists are concerned that
participation in conventional politics will lead to parliamentary
reformism. But this concern is itself ultimately premised on a tacit
acceptance of the liberal-parliamentary understanding of politics: to
claim that we can safely repudiate state politics simply by refusing
ever to enter a polling booth is to assume that 'the state' stops at the
door of Parliament. Marxists, in contrast, have argued that the state
apparatus includes educational institutions, the media, churches, the
family, and so on (e.g. Althusser 1971): simply in going about our daily
lives we are all therefore implicated in state politics. Given our
necessary involvement within politics, the question is not whether we
engage with it, but how we do so; even libertarian Marxists like
Holloway argue that engagement with the state is inevitable (Holloway
2005: 40). In contrast, the anarchist recommendation of disengagement
from the state risks a politics of withdrawal and isolation. There are
two related reasons why under our current conditions in particular the
Marxist willingness to engage in state politics is preferable to an
anarchist position. The first is the dominance of neoliberalism today.
Given the strength of neoliberalism since the crisis that it created,
there is a strong case for a certain pragmatism in our response. A
danger of the prefigurative politics favoured by anarchists is that it
dogmatically dictates an a priori exclusion of certain forms of
political action. For Marxists, on the other hand, **[political
[strategies must be decided according to particular conditions and
within a certain context]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In a context in which
private companies are increasingly undertaking tasks previously
performed by the state, **[[the]{.mark} active [defence of]{.mark} state
services and [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}** can be viewed as a
radical position to adopt: defending welfare provision, public pensions,
universal healthcare, and free higher education **[[should be
seen]{.mark} not as a reformist compromise with the existing order but
[as safeguarding the gains of]{.mark} class [struggle]{.mark} against
capitalist processes of accumulation by dispossession.]{.underline}**
This leads to the second reason for doubting the refusal of state
politics as a viable tactic under current conditions, which concerns the
specific role of the state under neoliberalism. The anti-state politics
of anarchism may have made sense during eras in which the state could
plausibly be presented as the main threat to freedom and equality:
during the period of nation-building and imperialistic expansion in the
mid- to late-19th century, of the rise of fascism in the early-20th
century, or even of the development of welfare capitalism after WWII.
But it has far less purchase in an era in which neoliberalism, as both
the official ideology and a form of everyday common sense, is
anti-statist. Put simply, the attack on state power too easily echoes
the rhetoric of neoliberalism itself (Taylor 2013: 735). When government
actors themselves are explicitly endorsing the retreat of the state,
then anarchist attacks on state power have limited efficacy either as a
tactical call to arms or as a convincing analysis of our present
conjuncture. In practice, of course, it is true that neoliberalism has
not dissolved state power. But nor has the relation between state and
capital remained the same under neoliberalism, such that our analyses,
strategies, or rhetoric need not alter. The nature of this relationship
between state and capital will be examined in the next section.

### Perm

#### Perm solves- only working through jurisdiction solves decolonization

**Buchanan 17** (Brenton, Society and Space Organization,
"Lumpy Space, Colonial Place: Jurisdiction As Infrastructure And (Post)Colonial Place Making In The Marshall Islands",
https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/lumpy-space-colonial-place-jurisdiction-as-infrastructure-and-post-colonial-place-making-in-the-marshall-islands)

In their work, both Lauren Benton and Shiri Pasternak examine the
fluidity of legal relationships through conceptions of jurisdiction
which overlap, entangle, and shift over time. As Pasternak explains,
seeing "[jurisdiction as a spatial category... \[allows\] for the
examination of the production of colonial space through the work of
jurisdiction]{.underline}" (emphasis mine. 2014: 147) Pasternak's
geographic lens positions law and space as political, as contested
categories that come together in constituting colonial claims to
authority; to colonial jurisdiction over others. As a result, layers of
colonial and imperial authority "become thicker or thinner as peoples'
movements through space produce new arrangements and negotiations of
power," (Pasternak, 2014: 149) bringing with them further systems of
domination. As unevenly asserted and applied across space and time,
[jurisdiction-as-infrastructure opens up a refutation of the
completeness of the colonial project. Infrastructure,]{.underline} in
this sense, [is understood not only as a 'structure,' but also as
'process'; one that works to produce other systems and
relations]{.underline}. This perspective highlights the productive
aspects of jurisdiction, rather than accepting legal authority and law
as removed from the space they claim. Instead, when framed as
infrastructure, [jurisdiction is shown to be a process of "overlapping
authority claims between Indigenous, state, regional, and private
interests, and it can help parse the ways in which these jurisdictional
encounters produce colonial space]{.underline}" (Pasternak, 2014: 146).
The importance of this emphasis on process and production is that, even
as laws are instituted and legal systems established, jurisdiction forms
its necessary and underlying infrastructure; "the power to speak the
law" (Pasternak, 2014: 148). Jurisdiction-as-infrastructure highlights
this claim-making, opening up law and legal authority as a contested
category. Mentioned above[, this approach refuses an acceptance of "law"
as a pre-spatial category, positioning instead not only the content of
the law but its claim to applicability over a given space as something
that must be established, and therefore maintained.]{.underline} As
such, law is produced through claims to jurisdiction, and by situating
it as such in the colonial process reveals uneven and contested
geographies of power. Law, legal systems, and the authority to impose
them become highly historicized objects, ones that are spatially and
relationally contingent in their production, enactment, and
perpetuation. [Through examining jurisdiction as infrastructure then,
colonial and imperial authority not only become, but already are,
contested and contestable claims]{.underline}. By asserting that legal
authority is continually produced, the voices of Indigenous claims and
contestations become themselves jurisdictional "lumps that betray
patterns of partial and uneven state sovereignty" (Pasternak, 2014:
148). The singular authority that colonial powers claim is instead
unsettled and made to compete. This [framework importantly resists the
perspective of the fatal impact theory, wherein the colonial encounter
produces a terminal "historical descent into a state of nothingness and
hopelessness]{.underline}" (Smith, 1999: 88) [of Indigenous cultures and
peoples, as well as reduction of the colonized to "the concept of "bare
lives" ...]{.underline} \[withdrawing\] all form of agency from the
bodies targeted by this violence" (Lambert, 2017: 13). [Its spatial
qualities belie the finality of colonial authority, as the emphasis on
the power "to speak" the law, rather than the law itself, allows for
non-colonial and non-state forms of authority to be
recognized.]{.underline} Jurisdiction works as a process over time to
establish and claim authority over space. As necessarily contingent,
relational, and historical, for this short intervention an examination
of the long imperial/colonial history of the Marshall Islands reveals
some of the ways that jurisdiction takes on "a quality of lumpiness"
(Benton, 2005: 701). [At the same time the contemporary work of the
Nuclear Claims Tribunal (NCT), established under the Compact of Free
Association (COFA), opens up space to discuss both the possibilities of
resistance through jurisdictional claims and the incompleteness of the
postcolonial project.]{.underline} Moving from infrequent economic
exchange with Spain (established through the Treaty of Tordesillas,
1594), German interests in the islands were recognized in 1885. However,
their relationship with the islands was primarily established in 1878
through a treaty with one local chief, granting them exclusive use of a
Jaluit Atoll harbor and trading privileges. The combination of
inter-imperial and German-indigenous relations positions, even tacitly,
indigenous jurisdiction over access and use of island harbors and
resources on a relatively even plane with imperial claims. Yet, in 1914,
when the Japanese seized the Marshall Islands from Germany during WWI,
it was not a renegotiation of a treaty between the new imperial power
and local chiefs, but rather seizure of one empire's land and
transference of control to another. Viewed as a German protectorate, the
shifted context meant that since "a state of war existed between...
nations... therefore the takings were legal" (emphasis mine. Benton,
2005: 705). As inter-imperial conflict, the transfer from German to
Japanese possession overlapped with German-Indigenous treaties. As the
former did not require a reconsideration of the latter, it implicitly
arranges them in a hierarchical legal relationship. Centering
jurisdiction as infrastructure, Japanese claims over Germany's imperial
relation to the Marshall Islands is temporarily troubled. If this
"transfer" is something necessarily produced, then by what authority
does Japan claim possession of the Marshall Islands, especially
considering the German-Marshall relationship was negotiated directly
with local Islander authority? Rather, these transfers should be seen
less as a shifting of powers but a cementing of certain legal
relationships that works to produce a privileging of imperial and
colonial claims over those of indigenous peoples. This did not equate in
a complete erasure, as much as the imperial/colonial project might
desire, but rather a layering on of different dominating relations. This
fungibility of (imperial) authority shifted not necessarily under the
auspices of a single imperial power, but rather across powers through
imperial jurisdictional understandings and transitions through conquest.
In this way, "territory... was constructed not just for empire but also
in empire, and at its margins" (Benton, 2005: 701). Divesting the
Marshallese of authority was not a foregone conclusion, but one produced
out of the very practice of empire. When the United States defeated
Japan in the islands in 1944, assertion of authority over the Islands in
1945 was in this sense a claim less in relation to the Marshallese
peoples, but rather against the Japanese empire. Perhaps an irony of
this shifting web of jurisdiction between imperial powers is found in a
statement from the UN in 1947 (itself newly established and working to
assert its own claims to authority) made to declare the Marshalls a
trust territory of the U.S. Not only was this the only trusteeship
"designated as a "strategic" territory," granting greater latitude over
the securitization of the region, but the UN declared the responsibility
of the U.S. to "protect the inhabitants... against the loss of their
lands and resources" (emphasis mine. Barker, 2013: 22). This language
implies a form of ownership by the Marshallese over the islands, yet
positions it as a subordinate claim to the paternalistic oversight of
the U.S. This reflexive maneuvering of possession and authority
constitutes a "cynical grounds for recognition" that "also entrenched
the subordination of Indigenous societies" (Pasternak, 2014: 159).
Through representing Marshallese possession of their islands, U.S. (and
UN) authority is asserted, structured, and simultaneously folds
Marshallese claims under this oversight. Though a shifting terrain, this
post-World War II legal relationship is predicated on preceding imperial
ones, and their own claims to "speak the law" in Marshallese lands. The
infrastructure of inter-imperial jurisdiction becomes productive of US
claims to the islands, as seized from Imperial Japan, as well as the
UN's claim to be able to designate a certain kind of authority over
them. The long historical process started with infrequent Spanish
trading, when understood though conceptions of jurisdiction over the
islands reveals the long production of the islands as colonial space,
privileging (primarily) Western imperial authority over Indigenous
claims over their land. This imperial history of the Marshalls forms the
centuries long preamble and pretext that established a legal context
wherein the United States could be "granted" the Islands as a strategic
territory under their trusteeship; pursuing sixty-six nuclear tests
between 1946-1963 and ongoing ballistic missile testing in the islands.
As the Cold War continued, the Marshallese of various communities sent
petitions through both US and UN channels to protest and improve their
position under US "strategic" oversight. Understanding these within the
productive infrastructure of jurisdiction, American legal authority and
aspects of the colonial dynamic are brought into question through both
an invocation of UN authority, and the very voices of the Islanders who
petition, protest, and contest. Within a broader framework of Cold War
decolonial movements, the basis of and imperial power to "speak the law"
became increasingly troubled. In addition to gaining periodic
concessions, tensions between indigenous movements and continued US
investment in the Marshall Islands as a military (test) site culminated
in the 1980s with negotiations for the COFA. As a victory for indigenous
sovereignty this nominally recognizes Marshallese self-government even
as it simultaneously perpetuates US military and colonial interests.
Following jurisdiction through the COFA, the establishment of the NCT
was to provide "jurisdiction to render final determination upon all
claims past, present, and future" (Pevec, 2005) regarding the nuclear
testing program. Given \$150 million for these ends, Smith-Norris (2016:
40) notes how the "finality" of this agreement also resulted in the
dismissal of all claims pending in the United States, as courts in the
US were divested of jurisdictional authority over these matters.
Although woefully underfunded, and the possibility of pursuing legal
cases within US courts being denied, the findings of the NCT function as
an avenue for pressuring the United States for further redress for the
legacy of its testing program. It is noted (Smith-Norris, 2016: 41) that
having awarded \$341,049,311 in damages to the Enewetakese alone in
2000, the findings of the NCT are not immediately actionable (though
payments are made as much as is possible). Instead, assessment of
damages, processing of claims, and the power to speak the law in cases
of redress for nuclear testing, contamination, and devastation has
become a new lump in the US-Marshallese relationship. Though quickly
running up against a limited budget, this shifting jurisdictional
geography opens up a site of resistance as well as a look into the
incomplete nature of decolonization. After an independent review of the
NCT by former US Attorney General Richard Thornburgh in 2003 and a 2012
UN investigation into impacts of the testing program, the findings of
the NCT comprise a mechanism of knowledge production about the legacies
of nuclear contamination independent from US oversight. As the
Marshallese continue to argue for adequate compensation through the NCT,
examining jurisdiction as infrastructural process through which colonial
and imperial authority can be asserted, its "return" through
decolonization belies the uneven power dynamics and systems that
continue to pervade colonizer/colonized relations. However, through the
NCT and its claim to jurisdiction over damages due to the Marshallese
people as a result of the United States' nuclear testing and colonial
domination, these contestations might be seen as more than an uneven
power dynamic. These claims to authority by the NCT, and by extension
the Marshallese people, are not simply petitions to US or UN law. They
are themselves claims to sovereignty that are one part of a larger
decolonial struggle, where the NCT's jurisdiction produces a new vision
and future for the Republic of the Marshall Islands. [It seems true that
the "decolonization" promised through the COFA and the establishment of
the NCT is not a recognition of an originary, total jurisdiction, but a
modified and contingent one that maintains other structures of
domination. Just as jurisdiction opens a recognition of the process and
contested nature of coloniality, as part of the postcolonial project it
reveals its own incompleteness. The ability of the US to deny
responsibility for the ongoing impacts of its nuclear colonialism and
payment of damages concluded by the NCT makes clear that jurisdictional
authority is but one of the necessary components for a true
decolonization]{.underline} of the Marshall Islands. Yet employing it as
a point of intervention can help reveal the contours of domination that
make up the lumpiness of imperial and (post)colonial dynamics. For a
historical approach, consideration of jurisdiction as infrastructure can
help to make clear the long duration, and process, of imperial and
colonial imposition and assertions of authority. Important to this is
that jurisdiction as productive of the colonial context and relationship
helps to set the stage for other forms and systems of power;
jurisdiction does not travel alone. For the decolonizing process then,
understanding it as infrastructure can reveal other forms of colonial
persistence. Even as jurisdiction is "returned" or recognized in
purportedly (de)colonized peoples, unequal power dynamics and
neo-colonial systems persist through other forms. Being productive of
colonial and imperial claims to authority, a site of contestation that
"actively works to produce something" (Dorsett and McVeigh quoted in
Pasternak, 2014: 151) it is also a process of multiple "things" in the
making. Perhaps as an ethical statement, this framework also insists on
hopeful potential and possibilities for decolonial struggles, even as it
provides a valuable critical approach to understanding the complexities
of colonial domination. **[Centering debates and claims worked out
through jurisdiction can reveal both the production and persistence of
colonialism, but also competing systems and visions of post- or
de-colonial futures.]{.underline}**

Theorising Decolonisation For all its attached redemptive prospects and
radical possibilities, it is important to emphasise that the meanings of
decolonisation as both a concept and political project are not just
broad, but also multifaceted and highly contested. What it means to
'undo' colonialism is deeply contextual (Jansen and Osterhammel, 2017).
While colonialism can be defined broadly as a relationship of domination
in which a people or territory is politically and economically
subjugated to a foreign power, actual colonial situations vary quite
widely from each other, depending on, among others, the particular
political systems instituted to maintain control, types of exploitation
and expropriation (resources, labour, plantations), relationship between
the metropole and colony and patterns of migration they compel (slavery,
settlement). [Projects of decolonisation accordingly take different
forms even if they are united by the common concern of ending or
overturning structures of domination instituted by
colonialism]{.underline}, which has historically taken place mostly
through the withdrawal of colonial powers and achievement of
independence for the colonised (Buchanan, 2010). Decolonisation speaks
to the aspiration of self-rule and its concomitant critique of
colonialism as the 'systematic denial of freedom' (Kohn and McBride,
2011: 6) and is therefore entangled with a variety of concerns, namely,
self-determination, justice, equality, freedom and solidarity against
colonialism and imperialism. As Todd Shepherd (2006: 3--4) writes,
decolonisation is 'a much wider concept than the mere "winning of
Independence" or "transfer of power"... It entails the exploration of
dreams, the analysis of struggles, compromises, pledges and
achievements, and the rethinking of fundamentals'. Traditional
literature on decolonisation approached it in terms of the historical
process that began in the immediate aftermath of World War Two in which
countries previously under (typically European) foreign rule
transitioned to constitutional independence (Buchanan, 2010).
Decolonisation was one of the most significant developments of the
twentieth century, radically changing the face of the globe from one in
which a small number of empires had dominion over some 80% of the
earth's surface to an international order based on the principle of
self-determination and made up of ostensibly independent states
(Hopkins, 2008). Scholars in this tradition have done much to illuminate
the wide-reaching structural transformations that accompanied
decolonisation, including the emergence of anti-colonial and national
liberation struggles at the turn of the century, shifts in world economy
that made the maintenance of traditional forms of Empire increasingly
difficult, the development of a 'Third World' political project and the
institutionalisation of human and civic rights principles that rendered
systems based on ideas of racial and ethnic superiority less viable
(Hopkins, 2008: 216). Yet, [the focus on transition has been critiqued
for its narrowness insofar as it seems to take for granted the meanings
of self-determination and temporally restricts decolonisation to the
moment of national liberation.]{.underline} Postcolonial scholars, among
others, have been at the forefront of this charge, arguing that
[decolonisation did not produce a postcolonial world per se, but rather
one that continues to be shaped in significant ways by the legacies of
European colonialism]{.underline} (e.g. Spivak, 1999). As Ella Shohat
(1992) has argued, there is no way of turning back from the world
colonialism set in play nor did colonial modes of domination end with
the formal period of decolonisation. From this broadened perspective[,
[decolonisation is the difficult task]{.mark} of tracing the economic,
political, social, cultural, relational and linguistic consequences of
colonialism and is therefore also an ongoing imaginative project seeking
'a new form of consciousness and way of life']{.underline} (Pieterse and
Parekh, 1995: 3) beyond the coloniality of modern modes of culture,
identity and knowledge more generally. While the transitional focus of
conventional scholarship is quite illuminating in the contexts of Africa
and Asia, for example, it furthermore excludes a great many
decolonisation efforts that have taken place and continue to take place
in other regions. This includes countries that remained dependent or
only achieved semi-independence as dominions, decolonising projects
carried out in territories never formally under colonial rule (the
Iranian Revolution, for instance) and -- as is particularly important to
our discussion here -- settler colonies that only partially decolonised,
whether by way of loosening ties with the Motherland or achieving
independence, but which continue to dominate substantial indigenous
populations (Hopkins, 2008). There is a significant lacuna in the
decolonisation literature when it comes to settler colonialism, which
has increasingly been recognised as a distinct form of colonial practice
-- and one that is particularly resistant to decolonisation (Veracini,
2007). As the transfer of an exogenous population to a territory they
intend to claim as their permanent home, settler colonialism establishes
quite a different structural relationship to 'traditional' forms of
colonialism, especially when settler colonial projects succeed in
creating a state (Bateman and Pilkington, 2011). Rather than governing
native peoples in order to extract resources for economic gain, settler
colonisers instead aim to 'seize their land and push them beyond an
ever-expanding frontier of settlement' (Elkin and Pedersen, 2005: 2).
For Patrick Wolfe (2006), what distinguishes settler colonialism is thus
that it is guided by a logic of elimination as opposed to a logic of
exploitation, wherein the eradication of indigenous presence is
essential to the success of settler colonial projects. [The primacy of
national liberation in the literature makes it especially difficult to
imagine, let alone theorise, decolonisation in many settler colonial
contexts.]{.underline} Whereas some settler colonial projects like
Algeria and Kenya saw decolonisation by way of a mass settler exodus,
paving the way for the establishment of independent states, the more
successful ones established permanent settler communities (e.g. Northern
Ireland) or their own states (e.g. Australia, Canada, the United States)
which preclude a simple transition from foreign rule to sovereign status
(Veracini, 2007). This is of course not to say that self-determination
of the type aspired to by anti-colonial national movements was an easy
or even necessarily achievable task. As Kohn and McBride (2011) suggest,
[in pursuing the dream of self-rule, anti-colonial thinkers had to
reckon with the difficulties of articulating alternative political
foundations that would make for a genuinely self-determining polity, an
enormous task which **[demands decolonising of minds as much
institutions and territory]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see Fanon,
2001\[1963\]). Decolonisation must pursue a convincing 'break' between a
colonial past and a postcolonial future 'through decisive action in the
present'; it must also 'seek to reinterpret the past in such a way that
it may help in the present and future struggle for self-rule' (Kohn and
McBride, 2011: 19). While these pursuits are invariably contingent,
partial and commonly symbolic, national liberation struggles very often
provide the fodder for a reinterpreted past that is robustly positive
and the establishment of an independent state serves as that aspired for
'break'. Settler colonial contexts, especially those where indigenous
peoples live as minorities in settler states, make these types of
symbolic transitions challenging, as they do the imagining of
postcolonial alternatives. If the narrative structure of colonialism is
circular (leave, stay, return), making that symbolic break possible,
settler colonial narratives are linear insofar as the settler comes to
stay and the line continues on unbroken (Veracini, 2007). As Ann
Curthoys (1999: 288) writes, **[[settler colonial spaces are
simultaneously colonial and postcolonial]{.mark}, colonising and
decolonising, [which makes decolonisation]{.mark} temporally [ambivalent
at best]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Lorenzo Veracini (2007) suggests that
there are only two alternatives to settler evacuation for decolonising
settler colonial forms and [it is dubious whether one of these counts as
decolonisation at all: the [decolonisation]{.mark} of
relationships]{.underline} through 'the promotion of various processes
of Indigenous reconciliation' [or the]{.underline} maintenance of the
status quo 'with the [explicit rejection of the possibility of reforming
the settler body politic']{.underline}. Again, **[what the former might
mean [is often vague]{.mark}, and historically it is the decolonisation
of relationships that is hardest to come by considering the
psychological consequences of colonialism for coloniser and colonised
alike]{.underline}** (Memmi, 1965). Like traditional forms of
colonialism, settler colonialism was legitimated by a belief in the
colonised's racial and cultural inferiority. However, the specific
settler colonial pursuit of land seizure compels additional stereotypes
of native peoples or unique applications of existing colonial ones,
wherein their supposed inferiority makes them ill-equipped to develop
that land (pre-modern, nomadic, barbaric) or, alternatively, voids any
claims to ownership (terra nullius). In other words, settler colonialism
is as much premised on the denial of indigenous peoples as a political
constituency with rights to land as it is their purported inferiority,
which is typically enshrined in their status as second-class citizens
with all the economic, cultural and social disadvantage this entails
(Bateman and Pilkington, 2011: 3). [Given that settler societies are
marked by 'pervasive inequalities, usually codified in law, between
native and settler populations' which preserve]{.underline} political
and economic [privileges for the latter]{.underline} (Elkin and
Pedersen, 2005: 4), **[[decolonising relationships demands structural
changes that often encounter significant resistance from settler
constituencies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Likewise, it requires a reckoning
with historical injustice -- specifically violence and conflict at the
colonial frontier -- that is challenging for settler states and
populations because it opens questions of settler identity, privileges,
legitimacy and reparations and expressly seeks to scrutinise disavowed
and long suppressed histories. [Settler colonial [decolonisation
is]{.mark} thus [complicated by a multitude of hurdles,]{.mark} which
bring the]{.underline} postcolonial caution of the [impossibility of a
'break' into stark relief.]{.underline} Kohn and McBride (2011) suggest
that [**[decisive action in the present is essential to
decolonisation]{.mark}**, but in settler colonial contexts **[this is
hindered by power discrepancies between settler and native
constituencies,]{.mark} a general [lack of settler political
will]{.mark}** to enter into difficult processes of historical
introspection **[as well as the constraining of Indigenous
claims]{.mark} within the settler state**.]{.underline} Indeed, even a
commitment to a postcolonial polity as expressed through processes of
historical reconciliation often encounters strong resistance when it
comes to judicial, constitutional or legislative change genuinely
decolonised relationships would demand. Nevertheless, even if it remains
difficult to comprehensively imagine the decolonisation of 'settler
societies vis-à-vis Indigenous constituencies' (Veracini, 2007), [[the
central question must be how to construct political foundations
which]{.mark} simultaneously [acknowledge]{.mark} 'the practices of
[racism, violence and subordination']{.mark}]{.underline} (Kohn and
McBride, 2011: 18) [that preceded them [while also **paving the way for
a postcolonial future in which natives and settlers are equal**]{.mark}
**parties [and share the right to narrate the
polity]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Equality, freedom and justice may come
from legally enshrining Indigenous rights to self-determination or,
alternatively, doing away with the categories of 'settler' and 'native'
altogether (Mamdani, 2001). What shape such efforts are likely to take
depends, among others, on the 'size and tenacity' of Indigenous
populations as well as the power of the settler constituency (Elkin and
Pedersen, 2005: 3, 6). But we would suggest that the measure to which
they may be thought of as decolonising rests on the robustness of the
relationship they envision and the space they carve for equal membership
in and to a postcolonial polity.
