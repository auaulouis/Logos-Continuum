#### Executive flexibility solves [terror]{.underline} AND [prolif]{.underline} -- extinction -- Congress is [structurally incapable]{.underline} at crisis response

The Framers realized the obvious. [**Foreign affairs** are
**unpredictable** and involve the **highest of stakes**, making them
**unsuitable** to regulation by preexisting
**legislation**]{.underline}. Instead, [they can demand **swift**,
**decisive action** --- sometimes under **pressured** or even
**emergency circumstances**]{.underline} --- [that is best carried out
by a branch of government that does not suffer from multiple **vetoes**
or that is **delayed** by **disagreements**. Congress is too **large**
and **unwieldy** to take the swift and decisive action required in
wartime.]{.underline} Our Framers replaced the Articles of
Confederation, which had failed in the management of foreign relations
because they had no single executive, with the Constitution's single
president for precisely this reason. [Even when it has **access** to the
**same intel**ligence as the executive branch, Congress's **loose**,
**decentralized** structure would \[**undermine**\]]{.underline}
~~paralyze~~ [American **policy** while **foreign threats
grew**.]{.underline}

[Congress has **no political incentive** to mount and see through its
own **wartime policy**]{.underline}. Members of Congress, who are
interested in keeping their seats at the next election, do not want to
take stands on controversial issues where the future is uncertain. They
will avoid like the plague any vote that will anger large segments of
the electorate. They prefer that the president take the political risks
and be held accountable for failure.

[Congress is too **large** and **unwieldy** to take the **swift** and
**decisive action** required in **wartime**.]{.underline}

[Congress's **track record** when it has opposed presidential leadership
has **not** been a **happy** one.]{.underline} Perhaps the most telling
example was the Senate's rejection of the Treaty of Versailles at the
end of World War I. [Congress's isolationist urge kept the United States
out of Europe at a time when **democracies fell** and **Fascism grew**
in their place. Even as **Europe** and **Asia** **plunged into war**,
Congress]{.underline} passed the Neutrality Acts designed to [keep the
United States out of the conflict]{.underline}. President Franklin
Roosevelt violated those laws to help the Allies and draw the nation
into war against the Axis. [While pro-Congress critics worry about a
president's foreign adventurism, the **real threat** to our **national
security** could come from **inaction** and
**isolationism**.]{.underline}

Many point to the Vietnam War as an example of the faults of the
"imperial presidency." [Vietnam]{.underline}, however, [could not have
continued without the consistent support of Congress in raising a large
military and paying for hostilities.]{.underline} And Vietnam ushered in
a period of congressional dominance that witnessed American setbacks in
the Cold War and the passage of the [**ineffectual** **W**ar **P**owers
**R**esolution]{.underline}. Congress passed the resolution in 1973 over
President Richard Nixon's veto, and [**no president** has ever
**accepted** the **constitutionality** of its 60-day limit on the use of
troops abroad. **No federal court** has ever **upheld** the resolution.
Even **Congress** has **never enforced it**.]{.underline}

Despite the record of practice and the Constitution's institutional
design, critics nevertheless argue that we should radically remake the
American way of war. They typically base their claim on Congress's power
to "declare war." But these observers read the 18th-century
constitutional text through a modern lens by interpreting "declare war"
to mean "start war." When the Constitution was written, however, a
declaration of war served diplomatic notice about a change in legal
relations between nations. It had little to do with launching
hostilities. In the century before the Constitution, for example, Great
Britain --- where the Framers got the idea of declaring war --- fought
numerous major conflicts but declared war only once beforehand.

Our Constitution sets out specific procedures for passing laws,
appointing officers, and making treaties. There are none for waging war
because the Framers expected the president and Congress to struggle over
war through the national political process. In fact, other parts of the
Constitution, properly read, support this reading. Article I, Section
10, for example, declares that the states shall not "engage" in war
"without the consent of Congress" unless "actually invaded, or in such
imminent danger as will not admit of delay." This provision creates
exactly the limits desired by anti-war critics, complete with an
exception for self-defense. If the Framers had wanted to require
congressional permission before the president could wage war, they
simply could have repeated this provision and applied it to the
executive.

Presidents, of course, do not have complete freedom to take the nation
to war. Congress has ample powers to control presidential policy, if it
wants to. Only Congress can raise the military, which gives it the power
to block, delay, or modify war plans. Before 1945, the United States had
such a small peacetime military that presidents who started a war would
have to go hat in hand to Congress to build an army to fight it. Since
World War II, Congress has authorized and funded our large standing
military, one primarily designed to conduct offensive, not defensive,
operations (as we learned all too tragically on 9/11) and to swiftly
project power worldwide. If Congress wanted to discourage presidential
initiative in war, it could build a smaller, less offense-minded
military.

[Congress's check]{.underline} on the presidency lies not just in the
long-term raising of the military. It [can]{.underline} also
[block]{.underline} any [immediate **armed conflict** through the
**power of the purse**.]{.underline} If Congress feels it has been
misled in authorizing war, or it disagrees with the president's
decisions, all it need do is cut off funds, either all at once or
gradually. [It can **reduce** the **size** of the **military**, shrink
or **eliminate units**, or **freeze supplies**.]{.underline} Using the
power of the purse does not even require affirmative congressional
action. [Congress can just sit on its hands and refuse to pass a law
funding the latest presidential adventure, and the war will end
quickly]{.underline}. Even the Kosovo war, which lasted little more than
two months and involved no ground troops, required special funding
legislation.

The Framers expected Congress's power of the purse to serve as the
primary check on presidential war. During the 1788 Virginia ratifying
convention. Patrick Henry attacked the Constitution for failing to limit
executive militarism. James Madison responded: "The sword is in the
hands of the British king; the purse is in the hands of the Parliament.
It is so in America, as far as any analogy can exist." Congress ended
America's involvement in Vietnam by cutting off all funds for the war.

Our [Constitution has succeeded because it **favors swift presidential
action** in war]{.underline}, later checked by Congress's funding power.
If a president continues to wage war without congressional
authorization, as in Libya, Kosovo, or Korea, it is only because
Congress has chosen not to exercise its easy check. We should not
confuse a desire to escape political responsibility for a defect in the
Constitution.

[A **radical change** in the system for making war]{.underline} might
appease critics of presidential power. But it [could]{.underline} also
[**seriously threaten** American **national security**.]{.underline} In
order to forestall another 9/11 attack, or take advantage of a window of
opportunity to strike terrorists or rogue nations, [the executive branch
needs **flexibility**.]{.underline} It is not hard to think of
situations where [congressional consent **cannot be obtained** in time
to act. Time for congressional **deliberation**]{.underline}, which [can
lead to **passivity** and **isolation** and not **smarter decisions**,
will come at the price of **speed** and **secrecy**.]{.underline}

The Constitution creates a presidency that can respond forcefully to
prevent serious threats to our national security. [Presidents can take
the initiative]{.underline}, and Congress can use its funding power
[to]{.underline} check presidents. Instead of demanding a legalistic
process to begin war, the Framers left war to politics. As we [confront
the new challenges of **terrorism**, **rogue nations**, and **WMD
prolif**eration]{.underline}, now is not the time to introduce sweeping,
untested changes in the way we make war.

PRESSURE POLITICS --- [Something]{.underline} quite [**striking** has
happened in Washington since Russia invaded Ukraine.
**[Congress]{.mark}** --- which typically takes a **back seat** on
foreign policy matters --- [has]{.mark} **repeatedly [driven]{.mark}**
the [**White House** beyond]{.mark} its [**comfort zone** with]{.mark}
**bipartisan [demands]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} more **[assertive]{.mark}
[policies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[It started with calls for **tougher [sanctions]{.mark}**, then
escalated to an appeal for a larger **military** and **humanitarian
[assistance]{.mark}** package]{.underline}. Members of both parties then
clamored for [a U.S. **[ban on]{.mark} [Russian]{.mark}
oil**]{.underline}, which the White House saw as politically risky given
the effect on gas prices at home. And they insisted that the U.S. end
permanent normal trade relations with Russia.

The [[tactics]{.mark} have **[worked]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And this
week, [[lawmakers]{.mark} will be at it again]{.underline} --- this time
[[nudging]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [to go **further than it wants** [in]{.mark}
facilitating]{.underline} the [[**transfer** of]{.mark} **fighter
[jets]{.mark}**]{.underline} from Poland to Ukraine.

The White House POV: The [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} White House ---
[[worried about **ratcheting up tensions**]{.mark} with the
Kremlin]{.underline} --- has rejected Poland's offer to move their
Soviet-style planes. Indeed, [[Russia]{.mark} over the weekend
[warned]{.mark} that [it would view]{.mark} any such [**delivery**
as]{.mark} an **[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and signaled that
any such convoys (even American-delivered ones) would be considered
"legitimate targets."

Alex Ward, who anchors POLITICO's National Security Daily newsletter,
noted Sunday that [the [administration has gone **out**]{.mark} [**of
its way** to **avoid**]{.mark} **any [moves]{.mark}** [that could
**trigger**]{.mark} **further [conflict]{.mark}** with **Russia**. It
has even taken steps back to **ease tensions**]{.underline}, such as
canceling special operations training and delaying missile tests. Our
colleagues also scooped Sunday that a "Pentagon push to send more
trainers to Ukraine was scrapped in December amid White House fears of
provoking Russia."

The supporters' POV: Supporters of approving a transfer of fighter jets
argue that Russia has drawn multiple lines that the West has already
crossed --- and that VLADIMIR PUTIN is the aggressor here. Sen. ROB
PORTMAN (R-Ohio), speaking from the Ukraine-Poland border, noted on
CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday that Putin had also called
sanctions an "act of war" and warned the U.S. against providing
stringers and helicopters.

"What we've heard directly from the Ukrainians is they want them badly,"
Portman said of the planes. "They want the ability to have better
control over the skies in order to give them a fighting chance. I don't
understand why we're not doing it."

The build-up: While [Republicans led the charge]{.underline} calling for
the transfer last week, over the weekend we saw some [Hill Democrats
join the fray]{.underline}. Ex-military Democratic Reps. JASON CROW
(Colo.), JARED GOLDEN (Maine) and CHRISSY HOULAHAN (Pa.) and a couple of
others [signed a bipartisan letter backing the move]{.underline}, as we
first reported in Playbook PM on Friday. By Sunday, [the
58-member-strong bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus --- half Democrats
--- had joined them]{.underline}.

"With Russia's alarming disregard for Ukrainian civilian casualties, the
U.S. must ... help supply more comprehensive air defense systems to
defend Ukraine and its people," the letter read.

Meanwhile, Sen. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minn.) --- who doesn't break often with
President JOE BIDEN --- said the U.S. shouldn't rule out making the
transfer: "I have made clear to them --- I spoke to the president
himself about 10 days ago about this --- I'd like to see the planes over
there," she said on "State of the Union," floating the idea of other
types of air defense assistance that could also work. "I still don't
rule out having planes at some point."

So is it just a matter of time before the Biden White House flips and
moves on the Poland transfer? Perhaps. What is clear is that [[Congress
has]{.mark} [had **success** with]{.mark} this type of [**vocal**,
**bipart**]{.mark}**isan [push]{.mark}** before]{.underline}. WaPo's Amy
Wang has more on the bipartisan movement on the plane issue. (Read on

#### Executive flexibility is [inevitable]{.underline} -- even if they're [right]{.underline} -- Congress [will NOT re-engage]{.underline} due to [political incentives]{.underline} -- AND, gridlock enables [executive power grabs]{.underline} -- NO spillover

As more information comes out about the proximate causes of the
Taliban's swift takeover of Afghanistan, AEI's Kori Schake has a good
op-ed in the New York Times reminding everyone (including Trump
administration officials hoping for national amnesia) about the February
2020 deal that the Trump administration negotiated with the Taliban that
set the table for the horrible meal we are all digesting now.

That agreement led to "the release of 5,000 combat and political Taliban
prisoners" and bypassed the Afghan government entirely. As Schake
writes, "For someone who prided himself on his abilities as a dealmaker
and displayed an 'I alone can fix it' arrogance, the agreement he made
with the Taliban is one of the most disgraceful diplomatic bargains on
record."

The deeper point to Schake's op-ed, however, is that President Donald
Trump's debacle is simply the most recent and most prominent example of
a U.S. president believing that personal diplomacy can solve everything.
Instead, "presidents should return to the practice of persuading their
fellow Americans of the merits of agreements with foreign powers."

If they do not, [Schake advises Congress to reclaim its powers over
foreign affairs]{.underline}:

Congress can begin by [reasserting its role in diplomacy and requiring
specific authorizations for the use of military force rather than
continuing to acquiesce to claims that existing executive authorizations
can be endlessly expanded. It should refuse the shifting of funds
previously authorized and appropriated for other purposes]{.underline}
(Mr. Trump made such shifts to construct the border wall). It should
reject foreign policy changes enacted by executive order rather than
congressional approval, [and it should force the Supreme Court to
clarify the extent of the president's war powers.]{.underline}

[Agreements with foreign powers]{.underline}, whether states,
international institutions or organizations like the Taliban, [should be
submitted to Congress for a vote. The best way to prevent catastrophic
foreign policy mistakes is to require the 535 representatives of the
American people to put their jobs on the line, become informed, and
support, reject or modify a president's program]{.underline}. Congress
tried to slow or block Mr. Trump's planned drawdown of U.S. forces.
Members who supported the Taliban deal should be explaining why they
thought the outcome would be different than the tragedy unfolding in
Afghanistan now. Apathy and unaccountability are the real enemies of
good foreign policy. [Presidents get around oversight by offering
unilateral policy actions or claiming international agreements aren't
formal treaties. Congress shouldn't let a president from either party
get away with that.]{.underline}

As an analyst, I agree wholeheartedly with Schake's diagnosis of the
problem. One of the running themes in my own long-form writing on
American foreign policy --- see here, here, here, here and here --- has
been that a variety of factors has led to everyone treating the
president as the last adult in the room. This is a real problem when
Americans elect a petulant child to occupy the Oval Office.

Nor is this argument original to me. It begins with Arthur Schlesinger's
"The Imperial Presidency," continues with Andrew Rudalevige's "The New
Imperial Presidency," proceeds with Linda Fowler's "Watchdogs on the
Hill" and so forth.

The [diagnosis makes sense --- but Schake's proposed remedy does
not]{.underline}, for two reasons. First, most members of [**Congress**
[have **little incentive** to **act responsibly**]{.mark} on **foreign
affairs**]{.underline}. As Helen Milner and Dustin Tingley note in
"Sailing the Water's Edge," [what motivates Congress is the distribution
of concentrated **costs** and **benefits**. Foreign affairs, which is
mostly about advancing the **national interest**, has **very little of
this outside** of the defense budget]{.underline}.

As a result, [most **individual members** of [Congress **do not care**
about **foreign policy**, except as]{.mark} an [**exercise in
partisanship**. Neither do]{.mark} their
**[constituents]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The result is that [[when
Congress does get involved]{.mark} in foreign affairs, [it is]{.mark}
mostly [through displays of]{.mark} **self-sabotaging
[symbolism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as passing JASTA or impulsively
flying to Kabul in the middle of a rescue mission or, as I noted in
Foreign Affairs, imposing economic sanctions [so that they "can tell
their constituents that they are doing something about a problem even if
that something **isn't working**]{.underline}."

Now it could be argued that if Schake's proposed reforms were enacted,
the shared sense of responsibility would focus the mind of Congress,
[leaving lawmakers]{.underline} no choice but [to act
responsibly]{.underline}. Alas, that [is **highly
unlikely**]{.underline}, for two reasons. First, [even if
[Congress]{.mark} was **blamed collectively** for **inaction** in
**foreign affairs**, individual members [**would not be punished**
by]{.mark} their **[constituents]{.mark}**. Ordinary [Americans **barely
consider foreign policy**]{.mark} when voting for the
president]{.underline}, much less their House representative.

Second, [[when]{.mark} a foreign policy **[crisis]{.mark}** does
[emerge]{.mark}]{.underline}, attention naturally gravitates toward 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue. [Congress has **535** individual voices; the
president is a **singular voice**]{.underline}. During a crisis, the
[[**president** will always have]{.mark} the **[incentive to]{.mark}
act** [us]{.mark}ing **[exec]{.mark}utive [power]{.mark}** []{.mark}in
the face of congressional **gridlock**]{.underline}. Furthermore, that
very [[gridlock]{.mark} will **[enable]{.mark} the president** to get
away with **[power grabs]{.mark}** more often]{.underline} than not. [So
long as a president's party provides **backup**, [there is
**little**]{.mark} that [Congress can do]{.mark}]{.underline} as an
institution [[to **constrain exec**]{.mark}**utive
[power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This is normally the point in the column when the hard-working staff
here at Spoiler Alerts offers a better solution. [This is a
[problem]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [that **[cannot]{.mark}**
necessarily [**be fixed** given]{.mark} the [current]{.mark} **political
[incentives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The best I can offer is to try to
further institutionalize consultations with congressional leadership in
a manner akin to reading in the Gang of Eight on intelligence matters.

I grant that this is weak beer. [The [problem is **structural**]{.mark}.
Presidents care about foreign policy because of the **national
interest** and]{.underline} also [because it's the arena where
presidents have the most **latitude**]{.underline}. Members of [Congress
**do not care** most of the time]{.underline}. And [the reason they do
not care is that their **constituents** really **do not
care**]{.underline}. Until something changes in that last sentence, [the
[status quo will **persist**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### AND, [NO impact]{.underline} -- Presidents pursue Congressional support to shield political criticisms -- unilateral action only occurs for [isolated]{.underline}, [non-escalatory]{.underline} instances

What does it mean to say that the United States suffers from an
"[Imperial Presidency Problem]{.underline}?" For at least the last fifty
years, it [has defined a]{.underline} line of [critique of]{.underline}
the [**Presidential power** to make war without the **consent of
Congress**]{.underline}.

The [vast expansion of]{.underline} the [standing military
establishment]{.underline} in World War II [meant that post-war
Presidents had the means to **wage war** at the **times** and **places**
of their choosing]{.underline}. The [development of nuclear weapons
meant that [Presidents **need**]{.mark}**ed the [authority]{.mark}** [to
make decisions]{.mark} of **war** and **peace** [**immediately**,
without]{.mark} the **advice** and **consent** of
**[Congress]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To be sure, there is a long history
of Presidents waging wars without Congressional intervention, but the
advent of the Cold War raised the stakes immensely. In 1950, President
Truman's decision to intervene in the civil war on the Korean Peninsula
seemed a harbinger of a vast expansion of Presidential power over war
and peace.

The problem was seen as so serious at near the end of the Vietnam War
that Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in 1973 in an effort to
limit Presidential prerogative with respect to warmaking. Congressional
critics of Presidential warmaking power have continued their efforts to
restrain imperial Presidents down to the present day; a bipartisan
coalition of lawmakers attempted to constrain President Trump's support
for the Saudi war in Yemen, albeit with little success. More recently,
Senators Bernie Sanders, Mike Lee, and Chris Murphy proposed a sweeping
overhaul of the national security prerogatives of the President that
would significantly expand upon and clarify the War Powers Resolution.

But what if the [Imperial Presidency is]{.underline}, at least
partially, [a **myth**]{.underline}?

Patrick Hulme, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University
of California at San Diego, has work circulating about the importance of
the precedent of the Korean War in Presidential thinking. As Hulme
argues, "[Truman's successors took a specific lesson away from the
Korean War: by failing to have members of **Congress publicly commit**
to **armed intervention** via a **formal vote ex ante**, they left
themselves **vulnerable** to highly damaging congressional action
**ex-post** if the **use of force** did not end in **victory**."
[Presidents]{.mark} don't [seek]{.mark} Congressional [approval
for]{.mark} every mission, but for [interventions that may last a **long
time** or have]{.mark} the [potential to **go badly**]{.mark}, they
**want Congress** on board]{.underline}.

We can see this with respect to President Obama's decision not to strike
Syria in 2013. Obama's initial instinct, testified to by many with
access to the deliberations, was to launch an attack on Syria as soon as
possible. At the same time, it seems that Obama became less certain that
US involvement could be limited to a few airstrikes. The Syrian
government was weak but in no danger of imminent collapse, and Obama
worried that initial strikes would require a follow-up if Assad
continued to use chemical weapons. This makes sense in the context of
Hulme's model; [a [President]{.mark} who may be **entirely willing** to
conduct a **quick**, **one-off strike** without **Congressional
approval** [will find it]{.mark} altogether [**less pleasant** to
launch]{.mark} a **[long-term]{.mark} military [operation]{.mark}**
**[without]{.mark} bringing [Congress]{.mark}** on board]{.underline}.

The real danger would be for a President to decide upon war without
consulting Congress and then earn public adulation for acting
effectively as a lawless warlord, or assume that Congress will
eventually be forced to support them. [Presidents do not launch wars in
**anticipation** that they will become **more popular** over time. The
**more engagement** the conflict requires, the more a President wants to
begin the war with **clear [Congressional
support]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this sense, [Congress
[provides]{.mark} the [President with]{.mark} a degree of **[protection
against critics]{.mark}** in case a military operation goes
bad]{.underline}.

The belief that launching and waging a war independently of Congress
would result in popularity would be truly dangerous to both America and
the world. Fortunately, [Presidents]{.underline} don't tend to act in
this way. Rather, they [see [unilateral war]{.mark}, especially when the
chance of a prolonged engagement [is]{.mark} high, as [too **politically
risky**. Even when Presidents claim that they do not **need**
Congressional authority]{.mark}]{.underline} to launch a war, [[they
seek such]{.mark} authority [because they want]{.mark} **political
[protection]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And in truth it is unclear that
Congressional approval did much to protect Johnson from the verdict of
Vietnam or George W. Bush from the verdict of Iraq; both Presidents bore
the brunt of public criticism for the decision to go to war,
notwithstanding the approval of Congress.

Thus, the problem is less that the "imperial" President launches wars
without the authorization of Congress. [The [problem is]{.mark} that
[Congress]{.mark} has [displayed]{.mark} **all-too-much
[willingness]{.mark}** [to go along with]{.mark} even the **[worst
wars]{.mark}** that a President seeks to undertake]{.underline}. None of
this means that reforming Presidential warmaking powers isn't a good
idea. In particular, giving Congress more control over presidential
power at low levels of escalation (arms sales, for example) clearly
seems to be a good idea. Moreover, we should not underestimate the
ability of a President to control the public discourse, and especially
to control the flow of intelligence. Both the Vietnam War and the Iraq
War were launched with a faulty intelligence frame; the executive
characterized and distorted existing intelligence to paint a picture
favorable to war. But as always, resolving the problem requires careful
analysis of the extent of the problem.

### 2ac -- flex good -- renewables

#### Biden's using [executive wartime powers]{.underline} to secure [critical minerals]{.underline} to develop clean energy -- [broad national security flex]{.underline} is key

The [[White House is]{.mark} weighing [using]{.mark} **wartime
[exec]{.mark}utive [powers]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} boost U.S. battery
production to help [secure]{.mark}]{.underline} supplies for the growing
market for electric vehicles and power storage on [the **electric
grid**]{.underline}, according to two people familiar with the Biden
administration's thinking.

President Joe [Biden would use the Defense Production Act to help secure
U.S. sources of **[critical minerals]{.mark}** [that
are]{.mark}]{.underline} deemed [[key components of **clean
energy**]{.mark} technology]{.underline}. While the U.S. possesses many
of those minerals, industry and some lawmakers of both parties contend
[**regulations** have **deterred development** and forced the U.S. to

"[As we [break]{.mark} our [**dependence** on
foreign]{.mark}]{.underline} sources of [[**oil** and]{.mark} **natural
[gas]{.mark}**, we must ensure]{.underline} that we [[secure]{.mark} the
materials necessary for]{.underline} the **[[clean
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}** economy [in a way
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} holds to our strong environmental, labor,
Tribal engagement standards and [[does not leave us **reliant**
on]{.mark} **unreliable** and [**unsustainable** **foreign supply
chains**]{.mark}]{.underline}," one of the people said.

The [move to use an **emergency national defense law**]{.underline}
dating to the Cold War [comes as]{.underline} the [prices of battery
minerals like nickel, lithium and cobalt, have **surged**
during]{.underline} Russia's war in [Ukraine]{.underline}. [Russia is a
**leading producer**]{.underline} of nickel, copper and other minerals.
[[Prices were already rising]{.underline}]{.mark} before Russia's
invasion [[because]{.mark} of forecasts that [**global supply** won't
keep up with]{.mark} surging **[demand]{.mark}**]{.underline} expected
from electrifying economies.

Influential lawmakers led by Democratic Sen. Joe
**[Manchin]{.underline}** (D-W. Va.), chair of the Energy Committee,
[and]{.underline} Sen. Lisa **[Murkowski]{.underline}** (R-Alaska)
[called]{.underline} last month [for]{.underline} the
[Biden]{.underline} administration [to invoke the Defense Production Act
to boost]{.underline} the [**production** and **processing** of
**critical minerals**, citing the ongoing supply chain crisis and the
vulnerability of]{.underline} depending on [Russian mineral
supplies]{.underline}.

"It's a nice start. If you are going to go whole hog on electric and you
don't have the minerals, you ought to do something," Sen. Bill Cassidy
(R-La.), who signed a letter with Manchin and Murkowski prodding the
Biden administration to take the action, said in an interview. Several
Democratic senators wrote to Biden two weeks later expressing concern
over supply chain issues related to the Ukraine crisis, too.

Rich Nolan, CEO of the National Mining Association, said the
[Biden]{.underline} administration [is sending a "strong signal" to the
marketplace by taking action]{.underline}.

"[It's going to incentivize getting]{.underline} some of these
[materials to the marketplace]{.underline} right when we need it," Nolan
said in an interview.

The effort Biden is considering would not circumvent or speed up
permitting and environmental reviews, one of the people familiar with
the plan said, a likely nod to the fact that some Democrats and green
groups are wary of expanding mining on U.S. soil.

Instead, [the [actions would act]{.mark} almost [as]{.mark} an
**[investment vehicle]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the person said. [Adding
minerals like nickel, lithium, graphite, manganese and cobalt to a list
of covered materials under the [D]{.mark}efense [P]{.mark}roduction
[A]{.mark}ct's Title III program could [help companies **secure money**
from a **fund**]{.mark} designed to ensure the U.S. maintains an
**industrial base** for **wartime capabilities**. Those dollars would
finance **feasibility studies** along with productivity and safety
improvements]{.underline} rather than directly buying minerals.

A 2019 Congressional Research Service report found the [U.S. **relies
wholly on imports** for 14 critical minerals]{.underline}, including
manganese, graphite and rare earths.

The move is in line with previous uses of [the Defense Production Act,
which **[explicitly grants]{.mark}** the [president authority]{.mark}
[to address]{.mark} the [**mining** and]{.mark} production of
**[minerals]{.mark}** that are [considered **essential** to]{.mark} the
[nation's security]{.mark}.]{.underline} It was invoked in the 1950s to
ensure an adequate supply of steel for use in the Korean War and again
during the Cold War to establish domestic aluminum and titanium
industries and reduce reliance on foreign sources.

"[[These are]{.underline}]{.mark} all [[things that]{.mark} the [U.S.
needs to]{.mark}]{.underline} help [[build]{.mark} up the]{.underline}
U.S. [**[mining industry]{.mark}** into something that is [capable of
navigating]{.mark} the **[energy transition]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
said Jordy Lee, a program manager at the Payne Institute for Public
Policy at the Colorado School of Mines. "Demand estimates show 1000
percent increases in lithium demand, 200 percent increases in nickel
demand, etc, and the U.S. mining industry is struggling."

Efforts to expand domestic mining production have already hit roadblocks
at the state and local level, as litigation, state mining laws and
environmental opposition have stymied some projects. The Biden
administration itself canceled the leases for a major proposed
copper-nickel mine in Minnesota earlier this year.

A similar [mobilization will be necessary for the US to
[decarbonize]{.mark} its economy]{.underline} **[[fast enough to
avert]{.mark} the [worst of climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To do
its part in limiting global temperature rise to between 1.5° and 2°
Celsius, [the US must reach net-zero carbon emissions by
2050]{.underline} at the latest. To achieve this, the full resources of
the US economy must be bent toward manufacturing the needed clean-energy
technology and infrastructure. FDR began with two questions. First, he
asked not what was politically feasible but what was necessary to win
the war. He also asked not how much funding was available in the federal
budget but how much productive capacity was available in the economy ---
what was possible. [Saul Griffith is trying to answer those same
questions on climate change]{.underline}: what is necessary, given the
trajectory of global warming, and what is possible, given the resources
in the US economy. [A physicist, engineer, researcher, inventor, serial
entrepreneur]{.underline}, and MacArthur "genius" grant winner,
[Griffith's recent work spans two organizations]{.underline}. First, [he
is founder]{.underline} and chief scientist [at Otherlab, an independent
research]{.underline} and [design lab that has mapped the energy
economy. And]{.underline} alongside Alex Laskey, co-founder of Opower,
[he]{.underline} recently [started Rewiring America, which will
develop]{.underline} and advocate for [policies to rapidly decarbonize
the US]{.underline} through electrification. (The organization is going
to release a book called --- be still my heart --- Electrify
Everything.) Last week, Rewiring America made its big debut with [a jobs
report show]{.underline}ing [that rapid]{.underline} [decarbonization
through electrification]{.underline} **[would create]{.underline}** 15
million to **[20 million jobs]{.underline}** in the next decade, with 5
million permanent jobs after that. For the most part, the media covered
it as just another jobs report, saying basically what other clean-energy
jobs reports have said. But the jobs are, in many; ways, the least
interesting part of the work. Much more interesting is Griffith's larger
project the model he's built and its implications. In a nutshell, he has
shown that [[it's possible to eliminate]{.underline}]{.mark} 70 percent
to **[[80 percent of]{.mark} US [carbon emissions]{.mark} by
2035]{.underline}** [[through]{.mark} rapid [deployment
o]{.mark}f]{.underline} existing [electrification
[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}, [with little-to-no carbon capture
and sequestration]{.underline}. **[[Doing so would slash]{.mark} US
[energy demand]{.mark} by]{.underline}** around **[half]{.underline}**,
[[save consumers money]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and keep the country on a
1.5° pathway]{.underline} without requiring particular behavior changes.
Everyone could still have their same cars and houses --- they would just
need to be electric. "[The report reinforces a key
finding]{.underline}," says Leah Stokes, an environmental policy expert
at the University of California Santa Barbara. "**[[Cleaning up]{.mark}
the [electricity]{.mark} system [solves the lion's share]{.mark} of the
problem.]{.underline}** [It allows us to electrify]{.underline} our
[transportation]{.underline} and [building sectors and]{.underline}
parts of [heavy industry]{.underline}, [which [would address **more than
70 percent of**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}total
**[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Some of Griffith's conclusions
run contrary to conventional wisdom in the energy space. And they are
oddly optimistic. Despite the titanic effort it would take to
decarbonize, [the US doesn't need any new technologies and it doesn't
require any grand]{.underline} national [sacrifice]{.underline}. [All
[it needs]{.mark}]{.underline}, in this view, [is a
**[serious]{.mark}**]{.underline} commitment to building the necessary
machines and creating a **[[regulatory]{.underline}]{.mark}** and policy
**[[environment]{.underline}]{.mark}** that supports their rapid
deployment. In this post, I will walk through the energy data he's
assembled, what the data reveals about the fastest way to decarbonize,
how fast that decarbonization could be accomplished, why it's doable,
its political challenges, and its political promise. Griffith's work is
among the most interesting contributions to the climate discussion in
ages. There's a lot here, but it is worth your time. Let's start with
how he built the model. How energy is used in the US economy, explained
In 2018, after applying for years, Otherlab was finally awarded a
contract from the Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects
Agency-Energy to assemble in one place, for the first time, all publicly
available data on how energy is used in the US. As it happens, [the US
has great energy data]{.underline}. In response to the oil crisis of the
1970s, presidents created the Energy Information Administration, the
Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Those
agencies began gathering data on how energy is generated, transported,
and used in various parts of the economy, and since have accumulated an
enormous catalog. [Oddly, all that data has never been]{.underline}
gathered, harmonized, and [put in a single database]{.underline}. So
Griffith and colleagues spent years poring over agency output from the
last 50 years --- he ruefully cops to being "the only person on the
planet who has read every footnote of every DOE report since 1971" ---
and assembling it in a massive dashboard, which you can view here. It
tracks where every unit of energy enters the economy and how it is used
as it passes through. This is not a model, per se, it's just lots and
lots of data visualized, a close-up "machine-level" view of energy flows
in the US economy. But having the data in one place provides the raw
material for Rewiring America to build a high-resolution model of what
it would actually take to decarbonize --- how many machines must be
built, what kind, and how fast. "[Where most studies look at
decarbonization in specific]{.underline} individual
[sectors]{.underline} such as transportation, the electricity grid, or
buildings --- and mostly only on the supply side," the Rewiring America
report says, "[we build a model of the **interactions of all
sectors**]{.underline}, both supply and demand, [in a **rapid and
total** decarbonization]{.underline}." [[The fastest way to decarbonize
is to **electrify everything**]{.mark}]{.underline} Griffith begins with
a core assumption: [We need to make a plan]{.underline} to solve the
problem [with the tools available]{.underline}. [It is
**unwise**]{.underline}, for instance, [to bet on a large amount of
carbon capture]{.underline} and [sequestration]{.underline} coming
online in time to make a difference. [The technologies are **still in
the early stage**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} there are strong
arguments [they will **never pencil out.**]{.underline} Griffith takes a
"yes, and" approach. If carbon capture sequestration works out, great.
If next-gen nuclear reactors work out, great. If hydrogen-based fuels
work out, great. But [we shouldn't rely on any of them **until they are
real.**]{.underline} We need to figure out how to do the job with the
technology available. On that score, [Griffith's modeling reaches two
key conclusions.]{.underline} First, it is still possible to reduce US
greenhouse gas emissions in line with a 1.5°C pathway. Specifically, [it
is possible to reduce US emissions]{.underline} 70 percent to **[80
percent]{.underline}** by 2035 (and to zero by 2050) **[through rapid
electrification]{.underline}**, [relying on]{.underline} five already
well-developed technologies: wind and [solar power plants,]{.underline}
rooftop solar, [electric vehicles, heat pumps, and
batteries]{.underline}. Think of those technologies as the
infrastructure of 21st century life. If everyone uses carbon-free energy
to heat their homes and get around, the bulk of the problem will be
solved. Second, to decarbonize in time, [[substitution of clean-energy
tec]{.mark}h]{.underline}nologies for their fossil-fuel counterparts
[[must ramp up]{.mark} to 100 percent **[as fast as
possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}, after a brief period of industrial
mobilization. Every time a gas or diesel car is replaced, it must be
replaced with an EV; every time an oil or gas furnace is replaced, it
must be replaced with a heat pump; every time a coal or gas power plant
goes offline, it must be replaced with renewable energy. There is no
room left in a 1.5° or 2° scenario for more fossil fuel infrastructure
or machines. We need to radically ramp up production of electrification
technologies and implement the policy and financing tools that will
enable 100 percent substitution. Clocking the maximum feasible
transition to clean energy Griffith and his colleagues set out to model
a "maximum feasible transition" to carbon-free energy, limited only by
the country's production capacity. They describe it like this: The
maximum feasible transition (MFT) involves two primary stages: (i) an
aggressive WWII--style production ramp--up of 3--5 years, followed by
(ii) an intensive deployment of decarbonized infrastructure and
technology up to 2035. This includes supply--side generation
technologies as well as demand--side technologies such as electric
vehicles and building heat electrification. When it says production
ramp-up, it's no joke. Within three to five years, production of
electric vehicles would have to increase four-fold, batteries 16-fold,
wind turbines 12-fold, and solar modules 10-fold.
[[Accommodating]{.mark} all those new [electricity
loads]{.mark}]{.underline} [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[mean]{.underline} **[expanding]{.underline}**]{.mark} the size of
**[[the grid]{.mark} by three- or four-fold]{.underline}**. "Today, we
deliver about 450 gigawatts constantly," says Griffith. "[In the model
of the future]{.underline} --- where everyone's house is the same size,
everyone's car is the same size, but it's all electrified --- [you need
to deliver 1,500 to 2,000 gigawatts]{.underline}." (To be clear,
Griffith doesn't necessarily think Americans should keep driving giant
cars and living in giant houses. He supports urbanism and cycling and
downsizing generally. He spent many years running a radical downsizing
experiment on his own life. But he wants the public to know that
changing their lifestyle is not necessary for decarbonization.) [[Almost
all]{.mark} the [heavy lifting]{.mark} in the]{.underline} maximum
feasible [transition [is done by
**electrification**]{.mark}]{.underline}, "the exception being 5-10
Quads of non--electrical energy sources coming from \[biofuels\]" the
Rewiring America report says. "Hydrogen or other synthetic fuels (which
are generated from electricity) are deployed for a few high--temperature
applications. The scenario does not rely on any deployment of carbon
capture and storage, and all primary energy sources are net zero." [In
terms of generation, **wind and solar do the bulk of the
work**]{.underline}, "along with a doubling of the current nuclear
electricity fleet from 100GW to 200GW." In particular, **[[distributed
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}** (rooftop and community solar and
batteries) **[plays a huge role]{.underline}**, "[accounting for around
25% of energy supply]{.underline} and a high degree of the storage
capacity" [**[would reduce]{.mark} the amount of [energy]{.mark} the US
[needs]{.mark} by half.** One key aspect of electrification makes this
transformation possible]{.underline}, and it represents perhaps the most
astonishing finding in Griffith's modeling: **[[Large-scale
electrification would slash]{.mark} total US [primary energy demand in
half]{.mark}]{.underline}**, from around 100 quads to about 45-50.
**[This a huge deal]{.underline}** --- [it means America only needs to
produce about half the energy with renewables that it is currently
producing with fossil fuels.]{.underline} And [that massive drop in
demand assumes no behavior change, no insulated buildings]{.underline}
or double-glazed windows, [no]{.underline} traditional ["efficiency"
measures of any kind]{.underline}. The transition from fossil fuel
combustion to electricity, in and of itself, is the largest demand-side
climate policy available. How is that possible? The simple answer comes
down to the fact that [electric motors are more efficient than fossil
fueled motors at converting primary energy]{.underline} into useful
work. The somewhat more complicated answer is this. You cut almost 10
percent off of energy demand right off the bat, says Griffith, because
the Energy Information Administration has been overestimating, due to
the way it accounts for nuclear and hydroelectric energy. (It's too
complicated to get into here.) Another 10 percent of energy used in
today's economy goes toward "finding, mining, refining, and transporting
fossil fuels," Griffith says, and that demand goes away in an
electrified economy. So it's down to 80 percent left to replace.
Shifting from fossil fuel power plants to renewable energy saves another
15 percent, because carbon-free, non-thermal power sources rely on fewer
energy conversions than thermoelectric sources. Electrifying
transportation gets another 15 percent, because electric vehicles (EVs)
are more efficient than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.
Electrifying buildings gets another 6 percent to 9 percent. To be clear,
the US could reduce demand even more if it continued to better insulate
buildings and other efficiency measures, if it downsized homes, drove
less, and relied more on walking and electric cycling to get around. But
it is worth emphasizing, again: [The biggest demand-side policy by far
is electrification, which could slash US energy demand by
half.]{.underline} "You can't efficiency your way to zero," Griffith
says. "You have to transform." [Industry is **not as big a carbon
problem** as it appears The alleged difficulty of decarbonizing heavy
industry has been a major topic]{.underline} in carbon circles lately.
(I have written about it myself.) It is one of the reasons often offered
for why large-scale negative emissions will be needed. **[Griffith
disagrees]{.underline}**. [He points out that a big chunk
of]{.underline} the [[carbon emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} attributed
to industry [are devoted to fossil fuels]{.underline} **[and [will
disappear]{.mark} as they do]{.underline}**. For instance, 4 percent to
5 percent of US energy is used to turn oil into gasoline, a subcategory
of industry that will decline along with ICE vehicles. As for the rest,
"[steel is tiny, and we can **use hydrogen to make
steel**]{.underline}," he says. "Aluminum traditionally makes a lot of
CO2 because we use carbon electrodes for the smelting process; Alcoa and
Rio Tinto already have carbonless electrodes for aluminum. Cement is
still hard, but that's only 1 percent. And [the rest of industrial heat
can mostly be done with induction for high-temperature heat or heat
pumps]{.underline} for low-temperature heat." In short, [industry is a
problem, but a **relatively small one**]{.underline}. "It's the last 5
percent of emissions," Griffith says. "It's hardly the thing that should
stop us."

a\. Standing for Plaintiff to a Lawsuit, whether member of Congress or

[Standing is a fundamental **constitutional concept**.]{.underline} 63
[If **plaintiffs** **lack standing**, **courts dismiss** the

**particularized injury** in their complaint]{.underline}, and does not

members of **Congress** and (2) **everyone else**]{.underline}. 66

Members of the military, part of the everyone-elses, can also bring suit
like Captain Smith, whose complaint recited his injuries to show
standing. 67 His presumed legal injuries, however, did not grant
standing, and the courts have found other reasons to dismiss on standing
for military members. 68 Therefore, [standing is the **initial**
**constitutional hurdle** that **plaintiffs must
overcome**]{.underline}. 69

[**Member of Congress** have also **tried to litigate** the War Powers

have standing]{.underline}. 71 Likewise, [the **courts** have
**dismissed** Congressional members\' suits for **lacking
standing**]{.underline}, even claims of standing based on stewardship of
taxpayer dollars. 72 Although often lacking standing and thereby access
to the courts, members of Congress also have access to Congressional
fora to disagree with military action which they should utilize rather
than the courts. 73 Moreover, the [**courts** will typically **find**

b\. Dismissal Unattached to Standing

Beyond standing, [courts have other **doctrinal reasons** to **dismiss**
any **litigation** involving the **W**ar **P**owers **R**esolution
beyond simply standing]{.underline}. 75 One doctrine is [**mootness**,
and]{.underline} another is **[political question]{.underline}**. 76 The
[courts also have a **favored disposition** toward the **military** and
**national security**]{.underline}. 77 Finally, [the **Feres Doctrine**
**bars civil suits** against the military.]{.underline} 78 [All of these
doctrines lead to **dismissal**]{.underline}. 79

[Mootness means that a **controversy** is **no longer ripe**, and a
**recurring injury** **does not counter** mootness]{.underline}. 80
[Even if plaintiffs had standing to bring a case, **military action**
may **move too swiftly** for the courts to react]{.underline}. 81 In
short, [sometimes the **military action** has already **achieved its
purpose**, **removing** the **impetus** for the **lawsuit**, hence the
**problem of mootness**]{.underline}. 82

[Certain controversies are, by]{.underline} their nature, [**outside**
of **what** the **courts** will **entertain**]{.underline}; as Justice
Douglass noted [\"\[u\]sed to bar from]{.underline} the courts questions
which . . . the Constitution . . . left to the other two coordinate
Branches to resolve, viz., the so-called **[political
question]{.underline}**.\" 83 The political question doctrine is a
narrow doctrine and relates to the enumerated powers of the various
branches. 84 The [War Powers]{.underline} are enumerated powers, and the
[courts]{.underline} have [dismissed]{.underline} various [lawsuits
based on the **p**olitical **q**uestion **d**octrine]{.underline}. 85
For instance, the court noted the political question doctrine was an
alternative reason to dismiss Captain Smith\'s suit. 86 Thus, the
[**political question doctrine** is also a **bar** to **litigating** the
**War Powers** and **W**ar **P**owers **R**esolution.]{.underline} 87

One [other ground for dismissal is]{.underline} general [**deference**
to the **military** and **national security**.]{.underline} 88 The
[**state secrets** doctrine is an **evidentiary privilege** which keeps
information related to state secrets or national security **out of the
courts** for **fear of disclosure**]{.underline}. 89 The states secrets
doctrine also has an example of false invocation, such as United States
v. Reynolds. 90 Moreover, in recent years the [state\'s secrets doctrine
has **transformed** from an evidentiary privilege to a **dispositive
privilege** to **dismiss suits**]{.underline}. 91 Additionally, [the
courts have shown a **degree** of **deference** toward the **military**
and military policy **underscoring** the **President\'s authority** as
**Commander-in-Chief**]{.underline}. 92 One example is the Koramatsu
decision, where the Court found that military necessity was an adequate
reason for the internment of Japanese-Americans. 93 Taken together,
[state secrets and deference to the military are additional **bars** to
**litigation**]{.underline}. 94

Finally, specific to military members, is the [Feres
Doctrine]{.underline}, which [grants **civil suit immunity** to the
military in a wide variety of causes of action]{.underline}. 95 The end
result is that the [courts dismiss these suits]{.underline} under the
Feres Doctrine. 96 Because Captain Smith\'s [suit]{.underline} is
[against the **Commander-in-Chief**]{.underline}, such a suit [could
also be **barred** under the **Feres Doctrine**]{.underline}, although
the Feres Doctrine has primarily been a torts doctrine. 97 Thus, the
[Feres Doctrine could act as a bar to litigants]{.underline}. 98 In
short, [**multiple judicial doctrines** exist, such as **standing**, or
**mootness**, or **political questions**, which **bar litigation** of
the **War Powers** doctrine]{.underline}. 99

2\. Congressional Abdication

If the War Powers are truly a political question, as the courts
maintain, then [part of the **blame** lies with
**Congress**.]{.underline} 183 [Part of the problem is that Congress has
**only toyed** with **fixing** the **W**ar **P**owers **R**esolution
using its **normal legislative capabilities**, or considered **outright
repeal**]{.underline}. 184 Other [members of Congress have settled for
**incremental modification**, requiring the President to consult
Congress more frequently and return to a more consultative system for
using military force, but with**out results**.]{.underline} 185 [Nor
have **Congressional-led lawsuits** led to anything]{.underline};
moreover, [many of these lawsuits have **partisan roots**.]{.underline}
186

[Congress also deserves a **degree of blame** for the **current AUMF
status** via **continued funding** of the use of military
force.]{.underline} 187 [Funding war is a **Congressional
power**]{.underline}, one [which Congress could **potentially withhold**
and end]{.underline} some use of [military force]{.underline}, even
while troops are engaged. 188 Yet, [to contend plausibly that Congress
would **cease funding**]{.underline} with deployed troops in the field,
for instance, [**utterly ignores** the **political problems** of that
choice and **ignores** the **political costs** associated with funding,
making **sole control** of **funding** an **ineffective check** on the
**Executive Branch**]{.underline}. 189 Moreover, [Congress continues to
**vote for funding** for military operations, **tacitly approving** the
**President\'s actions**.]{.underline} 190 [Between continuing to **fund
wars** and **lack of legislative initiative** on the **war powers**,
Congress has **effectively abdicated** its position, and has not adopted
a way that would make the use of military force a more **consultative
act** between **Executive** and **Legislation**]{.underline}, which this
Note proposes. 191 Therefore, [Congress\' supine **stance**,
**partisanship**, and other **maladies** do not auger that
**Congressional action** will **change** the **policy** of **perpetual
war**]{.underline}. 192

#### Exec circumvents AND Courts strikedown the CP

By Erica H. **Ma 21**, J.D., 2020, New York University School of Law;
B.A., 2015, University of Pennsylvania, \"Article: The War Powers
Resolution and the Concept of Hostilities,\" Northeastern University Law
Review, 13, 519, pp. 535-537, May 2021, Lexis, nihara

In line with the purpose of the resolution, the Senate report of the WPR
noted that Section 5(b) is the \"heart and core\" of the resolution and
\"represents, in an historic sense, a restoration of the
constitution\[al\] balance which has been distorted by practice in our
history.\" 87[[Exec]{.mark}utive]{.underline} branch
[officials]{.underline}, however, [have **[challenged]{.mark}** this
[provision]{.mark} in particular [as]{.mark} an
\"**[unconstitutional]{.mark} infringement** on the President\'s
authority as Commander in Chief.\"]{.underline} 88Moreover, the
[executive branch has argued that this provision \"[**interferes**
with]{.mark} **successful [action]{.mark}**, **[signals]{.mark}** a
**[divided nation]{.mark}** and **[lack of resolve]{.mark}**, gives the
enemy a basis for hoping that the President will be forced by domestic
opponents to stop an action, and **[increases risk]{.mark}** to **U.S.
forces** in the field.\"]{.underline} 89While [Section 5(c) of the WPR
allows Congress]{.underline}, through a concurrent resolution, [to
**direct the President** to **remove** U.S. **armed forces** from
situations of **hostilities**,]{.underline} the [[Supreme
Court]{.mark}\'s 1983 decision **INS v. Chadha**]{.underline}, which
**[[struck down]{.underline}]{.mark}** one-house [**legislative
[vetoes]{.mark}** not presented to the President]{.underline} for
signature, has [[cast doubt on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[constitutionality]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Section 5(c). 90

Because of the dispute over the constitutionality of Section 5(b), [the
**meaning** of \"**hostilities**\" under the WPR has become
**contested** through the years]{.underline}, as the sixty-day
termination clock is only triggered when U.S. armed forces are
introduced \"into hostilities or into situations where imminent
involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances.\"
91At the time of the WPR\'s passage, a report of the House [Foreign
Affairs Committee defined \"hostilities\" **broadly**]{.underline}: It
noted that \"hostilities\" is [\"broader in scope\" than an \"armed
conflict\"]{.underline} (a term with legal meaning under international
law), [and]{.underline} that \"hostilities\" c[an include a \"state of
confrontation in which no shots have been fired.\"]{.underline}
92[However]{.underline}, as Section II.C elaborates, [subsequent
**presidential [administrations]{.mark}**]{.underline}\--including the
Ford Administration, the first to submit a forty-eight-hour report
pursuant to the hostilities/imminent hostilities prong of the
WPR\--[interpreted \"hostilities\" **narrowly**]{.underline} to
encompass only situations where \"units of the U.S. armed forces are
actively engaged in exchanges of fire with opposing units of hostile
forces.\" 93[This [narrow interpretation of]{.mark}
\"[hostilities]{.mark}\" has [allowed Presidents]{.mark} through the
years [to claim that there is a **greater range** of]{.mark}
**[situations]{.mark}** in[to which he can **send**]{.mark} **U.S.
[armed forces without triggering]{.mark}** the **[WPR\'s]{.mark}
withdrawal mandate**]{.underline}.
