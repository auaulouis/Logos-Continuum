### 1NC -- UQ -- General

#### Competitiveness [passes]{.underline} -- companies are helping [policymakers]{.underline} AND details of the bill are being [negotiated]{.underline}

**Flatley & Wasson 7/20** (Daniel Flatley, National Security Reporter,
Erik Wasson, Congressional Reporter, 7-20-2022, \"Senate Moves Forward
With \$52 Billion in Semiconductor Funding,\" Bloomberg,

DOA: 7-20-2022//Smarx Ahsan)

The US [Senate voted]{.underline} by a wide margin [to]{.underline}
begin [**debate** on legislation to provide]{.underline} more than \$52
billion in grants and [incentives for the American semiconductor
industry]{.underline}, a **[major milestone]{.underline}** [for
the]{.underline} long-stalled [package]{.underline} that [proponents say
is vital to national security]{.underline}.

The [64-34 procedural vote]{.underline} on Tuesday night [met the
criteria set by]{.underline} Senate Majority Leader Chuck
[Schumer]{.underline} [to add **r**esearch **and**
**d**evelopment]{.underline} [initiatives circulated by]{.underline}
Republican Todd [**Young** and]{.underline} Democrat Kyrsten
**[Sinema]{.underline}** [to the legislation]{.underline}, [which could
be **passed by the Senate** next week.]{.underline}

Schumer before the vote called it "[legislation our country
desperately]{.underline}, desperately [needs]{.underline}."

[Details of the bill]{.underline}, a [scaled-down version]{.underline}
of the original and more expansive measure intended to make the US more
competitive with China in technology and advanced manufacturing, [are
still being **worked out**.]{.underline}

In addition to money to assist semiconductor companies building
fabrication plants or "fabs" in the US, [a draft bill circulated by the
Senate leadership includes]{.underline} a 25% [investment tax credit
for]{.underline} manufacture of [semiconductors]{.underline} and tools
to create semiconductors, \$500 million for an international secure
communications program, \$200 million for worker training and \$1.5
billion for public wireless supply-chain innovation.

[The provisions]{.underline} proposed by Young and Sinema [would
establish a]{.underline} **[directorate]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
technology and [innovation]{.underline} within the National Science
Foundation [to support]{.underline} basic and applied research and
bolster [education i]{.underline}n science, [technology]{.underline},
engineering and mathematics. Schumer had said the Senate needed at least
60 votes to show support for those provisions.

The [legislation]{.underline} also [would have to pass the
**House**]{.underline}, where Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said
[**Democrats** would support the Senate version]{.underline}, [even if
some wanted a broader bill]{.underline}.

"[We **need** to do the chips part]{.underline} and [if we
don't]{.underline} do that [**we will lose** chip
manufacturing]{.underline} to other places," he said.

Senate GOP leader Mitch [McConnell]{.underline}, who had previously
threatened to block the wider legislation until Democrats dropped their
plans for a tax and climate package, voted against starting debate. He
[said]{.underline} earlier in the day that [he wanted to see what is in
the eventual legislation]{.underline} first, even though [he called
the]{.underline} domestic [chip manufacturing]{.underline} "**[a
national security issue]{.underline}** of significant proportion."

The [Biden]{.underline} administration, lawmakers from both parties and
the semiconductor industry have [called the chips
incentives]{.underline} **[urgent]{.underline}** [amid a global shortage
and supply chain disruptions]{.underline} that have affected industries
including automobiles, electronics and appliances. [The US still leads
the world in chip design]{.underline}, but [manufacturing]{.underline}
has [shifted to Asia]{.underline}. The [legislation aims to bring more
chipmaking back to the US]{.underline}.

Some **[companies]{.underline}**, including Intel Corp., [and a
**lobbying** group]{.underline}, the [Semiconductor Industry
Association]{.underline}, [have been seeking changes to the legislation
to allow production of more advanced chips in China]{.underline}. The
current language bans investment in plants that produce chips smaller
than 28 nanometers while some facilities in the country are already
producing 16 nanometer chips.

"[Legislation this]{.underline} **[complex]{.underline}** and important
[requires input from all stakeholders]{.underline}," Intel spokesperson
Nancy Sanchez said in an emailed statement. "[Intel and many
companies]{.underline} in our industry [have come together with our
trade association to]{.underline} **[provide input to
policymakers]{.underline}** in order [to ensure that we have the best
legislation possible and don't]{.underline} inadvertently [undermine the
global competitiveness of companies]{.underline} that receive CHIPS
funds."

#### Congress works to pass the [CHIPS act]{.underline} -- [ensures]{.underline} the US [wins]{.underline} the tech race

**Seddiq 7/23** (Oma Seddiq, politics reporter for Insider, where she
covers Congress, the White House and the Supreme Court, 7-22-2022, \"A
bipartisan bill years in the making to boost the US semiconductor
industry and competition with China will soon hit the Senate floor for a
final vote,\" Business Insider,
https://www.businessinsider.com/chips-act-bill-to-boost-us-chipmaking-competition-with-china-2022-7,
DOA: 7-23-2022//Smarx Ahsan)

[As soon as]{.underline} **[next week]{.underline}**, the
[Senate]{.underline} is expected [to hold a vote on a bipartisan bill
that would provide]{.underline} **[billions]{.underline}** of dollars
[in]{.underline} federal [funding to **rebuild**]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} [US]{.underline} **[semiconductor]{.underline}**
[industry]{.underline}. It\'s [an effort]{.underline}
**[years]{.underline}** [in the making]{.underline} designed [to boost
competition with China]{.underline}, [home to]{.underline} one of the
[fastest-growing]{.underline} **[chip markets]{.underline}** in the
world.

The [Senate]{.underline} on Tuesday [held]{.underline} an important
**[procedural vote]{.underline}** that [passed]{.underline} [64-34 to
clear]{.underline} [the way for]{.underline} the
**[legislation]{.underline}** [to be considered for a]{.underline} final
[vote]{.underline}. The bill, known as the [CHIPS]{.underline} Act,
[would provide]{.underline} around [\$52 billion in
subsidies]{.underline} and tax breaks [to American chip manufacturers to
incentivize them to build new factories]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[bolster]{.underline}** [production]{.underline} in the country.

\"[Members]{.underline} of both sides [know]{.underline} that
[America\'s chips crisis is sending]{.underline}
**[shockwaves]{.underline}** [across the economy]{.underline}. It is
**[endangering]{.underline}** our [national security]{.underline},\"
Senate Majority Leader Chuck [Schumer said]{.underline} Thursday. \"[To
ignore the chips crisis means]{.underline} **[higher
costs]{.underline}**, [squandered job opportunities]{.underline},
greater **[dependence]{.underline}** [on foreign chip
producers]{.underline}. Thankfully, the **[Senate is
close]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} finally **[taking
action]{.underline}**.\"

[The bill attempts to combat]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[global
chip shortage]{.underline}**, largely [driven by supply
issues]{.underline} caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It also [aims to
provide new jobs across]{.underline} a slew of
**[industries]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} [rely on
chipmaking]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} the [automotive,
energy, electronics, and transport]{.underline} sectors, to name a few.
[Computer chips]{.underline} are **[essential]{.underline}** to
countless products, from cars to phones to laundry machines and digital
services.

\"Of course I believe [America will lead the way]{.underline},
**[if]{.underline}** [this chamber is willing to do what is]{.underline}
**[necessary]{.underline}** [for our]{.underline} economic and our
**[national security]{.underline}**,\" Schumer said.

The [US]{.underline}, once the global leader in chip-making, has [faced
increased competition from]{.underline} several [countries]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} [China, Taiwan and the]{.underline}
**[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion, [which have poured
major investments into]{.underline} their [domestic
industries]{.underline}.

Commerce Secretary Gina [Raimondo]{.underline} has repeatedly [warned
about China\'s increased competition]{.underline} and called on Congress
[to take action in response]{.underline}. American
[chipmakers]{.underline}, such as Intel, have [also urged **Congress**
to reach a deal to **help the industry** and **mitigate the
shortage**]{.underline}.

\"[If Congress]{.underline} **[fails]{.underline}** [to pass
this]{.underline} the next couple of weeks, **[China wins, America
loses]{.underline}**,\" Raimondo told reporters on July 15, according to
the Columbus Dispatch. \"In fact, [China is lobbying against this
bill]{.underline} precisely [because they know it will make America
stronger]{.underline} and enable us to compete. [China is **not
waiting**]{.underline}. The rest of the world is not waiting.\"

Negotiations in Congress have dragged, though both Democrats and
Republicans are united in seeking to constrain China\'s economy. The
Senate last year passed a bill to strengthen the semiconductor industry
and US research and development, but the House had its own legislation,
and neither version became law, CNBC reported.

Yet [there appears to be a]{.underline} **[greater
urgency]{.underline}** [to get something done]{.underline} this time
around. If the bill, which has yet to be finalized, is approved by the
Senate, it would then head to the House for passage and lastly to
President Joe Biden\'s desk for his signature. The [Biden]{.underline}
administration has [pushed]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the
**[legislation]{.underline}** [to advance before Congress leaves for its
summer recess]{.underline} starting in August.

https://www.eenews.net/articles/congress-nears-passage-of-innovation-research-bill/,
DOA: 7-25-2022//Smarx Ahsan)

After months of work, [Congress]{.underline} is [looking to pass an
innovation]{.underline} and economic **[competitiveness]{.underline}**
[package]{.underline} this week [with large authorizations for
the]{.underline} [**D**epartment **o**f **E**nergy]{.underline}.

The [legislation]{.underline} [would inject]{.underline} more than [\$50
billion]{.underline} [to spur]{.underline} a [domestic semiconductor
manufacturing **renaissance**]{.underline} [while]{.underline} also
**[retooling]{.underline}** t[he nation's innovation engines
to]{.underline} better [address]{.underline} **[emerging]{.underline}**
21st-century **[technologies]{.underline}**.

To get there, leaders and [Biden]{.underline} administration officials
are [attempting to]{.underline} **[navigate]{.underline}** the [concerns
of progressive lawmakers]{.underline}, [who are expressing]{.underline}
**[unease]{.underline}** [at the prospect of]{.underline} an alleged
[corporate handout to the chip industry]{.underline}
**[despite]{.underline}** [backers calling the legislation a **national
security** imperative]{.underline}. The Senate is holding another
procedural vote this evening.

"[This is a matter of]{.underline} **[national security]{.underline}**,
and [I don't think we can put a price tag on it]{.underline} because [we
are in a very vulnerable]{.underline} [spot]{.underline}," Commerce
Secretary Gina Raimondo said yesterday on CBS's "Face the Nation."

[Leaders]{.underline} are looking [to **address**]{.underline}
[progressive worries]{.underline}, especially [stemming
from]{.underline} Sen. Bernie [Sanders]{.underline} (I-Vt.), by
[attaching]{.underline} so-called **[guardrails]{.underline}** [that
would prevent companies from using federal funds for stock buyback
campaigns]{.underline} or [relocating facilities to China]{.underline}.

Raimondo said [the chip money will come with]{.underline} "many [strings
attached]{.underline} ... so [to say it]{.underline} [is a blank check
is]{.underline} just dead **[wrong]{.underline}**."

House Speaker Nancy [Pelosi]{.underline} (D-Calif.) has also [looked to
highlight]{.underline} the [legislation's **guardrails**]{.underline}.

"What's really important is that --- to us --- is that there would be
[guardrails to ensure that chip investments benefit U.S.
workers]{.underline}, not foreign companies ---
[strengthening]{.underline} [**r**esearch **and**
**d**evelopment]{.underline} for basic science and next-generation
technologies," Pelosi told reporters last week.

While [Democratic leaders]{.underline} are [worried about their party's
left flank]{.underline}, **[conservatives]{.underline}** are
[launching]{.underline} their own [**broadside** against the bill over
**allegations** it represents a]{.underline}
"**[zombie-like]{.underline}**" [version of **legislation** passed
by]{.underline} House [Democrats earlier]{.underline} this year.

Late last week the Republican Study Caucus, a group of House
[conservatives]{.underline}, [said the]{.underline} emerging
**[compromise]{.underline}** in the Senate [did not go far enough to
fight China]{.underline} [while]{.underline} also [giving
out]{.underline} billions in alleged "[corporate welfare]{.underline}"
[benefits]{.underline} to the chip industry.

"In their effort to win 60 votes, they seem to have forgotten that the
bill must pass both chambers to become law," House Science ranking
member Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) said in a statement last week.

[This week's action follows the **collapse**]{.underline} [of conference
committee talks]{.underline} [to reconcile]{.underline} H.R. 4521, the
"America [COMPETES]{.underline} Act," and S. 1260, the "U.S. Innovation
and Competition Act."

[The new Senate legislation includes]{.underline} an authorization of
[\$50 billion]{.underline} over five years [for DOE's **O**ffice **o**f
**S**cience]{.underline}, the first such reauthorization in the office's
history.

[The **N**ational **S**cience **F**oundation would get \$81
billion]{.underline} over five years, [including]{.underline} [\$20
billion for a]{.underline} new [technology directorate]{.underline}
meant [to spur]{.underline} technologies like [quantum computing and
**a**rtificial **i**ntelligence]{.underline}.

[That matches]{.underline} **[language]{.underline}** [that emerged from
the House Science]{.underline}, [Space and Technology
Committee]{.underline}, although some House-backed trade and climate
provisions were dropped from the package.

"[Of course]{.underline}, [after]{.underline} months of
[negotiating]{.underline} between the House and the Senate on an
innovation package, [**compromises** had to be made]{.underline}, and
[not everyone is going to get all that they]{.underline} originally
[wanted]{.underline} --- including me," House Science Chair Eddie
Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) said in a statement.

"But [that is the]{.underline} **[nature]{.underline}** [of
compromise]{.underline}," she added. "[We need to recognize
the]{.underline} **[urgency]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} acting on
[these provisions]{.underline} and getting this legislation to the
President for his signature."

Senate Majority Leader Chuck [Schumer]{.underline} (D-N.Y.) [held a test
vote]{.underline} last week before [deciding whether to pursue DOE and
NSF money]{.underline} on top of chip spending. [That vote got **16**
Republicans and **most** Democrats]{.underline}. Sanders voted no.

[Senate passage could happen]{.underline} as soon as
**[tomorrow]{.underline}**, and [the House is poised to act
**quickly**]{.underline}. [The goal is for]{.underline} President Joe
**[Biden]{.underline}** [to sign the legislation before
recess.]{.underline}

"[This will be a]{.underline} **[big bipartisan]{.underline}**
[vote]{.underline} in the House and the Senate," Raimondo predicted.
"[You see]{.underline} former Secretary Mike [Pompeo]{.underline} today,
**[tweeting]{.underline}** [out in favor of]{.underline} it. You're
going to see [Republicans and Democrats]{.underline} **[coming
together]{.underline}** because [it's about national
defense]{.underline}, it's about jobs."

### 2NC -- Floor time?

#### Test vote proves [broad swaths]{.underline} of support for the bill, they want to get something done before recess -- passage is [likely]{.underline}, BUT [rushing]{.underline} through other priorities prompts McConnell to [block]{.underline} the bill -- [Absent]{.underline} passage, the US [loses]{.underline} the tech race -- Debates make us better [advocates]{.underline} and [train us]{.underline} to be better [policymakers]{.underline} so we can go to congress and use our skills to pass the bill ourselves, [this debate is KEY]{.underline}

DOA: 7-20-2022//Smarx Ahsan)

The US [Senate]{.underline} appears **[likely to pass]{.underline}**
[legislation that would]{.underline} deliver billions of dollars of
federal [funding to the]{.underline} American [semiconductor
industry]{.underline}, a **[top priority]{.underline}** [in the Biden
admin]{.underline}istration's **[continuing efforts]{.underline}** [to
out-compete China]{.underline}, [after a preliminary vote]{.underline}
on Tuesday.

The [Senate's procedural vote passed]{.underline} **[64 to
34]{.underline}**, but the [legislation]{.underline} will still
[require]{.underline} additional [voting rounds before final
passage]{.underline} in the chamber.

[If the bill]{.underline} ultimately **[passes]{.underline}** both
chambers of Congress and becomes law, the [legislation would
provide]{.underline} about [\$52 billion to the semiconductor
industry]{.underline}, which [produces the microchips essential
to]{.underline} everything from **[weapons]{.underline}** to household
goods to video games to cars.

"[Advancing]{.underline} this bill [is crucial for lowering
costs]{.underline}, [solving]{.underline} our nation's [chip shortage
and making sure America]{.underline} **[remains
competitive]{.underline}** in the 21st century," Senate Majority Leader
Chuck [Schumer]{.underline}, a New York Democrat, said moments before
voting, [referring to the **vote as a "test"**.]{.underline}

"[America will fall behind]{.underline} in so many areas [if we don't
pass this bill]{.underline}, and [we could]{.underline} very well [lose
our ranking as the number one]{.underline} economy and [innovator in the
world]{.underline} **[if we can't pass this]{.underline}**."

For more than a year, the [semiconductor funding has been]{.underline}
**[at the heart]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} sprawling
[legislation]{.underline} meant [to boost Washington]{.underline} over
Beijing [in the quest for]{.underline} a greater share of [global chip
production]{.underline}.

The [Senate passed]{.underline} its own version of that [broader
competition]{.underline} [bill]{.underline}, which touched on nearly
every aspect of the US-China rivalry and drew substantial bipartisan
support last June.

In February, [Democrats]{.underline} in the House of Representatives
[passed]{.underline} their own version of the [competition
legislation]{.underline}, but [did so on]{.underline} what was
essentially [a party-line vote.]{.underline}

Since the spring, the two chambers of [Congress]{.underline} have been
[engaged in a]{.underline} rare **[bipartisan]{.underline}**, bicameral
[negotiation process to]{.underline} try and resolve their differences
and [produce a compromise version]{.underline} of the bill [that can
attract enough votes to become law]{.underline}.

But the [negotiations have become entwined in]{.underline} other
**[policy debates]{.underline}** and political divisions [in
Congress]{.underline}.

Late last month, Senate minority leader Mitch [McConnell]{.underline}
[warned he would **block**]{.underline} the [China competition
legislation]{.underline} [if Democrats]{.underline} **[tried to
rush]{.underline}** [through a separate]{.underline},
**[unrelated]{.underline}** [bill]{.underline} that would raise
corporate taxes and spend money to fight climate change.

[Beyond]{.underline} the [semiconductor]{.underline} industry
[funding]{.underline}, [different versions of the]{.underline} China
competition [bill]{.underline} have also [included]{.underline}
priorities related to [human **rights** in China]{.underline}, [science
research **funding**]{.underline} in America, [and US **alliances**
around China's periphery]{.underline}.

[One]{.underline} recent [version]{.underline} of the bill [would create
a **human rights envoy**]{.underline} [for China's far-west Xinjiang
region]{.underline}, where Washington says [Beijing is committing
genocide]{.underline} and crimes against humanity [aimed at the Muslim
Uygur]{.underline} ethnic [group]{.underline}.

[It would]{.underline} also **[strengthen]{.underline}** [US ties to
Taiwan]{.underline}, and change the name of Taipei's de facto embassy in
Washington to "Taiwan Representative Office in the United States" -- a
move welcomed by Taiwan, but [certain to infuriate Beijing]{.underline},
which views the self-governed island as its own territory.

The status of those other China-related provisions is now uncertain.
[Lawmakers]{.underline} were [scrambling]{.underline} on Tuesday in the
hours before the vote [to include other hard-fought
priorities]{.underline} in the bill, but [a final draft was
not]{.underline} immediately [available]{.underline} to the public as
voting began.

Were the \$52 billion in semiconductor industry funding to become law,
[lawmakers could]{.underline} still continue to
**[negotiate]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} separate
[compromise]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [the rest of the]{.underline}
competition [bill]{.underline}, but it is unclear if they would do so.

In theory, [the House could]{.underline} also [set up a vote to pass the
Senate's version]{.underline} of the competition legislation, which
already passed the Senate last June. But [it is unclear
whether]{.underline} House [**Democratic leadership** would be
**willing** to act on such a major bill if it was written]{.underline}
entirely [by the Senate]{.underline}, without input from their own
members.

[Lawmakers will]{.underline} also soon [be leaving
Washington]{.underline} [for]{.underline} their August
**[recess]{.underline}**, and [after that will spend]{.underline} much
more [time on their campaigns]{.underline} leading up to the midterm
elections on November 8. [One-third of the Senate and the]{.underline}
entire [House]{.underline} of Representatives [will be on the
ballot]{.underline}.

#### [Urgency]{.underline} frames this debate -- Congress want to get something passed [before]{.underline} August to [revive]{.underline} our national security and competitiveness, procedural vote proves [momentum]{.underline}

[After months]{.underline} and months [of]{.underline} start-and-stop
**[negotiations]{.underline}**, [the Senate]{.underline} on Tuesday
[voted to advance a]{.underline} \$[52 billion bill]{.underline} aimed
at [boosting]{.underline} domestic [semiconductor

**[crucial]{.underline}** [to **ease** supply chain

**[competitiveness]{.underline}** [with China]{.underline}.

What You Need To Know

- [The Senate]{.underline} on Tuesday night [voted to advance
  a]{.underline} \$52 billion [bill]{.underline} aimed at [boosting
  domestic semiconductor production]{.underline}

- [The measure includes]{.underline} tens of [billions]{.underline} of
  dollars [to]{.underline} "build, [expand]{.underline}, or modernize
  [domestic facilities and equipment for semiconductor]{.underline}
  fabrication, [assembly]{.underline}, testing, advanced
  [packaging]{.underline} [or **r**]{.underline}esearch
  **[and]{.underline}** **[d]{.underline}**evelopment\"

- The [bill]{.underline} also [includes]{.underline} certain
  "**[safeguards]{.underline}**," including language [which
  says]{.underline} that [federal funds cannot be used for stock
  buybacks]{.underline}, [nor can they be used to]{.underline} "[build
  advanced semiconductor production]{.underline} facilities in countries
  [that present a national security concern]{.underline}," including
  China

[Biden]{.underline} administration officials had recently **[sounded the
alarm]{.underline}** [about]{.underline} the long-stalled
[legislation]{.underline}, urging that [if it did not pass
quickly]{.underline}, [there would be dire ramifications
for]{.underline} **[national security]{.underline}** and the economy

The measure, known as the [CHIPS Act]{.underline} of 2022,
[contains]{.underline} [\$39 billion]{.underline} in financial aid
[to]{.underline} "[build, expand]{.underline}, or
[modernize]{.underline} domestic [facilities and equipment for
semiconductor]{.underline} fabrication, assembly, testing, advanced
[packaging]{.underline} [or **r**esearch **and**
**d**evelopment]{.underline}." Of that figure, [\$6 billion can be used
for loan guarantees]{.underline} or direct loans.

The [bill cleared a]{.underline} **[major]{.underline}** procedural
[hurdle]{.underline} on Tuesday night, [advancing]{.underline}
comfortably [in a 64-34 vote]{.underline}.

An additional [\$11 billion]{.underline} will be [devoted
to]{.underline} the [Commerce Department for]{.underline} advanced
[**r**esearch **and** **d**evelopment]{.underline} programs[, \$2
billion]{.underline} will go [to the Pentagon for workforce]{.underline}
applications and national [defense programs]{.underline}, [\$500
million]{.underline} will be [utilized by the State Department to
"support]{.underline} international information and [communications
technology security and semiconductor]{.underline} **[supply chain
activities]{.underline}**," and [\$200 million will be used for a
domestic workforce and education fund.]{.underline}

The [measure]{.underline} also [includes]{.underline} certain
"[safeguards]{.underline}," including language [which says that federal
funds cannot be used for stock buybacks]{.underline}, nor can they be
used to "build advanced semiconductor production facilities in countries
that present a national security concern," including China.

The [Senate passed]{.underline} its \$250 billion U.S. Innovation and
Competition Act, or [USICA]{.underline}, in June 2021 by a [68-32
vote]{.underline}. The [bill]{.underline} includes \$52 billion to
[incentivize]{.underline} more [companies to build factories in the
U.S]{.underline}. In February, the [House approved]{.underline} its own
version, called the **[A]{.underline}**merica **[C]{.underline}**ompetes
**[A]{.underline}**ct --- a \$350 billion plan. That [legislation
passed]{.underline} largely [on party lines]{.underline}. Both
[bills]{.underline} aim to [make the U.S. more competitive]{.underline}
against China and strengthen domestic supply chains by investing in the
chip industry.

Senate and House [lawmakers]{.underline} have been [negotiating
toward]{.underline} **[compromise legislation]{.underline}**, as their
[bills differ on how to improve]{.underline} **[r]{.underline}**esearch
**[and]{.underline}** **[d]{.underline}**evelopment, whether [to
expedite visas for]{.underline} skilled [foreign citizens]{.underline},
and how [to protect U.S. research]{.underline} from foreign
interference.

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [and]{.underline} other key
[lawmakers]{.underline} **[signaled]{.underline}** that [they would
support a]{.underline} scaled-down [version of the measure
that]{.underline} just [bolsters]{.underline} [semiconductor
manufacturing]{.underline}, with the preference to approve that more
urgently and move other parts of the bill later.

"[There are]{.underline} several [parts of]{.underline} the **[broader
legislation]{.underline}** [that are important]{.underline}, and I am
[committed to doing whatever it takes to get them over the **finish
line**]{.underline} in this Congress," Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo
wrote in a statement. "But [chips funding is the only part of this bill
that we **have to pass** r]{.underline}ight now to avoid facing
devastating consequences."

After Tuesday\'s vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck
[Schumer]{.underline}, D-N.Y., [filed a **bipartisan** amendment which
would include]{.underline} tens of [**billions** of dollars in funding
for the Commerce Department]{.underline}, the National Science
Foundation [and other agencies]{.underline}.

**[Schumer]{.underline}**, one of the [bill\'s biggest
backers]{.underline}, said Tuesday that [he expects many of the
provisions left out of the scaled-down bill]{.underline} will [be
brought up again]{.underline} at a later date.

\"[There are lots of things]{.underline} **[Republicans and
Democrats]{.underline}** [want in the eventual bill that
will]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [be in this bill]{.underline},
even if science is included,\" he said, adding that [there will be
a]{.underline} \"**[bipartisan desire]{.underline}**\" [to get a deal
done]{.underline}.

[Should the bill pass the **Senate**]{.underline}, the [House is
**expected** to t]{.underline}ake up the measure and [send it
to]{.underline} President Joe [Biden\'s desk.]{.underline}

In a letter to her Democratic colleagues Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy
[Pelosi]{.underline}, D-Calif., [hailed Tuesday's vote as]{.underline}
"**[important progress]{.underline}**" [on the measure]{.underline},
which she called "**[a bold, bipartisan package]{.underline}** that will
lower costs for families here at home while [reigniting American
competitiveness]{.underline} on the world stage."

[Pelosi said]{.underline} that [passing the bill is an]{.underline}
"**[economic necessity]{.underline}** [to lower costs for
consumers]{.underline}" and "[a national security
**imperative**]{.underline} as we seek [to reduce]{.underline} our
[dependence on foreign manufacturers]{.underline}."

"[The Chips Act]{.underline} for America is [a major victory
for]{.underline} American families and [the American
economy]{.underline}," Pelosi wrote. "As the Senate undergoes its
legislative process, we are **[optimistic]{.underline}** that [the House
will]{.underline} be able to [take this bill up]{.underline} as early as
**[next week]{.underline}**."

[Biden]{.underline} administration officials had recently [sounded the
alarm about the]{.underline} long-stalled [legislation]{.underline},
urging that [if it did not pass]{.underline} quickly, [there would
be]{.underline} dire **[ramifications]{.underline}** [for national
security and the economy]{.underline} --- including [risking the loss
of]{.underline} a number of planned multi-billion dollar **[domestic
investments.]{.underline}**

Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger said last week he might delay development of
a \$20 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility in Ohio if Congress
does not soon approve billions of dollars in subsidies for his industry.

In an interview with Washington Post Live last week, Gelsinger said he
will "make a decision to delay our project in Ohio if" a chip subsidy
bill "doesn't pass."

\"[There are **real‑time** consequences if this doesn\'t
pass]{.underline},\" he said.

Similarly, Commerce Secretary Raimondo told CNBC last month that
[Taiwan]{.underline}-based [semiconductor company]{.underline}
**[GlobalWafers]{.underline}** [might not follow through on its plans to
build a factory in]{.underline} Sherman, [Texas]{.underline}, [if
Congress **doesn't** approve the]{.underline}
**[incentives]{.underline}** for chip production.

"[This investment]{.underline} that they're making [is contingent
upon]{.underline} **[Congress passing]{.underline}**" the funding, she
said. "The CEO told me that herself."

Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO of Micron, a computer memory and data
storage company, told Fox News on Monday the [public funding is needed
to level the playing field with countries]{.underline} whose governments
have invested heavily in semiconductor manufacturing for more than 20
years.

[The U.S. share of]{.underline} the worldwide [chip
manufacturing]{.underline} market [has declined]{.underline} from
**[37%]{.underline}** in 1990 to 12% today, according to the
Semiconductor Industry Association.

"[We need to get it]{.underline} (the [legislation]{.underline})
**[across the finish]{.underline}** line for jobs, [for the]{.underline}
resilient [domestic supply chain]{.underline} here in the U.S.
[and]{.underline}, of course, at the same time, ([for]{.underline})
**[economic security]{.underline}**, but also **[national
security]{.underline}**," Mehrotra said.

In an interview with Spectrum News last week, Cecilia Rouse, chair of
the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said [the bills are very
important in increasing the United States' economic
capacity]{.underline}.

"[They go to helping us make our economy]{.underline} **[more
productive]{.underline}**, which [helps us address challenges such as
Russia\'s war against Ukraine]{.underline}, **[challenges such
inflation]{.underline}**," she said. "[It helps us address]{.underline}
**[those policies]{.underline}** [and face those]{.underline} those
[challenges and maintain economic health going forward]{.underline} as
well. So [we call on Congress to do the right thing]{.underline}."

"[Bottom line is there are]{.underline} very real, very [**devastating
consequences** if Congress doesn\'t do its job]{.underline} in the month
of July,\" Raimondo said in an interview with The Associated Press.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. **[House]{.underline}** [plans to
**vote**]{.underline} as early as next week [on]{.underline} a
slimmed-down version of **[legislation]{.underline}** [to
provide]{.underline} tens of [**billions** of dollars in]{.underline}
subsidies and [tax credits for the semiconductor industry]{.underline},
Speaker Nancy [Pelosi said.]{.underline}

On Tuesday, the [Senate backed]{.underline} by [64 to 34]{.underline} a
**[procedural measure]{.underline}** [to set the stage for potential
votes to pass]{.underline} the [legislation]{.underline} [in the
Senate]{.underline} **[as soon as this week.]{.underline}**

[The bill]{.underline} \"is [a]{.underline} major
**[victory]{.underline}** [for American families and the]{.underline}
American [economy]{.underline},\" [Pelosi]{.underline} said in a letter
to lawmakers, [calling it]{.underline} \"[a **bold**]{.underline},
**[bipartisan]{.underline}** [package that will lower costs]{.underline}
for families here at home [while reigniting American
competitiveness]{.underline} on the world stage.\"

[The bill aims to ease a shortage that]{.underline} has [disrupted
production in industries]{.underline} from automobiles to electronics
and **[high-tech weapons]{.underline}**. [It is part of a broad effort
across the government to **push back** against]{.underline} an ascendant
[**China** and ease supply-chain problems]{.underline} by decreasing
U.S. companies\' reliance on foreign-made semiconductors.

\"[As the Senate undergoes its legislative process]{.underline}, we are
**[optimistic]{.underline}** that the [House will be able to take this
bill up]{.underline} as early as [next week]{.underline},\" Pelosi
wrote.

The final text was not released but Senate aides said the measure
includes about \$54 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor
companies, as well as a new, four-year 25% tax credit to encourage
companies to build U.S. semiconductor plants. The tax credit is
estimated to be worth about \$24 billion. There are other provisions
including a \$1 billion grant program for \"persistently distressed
communities.\"

President Joe [Biden\'s admin]{.underline}istration [urged Congress to
pass a]{.underline} [semiconductor bill]{.underline}
**[before]{.underline}** lawmakers leave Washington for their [August
recess]{.underline}, saying [it would]{.underline} create and preserve
U.S. jobs and **[bolster]{.underline}** [national security]{.underline}.

[The current bill is a pared-down version of]{.underline} stalled [rival
measures]{.underline}, even though efforts to counter China are policies
generally backed by both Republicans and Biden\'s Democrats, who
narrowly control Congress.

The [Senate approved a bipartisan \$250 billion bill boosting spending
on technology]{.underline} research and development in June 2021, while
[the House passed its own version in February.]{.underline}

Republican Senator Rick Scott criticized the bill, saying taxpayers
should get a return on their investment - rather than giving grants that
do not have to be repaid. \"The taxpayer doesn\'t get anything here,\"
Scott told Reuters.

### 2AC -- BBB -- No Impact

#### Slimmed down BBB killed by Manchin -- At best it's a health care bill which doesn't solve the DA's impacts

**Zhou 7/18** \[Li Zhou, Politics and Policy Reporter Vox, BA --
Economics, English from Harvard University, \"Build Back Better may end
up a health care bill, thanks to Joe Manchin\", 7-18-2022, accessed
7-20-2022,
https://www.vox.com/2022/7/6/23197398/build-back-better-prescription-drug-prices\]
Lex IT

Sen. Joe [Manchin]{.underline} (D-WV[), a longtime holdout on the
**Build Back Better** Act, has **once again up-ended talks on the
bill**.]{.underline}

[**Democrats had hoped** to put together **a slimmed down version** of
the original \$2 trillion package, narrowly focused on health care,
climate, and tax reforms]{.underline}. **[Manchin]{.underline}**,
however, [has **expressed opposition** to additional climate and tax
policies at this time]{.underline}, and it now seems the party will have
to settle for a smaller bill than leaders wanted.

[**Manchin said** Friday that **he remains concerned** about the impact
new climate spending could have on inflation]{.underline}, [and worried
raising taxes on businesses could stymie their growth]{.underline}.

"[Inflation is]{.underline} absolutely [killing many]{.underline}, many
[people]{.underline}," [Manchin said]{.underline} in a recent interview
with MetroNews's Hoppy Kerchaval, noting that he was particularly
alarmed by the recent Labor Department report. "[Can't we wait to make
sure we do nothing to add to that?]{.underline}"

Manchin remains supportive of Democrats' prescription drugs package as
well as an extension to Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are due to
sunset at the end of this year. And he has said he may be willing to
negotiate again on taxes and climate in September, when lawmakers have
more information about where inflation stands.

At this point, Democrats have to determine if they want to advance
policies that they have agreement on or wait to see if they can get a
more expansive bill later this year. If they choose the latter, they run
the risk that **[Manchin might still not agree in]{.underline}** two
months' **[time]{.underline}**. What's more, [waiting until the fall
means negotiations will run up against both the **midterm elections and
a September 30 deadline** for passing Build Back Better through the
streamlined budget reconciliation process]{.underline}

DOA: 7-23-2022//Smarx Ahsan)

Legislation called [the CHIPS-Plus]{.underline} Act is barrelling
through Congress. Although the legislation [is]{.underline} supposed [to
boost U.S. competitiveness]{.underline} and counter China, [there
are]{.underline} several [ways]{.underline} the CHIPS-Plus Act, [if
enacted]{.underline}, [would have the]{.underline} **[opposite
effect]{.underline}**. For example:

[Increasing]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[federal budget
deficit]{.underline}**: In a matter of days, [the]{.underline} possible
[cost of the bill]{.underline} **[exploded]{.underline}** from \$52
billion [to \$279 billion]{.underline}. According to the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO), [the base 10-year deficit]{.underline} impact
[would be]{.underline} **[\$79.344 billion]{.underline}**, though, as
described below, [that number will be]{.underline} much
[higher]{.underline} [if Congress decides to appropriate the
funding]{.underline} that is authorized in the bill.

On the spending side, it [would increase outlays for]{.underline} the
following:

- \$50.4 billion for [the]{.underline} Creating Helpful Incentives to
  Produce Semiconductors ([CHIPS]{.underline}) for America
  [Fund]{.underline},

- \$1.4 billion for [Wireless Supply Chain Innovation]{.underline},

- \$3.1 billion for [research and innovation]{.underline}
  [programs]{.underline}, and

- \$19 million to [boost security for the Supreme Court]{.underline}.

- Pay-as-you-go [budget enforcement]{.underline} is [waived]{.underline}
  for the spending and [there are no offsets included]{.underline} in
  the bill.

In addition, CBO notes that [the bill would authorize]{.underline} the
appropriation of potentially \$[200 billion over]{.underline} the
2022-2031 period, primarily [for]{.underline} [research]{.underline}
activities. That's \$200 billion that is **[not]{.underline}** being
appropriated right away [in the CHIPS]{.underline}-Plus
[Act]{.underline}, but [may be appropriated in some future
bill]{.underline} passed [by Congress]{.underline}.

[The way]{.underline} many of [these spending authorizations are
written]{.underline} [could cause]{.underline} **[budgetary
confusion]{.underline}**. [Many are]{.underline} **[indirect
authorizations]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} refer to other
legislation that [will need to be drafted in the future]{.underline}.
For example, [the bill authorizes funding for]{.underline} several
[specified projects]{.underline} under the direction of the Department
of Energy\'s Office of Science. [To fund these efforts]{.underline}, the
[text of the bill provides that]{.underline} \"[out of funds authorized
to be appropriated to the Office of Science]{.underline} in a fiscal
year, there [are authorized to be appropriated]{.underline} to the
Secretary to carry out the activities described \...\" a total of \$34
billion.

The [Office of Science]{.underline} was last [authorized through
2013]{.underline}. [Appropriators]{.underline} have
[provided]{.underline} \$[52 billion to the Office since
then]{.underline} **[despite]{.underline}** the [lapsed
authorization]{.underline}. [The new text]{.underline} is largely based
on a separate bill [called the Department of Energy Science for the
Future Act of 2022]{.underline}. Its author, Senator Joe
[Manchin]{.underline} (D-WV) [noted]{.underline} that [it would
provide]{.underline} \"[the first-ever comprehensive authorization for
the DOE's Office of Science]{.underline}.\" But [the]{.underline}
funding provided in the **[language]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[hardly comprehensive]{.underline}**. [The level of
spending]{.underline} resulting from these authorizations in the
Senate\'s new bill [will depend on top]{.underline} [line levels
established]{.underline} in future authorization bills and ultimately by
appropriators.

**[Undermining tax reform]{.underline}**: The [CHIPS]{.underline}-Plus
Act [would **reverse**]{.underline} [progress made in the]{.underline}
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ([TCJA]{.underline}) [to **broaden** the tax base
and limit provisions]{.underline} designed [to benefit specific
industries]{.underline}. A \$[24 billion investment tax credit would be
narrowly targeted at semiconductor manufacturing,]{.underline} [even
though]{.underline} more **[comprehensive]{.underline}**
[reforms]{.underline} -- like returning the tax treatment of research
and development (R&D) costs to full and immediate expensing -- [would
offer similar levels of tax relief]{.underline} to a much broader array
of U.S. businesses and industries.

**[Subsidizing China]{.underline}** chip users: The
[CHIPS]{.underline}-Plus Act [could]{.underline} also
**[subsidize]{.underline}** [semiconductor chips]{.underline}
[purchased]{.underline} [by Chinese manufacturers]{.underline}. [China
is the]{.underline} **[largest export market]{.underline}** [for
U.S.]{.underline}-made semiconductor [chips]{.underline}, and
[semiconductor subsidies would free up funds for production]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} so-called legacy [semiconductor chips in
China]{.underline}. Many U[.S.-based chip companies earn **more**
on]{.underline} their **[China sales]{.underline}** [than]{.underline}
on [U.S. sales]{.underline}. There's nothing wrong with that, subject to
legitimate national defense concerns. [It]{.underline} just [shouldn't
come at taxpayer expense]{.underline}.

**[Encouraging conflict]{.underline}** instead of cooperation with our
allies: The [CHIPS]{.underline}-Plus Act has been [pitched as a response
to China]{.underline}, but instead [it helps China by
encouraging]{.underline} **[economic conflict]{.underline}** between the
United States and our allies. On July 19, the CEOs of Intel and Ford
wrote: "[**So**uth **Ko**rea]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[Taiwan]{.underline}**, notably, have [spent years]{.underline}
actively [investing in their own chip manufacturing]{.underline},
[creating]{.underline} an **[uneven playing field]{.underline}** [for
U.S. chip makers]{.underline} that **[harms]{.underline}** [our economy
and]{.underline} **[global competitiveness]{.underline}**." Intel's CEO
has said that [without subsidies]{.underline}, the [company would
invest]{.underline} "**[a lot more]{.underline}**" [in
Europe]{.underline}. He added: "We are not competing with TSMC or
Samsung. [We are competing with]{.underline} **[Taiwan]{.underline}**
and **[Japan]{.underline}** and **[Korea]{.underline}**." [Instead of
escalating a global subsidy war]{.underline} that creates conflict
between the United States and our allies, [the United States should
promote cooperation]{.underline} with Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Europe [and
other allies to respond to China's non-market activities]{.underline}.

**[Undermining]{.underline}** [U.S. **leverage** in trade]{.underline}
negotiations: The [CHIPS]{.underline}-Plus Act [weakens]{.underline}
U.S. [credibility]{.underline} [in negotiations with China]{.underline}.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai has specifically called out
"[unfair state-led industrial planning and targeting of certain
sectors]{.underline}" [by China]{.underline}. To maintain credibility on
this point, [the U.S. government should not engage in industrial
planning and targeting of its own.]{.underline}

[Encouraging industries to]{.underline} engage in
**[lobby]{.underline}**ing instead of productive activities: The
[CHIPS]{.underline} Act would en[courage other industries to ramp
up]{.underline} their [lobbying efforts]{.underline} in order [to
extract benefits]{.underline} from Congress. As Sen. Bernie
[Sanders]{.underline} (I-VT) [warned]{.underline}: "[You pass this bill
and tomorrow we'll hear]{.underline}, no doubt, [from the cellphone
industry]{.underline}, from the [computer laptop industry]{.underline},
[about how they need their welfare checks as well]{.underline}."

For these reasons, [Congress should reject the]{.underline} flawed
**[CHIPS]{.underline}**-Plus [Act]{.underline} [and]{.underline} instead
[pursue broad-based economic reforms designed to benefit **all** U.S.
taxpayers.]{.underline}

#### The bill [sabotages]{.underline} US [competitiveness]{.underline}

DOA: 7-25-2022//Smarx Ahsan)

The [CHIPS]{.underline} legislation [advancing]{.underline} rapidly
[through the Senate]{.underline} is many things. It is [an
industrial-policy bill]{.underline} and [a handout to the
higher-education industry]{.underline}. It's a bill [intended to further
entrench]{.underline} **[progressive]{.underline}**
**[pieties]{.underline}** [on diversity and equity within the federal
bureaucracy]{.underline}. And it is **[expensive]{.underline}**. What
[it is not]{.underline}, however, is [a tool for improving]{.underline}
Washington's lot in the [competition with the]{.underline} [**C**hinese
**C**ommunist **P**arty]{.underline}.

After over a year of back-and-forth, [lawmakers]{.underline} seem
[poised to converge on a final version]{.underline} of the so-called
U.S. Innovation and Competition Act this week. At first, [it seemed that
the final package would contain]{.underline} about [\$52 billion in
subsidies]{.underline} [for semiconductor manufacturing]{.underline} and
some miscellaneous other provisions. But, [as lawmakers
realized]{.underline} that a larger version of the package remained
politically feasible, [the package **ballooned**]{.underline}. The [most
recent version]{.underline}, put forward [by]{.underline} Chuck
[Schumer]{.underline}, strongly [resembles]{.underline} the original,
**[disappointing]{.underline}** [version]{.underline} that the Senate
passed last year. That's the main problem. [Sixty-four
senators]{.underline}, [including **16** Republicans]{.underline},
[voted to advance the bill]{.underline} last Tuesday.

Just as it was last time, [the latest Senate proposal is]{.underline}
**[light]{.underline}** [on measures]{.underline} intended [to give
America the advantage]{.underline} vis-à-vis China; in the thousand-page
text advanced last week, [there are]{.underline}
**[eleven]{.underline}** [mentions of]{.underline} the word
"[China]{.underline}." **[Most]{.underline}** [of the
legislation]{.underline} instead [focuses on]{.underline}
[semiconductor]{.underline}-manufacturing [subsidies]{.underline} [and a
massive]{.underline} \$80 billion [boost to the]{.underline}
[**N**ational **S**cience **F**oundation]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
[there's no]{.underline} **[meaningful]{.underline}** [investment in the
government agencies]{.underline} [that have a direct bearing on American
competitiveness]{.underline}: the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, the Commerce Department's export-control cell, the Justice
Department's foreign-agent enforcement unit, and the Treasury
Department's sanctions office. Unsurprisingly, [the
Schumer]{.underline}-advanced [version]{.underline} [lends itself
to]{.underline} fashionable **[left-wing causes]{.underline}** via the
NSF, establishing a chief diversity officer and fast-tracking
government-funded climate-change research. [It's **not clear** why this
emphasis on NSF is]{.underline} **[germane]{.underline}** [to
a]{.underline} purportedly [China]{.underline}-focused
[bill]{.underline}, [other than to serve]{.underline} **[Democrats'
political purposes]{.underline}**.

In fact, this new [CHIPS]{.underline} bill may be [more likely to
**sabotage** U.S. efforts]{.underline} to get on a more competitive
footing. [This version strips out]{.underline} previous,
**[encouraging]{.underline}** [measures passed by the
Senate]{.underline} last June [that funded efforts to
counter]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party [propaganda]{.underline}
[and made it]{.underline} **[easier]{.underline}** [for U.S. officials
to interact with]{.underline} their [Taiwanese]{.underline}
[counterparts]{.underline}. The [Schumer]{.underline} version
[contains]{.underline} **[none of that]{.underline}**. In fact, rather
than merely omitting promising proposals, [this bill also creates
a]{.underline} **[carve-out]{.underline}** [allowing the]{.underline}
[**N**ational **S**cience **F**oundation]{.underline} [to partner with
Confucius Institutes]{.underline}, for [reasons]{.underline} that **[are
unclear]{.underline}**. [What is clear is]{.underline} that [such a step
would]{.underline} **[reverse]{.underline}** the [progress made in
dismantling]{.underline} those [outposts of Beijing's influence
on]{.underline} [American college campuses]{.underline} in recent years.

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [claims]{.underline} that
[Congress]{.underline} [needs to send]{.underline} the
[subsidies]{.underline} [to the president]{.underline}
**[immediately]{.underline}** [to avoid a massive **strategic**
failure]{.underline}; meanwhile, Intel and other [chips
firms]{.underline} are **[threatening]{.underline}** [to pull back on
chip]{.underline}-plant [openings]{.underline} [on U.S.
soil]{.underline} [if Congress]{.underline} **[fails]{.underline}** [to
pass the chip subsidies]{.underline} this year. Meanwhile, [reports
say]{.underline} that some [senators]{.underline} [have
been]{.underline} **[swayed]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} classified
[briefings]{.underline} [delivered by]{.underline} top [administration
officials]{.underline} supportive of the chips subsidies. But [if their
brief is]{.underline} so [compelling]{.underline}, [they should make
their case]{.underline} **[publicly]{.underline}**. [It's]{.underline}
also [unclear]{.underline} [why]{.underline} the chips
[subsidies]{.underline} [are]{.underline} still
**[necessary]{.underline}** even [as the global chips shortage
shows]{.underline} signs of [easing]{.underline}. And whatever the case
for semiconductor subsidies, [they should come]{.underline}
**[after]{.underline}** [we grant the industry relief from
tariffs]{.underline} that raise its manufacturing costs.

[The talks are]{.underline} still **[in flux]{.underline}**, and, if
last week is any indication, the [contours of the legislation could
change]{.underline} **[dramatically]{.underline}** in the coming days.
Some [national-security hawks]{.underline} are [working to salvage the
bill]{.underline}. Senator Marco [Rubio]{.underline} [put forward three
proposals]{.underline} on Friday [to fund the FCC's efforts to
**eliminate** **Huawei**]{.underline} and ZTE equipment from U.S.
telecom networks, [and place stringent security restrictions on the
research and chips funding.]{.underline} His amendments would serve to
significantly improve the legislation, if adopted.

But [the fact that 16 Republican senators lined up to advance debate on
the bill last week is]{.underline} **[discouraging]{.underline}**. [The
current CHIPS measure **isn't**]{.underline} really [a counter-CCP
package]{.underline}, and [the GOP might stand a better chance of
pushing their own]{.underline}, much [sounder legislation if they wait
until the next Congress.]{.underline}

geopolitical [ambitions]{.underline} turned out to be mostly **[a
whiff]{.underline}**.

The [Senate]{.underline} is poised **[to abandon]{.underline}** months
of work on [legislation]{.underline} [overhauling U.S.
policy]{.underline} toward Beijing [when]{.underline}, as soon as this
week[, it approves a]{.underline} **[drastically]{.underline}**
[slimmed-down bill to boost]{.underline} domestic [semiconductor
manufacturing]{.underline}. It will do so [**without** a firm
guarantee]{.underline} [that those]{.underline} tough-on-China
[provisions]{.underline} left on the cutting-room floor **[will ever
become law.]{.underline}**

[The]{.underline} resulting [legislation]{.underline} aims to address
the nationwide microchip shortage by spurring domestic production, a
pivotal step to depriving China of U.S. dollars, and is [poised to
include]{.underline} vital [research]{.underline}-related
[provisions]{.underline}. But **[the failure]{.underline}** [of the
initial vision]{.underline} for the bill has [left Democrats and
Republicans **frustrated**]{.underline} [at their inability to come
together]{.underline} on an enduring strategy [to address]{.underline}
what they see as the biggest long-term threat to U.S. [national
security]{.underline}.

"[This place is the]{.underline} **[land of missed
opportunities]{.underline}**," lamented Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), who
has spent nearly two years on the larger effort to boost U.S.
competition with China.

[A]{.underline} **[frantic]{.underline}** [push by]{.underline} the
[Biden]{.underline} administration [led lawmakers to]{.underline}
**[suspend]{.underline}** cross-Capitol **[negotiations]{.underline}**
[on a]{.underline} more comprehensive [China competition
bill]{.underline}, instead [pursuing the chips]{.underline} funding as
well as a few other non-controversial provisions already settled in the
talks. [That was viewed]{.underline} by proponents of action [as
the]{.underline} more [pragmatic option]{.underline}, given the White
House's recent warnings that U.S. companies are on the verge of taking
their chip production overseas.

[The final package]{.underline}, as outlined by Speaker Nancy Pelosi in
a Wednesday letter to her caucus, [will include technology and research
provisions]{.underline}, too. [Pelosi]{.underline} is [eyeing floor
consideration]{.underline} of the measure next week, suggesting [the
Senate may be able to clear it]{.underline} within days.

**[Dropped]{.underline}** [from the bill]{.underline}, however,
[were]{.underline} popular [provisions aimed at cracking down on
China's]{.underline} **[coercive]{.underline}** [economic
practices]{.underline}, [not to mention the]{.underline} Senate [Foreign
Relations Committee's]{.underline} entire [contribution to
the]{.underline} initial competition [package]{.underline} --- **[a
sprawling]{.underline}** [bipartisan effort that got]{.underline}
near-[unanimous support]{.underline} on the panel.

"[We worked]{.underline} very hard [to get a bill out of the
Senate]{.underline}. [We got overwhelming votes]{.underline} for it, and
then [when we got to the House]{.underline}, **[we hit a brick
wall]{.underline}**," Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Menendez
(D-N.J.) said in an interview. "[It's a shame]{.underline}. Because
[it's]{.underline} \[now\] [a chips bill]{.underline}, **[not a China
bill."]{.underline}**

[The centerpiece]{.underline} of the emerging legislation, which
senators formally kicked off on Tuesday, [is a]{.underline} [\$52
billion investment in semiconductor manufacturing]{.underline}
subsidies, plus tax credits and funding to spur scientific research.
[While significant]{.underline}, **[it's a far cry]{.underline}** [from
what was]{.underline} initially [envisioned]{.underline} as a historic
bipartisan effort [to crack down on China]{.underline} and re-orient
U.S. policy in the Indo-Pacific --- a long-running priority for Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Lawmakers' frustrations over that fizzling on China [stem]{.underline}
largely [from]{.underline} the House's [failure to act on
the]{.underline} **[larger competition bill]{.underline}** last year
when the Senate first passed it. Many [Democrats]{.underline} are
privately [grumbling at the White House]{.underline}, too, [for not
pushing the House to act sooner]{.underline} on the broader legislation
and thus establishing cross-Capitol negotiations months earlier.

Instead, the [Biden]{.underline} administration this month began
[warning Congress]{.underline} that **[it was out of
time]{.underline}**. Commerce Secretary Gina [Raimondo]{.underline} has
led that Capitol Hill blitz, [calling on lawmakers to]{.underline}
[send]{.underline} President Joe Biden [legislation
addressing]{.underline} the [semiconductor shortage]{.underline} and
[encouraging U.S. companies to boost semiconductor
production]{.underline} at home --- instead of turning to foreign
countries.

But in public, [Democrats]{.underline} like Menendez are [holding off on
hitting Biden hard]{.underline} and [**directing** ire at]{.underline}
Senate Minority Leader Mitch [McConnell]{.underline}, [who threatened to
tank the China push altogether if Democrats]{.underline} continued
[pursuing]{.underline} a [party-line health care and
climate]{.underline} [bill]{.underline}.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) speaks with reporters
following a closed-door caucus lunch, at the Capitol in Washington,
Wednesday, June 22, 2022.

Young acknowledged that "[there is an urgency to act]{.underline}" now
[on]{.underline} the computer [chips]{.underline} subsidies [instead of
waiting for long-stalled bicameral talks]{.underline} on the broader
legislation to wrap up. [Those negotiations fell victim to]{.underline}
immediate **[sprawl]{.underline}**; dozens of [lawmakers got
involved]{.underline}, representing committees with jurisdiction over
everything from foreign policy to trade to science investments.

"It got to a point where [it became **large** and
**unwieldy**]{.underline}," said Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who
chairs the House Ways and Means Committee's trade subpanel.

### 2AC -- Competitiveness -- Thumpers

#### Antitrust bills are at the [top]{.underline} of the [agenda]{.underline} -- [Schumer]{.underline} is [distracted]{.underline}

[With a]{.underline} months-long **[recess]{.underline}** on the
horizon, House [progressives]{.underline} are [urging]{.underline}
Senate Minority Leader Chuck [Schumer]{.underline} [to act fast
on]{.underline} two competition [bills that would]{.underline} better
[equip **antitrust** enforcers to take on]{.underline} major [tech
firms.]{.underline}

In a letter sent to Schumer on Friday, more than a dozen Congressional
Progressive [Caucus leaders urged the Senate majority leader to schedule
a vote on **two bills**]{.underline} in the coming weeks.

"It is time for Congress to vote on this legislation," the lawmakers
wrote. "[These bills are ready for a vote]{.underline} and we urge you
to schedule the vote on them in the next few weeks."

[The]{.underline} [bills]{.underline} -- the [American Innovation and
Choice Online Act]{.underline} (**[AICO]{.underline}**)
[and]{.underline} [**O**pen **M**arkets **A**ct]{.underline} --were
[introduced]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the heels of a 16-month long
congressional [investigation into]{.underline} possible
**[anticompetitive]{.underline}** [behavior by Amazon]{.underline},
[Apple]{.underline}, [Google]{.underline}, and Facebook's parent company
[Meta]{.underline}. If enacted, **[AICO]{.underline}** would [restrict
dominant platforms from favoring]{.underline} their own
[products]{.underline} or services [over those of their
competitors]{.underline} on their own platforms. Additionally, the
[**O**pen **M**arkets **A**ct]{.underline} would [bar
companies]{.underline} like Apple and Google [that operate app stores
from setting]{.underline} onerous and expensive [rules for
developers.]{.underline}

In May, [Axios reported]{.underline} that [Schumer planned
to]{.underline} hold a [vote on AICO this summer]{.underline} so long as
there were 60 senators who would vote to approve it. But last week, The
Washington Post reported that at least [a dozen senators]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} **[necessary]{.underline}**
[Democrats]{.underline} like Sen. Jon [Ossoff]{.underline} (D-GA),
[were]{.underline} **[undecided]{.underline}** [on how they
would]{.underline} potentially [vote]{.underline}. [Without
support]{.underline} from every Democrat and ten Republicans, [the
measures couldn't overcome the filibuster and would fail]{.underline} on
the floor.

[That hasn't dissuaded]{.underline} **[Democrats]{.underline}**
[like]{.underline} Rep. Pramila [Jayapal]{.underline} (D-WA)
[and]{.underline} Sen. Amy [Klobuchar]{.underline} (D-MN), an AICO
author, [from **pressuring** their]{.underline} Senate [colleagues to
support the bill they argue has]{.underline}
**[overwhelming]{.underline}** [support from both progressive and
conservative voters]{.underline}.

Friday morning, [sixteen progressive groups]{.underline}
**[demanded]{.underline}** [Schumer recuse himself from]{.underline} any
[antitrust legislation]{.underline} set to regulate large tech
companies, according to Bloomberg. The [groups said]{.underline} that
[he had a **c**onflict **o**f **i**nterest as his daughters work at Meta
and Amazon]{.underline}.

[In a]{.underline} nearly hour-long [floor speech]{.underline} this
week, [Klobuchar emphasized]{.underline} the **[urgency]{.underline}**
in passing her bill. "[These]{.underline} dominant [tech
platforms]{.underline} have [abused their power]{.underline} for years,
and now [we are at a crossroad]{.underline}," Klobuchar said. "[Will
America continue to be a place where **entrepreneurs** lead our
**economy**]{.underline} forward [or]{.underline} will we become [a
country where a handful of monopolists dictate who gets]{.underline} a
chance [to succeed]{.underline}?"

[The future]{.underline} of the bills [remains **unclear**]{.underline}.
[With **mounting** legislative **priorities**]{.underline} --
[from]{.underline} budget [reconciliation]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[codifying gay marriage]{.underline}** -- [the time to put the
competition bills up for a]{.underline} floor [vote]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} rapidly **[shrinking]{.underline}**. [If antitrust
reform **doesn't pass** before August]{.underline}, [it's unlikely the
bills would be approved]{.underline} this year as the attention of
lawmakers turns to this year's midterm elections.

In a press conference on Wednesday, [Schumer remained
**noncommittal**]{.underline}. "[I **support** these bills]{.underline}.
I [want to bring them to the floor]{.underline}," Schumer told
reporters. "[We have to see if we have **60** votes]{.underline}."
