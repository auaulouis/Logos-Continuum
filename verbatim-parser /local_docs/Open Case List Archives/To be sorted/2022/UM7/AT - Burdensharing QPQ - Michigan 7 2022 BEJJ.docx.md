A further, critical implication of this assessment of the strategic
environment is rarely noted: [it is]{.underline} entirely
**[inconsistent]{.underline}** [with **shock therapy's
assumption**]{.underline} [about the lack of serious threats to European
security to say that calling]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [Article 5 commitment
**into question**]{.underline} [will cause European governments **step
up**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [create **more military
capacity**]{.underline} [via increased **spending**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} **[coop]{.underline}**eration. [On the
contrary]{.underline}, [a]{.underline} relatively [**benign** security
setting is]{.underline} arguably **[more conducive]{.underline}** [to
allowing]{.underline} (p.260) narrow national perspectives to trump
EU-wide initiatives and to foster the continuation of [minimalist
defense efforts]{.underline} [than]{.underline} the status quo of [US
leadership]{.underline}. America's [NATO allies make]{.underline}
[up]{.underline} nearly **[a fifth]{.underline}** [of
global]{.underline} military [spending]{.underline}. [Britain is the
fourth biggest]{.underline} military spender in the world, [with
France]{.underline} close [behind]{.underline} (after another US ally,
Japan) as sixth. [Germany]{.underline}, [Italy]{.underline},
[Turkey]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [Canada]{.underline} all [rank
among]{.underline} the world's fifteen [biggest spenders]{.underline}.41
Very [secure states]{.underline} like Norway and Canada
[purchase]{.underline} [sophisticated weaponry from the US]{.underline}
military-industrial complex [and order]{.underline} their [soldiers into
battle in America's wars]{.underline} in far off lands.
**[Why?]{.underline}** [A major]{.underline} [reason is]{.underline}
**[the alliance with the United States]{.underline}**---it is [the
existence of]{.underline} the **[overseas hegemon]{.underline}** [and
the **perceived need**]{.underline} [to retain access to it and
**standing with it**]{.underline} that **[drive much of]{.underline}**
this **[behavior]{.underline}**.42

Options 1 and 2 are based on the [assumption that]{.underline} the
international [system generates]{.underline} strong [pressures for
European states to]{.underline} do one or all of three very costly
things: **[ramp up]{.underline}** spending on **[defense]{.underline}**;
reform entrenched domestic defense practices and institutions; and set
aside national prerogatives to generate genuine supranational military
defense and decision making at the EU level. [Take away]{.underline}
[Uncle Sam's "**welfare for the rich**]{.underline}" [and the logic of
anarchy will]{.underline} somehow [force]{.underline} this
[outcome]{.underline}. It cannot be ruled out that there is something
special about Europe that would cause it to act in this collectively
martial way without the US umbrella. But [that expectation is
**inconsistent**]{.underline} [with most of]{.underline} [what we know
about]{.underline} **[international politics]{.underline}** [and with
the **lived experience**]{.underline} [of the EU]{.underline}'s European
Security and Defense Policy and Common Foreign and Security Policy.
[Governments just don't do]{.underline} **[extremely
expensive]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[politically costly
things]{.underline}** without a major prod of some sort. The problem is
that [there is neither **a compelling external security
incentive**]{.underline} [nor a]{.underline} [**European hegemon** to
help solve]{.underline} the **[collective action]{.underline}**
[problem]{.underline}. [Germany may play]{.underline} [this role in
economics]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} it is [not]{.underline} going
to do so [in **security**]{.underline}.43 The [likelihood
that]{.underline} **[a US revocation of Article 5]{.underline}** [would
spur **France**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[Britain]{.underline}**
[to set aside **national feeling** and **unite defense
efforts**]{.underline}---[and that middle powers]{.underline} [from
**Poland**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[Turkey]{.underline}** [would
acquiesce]{.underline}---[is exceedingly **low**]{.underline}. Indeed,
[the downward trend in European defense spending has
**continued**]{.underline} [despite]{.underline} the continuing
**[decline in American military forces in Europe]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} despite increasingly [**loud calls** for
**retrenchment**]{.underline}.

Three consequences follow from this analysis. First, doubling down is
unlikely---because Americans won't pay for it---and neither form of
retrenchment will work---because [Europeans **won't**]{.underline} [pay
the **political**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[economic
costs]{.underline}** [even]{.underline} [if the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [steps
aside]{.underline}. Second, major changes to the current benign
macro-security environment are likely to occur only after substantial
strategic warning, and therefore projected low costs and risks for US
security provision will likely remain adequate. And third, [there is
**no**]{.underline} net **[security benefit]{.underline}** [to
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
(p.261) [of **administering a shock**]{.underline} [to NATO
via]{.underline} [even more **dramatic reductions**]{.underline} [in
presence or **commitment**]{.underline}. Indeed, [there are
serious]{.underline} **[expected costs]{.underline}** [in terms of
**lost security cooperation**]{.underline} [and even **less
capable**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[interoperable
allies]{.underline}**. [With militarily capable allies like]{.underline}
**[NATO]{.underline}** and the Republic of Korea, [a major benefit of
presence is]{.underline} **[security cooperation]{.underline}** (joint
training, planning, etc.) [that is **difficult**]{.underline} or
impossible [to replicate with]{.underline} **[rotational
deployments]{.underline}**. According to a recent comprehensive RAND
study, the US presence in NATO is getting near the floor of deployed
personnel needed to sustain security cooperation at current level.44

**Countries have [limited]{.underline} budgets and can't afford
defense**

**Gilli 17** (Andrea Gilli is post-doctoral fellow at Stanford
University's Center for International Security and Cooperation. "The
Trump administration wants Europe to pay more to defend itself. It's not
that easy." Washington Post. Feb. 3, 2017.

[The transatlantic gap in military capabilities]{.underline} --- how
much defense output the two sides of the Atlantic are able to generate,
respectively --- [has three main causes that cannot easily be
addressed:]{.underline}

1\) [European countries have **limited defense budgets**]{.underline}
--- On average, defense expenditure in Europe is just over 1 percent of
GDP, while the U.S. defense budget is well above 4 percent of GDP.
[Would a **U.S. retrenchment push** European **allies to fix this
imbalance**]{.underline}, and bring NATO members closer to the 2 percent
threshold they pledged to move toward in 2014?

**[Maybe]{.underline}**. [But half of NATO's members are **small
countries** with **small defense budgets**,]{.underline} well below \$2
billion per year. Thus, [a **substantial bump** in their military
spending **won't bring** about a **significant increase** in Europe's
**overall military investments**]{.underline}. Estonia's 2 percent GDP
defense expenditure amounts to just \$500 million, for instance. [That
might pay for the operational costs of a few of middle-sized U.S.
warships, but **wouldn't push back a Russian invasion.**]{.underline}

With the exception of Germany and Poland, [large E.U. countries face
**financial and political constraints** to **increasing military
expenditure**]{.underline}. The U.K. is going through
**[Brexit]{.underline}**, which will also affect several countries, in
particular the Netherlands and Ireland. **[Italy's bank
problems]{.underline}** loom large, and **[Spain]{.underline}** and
**[France]{.underline}** have **[limited financial]{.underline}** and
**[political room]{.underline}** [for additional public
spending]{.underline}. This points to a broader problem.

In part, U.S. security assurances may have freed up state funds in
Europe for other priorities, including a robust system of social
services. However, [cutting **welfare state provisions** in Europe **to
fund defense expenditures** is going to be **extremely difficult**, if
not **counterproductive**.]{.underline}

On the one hand, [those who receive these benefits are **far more
numerous**, and thus **politically more influential**]{.underline}, than
those receiving a direct benefit from military spending. On the other,
[cuts in welfare spending risk actually bringing **additional support**
to **anti-establishment parties**]{.underline} like the Five Stars
Movement in Italy, Die Linke in Germany or Podemos in Spain --- [all of
which have **strong anti-defense stances.**]{.underline}

2\) [European countries pay **more in defense overhead**]{.underline}
--- [All armed forces require **military bases**, **training
facilities**, and **administrative support**. So in a continent with
several small, national armed forces, overhead necessarily absorbs a
higher fraction of resources than in the United States.]{.underline}

A solution for Europe would be to share some military assets and
functions. In recent years, there have been important bilateral and
multilateral initiatives in this respect --- but there are strong
political limits as well.

[Countries have **no guarantees** their **partners** ultimately will
**support them** in a military crisis]{.underline}. Thus, if sharing
turns into a lock-in, countries run the risk of having access to fewer
military capabilities than they might need. This explains why the width
and depth of past initiatives have been generally limited.

However, this comes at the cost of intra-alliance inefficiency and thus
an inferior capacity to generate military capabilities. An E.U. Defense
Union could address these problems, but efforts to set this up face many
of the same challenges: Why should a country tie its destiny to others?
How can it ensure that its interests will be respected? And what
tangible benefits would it observe in the short term, beside loss of
jobs and income, following base closures and defense industry
consolidation?

3\) [Implementing **defense cooperation** in Europe **won't be
easy**]{.underline} --- Some analysts think that by promoting
cooperation among NATO allies, any U.S. retrenchment from Europe would
help address existing problems, but there are strong reasons to be
skeptical.

[With Europe's **limited funds** to spend on defense, large
**cooperative projects** will be **difficult to launch**]{.underline}.
In the past, [countries in Europe abandoned cooperative projects because
of **their negative domestic implications** for **jobs**,
**technological know-how** or **military exports**. In **an age of
austerity**, amid **a refugee crisis** and **high youth unemployment**,
this mind-set is **unlikely to change** anytime soon.]{.underline}

And [some countries may have **little interest** in
cooperation]{.underline}. [They may operate in **completely different
environments**]{.underline} --- [Mediterranean vs. North
Sea]{.underline}, for example. [Or]{.underline} they perceive [a
**different strategic threat** at home]{.underline} --- [think Russia
vs. the Islamic State]{.underline}. [Some countries may even have a
**strategic interest** in leaving unaddressed some **capability gaps**
--- to compel proximate allies to come to their defense. This was
Finland's military strategy during the Cold War.]{.underline}

Sharing in NATO and the Problem of Free Riding,\" Political Analysis:

/alundy\]

[The literature on burden sharing has shown great
development]{.underline} over the years moving from a more pecuniary
focus, to a focus that incorporates a variety of inconspicuous factors.
From a deterrence and pure public goods standpoint, the United States is
bearing an unfair share of the burden. The simple fact that it is
leading the way economically (and in turn with the efficiency and
effectiveness of its forces) shows that [non-U.S. NATO allies are indeed
benefitting]{.underline} unfairly from its ally's efforts. [The decline
in NATO allied defense spending indicates the acceptance of relying on
U.S. capabilities and letting their own forces bear less of the
financial responsibility associated with collective
defense]{.underline}. However, [the simplicity of this model does not
consider other factors that can be just as important]{.underline} to
burden sharing. The joint product model would seem to take better
account of factors that do not seem immediately pertinent to burden
sharing but are without a doubt just as important. [The dedication of
alliance forces can produce strain in a **political** manner due to the
potential loss of life and the ramifications]{.underline} such losses
can have back home. Furthermore, [the introduction of excludable goods
levels the playing field in different ways.]{.underline} The massive
output of defense provided by the U.S., [incurs significant benefits
that are only a positive for the U.S. alone]{.underline}**.** The
expansion of the defense industry, for example, can provide jobs and
further stimulate the U.S. economy; however, this is a good that other
nations cannot benefit from directly. This same idea can be redirected
back to non-U.S. NATO allies. [Many of them intend to focus more on
domestic issues at home while letting their forces **weaken** under the
greater protection of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. With new threats on the rise and a turn to
out-of-area operations, it becomes apparent that if the U.S. "is able to
provide politically or physically sufficient levels of security for the
rest of NATO's members in response... then other members can free ride
and will provide little additional assistance. Therefore, we should
expect even more free riding than in the past," (Siegel 2009).

**[Deficit---Say No---Nationalism]{.underline}**

The complications that caused that stillbirth linger. [The nations
in]{.underline} what is now [the **E**uropean **U**nion **still care**
about **their sovereignty**]{.underline}, which is expressed above all
in the decision to send young soldiers into harm's way.
[They]{.underline} also [have **different interests**. The French are
busy in their former African colonies. The Poles and Balts feel most
threatened by Russia. Germany]{.underline}, caring not a whit about all
that, [is merrily building itself **a second gas pipeline** to Russia,
circumventing **the eastern EU**]{.underline}.

**[Member states]{.underline}** also [have **dissonant historical
traditions**, which make **integration into one command
hierarchy**]{.underline} almost [impossible]{.underline}. Postcolonial
France considers military action a legitimate tool of foreign policy,
and its president has ample powers to direct its army.
[Germany]{.underline}, still atoning for World War II, [**disavows**
military interventionism]{.underline}. Unlike France, it has a
"parliamentary army," which must get explicit approval from the
Bundestag to do anything. Would a French president patiently wait for
the German legislature before deciding whether to shoot at little green
men speaking Russian in an Estonian forest? Would 27 states cede that
decision to Brussels?

**[The fundamental problem]{.underline}**, as Jan Techau of the German
Marshall Fund puts it, [is **distrust**: The French and Germans don't
**fully trust**]{.underline} [each other, the Italians trust **neither
of them**, the Germans don't **even trust themselves**, Warsaw distrusts
Berlin, Bucharest and Budapest distrust each other, people in the
Balkans **don't trust anybody**, and so forth]{.underline}.

That's why Macron is seen in central Europe as a neo-Gaullist. When he
talks about "strategic autonomy" or "European sovereignty," he seems
mainly to be eager for France, the EU's only nuclear power after Brexit,
to lead Europe, snubbing its nose at the U.S. and accommodating Russia.
To advance that vision, he's sponsored a fledgling alliance called the
"European Intervention Initiative," which is part of neither NATO nor
the EU. Needless to say, [**the EU's eastern members** would much prefer
to keep relying on the U.S]{.underline}.

macro-security environment are likely to occur only after substantial

(p.261) [of **administering a shock**]{.underline} [to NATO
via]{.underline} [even more **dramatic reductions**]{.underline} [in
presence or **commitment**]{.underline}. Indeed, [there are
serious]{.underline} **[expected costs]{.underline}** [in terms of
**lost security cooperation**]{.underline} [and even **less
capable**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[interoperable
allies]{.underline}**. [With militarily capable allies like]{.underline}
**[NATO]{.underline}** and the Republic of Korea, [a major benefit of
presence is]{.underline} **[security cooperation]{.underline}** (joint
training, planning, etc.) [that is **difficult**]{.underline} or
impossible [to replicate with]{.underline} **[rotational
deployments]{.underline}**. According to a recent comprehensive RAND
study, the US presence in NATO is getting near the floor of deployed
personnel needed to sustain security cooperation at current level.44

Now let's consider how this vision of NATO aligns with American grand
strategy. The US grand strategy of deep engagement is essentially about
three objectives: managing the external environment to reduce near- and
long-term threats to US national security; promoting a liberal economic
order to expand the global economy and maximize domestic prosperity; and
creating, sustaining, and revising the global institutional order to
secure necessary interstate cooperation on terms favorable to US
interests.45

NATO's declining capability for large-scale optional expeditionary
operations to address conjectural security threats or humanitarian
ideals does little to impede this grand strategy. The Obama
administration's policy pronouncements and military deployments do not
in any way represent a change away from deep engagement. They reflect a
refocus on the strategy's core. For that core, NATO retains value as an
institutional framework for:

• Coordinating transatlantic security cooperation;

• Maintaining key infrastructure and lines of communications to sustain
a US-led containment strategy in the greater Middle East;

• Reducing inefficient duplication of defense efforts among allies,
preventing full renationalization of security;

• Hedging against the emergence of a more threatening Russia or the
appearance of a new, serious security threat.

The retrenchment options (One and Two) put these benefits at risk. Full
retrenchment does so because it is obviously inconsistent with deep
engagement. "[NATO-friendly" **retrenchment**]{.underline} does so
because it confuses secondary aims with the grand strategy's core aims.
It [is **willing**]{.underline} [to trade US leadership of the alliance
for **ephemeral**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} likely **[unattainable
gains]{.underline}** [in indigenous European capability]{.underline}.
Doubling down on NATO makes the same mistake of viewing optional
capacities as essential, and magnifies it by ultimately imposing its
costs on the US taxpayer, as it has no answer to the "free rider"
problem aside from exhortation.

[If the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[engineers]{.underline} **[a dramatic shift]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} its [grand strategy to a]{.underline} strong version of
**[restraint]{.underline}** [that devalues]{.underline} **[the
capacity]{.underline}** [to mount light footprint]{.underline} military
[operations]{.underline} around Eurasia as well as the incipient
"coalition in waiting" represented (p.262) by NATO, [then the **alliance
would cease to make sense**]{.underline}. But if, as is likely, it pares
the deep engagement strategy to its core objectives, then muddling
though, with no new grand bargains, no grand "rebooting" of the
alliance, no sudden new infusion of defense dollars and euros, and no
"post-American" NATO emerges as the optimal choice. In other words, the
transatlantic bargain should contain three parts: NATO should continue
to guarantee territorial defense; external operations in Europe's
neighborhood where the United States has no interest should fall under
the EU or individual European allies (e.g., France in Mali, Central
African Republic); and NATO should only engage beyond Europe's borders
when the United States wishes to be involved.

[Yet there inevitably are areas of national strategy that a
process]{.underline} alone [cannot shape]{.underline}. [We maintain that
national strategic cultures, **national political
economies**]{.underline}, [and E.U. macroeconomic and fiscal policy
**decisively influence** how countries allocate resources to defense --
before NATO and E.U. planning processes take place]{.underline}.
Specifically, the more Atlanticist (a preference for a transatlantic
approach to European security, in which the United States' role is
central) a country's national security strategy was, the more it
contributed to shared operational priorities during NATO's "out of area"
period (from 2000 to 2012). As European states experience increased
unemployment, they "slightly decrease top-line defense spending in
response to unemployment, while shifting much more substantial amounts
within defense budgets out of equipment and into personnel." E.U.
members respond similarly to supranational (E.U.) fiscal constraints
agreed to by heads of state and government as part of the Maastricht
Treaty on European Union, and "monitored" (enforced) by the European
Commission. Processes cannot address these tough choices, which amount
to rival claims on strategic resources, but politico-strategic dialogue
may. For example, when NATO allies agreed to a "pledge on defense
investment" at their 2014 Wales Summit, their heads of state and
government gave broad but clear guidance not only to defense ministries
to "meet\[\] capability priorities," but also to finance ministries to
"reverse the trend of declining defense budgets." Two years later, E.U.
heads of state and government formally adopted the NATO goals of moving
toward spending two percent of GDP on defense and 20 percent of defense
spending on equipment modernization. Early indications are that these
political agreements are having some effect on resource allocation, as
Figure 3 shows. European allies' defense spending increased by \$87
billion from 2014 to 2018. That this would occur in spite of
disagreements regarding threats, economic fragmentation within Europe
and the broader transatlantic community, and fiscal austerity in the
European Union, points to the importance of cultural factors like
Atlanticism. However, as Figure 3 also shows, increases may be stalling
-- a transatlantic divide may harm burden-sharing and, perhaps
paradoxically, weaken Europe as a strategic actor. Figure 3: Annual Real
Change in Defense Spending, NATO Europe and Canada Source: NATO, Defence
Expenditure of NATO Countries (2013-2019), 2020. NATO and European Union
agreement on exigent defense investment guidelines, as well as the
downstream effects on coordinated capability development, point toward
other opportunities for the two organizations to cooperate
strategically. This is especially true given the tight interconnection
between the economic strength of the transatlantic community and its
military strength. For example, NATO and the European Union could build
on current cooperation proposals to include the grand strategic area of
resource allocation, ensuring that NATO and E.U. defense spending goals
are not in competition with E.U. fiscal rules for scarce resources.
Italy's 2015 defense White Paper, for example, suggests the possibility
that some defense spending "could be excluded from the thresholds of the
Stability and Growth Pact." Trouble Behind, Trouble Ahead At some level,
all states must prepare for war. Robert Osgood called alliances "latent
war communities" -- they are designed for that purpose. Indeed, Bear
Braumoeller's recent work extends Charles Tilly's insight that "war made
the state and the state made war" to international orders, which he
argues prevent war among their members but are dangerous to non-members.
Processes like those that NATO and the European Union have developed
during the last eight decades of relative calm and prosperity are
central to the transatlantic community's ability to prepare for, and
perhaps forestall, future wars. They are the best tools its members have
to convert political will into capabilities that they believe will have
strategic effects, like deterring adversaries or, if necessary,
defending national territory and shared interests. Processes are,
however, no substitute for grand strategic vision. Such vision animated
the creation of both NATO and the European Union. There is now a strong
case for a bolder vision of transatlantic cooperation in defense
planning and grand strategy to keep the "fog of peace" from turning into
the "fog of war." What might such a vision look like? Some scholars have
proposed to address the fog of peace by "rediscovering geography" to
regionalize NATO defense planning, enabling allies to focus on
capabilities that are most directly relevant to their own strategic
priorities. Others have argued that it is time for Europe to seek -- and
achieve -- true strategic autonomy, either by "Europeanizing" NATO
(whereby the United States would reduce its footprint in the alliance
and concentrate on its strategic challenges elsewhere), or by subsuming
NATO into a broader European political-security framework. Even the
possibility of extending France's nuclear deterrent to its European
allies has been raised, first by French scholars discussing "nuclear
solidarity," and then by President Emmanuel Macron, who invited European
partners to "be associated with the exercises of French deterrence
forces" in the interest of a "true strategic culture among Europeans."
Macron further clarified his intent in an interview with Wolfgang
Ischinger at the 2020 Munich Security Conference, pointing to an
"unprecedented dialogue" on nuclear deterrence among Europeans.
Challenges abound. First, [transatlantic discord creates challenges for
European Atlanticists, making it more difficult to align national
strategies, and may even incentivize countries to **curb defense
spending to appeal to domestic electorates that bristle at external
pressure**]{.underline}. Second, the combination of economic recession
and fiscal austerity that plagued Europe during the 2008 crisis appears
likely to return in a more virulent form, which is almost certain to
dampen defense investment. Taking Europe's "destiny in its own hands" is
easier said than done. Years of low defense investment, the complicating
effects of Brexit, the rise of populist politics across Europe, and
uncertainties about Turkey, among other issues, cloud prospects for
greater European defense autonomy. While retaining the transatlantic
bond, in an era of great-power competition when conflict would almost
certainly not be confined to one operational theater, it may be wise to
encourage allies to "concentrate on those tasks for which they are most
geographically suited." For example, Baltic Sea states could focus on
defending their territory from Russian aggression, while states along
the Mediterranean could focus on combatting terrorism and building
partner capacity -- each without fear of being criticized for
inadequately supporting allies. Doing so would help link operational and
strategic planning to threat assessments, while also helping to blunt
conflict among allies about defining the array of threats, risks, and
challenges that characterize the emerging security environment. It would
enable the transatlantic security community to incentivize and leverage
the national defense planning efforts of its members. Specializing like
this would enable institutional work to focus on harmonizing, which
encourages [burden-sharing]{.underline}, as opposed to dominating, which
incentivizes free-riding. But such specialization [demands trust, which
is **currently in short supply** in the transatlantic community and
beyond]{.underline}.

**[Deficit---Say No---vs 2% of GDP]{.underline}**

**The 2% standard is not an accurate representation of contribution\-\--
destabilizes the alliance by calling out competent countries.**

/alundy\]

The national [GDP]{.underline} share of defence spending [is often used
as an easy, parsimonious, quantitative measure of
contribution]{.underline} in some of the formative studies in the field
and in most studies that aim at complete mathematical models of burden
sharing in military alliances (Olson and
Zeckhauser [1966](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750),

Sandler and
Hartley [2001](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750)).
[The use of national defence spending is justified by the fact that much
of NATO's operations and activities are funded by national defence
spending]{.underline}, while only some funding is channelled through the
NATO budget. Thus, [the idea of measuring contribution to NATO by
considering GDP]{.underline} shares of national military spending makes
some sense, but it [is **neither an accurate**, nor]{.underline} a
necessarily [**useful**, indicator of contributions]{.underline}
(Zyla [2009](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750),
Techau [2015](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750),
Kunertova [2017b](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750)).

US military spending in 2017 was at a level of 610 billion USD, thus
representing not only a majority of NATO spending, but 35% of the
military spending of the entire globe; 9.2 times that of Russia and 2.7
times that of China (These calculations are based on data by
SIPRI [2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750)).[^3^](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750) Thus,
if we use the GDP share of national military expenditure as an
indicator, it seems clear that the US, with about a 45% share of the
NATO GDP , (GDP data is calculated from "The World Factbook --- Central
Intelligence Agency" n.d.) has a too high a national expenditure, as it
add up to more than 50% of the sum of national defence expenditures of
all NATO countries.

[If we look at the funding of NATO itself]{.underline} and of such
functions and operations that are under the direct control of the
alliance rather than member countries, **[the picture changes
dramatically]{.underline}**. If security is a public good and there is
an agreement on how best to protect it, one could assume that NATO
countries should have no difficulties in channelling their military
spending through a common, rather than a national, decision-making
structure. The fact that this is not the case already challenges the
credibility of seeing security as a public good for NATO countries.

Direct [NATO funding is proportional to each member country's
GDP]{.underline}, with the exception of the US, which is compensated in
its NATO shares for its superior national spending. According to NATO
statistics on defence spending (NATO 2018) from 2016 and the CIA World
Factbook ("The World Factbook --- Central Intelligence Agency" n.d.,
NATO [2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750))
data on GDPs, [all NATO **countries contribute more to NATO's budget
than** their **GDP** share]{.underline} (the GDP share equals the GDP of
the country divided by the GDP sum of all NATO countries), excepting
Luxembourg and the United States. While NATO's budget share from
Luxembourg is likely to be a result of fluctuation in GDPs and a
specific year's (2016) contribution, and while the share of Luxembourg's
contribution to the NATO budget is still very close to its share of GDP,
the case of the US is different. [US funding for NATO is
**systematically lower** than its GDP share, less than half]{.underline}
of it. Obviously, this relates to US superior national military
spending, but again, [it highlights problems with the assumption that
the security needs of NATO countries are identical]{.underline}. If the
US actually contributes 22% of the NATO budget while its GDP share would
be 45%, [then we either have to believe that US national defence
spending serves NATO's security needs or relinquish the conclusion that
the US is such a disproportionate contributor to NATO]{.underline}**.**
However, the question of burden sharing is much more complicated than
the debate on defence expenditures may suggest.

**Allies are [unwilling]{.underline} to meet 2% burdens\-\--it's not
realistic**

**Techau 15** \[Jan Techau; director of Carnegie Europe, a part of
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; 9/2/15; THE POLITICS OF 2
PERCENT;

If **[2 percent has become the gold standard for defense
spending]{.underline}** in the debate on NATO's future, then how
realistic is it that the goal will ever be reached? Pessimism prevails
on this issue. "The guideline . . . **[if taken literally, would create
an impossible situation for some allies]{.underline}**," writes Ian
Anthony of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. A
country like Germany would have to absorb €74 billion (\$82 billion) of
defense spending instead of its current €37 billion (\$41 billion),
something it **[would be unable (and unwilling)]{.underline}** to do and
that would in turn lead to "inefficiency and waste, rather than an
increase in useful capability."20 Germany is also the focus of another
argument that aims at making 2 percent look unrealistic. The enormous
increase in absolute defense spending in Germany, with its large
economy, that would result from 2 percent could also lead to a degree of
nervousness among some of the country's allies. As Karl-Heinz Kamp of
the German Federal Academy for Security Policy argues, "If Germany spent
2 percent of its huge GDP, it would produce a defense budget
overshadowing those of France and the UK, arguably causing more concern
than reassurance among its neighbors."21 This is a weak argument, as it
essentially questions the political reliability of a key NATO partner
that is most under pressure to spend more The strength of the 2 percent
metric is its triumph of simplicity over complexity. 12 \| The Politics
of 2 Percent: NATO and the Security Vacuum in Europe on defense. For the
most part, it is a self-serving defensive argument against higher
defense spending that has been used primarily by Germans themselves, not
so much by other NATO allies. **[But the lack of capacity among member
states to absorb significantly increased defense budgets is not the only
factor that leads to doubt about hitting the 2 percent target. The
biggest concern comes from the fact that many NATO countries agreed to
the 2 percent pledge in Wales but have no real intention to make good on
the promise.]{.underline}** "The problem is not that most NATO allies
will fail to reach the 2 percent bar. The trouble comes with those that
don't even try," as Kamp puts it.22 Initial budget decisions made around
or after the Wales summit and even public announcements by many member
states seem to indicate that the **[political will to really reach 2
percent is indeed underdeveloped across NATO]{.underline}**. Overriding
economic concerns are also reasons for skepticism that the 2 percent
pledge can be fulfilled. "As long as austerity remains the eurozone's
economic mantra, it is unlikely that European allies will meet the
target," one researcher argues.23 Under the prevailing economic
circumstances, it is often claimed that a reversal of the downward trend
in defense spending would already be a success, but that an **[increase
to 2 percent would be too much to realistically expect.]{.underline}**
The Wales summit declaration itself makes **[2 percent dependent
on]{.underline}** positive **[economic development, stipulating that
allies "aim to increase defence expenditure in real terms as GDP
grows."]{.underline}**24 This conditionality is meant to generate more
defense spending from the moment economic recovery sets in. The volume
of growth that would be needed to increase defense spending is not
specified, nor is a time reference for growth given. Should spending be
measured against absolute GDP growth on an annual basis, or should the
growth rate be the metric? Or should GDP growth be measured against a
fixed point in time---for instance, GDP before the financial crisis?

better]{.underline}.**

The president's critique is not unfounded. American power today differs
from its heights in 1945, or even 1990. The United States will need help
shouldering the maintenance of a liberal international order that has
increased global security, prosperity and freedom these past seven
decades. Nevertheless, the **[manner in which an American administration
approaches the burden-sharing issue matters]{.underline}**. Trump has
pointedly called for NATO allies to pay more for defense and his team at
the United Nations has circulated a potential policy to make foreign aid
contingent on alignment with U.S. positions, so that aid dollars "only
go to America's friends." Though increased action among allies and
partners is necessary, **[to simply demand greater burden-sharing is
insufficient. Policymakers confront two central questions if they are to
promote effective burden-sharing]{.underline}**: first, **[how to ensure
other stakeholders do step forward, rather than leave a vacuum around an
issue]{.underline}**; and, second, **[how to protect and advance U.S.
interests if burden-sharing cedes the initiative]{.underline}** to
others. Demands for increased activities from partners **[must be
coupled with coordination and a measure of U.S. leadership for an
effective burden-sharing campaign]{.underline}**. A **[number of cases,
therefore, reveal bases for eliciting burden-sharing of the quality and
variety the United States should want---as well as the risks of forcing
burden-sharing via disengagement]{.underline}**. The notion of
**[compelling other nations i]{.underline}**nto taking
actions---**[particularly by arousing skepticism around U.S.
credibility]{.underline}**---is a **[recipe for shortchanging American
interests.]{.underline}** Consideration of both **[UN peacekeeping
operations]{.underline}** and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria **[illustrate how effective burden-sharing
requires continued U.S. commitments]{.underline}** in order **[to spur
burden-sharing over inaction]{.underline}**. Furthermore, the success of
the Global Fund, the **[worsening of some crises in]{.underline}** the
Middle East, such as in **[Yemen, and the mixed record of the U.S.
withdrawal from]{.underline}** the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(**[TPP]{.underline}**), similarly **[demonstrate that leadership
creates the leverage necessary for Washington]{.underline}** to advance
U.S. interests **[when others do step up to act.]{.underline}**
Americans may legitimately want others to do more, but how that aim is
pursued matters. **[Nowhere is this more evident than the debate over
NATO.]{.underline}** Even before the signing of the Washington Treaty,
concerns around NATO burden-sharing arose. U.S. military planners
worried that an American security guarantee would perpetually deter
defense spending by the new European allies. This concern dogged the
allies throughout the Cold War. Disagreements flared almost immediately
in the Senate's "great debate" over deploying troops to Europe without
additional European support in the Korean War, a peripheral interest to
many European leaders. **[Disagreements resurfaced in the 1960s as
Western European economies recovered from their postwar
devastation]{.underline}**. The Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon
administrations repeatedly sought to navigate clashes between security
interests in Europe and trade or balance of payments deficits.
Compounded by the strains of Vietnam, both the **[security and economic
arrangements boiled over in the Nixon administration with the resulting
shifts of the Nixon Doctrine]{.underline}** and the shocks to the
Bretton Woods system. Though the transatlantic partners were in sync on
détente and then counterbalancing in face of the Soviet Union in the
1970s and early 1980s, disagreements surrounding approaches to European
security, particularly around the deployment of intermediate-range
nuclear missiles, maintained a measure of tension between the
Euro-Atlantic allies. The subsequent Soviet collapse transformed the
global security environment; yet, it **[did not take long for a new
generation of burden-sharing issues to emerge. The Clinton
administration at first evidenced ambivalence on respective roles and
responses on Balkans crises. Others, like then-French foreign minister
Hubert Vedrine, derided the U.S. "hyperpower]{.underline}**." During
this period even Paul Wolfowitz admitted a "need to believe that others
are doing their share." Frustrations persisted in the George W. Bush and
Barack Obama administrations. Under both presidents, Secretary of
Defense Robert Gates forewarned of a potential "two-tiered alliance" at
the 2008 Munich Security Conference and the "the growing difficulty for
the United States to sustain current support for NATO if the American
taxpayer continues to carry most of the burden in the Alliance" in his
2011 farewell address at NATO. Jeffrey Goldberg further captured this
sentiment in President Obama's derision of "free-riders" in his
revealing 2016 article "The Obama Doctrine" in The Atlantic.
**[Surviving these crises, NATO's story reminds that the organization
has been and remains, like many of America's global partnerships,
inherently reformable]{.underline}**---**[provided the United States
engages with tangible and realistic ambitions]{.underline}**.
**[Without]{.underline}** initial U.S**[. involvement, no effective
collective defense organization would have developed in
Europe]{.underline}** sufficient to manage the Soviet threat. **[Without
continued engagement]{.underline}** that same **[organization would not
have changed as needed, for instance, to be a stalwart partner in
Afghanistan. NATO]{.underline}** and the broader transatlantic
partnership certainly **[require further shifts to manage today's era of
resurgent great power competition; however, this past precedent
emphasizes the need for active U.S. leadership and reasonable
agenda-setting]{.underline}**. Pragmatic engagement will yield practical
results. Peacekeeping by the United Nations offers an important example
of what burden-sharing means and what elicits it. During the Cold War,
UN peace operations were confined to interposing a deployment between
formerly warring parties. The clash of the Cold War superpowers as
veto-wielding United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members meant that
was all the traffic would bear. In settings like Cyprus and Lebanon,
long-standing deployments kept additional military duties off the U.S.
plate through decades of the Cold War. **[The Cold War's end ushered in
more numerous and ambitious UNSC mandates---as the United States and
Russia were more often willing to align on authorizing peace
operations]{.underline}**. In the 1990s, along with a couple of dramatic
failures marred by murky mandates (in Bosnia and Rwanda, where excessive
impartiality left atrocities to occur on peacekeepers' watch), an
**[array of peace operations took hold with a variety of
governance]{.underline}** and post-conflict goals beyond the traditional
interpositional model.

on [several positive regional security
enhancements](http://www.atahq.org/2018/02/projecting-stability-adapting-nato-readiness-action-plan/):
command and control structure changes, new headquarters for maritime
forces, and higher defense spending levels. [European scholars and
policy experts would like to see the Summit move past the issue of
burden sharing]{.underline}**.** Certainly, [there is much more than
burden sharing to discuss]{.underline}. Yet, [a **lack of consensus**
about Russia and threats from terrorism have limited the progress the
Alliance should have gained]{.underline} since Wales in 2014. Coercive
tactics with tariffs and trade imbalances will only increase resistance
and weaken consensus on a way ahead with regard to security arguments.

At the Summit, the attendees will be able to see a clear reversal of
declining defense spending as several NATO members are expanding their
defense budgets. Despite President Trump's desires for rapid achievement
of the 2% threshold, [European disarmament occurred over a long period
of time, and given **economic realities** in Europe, **it will not be
overcome in a matter of one or two years**]{.underline}, as Frank
Hoffman noted [last
year](https://www.fpri.org/article/2017/03/making-nato-less-obsolete/) on
this topic. However, as shown in Figure 2, European and Canadian defense
expenditures are on a clear upward trend. Given U.S. persistence, and a
bit of patience from U.S. leaders, these positive improvements should
continue.

2.5.1 The Reassurance Dilemma. One [might thus conclude that reassurance
is suboptimal, and that patrons are best served by casting their
protection into doubt]{.underline}. The [reality is **not so
simple**,]{.underline} however. Because the patron's side of the bargain
entails providing protection to its allies, [if that **protection comes
into doubt** then **allies have less reason to honor their end of the
bargain**]{.underline}: namely, to [**remain loyal** to the
patron]{.underline} by siding with it against its adversaries, providing
basing access, and supporting its other foreign policy priorities
(Morrow, 1991; Lake, 2009). [The patron thus faces a
dilemma]{.underline}. It must [**choose between withholding reassurance
to maximize burden-sharing**, on the one hand, and **providing
reassurance to ensure that allies have incentives to remain loyal to
it**, on the other.]{.underline} Directly studying the relationship
between reassurance and burden-sharing is difficult, however. The first
two problems are methodological. [Any relationship that exists between
patron reassurance and allied burden-sharing may be
**spurious**.]{.underline} For example, U.S. troop presence is likely to
be correlated with threat, which may have an independent effect on
allied military spending. Second, the relationship between reassurance
and burden-sharing may be endogenous; patrons may withhold reassurance
from allies which are under-contributing and then reward them with
assurances of protection once they have increased their efforts. The
third problem is theoretical -- even if troops are present, [allies may
fear (and, indeed, the patron may threaten) that they will be
withdrawn.]{.underline} It is difficult to know, for example, whether a
large U.S. troop presence in a country indicates that the host is highly
dependent on the United States, or whether it is instead the United
States that is dependent upon the host. Indeed, while Lake (2007, 2009)
and Machain and Morgan (2013) find that states which host U.S. troops
have lower defense contributions, Allen, VanDusky-Allen, and Flynn
(2016) show that NATO allies' defense efforts are positively related to
U.S. military presence. Moreover, Bennett, Lepgold, and Unger (1994)
find that states with a large U.S. military presence -- which they treat
as a proxy for partners' dependence on the United States -- were more
likely to contribute to the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War.

Winter 2019, The Fletcher forum of world affairs, vol. 43

Since its creation in response to Soviet aggression after World War II,
the majority of the U.S. public has consistently held favorable views of
NATO. But [Trump's repeated public **criticism of NATO may be having an
effect on** popular **support for the Alliance**]{.underline}. Support
for NATO by Republicans decreased from 52 percent in 2016 to 47 percent
in 2017, during the first year of the Trump administration.81
Nevertheless, a strong majority of Americans polled have a favorable
view of NATO. While Republican support for NATO may have gone down
slightly, support for NATO by Democrats and Independents has increased
significantly. As a result, overall public support for NATO has grown,
from 53 percent in 2016 to 62 percent in 2017. 82 Still, [Trump's tough
NATO policy is putting **great strain on the Alliance**]{.underline}. It
will not convince the majority of U.S. allies to meet NATO's 2-percent
defense-spending pledge by 2024. Moreover, [**reducing U.S. commitments
to NATO** and cutting contributions to the Alliance will only **make the
problem worse** and may make hostile powers **more willing to test the
Alliance by using force or engaging in a hybrid attack** against a NATO
member]{.underline}. Instead of focusing on threats, Trump's NATO policy
should propose feasible burden-sharing ideas that can be implemented
quickly.83 But the key to a successful NATO policy from the Trump
administration must be a more accurate perspective on the central role
of NATO in U.S. national security. Trump needs to [**stop overestimating
the harm from burden-sharing** and underestimating the value of NATO to
U.S. national interests]{.underline}. The [security that **NATO**
provides Europe, the North Atlantic, and the Mediterranean **is worth
much more to the United States** than the 5 percent of the Department of
Defense budget allocated to U.S. forces in Europe]{.underline}. It is
critical that Trump appreciate the unique value that previous presidents
saw in NATO. As George W. Bush described it,"These trans-Atlantic ties
could not be severed by U-boats. They could not be cut by checkpoints
and barbed wire. They were not ended by SS-20s and nuclear blackmail.
And they certainly will not be broken by commercial quarrels and
political debates."84 [NATO must not be evaluated simply as a
transactional cost]{.underline}. It is a unique asset for the United
States that protects American citizens, interests, and values. As Barack
Obama explained,"Our nations are stronger and more prosperous when we
stand together. In good times and in bad, our alliance has endured; in
fact, it has thrived---because we share an unbreakable commitment to the
freedom and security of our citizens. NATO is a force multiplier....
There is nothing else like it on Earth."85 Notably, on July 6, 2017,
Trump gave one of his most powerful foreign policy speeches in Warsaw.
In the speech, he made two strong statements. "Americans know that a
strong alliance of free, sovereign and independent nations is the best
defense for our freedoms and for our interests. That is why my
administration has demanded that all members of NATO finally meet their
full and fair financial obligation," he said.86 It is important that
Trump recognize how his threats and **[demands are jeopardizing the
significant value that NATO offers]{.underline}**. If Trump leaves NATO
or [unintentionally breaks up the Alliance, the United States will not
be able to replace it.]{.underline} Rather, the Trump administration
should pursue alternative options to produce more responsible and fair
behavior from NATO allies. As President, it is in Trump's interest to
strengthen NATO and find more positive and feasible policies to resolve
the burden-sharing problem. NATO is the most powerful alliance in
history and a key asset in U.S. national security. None of our
competitors have anything like it. [The loss of NATO would be a **major

[If the benefits of coercion---especially **the capricious sort** in
which Trump specializes---are **small**, the costs may be
**sizable**]{.underline}. As we have seen, postwar American leaders saw
value in asymmetric alliances in part because, by taking on the burden
of defending others, they gained control over allies whose territory
replaced the homeland as America's front line. [Washington spent **more
on defense** than]{.underline} its [allies, but got **far more** out of
its alliances than **any one of them** did. If the U]{.underline}nited
States continues to [emphasize cost-sharing above **all other strategic
priorities**, it will reduce its ability to **assure and control
allies**, which may]{.underline} in turn [weaken **the defense and
deterrence benefits** those allies provide. America may pay less, but it
will]{.underline} also [get **far less in return**]{.underline}.

[**A loss of allied control** may take **the form of political
distance**, as allies look for other relationships to replace **their
faltering partner**]{.underline}. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has
already declared that Europe can no longer depend on the United States,
and French President Emmanuel Macron has lamented that, amid US neglect
and browbeating, NATO is "experiencing brain death." South Korean
President Moon Jae-In has prioritized his ongoing negotiations with Kim
Jong Un, distancing himself from the United States. Both South Korea and
Japan have improved their relations with China.16 [Distance undermines

Accusations of free-riding have marred transatlantic relations ever
since the creation of the Atlantic alliance in 1949. Then as now, [the
rhetoric of burden-sharing has served as a useful **rhetorical weapon to
blame** those who were seen as **not contributing enough** to the cause.
Each time, however, Washington\'s call has fallen on deaf
ears]{.underline}, at least in public. In private, European and Canadian
officials highlight other contributions they think they are making to
NATO operations, for example in the shape of development aid or
considerable troop casualties in Afghanistan. They mention UN
peacekeeping missions, such as in Lebanon, where the US is not involved.
Cynics admit that they never really bought much into the military
adventures into which the US threw them, and that the US itself did not
seem to believe much in the Libya mission. The reality, French foreign
minister Alain Juppe retorted to Gates, is that it is the Europeans who
\"think the Americans aren\'t doing enough.\"3 The evolution of the
transatlantic debate suggests two things. [First, burden-sharing is
about **more than NATO**. One cannot just look at defence spending at a
time when humanitarian aid, diplomatic mediation, and the fight against
climate change can all be considered contributions of a sort to
collective security.4]{.underline} [**Disentangling what counts as a
contribution** to which public good **is no easy thing**. Second,
burden-sharing is a **contested political concept**. Statesmen and
diplomats]{.underline} [do not speak the abstract language of public
choice]{.underline}, with its \"non-excludable\" and \"non-rival\"
goods. Rather, they talk about \"being fair,\" \"doing what you can,\"
and **[\"making a real contribution.\"]{.underline}** In other words,
they [speak the normative language of justice rather than the
utilitarian language of economics]{.underline}.

**[Deficit---Cohesion/Relations---Trump Proves]{.underline}**

**Conditional U.S. aid undermines allied cohesion -- Trump's public
views on NATO prove**

Winter 2019, The Fletcher forum of world affairs, vol. 43

These statements echo some of Trump's remarks about NATO. They
demonstrate that [American leaders are becoming more impatient with the
persistent burden-sharing imbalance with European allies, marking
a]{.underline} frequently overlooked yet nevertheless [dangerous
**decline in the U.S. attitude toward** the behavior of **its
allies**]{.underline}. They are proof that Europe has underestimated the
corrosive effect of its attitude toward fulfilling the NATO defense
commitment. These comments demonstrate that the problem of
burden-sharing is serious and will continue to jeopardize transatlantic
relations after Trump, unless significant progress is made. Trump no
doubt feels validated by these criticisms from previous presidents. But
Trump also feels that previous presidents were unsuccessful because they
did not make sufficient effort to pressure NATO allies to fulfill their
defense commitments. As a result, Trump appears willing to take greater
risks than any of his predecessors. Trump summed this up after his last
NATO summit in 2018: Now, what has happened is, presidents over many
years, from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama, they came in, they said,
"Okay, hey, do the best you can," and they left. Nobody did anything
about it. And it got to a point where the United States was paying for
90 percent of NATO. And that's not fair. [So it's
changed]{.underline}.13 To properly understand this widening gap between
the United States and NATO allies, it is essential to recall the timely
warning from Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. In 2011, Gates spoke in
very direct language to emphasize to Europe the gravity of the problem,
stating, "I am the latest in a string of U.S. defense secretaries who
have urged allies privately and publicly, often with exasperation, to
meet agreed-upon NATO benchmarks for defense spending."14 He then made
one of the starkest warnings about the health of the Alliance, stating,
"\[I\]f current trends in the decline of European defense capabilities
are not halted and reversed, future U.S. political leaders--- those for
whom the Cold War was not the formative experience that it was for
me---may not consider the return on America's investment in NATO worth
the cost."15 Gates did not advocate for such a change in U.S. NATO
policy, but he feared that if allies did not make a significant change,
future U.S. leaders would lose faith in the most powerful alliance in
U.S. history. This warning may now seem prophetic with the rise of
Trump, but even Gates must have been surprised at how quickly his
warning proved true. TRUMP BREAKS FROM HISTORICAL PRESIDENTIAL SUPPORT
FOR NATO As we have seen, Trump is not the first president to complain
that NATO allies are not contributing their fair share of defense
spending to the Alliance. [But **Trump has done two things his
predecessors avoided.** First, he has **publicly questioned the value of
NATO to U.S. national security**. Second, Trump has **publicly
questioned the validity of U.S. defense commitments to NATO allies**.
These two deviations from]{.underline} decades of bipartisan
[presidential support for NATO have **weakened the cohesion of the**
transatlantic **alliance and caused fears** in allied capitals
that]{.underline} under the Trump administration, [the]{.underline}
[**U.S. may not help defend them** should they face a foreign
attack]{.underline}. Trump's views on NATO should be understood and
examined in two phases: his statements about NATO as a candidate during
the 2016 presidential campaign and his statements about NATO since he
became president.

**[Deficit---Deterrence]{.underline}**

**The CP's pressure undermines deterrence**

These responses from European leaders show that [startling allies into
thinking the United States will abandon them has influenced
allies]{.underline} to increase defense spending in line with the [2014
Wales
Pledge](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm).
However, in the [**long term**, NATO policymaking should employ a
balanced approach]{.underline}. [If the United States brings its
security guarantee of the alliance too much into question, **Russia or
other states may take action to test the United States'
resolve**]{.underline}. During the Cold War, US leaders continually
reaffirmed their commitment to allies, effectively deterring a Soviet
invasion[**. Deterrence works best** when allies **clearly express their
mutual obligations** to all actors on the international
stage.]{.underline}

The experience of [the United Kingdom and Germany leading up to World
War I provides an example of how the United Kingdom's lack of a solid
commitment to its allies allowed German leaders to think the British
would stand aside in the war.]{.underline} [Barbara
Tuchman](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=92J9wTgKBOMC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=Guns+of+August&ots=mOLWViY-lK&sig=TOaFasP065_hkRLQIjryq6MJ6PI%23v=onepage&q=Guns%25252520of%25252520August&f=false) details
this situation in her book The Guns of August. The failure of King
George V and the UK Foreign Secretary to give a definite guarantee of
joining the war should Germany invade allowed the Kaiser to think that
he could attack without a British intervention[. If the British had made
a direct declaration of support for its allies, German leadership might
have **decided against escalating the war**. This case gives
policymakers an idea of what could happen if the United States does not
maintain a firm commitment to its NATO allies. US leaders must watch how
far they allow the US commitment to NATO wane in competitors' eyes or
**risk possible adventurism on the eastern flank of NATO**.]{.underline}

What do these two conflicting options mean for US policymakers? [If the
United States wants allies to meet the defense spending requirements, it
needs them to fear the possibility that the United States may abandon
them because their interests no longer align]{.underline}. The allies
will only fear abandonment if the United States sends costly signals to
them, such as troop withdrawals. As of 2020, the [majority of
allies](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2020/10/pdf/pr-2020-104-en.pdf) that
meet the elusive two percent spending goal sit on NATO's eastern flank,
fearing Russia and desiring US protection. Nevertheless, [spending
across the
alliance](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2020/10/pdf/pr-2020-104-en.pdf) has
increased since 2014, in part, due to the Trump administration's
application of political pressure calling into doubt US interests in
Europe. [However, in the medium- and long-term, threatening to abandon
**allies will decrease the appearance of US security** guarantees and
**invite competitors to push boundaries**.]{.underline}

**[Deficit---Conditions Fail]{.underline}**

**Conditional SC fails---it [doesn't induce behavioral
change]{.underline}**

services and global crisis management for a private sector corporation
and a retired U.S. Marine Corps officer. "THE LIMITS OF SECURITY

[Planners should go to great lengths to ensure that SC is seen as a tool
for a specific purpose, **not a reward to condition
behaviors**]{.underline}. [SC-as-a-conditioning-tool becomes bribery
with **diminishing returns**]{.underline}. [If policymakers want a quid
pro quo, they need to admit as much and use much more precisely targeted
incentives: paying a fee for access]{.underline} or head-of-the-line
transit privileges for example. [This becomes a much more predictable
business transaction than trying to use SC funds, winks, and nudges to
get one's way.]{.underline} Finally, in the land of perverse incentives,
SC is often seen as a means to drive defense business to U.S.
contractors. This is true. By creating arms races and supplying prestige
weapons, however useless, to unstable areas of the world, they are
creating U.S. jobs. But wouldn't taxpayer money and efforts be better
spent if officials more precisely targeted domestic concerns with
taxpayer funds rather than hoping that efforts trickle down predictably
from collaboration with corpulent and unsavory foreign generals? [In the
land of perverse incentives, SC funding is one of the most
egregious]{.underline}---and in the post-9/11 era, [many officials see
SC as a critical tool of strategic positioning]{.underline}. However,
[the premises of SC must be reconsidered before the U.S. military
squanders more resources on white elephant projects.]{.underline}

**[Deficit---AI---Say No]{.underline}**

**Despite talks and rhetoric, there's no way that NATO cooperations on
AI and Tech.**

**Franke '21** (Ulrike Esther Franke, Senior policy fellow at the
European council on Foreign Relations, "ARTIFICIAL DIVIDE: HOW EUROPE
AND AMERICA COULD CLASH OVER AI",
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep29123>) //sethlee

Both sides of the Atlantic are already motivated to cooperate with each
other on AI. But, [despite these shared interests, transatlantic
cooperation on AI may **not be straightforward**. Four trends, in
particular, could pose problems: **transatlantic estrangement; European
digital autonomy efforts; differing views on China;** and, potentially,
Brexit. The transatlantic alliance has had a bad four years. The Trump
administration's criticism of the United Nations and the World Trade
Organization, the president's threats to leave NATO, and his active
criticism of the EU all made Europeans wonder whether they had lost
their most important partner.]{.underline} Moreover, in light of the
conflict over 5G, in the minds of many Europeans[, technology in
particular has become an area that creates conflict in the transatlantic
relationship rather than fostering cooperation]{.underline}. Although
transatlantic relations are likely to improve under Biden, [substantial
damage has been done]{.underline}, and it will take some time to mend
these ties. But, even if relations improve, it is becoming increasingly
obvious that US has a diminishing interest in Europe as a geopolitically
important part of the world. This trend was already visible under
Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. It is, therefore, unsurprising that,
on technology cooperation, both sides emphasise the importance of
working with other actors as well as each other. The US National
Security Commission on AI, for example, recommends that the US
Departments of State and Defense "should negotiate formal AI cooperation
agreements with Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and
Vietnam". Its March 2020 report emphasises on several occasions the
importance of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. Meanwhile, Europeans
are pursuing the idea of an alliance for multilateralism. And, on
technology and AI more specifically, they have also begun to reach out
to other democratic allies. The most important aspect of transatlantic
estrangement, however, is not the loss of trust between the US and
Europe -- which they will eventually reverse. Rather, [during the four
years of the Trump administration, and partly in response to
isolationist tendencies in the US, Europeans have become much more
comfortable talking about European strategic autonomy or sovereignty.
Without encouraging the narrative that these efforts are directed
against the US, or were primarily an answer to Trump, **Europeans aim to
empower Europe as an actor in its own right.** In the technological
realm, this led to the idea of European digital sovereignty, the aim of
which is to build up European technological capabilities.]{.underline}
Although European digital sovereignty is not specifically targeted at
the US, it has led, among other things, to efforts such as the possible
regulation of American technology companies and concerns over American
firms acquiring European start-ups. European campaigners and some
policymakers believe US tech giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and
Amazon are forces to protect against. European thinking on technology
partly developed in opposition to the US and US companies[. Thus,
European efforts to build up digital sovereignty may **impede
transatlantic cooperation.**]{.underline} The EU's effort to strengthen
ethical AI, and to make 'trustworthy AI' a unique selling point for
Europe[, might also end up creating problems for transatlantic
cooperation]{.underline}. Many EU policymakers believe that the EU's
insistence on ethical AI will eventually become a location advantage for
Europe (much like data privacy): as more people become concerned about
unethical AI and data security, they will prefer to use or buy AI 'made
in Europe' rather than elsewhere. In this respect, two European aims are
at odds with each other: on the one hand, Europeans want to ensure that
AI is developed and used in an ethical way. Partnering with a powerful
player such as the US on this matter should be an obvious way to help
them achieve this goal. [However, if the EU considers ethical AI not
just a goal for humanity but a development that may also create
commercial advantages for Europe, then transatlantic cooperation on this
issue is counterproductive, as it would undermine Europe's uniqueness.
Finally, **many Europeans have expressed scepticism** about the extent
to which Europe and the US are indeed aligned on ethical AI
principles.]{.underline} For example, the Danish national AI strategy
argues for a common ethical and human-centred basis for AI. It describes
ethical AI as a particularly European approach: "Europe and Denmark
should not copy the US or China. Both countries are investing heavily in
artificial intelligence, but with little regard for responsibility,
ethical principles and privacy." **[Many Europeans feel that the US "has
no idea how to regulate" cyberspace]{.underline}** and continues to show
little enthusiasm for doing so. The EU, however, likes to think of
itself as a trailblazer when it comes to digital rights, such as the
2014 "right to be forgotten" or the 2018 General Data Protection
Regulation.

**[AT: Blankenship]{.underline}**

**Their "threats key" evidence is a mis-reading of Blankenship. They
think the [latent and implicit threat of abandonment]{.underline} is
preferable to overt QPQs.**

**Blankenship -- 1NC solvency advocate - 18** (Professor of Political
Science at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, PhD political

under Pressure: Reassurance and Burden-Sharing in Asymmetric Alliances,"
Columbia University PhD dissertation)

[The credibility of a patron's threat of abandonment is shaped by far
more than just the level of reassurance it provides]{.underline}. As a
result, the extent to which reassurance and burden-sharing are
positively or negatively correlated depends in large part on whether the
patron can couple its assurances with threats. When a patron's threat to
abandon allies is credible ex ante, it can afford to reassure its allies
without worrying as much about free-riding. Indeed, [the literature on
coercion shows that reassurance is **equally as important** as threats
in making for effective coercion]{.underline}, although it is much less
studied (Davis, 2000; Sechser, 2007; Carnegie, 2015; Gerzhoy, 2015). The
target of coercive bargaining needs to know that if it gives in, its
partner will simply punish it anyway (Schelling, 1966). Thus,
[reassurance can actually be a positive tool that is used to increase
burden-sharing]{.underline}, though only [if it is backed up by
threats]{.underline}. [These threats **do not** necessarily **need to be
explicit**, and indeed may be **most effective if they are
not**]{.underline}. Allies are likely to consider how likely patron
abandonment is, and thus their **[burden-sharing efforts
will]{.underline}** in no small part [be a reaction to the patron's
**latent threat** of abandonment]{.underline}.

3.2.1 What is Exit? By exit, I refer to attempts by states in an
alliance to loosen themselves from the partnership and reduce the
benefits they provide to their partners. For allies, exit takes the form
of efforts to reclaim their autonomy and pursue a foreign policy more
independent of the patron, while for patrons exit takes the form of
efforts to reduce the security it provides. Exiting the alliance is more
credible to the extent that a state has attractive outside options for
meeting their security and/or autonomy needs. [Violation or abrogation
of the alliance treaty are]{.underline} only the most [extreme forms of
exit]{.underline}; a party to an alliance need not expect that its
partner will outright terminate the partnership. Rather,
**[exit]{.underline}** is a spectrum, and states may fear the
consequences of the more moderate step of their partners "distancing"
themselves from the alliance. Distancing **[is undesirable for two
reasons]{.underline}**. The first is that [the perception of disunity
may weaken deterrence by tempting adversaries to drive a wedge between
the allies or by emboldening them to behave more
aggressively]{.underline} (Weitsman, 2004; Crawford, 2011). [Second,
distancing raises questions about the amount of support that the partner
will]{.underline} 35 [furnish]{.underline}. [Allies may fear that the
patron will give only minimal support if they are attacked,]{.underline}
while the patron may anticipate that more [autonomous allies will be
less likely to]{.underline} [provide basing]{.underline} rights, less
likely to [support its foreign policy initiatives, and more likely to
come to a separate understanding with adversaries]{.underline} (Lake,
2009). In early 2018, for example, steps toward détente between North
and South Korea -- including North Korea's participation in the Winter
Olympics and discussions of potential bilateral talks -- worried many in
the United States, who feared that such a rapprochement might undermine
South Korea's support for the United States' preferred policy of putting
military and economic pressure on the North.3 Two general forms of
outside options are available to alliance partners: self-sufficiency and
search. In the case of the former, states reduce their need for
partners. Allies, for example, can attempt to increase their own
military capabilities such that they no longer need protection. Patrons,
for their part, can reduce their need for loyal allies by pursuing a
more unilateral or isolationist foreign policy, and by striking a deal
with adversaries. In terms of search, patrons and allies can seek
alternative partners. While the types of outside options weaker allies
can pursue -- ranging from nuclearization, to neutrality, to finding
other countries to rely on for support -- are diverse, and in many cases
will not be the precursor to actual alliance termination, their causes
are fundamentally similar, and they share common features that will make
them worrisome to the patron. First, all of the forms of exit I discuss
reduce allies' dependence on the patron. [This]{.underline}, in turn,
**[makes them less likely to cave into its pressure]{.underline}** in
the future, [and]{.underline} **[gives them less incentive to
be]{.underline}** automatically **[loyal]{.underline}**. As a result, a
patron has good reason to discourage allies from pursuing any of these
options. Second, allies will be most prone to consider all of these
forms of exit when relying on the patron's protection becomes less
attractive -- whether because the patron seems unreliable, because the
severity of the threat environment makes trusting the patron risky, or
because the barriers to exit decrease. I am ultimately agnostic as to
which form of exit allies will be most likely to pursue in a given
situation. Indeed, in many cases, allies can pursue multiple options in
tandem, such as unilateral military arming coupled with efforts at
rapprochement with adversaries. Nevertheless, I treat the threat of all
forms of exit as a key driver of patron reassurance.

Marin Cty. Employees\' Ret. Assn.," 2 Cal. App. 5th 674\]

There is, of course, no bar to the Supreme Court adopting a Court of
Appeal\'s reasoning as its own. Yet there is legitimate reason to
question whether that was what the Supreme Court intended in 1983.
First, as just shown, [**only the least authoritative** of the three
sources]{.underline} cited \*\*385 [**actually supports** the word
"must,"]{.underline} while [the]{.underline} two [Supreme Court
decisions employ "**should**."]{.underline} Second, barely a month
later, the Supreme Court---speaking though the same justice---filed
another decision which used the "should" formulation from the 1955 Allen
decision as quoted in Abbott.20 Third, the 1983 Allen decision involved
retirees (and Flournoy the widow of a retiree), who historically receive
a heightened degree of judicial protection. (See fn. 19, ante.) Fourth,
and most significantly, [the "must" formulation has never been
reiterated by the Supreme Court, which has **instead uniformly
employed** the "should"]{.underline} \*699 [language]{.underline} from
the 1955 Allen decision. (Olson v. Cory, supra, 27 Cal.3d 532, 541, 178
Cal.Rptr. 568, 636 P.2d 532 \["Although an employee does not obtain any
'absolute right to fixed or specific benefits \... there \[are\] strict
limitation\[s\] on the conditions which may modify the pension system in
effect during employment.' \[Citation.\] Such modifications must be
reasonable and any ' "changes in a pension plan which result in
disadvantage to employees should be accompanied by comparable new
advantages" ' "\]; Legislature v. Eu (1991) 54 Cal.3d 492, 529--530, 286
Cal.Rptr. 283, 816 P.2d 1309 \[quoting Olson\]; City of Huntington Beach

disadvantage to employees should be accompanied by comparable new
advantages," citing Allen v. City of Long Beach, supra, 45 Cal.2d 128,
131, 287 P.2d 765\].)

It thus appears unlikely that the Supreme Court\'s use of "must" in the
1983 Allen decision was intended to herald a fundamental doctrinal
shift. ["Should," not "must," remains the **court\'s preferred
expression**]{.underline}. And ["should" does not convey **imperative
obligation**, **no more compulsion** than "ought."]{.underline} (Lashley
v. Koerber (1945) 26 Cal.2d 83, 90, 156 P.2d 441; see People v. Webb

**[AT: INB---European Defense High]{.underline}**

**European Defense spending is high and increasing rapidly**

**Rolander '22** (Niclas Rolander, Reporter, "Global Military Spending
Tops \$2 Trillion for First Time as Europe Boosts Defenses",
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-24/military-spending-passes-2-trillion-as-europe-boosts-defenses>)
//sethlee

[Global military expenditure has surpassed \$2 trillion per
year]{.underline} for the first time, [and looks set to rise further
**as European countries beef up their armed forces** in response to
Russia's invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline}

In 2021, countries spent a total of \$2,113 billion on their militaries,
up 0.7% in real terms from the year before, according to a report
released Monday by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute,
or SIPRI. 

After a brief period of declining military spending between 2011 and
2014, outlays have increased for 7 consecutive years, according to SIPRI
data. [In the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, several
European governments have pledged a spending overhaul **to boost their
forces' capabilities. **]{.underline}

**["Europe was already on an increasing trend, and this trend will
accelerate and intensify,]{.underline}**" Lucie Beraud-Sudreau, director
of SIPRI's military expenditure and arms production program, said in a
phone interview. "[Usually change happens slowly, until you are in a
crisis and then change really happens. I think that's where we are
now."]{.underline}

[The upturn since 2015 has partly been fueled by higher spending in
Europe, after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea]{.underline} raised the
perceived threat level at the same time as the U.S. administration under
Donald Trump increased pressure on NATO allies to spend more on their
armed forces, Beraud-Sudreau said.  

[European spending in 2021 **accounted for 20%** of the global
total]{.underline}, and China's defense budget, the world's second
largest, is estimated to make up 14%. 

The U.S. remains by far the biggest spender, with \$801 billion
allocated to the armed forces in 2021, according to SIPRI. In the last
decade, U.S. military spending has made up as much as 39% of global
expenditures. While the country's arms purchases have declined, more
funds have been devoted to military research and development, suggesting
that the U.S. is focusing more on next-generation technologies,
according to SIPRI researcher Alexandra Marksteiner. 

[As European nations from Sweden to Spain have pledged to increase
defense budgets, early indications are that modernizing and **upgrading
weapons systems will be a key priority,** Beraud-Sudreau said. In doing
so, they are facing a choice of whether to prioritize a quick buildup by
buying equipment off-the-shelf from arms manufacturers in other parts of
the world, or taking a more long-term approach by increasing funding for
domestic industry]{.underline}.

//sethlee

[When NATO leaders met in Wales in 2014, strengthening allied burden
sharing and reversing a downward trend in national defense spending were
high on the agenda]{.underline}. In response to Russia's comprehensive
military modernization efforts and territorial aggression against
Ukraine, member
states [pledged](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm) to
increase their national defense spending to at least 2 percent of real
gross domestic product (GDP) by no later than 2024.

[European allies and Canada **have now contributed five consecutive
years of growth in defense investment**, adding a cumulative total
of** [\$130
billion](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_174406.htm#sg4) in
new spending** since 2016. In 2019, all but three NATO allies increased
their defense spending in real terms, **with nine allies reaching or
surpassing the 2 percent goal** (up from seven in 2018).]{.underline}

But progress has not been confined just to the realm of investment.
Since 2014, [the Alliance has stepped up [military
exercises](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2019_02/1902-factsheet_exercises_en.pdf) across

and reinforced its eastern flank with new enhanced Forward Presence

Looking ahead, the COVID-19 pandemic has left much regarding
the [future](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/coronavirus-and-transatlantic-security-implications-for-defense-planning/) of
allied defense planning and investment uncertain, and it is likely that
many allied governments will feel pressured to limit or cut defense
spending as the pandemic's economic toll continues to mount. That said,
[it is clear from the data that the Alliance-wide drive towards 2
percent, though uneven at times, continued apace through 2019, signaling
NATO members' commitment to strengthening and more evenly distributing
their contributions to the common defense.  ]{.underline}

PARIS: [The war in Ukraine has been a **strong wake-up call** for a
number of European countries who'd been basking in post-Cold War comfort
thinking that armed conflict was relegated to history and that spending
on defense could be minimal.]{.underline}

[The turnaround since [Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of
Ukraine](https://breakingdefense.com/2022/02/russia-aiming-to-decapitate-ukrainian-government-us-official/) has
been nothing less than stunning, to the point that **six NATO members
have now pledged defense increases of \$133 billion so
far**]{.underline}; militarily neutral Sweden has also pledged an
increase. And more nations seem poised to follow suit in the days and
weeks to come.

[The first to make a 180° turnaround was Germany]{.underline}. Just four
days after Russia's invasion began, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced his
government would ramp up its defense spending in 2022 alone by €100
billion (\$112 billion) taking defense spending from 1.53% of GDP to
above 2%.

That is the figure recommended by NATO estimated to have been [only met
in
2021](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2021/6/pdf/210611-pr-2021-094-en.pdf) by
the US, Greece (3.82%), Croatia (2.79%), the United Kingdom (2.29%),
Estonia (2.28%), Latvia (2.27%), Poland (2.10%), Lithuania, (2.03%),
Romania (2.02%) and France (2.01%), according to NATO statistics. (That
Germany had not met that threshold was a major political sticking point
during the Trump administration, leading to tensions between Washington
and Berlin.)

[Scholz said in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine it had become
clear "we need to invest significantly more in the **security** of our
country, in order to protect our freedom and our
democracy.]{.underline}" If the money Scholz has requested comes
through, it will mark a dramatic moment for Germany, with Berlin
becoming the largest overall defense spender in Europe. How that money
will be spent will be important to watch for industry; currently,[ only
four European NATO member
states](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2021/6/pdf/210611-pr-2021-094-en.pdf) (Iceland,
Slovenia, Portugal and Belgium) spend a lower percentage of their
overall defense spending on procurement and defense-related R&D than
Germany's 18.6%.

[NATO's]{.underline} geographic home of [Belgium followed suit days
later]{.underline}, announcing on Feb. 25 it would raise its defense
budget from the current €4.2 billion (0.9% of GDP) to €6.9 billion
(1.54% of GDP) by 2030. But on March 16 Prime Minister Alexander De Croo
told parliamentarians this was not enough, indicating **[more may
come.]{.underline}**

[Romania announced]{.underline} on March 1[ it will up its defense
budget from 2.02% to 2.5% of GDP starting in 2023. The 2022 defense
budget of RON25.9bn (\$5.8bn) is already 14% higher than
2021.]{.underline} Florin Cîțu, president of the Romanian Senate,
suggested a day later that a large proportion of the new funds should be
used for capital investments, but gave no precise figures. A forecast
released in December 2021 suggested investment would account for 40% of
the total defense budget by 2025. [**That will likely increase further**
in light of the new 2.5% goal.]{.underline}

spending\-\-- CP does nothing.**

[In the wake of Vladimir Putin's beastly assault on Ukraine, multiple
NATO nations have announced immediate plans to increase defense
spending]{.underline}**.** [This reawakening is **long
overdue**]{.underline}. In this post-post-Cold War era, there's no room
in the free world for free-riders.

Rearming What Winston Churchill said of Josef Stalin and his commissars
remains true of Putin and his henchmen: "There is nothing they admire so
much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect
than for weakness, especially military weakness."

[Before hurling his army into Ukraine, Putin not only sensed weakness in
NATO but saw it in a range of policies: evaporating defense budgets,
lack of cohesion and commitment]{.underline} in Afghanistan, doubts
about NATO sown by NATO leaders, the chaotic pullout from Kabul, the
feckless response to his invasion of Georgia (2008) and annexation of
Crimea (2014), flatfooted confusion over his misinformation campaigns
and cyberattacks, a shortsighted dependency on his regime for energy
supplies, the straitjacket self-restraint in NATO capitals.

Yet [what Putin has seen in the months since he launched
his]{.underline} catastrophic and criminal [invasion]{.underline} of
Ukraine [is something he never anticipated]{.underline}.

For individuals and nations alike, danger on the doorstep has a way of
rearranging priorities and refocusing the mind. That\'s what has
happened among NATO\'s European leaders.

In a stunning 180-degree turn just 72 hours after Putin's attack on
Ukraine, [**German** Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that his
government would increase defense spending]{.underline} to 2% of GDP --
something NATO has been begging Berlin to do since 2006. That amounts to
a near-doubling of Germany's defense budget \-- by next year. Scholz
also unveiled a massive \$112.7 billion modernization and rearmament
fund and announced plans to replace Germany\'s aging fighter-bomber
fleet with F-35s. And since energy security is inextricably tied to
national security, it's worth noting that he unveiled detailed plans to
create a strategic LNG reserve and build new LNG terminals.

"[The world]{.underline}," Scholz explained as Putin began his siege to
Ukraine, "[will no longer be the same as the world
before]{.underline}**."**

Berlin's extraordinary about-face was an early indication that other
NATO nations would begin to lift their defense budgets -- and finally
see Putin for what he is, not what they hoped him to be.

[Defense spending was inching upward in Europe even before Putin's war,
but Germany's transformation that fateful last week of February heralds
a far more dramatic and rapid return to deterrence]{.underline} across
the 30-member alliance.

**[Poland]{.underline}** -- thrust to the frontlines of Cold War 2.0 by
Putin's invasion -- [announced that its defense budget will jump to 3%
of GDP next year]{.underline}. Before the invasion, Poland had planned
to invest 2.5% of GDP into defense. That's a 20% spike in just one year.
Mariusz Blaszczak, Poland's defense minister, says Warsaw is committed
to fielding "one of the strongest armies in NATO.\"

Just days after the invasion, [**French** President]{.underline}
Emmanuel [Macron revealed that his government would increase defense
spending]{.underline}, calling it "the price for peace, freedom and
democracy." To his credit, Macron has increased defense spending every
year since 2017.

[**Italian** Prime Minister]{.underline} Mario [Draghi unveiled plans to
"invest more in defense than we have ever done before]{.underline}" and
to lift Italy\'s defense budget to the NATO standard of 2% of GDP.

Immediately after Putin launched his war, [**Latvia** approved measures
pushing its defense budget to 2.5% of GDP]{.underline} (up from 2.2%).
That represents a one-year increase of 13%. [**Lithuania** is increasing
defense spending. And Estonia's defense minister says the country will
increase defense]{.underline} spending to accelerate equipment
acquisitions.

Even before Russia's February invasion, the [**Netherlands** had
increased defense spending]{.underline}. The Dutch government is working
on an even bigger defense budget now, with Prime Minister Mark Rutte
declaring, "The Netherlands will spend a lot of extra money on defense."

Norway, which shares land and maritime borders with Russia, is making
immediate emergency investments to- increase the number and tempo of
naval deployments, increase the number of combat exercises, increase
ammunition and fuel stocks, enhance its \"ability to receive allied
reinforcements,\" and \"strengthen the armed forces\' ability to prevent
and stop digital threats.\"

[**Romania** is increasing defense spending by 23.7%]{.underline} for
fiscal 2023.

Thanks to major investments in defense announced in 2020, [**Britain**
is already riding its largest wave of defense spending]{.underline}
since the Cold War's end.

Sweden \-- not yet a NATO member \-- has unveiled a plan to rapidly
increase defense spending from 1.3% of GDP to 2% of GDP.

As of this moment 10 members of the alliance meet NATO'sstandard
2%-of-GDP standard. [But NATO is headed in the right
direction.]{.underline} In 2016, just five members met that standard.
And [several allies are pouring significant sums into the common
defense. Belgium]{.underline}'s defense budget is 10.9% larger than a
year ago, [Croatia]{.underline}'s is up 62.5% and the
[Greek]{.underline} defense budget is 49.6% larger.
[Italy]{.underline}'s is up 6%, [Spain]{.underline}'s 7.7%,
[Britain]{.underline}'s 7.5% [and France]{.underline}'s 5%.

Regarding Libya and Afghanistan, it would appear as though [NATO allies
were contributing to a more balanced and fair system of burden sharing,
but this is in fact not the case.]{.underline} In Afghanistan, alliance
cooperation and burden sharing were on more equal footing with the
initial invocation of Article 5. [Countries were attempting to provide
military assistance to the operations **despite the limitations** their
economies and populations imposed upon them]{.underline}. However,
[there were only a few countries that provided enough force in any truly
effective sense]{.underline}. While major allies such as Canada did
indeed provide a great deal for the alliance in the beginning, [support
tapered off overtime.]{.underline} Several other capable countries did
not dedicate as much as they could have, and even when they did, [their
support provided **little strategic significance.**]{.underline}
Instead, [U.S. forces were providing for the **bulk of the operation**
while its allies were hampered by **inefficient forces**]{.underline}
and a reluctance to give in to U.S. unilateralism. In addition, the
restraints placed on rules of engagement and other factors significantly
reduced the effectiveness of their combat roles. [This forced the U.S.
to pick up the slack]{.underline}, as it had done during the Cold War,
[with its deterrence abilities]{.underline}. The eventual decline in
alliance involvement [also indicates support for collective action
theory as allies began to outweigh the costs to the benefits of
participating in combat operations with the U.S]{.underline}. In Libya,
on the other hand, the U.S. attempted to reduce its role in combat
operations while [NATO allies shouldered the burden of putting their
forces in potential danger]{.underline}. While the U.S. was dedicating
its budget to strategic command, its [allies were]{.underline} making up
for their lack of defense spending by [taking more responsibility
through both material and non-material variables]{.underline}. The
involvement of more subtle factors completely changes the implications
of collective action. However, the [statistics indicated that the U.S.
was still **forced to engage** in taking on a larger share of the burden
than it had anticipated or even wanted]{.underline}. The [other allies
did in fact break through **domestic constraints** by putting their
forces in harm's way]{.underline}. But Hasebrouck's work showed that
such constraints were not as prominent because Libya was considered an
easier operation, and [the U.S. still took on a greater
role]{.underline}. Furthermore, the implications of increased U.S.
involvement show in a concrete way that free riding is occurring. The
inability of European forces to deal with the realities of modern combat
[forced them to rely on the U.S. even though they were trying to take
more of a leadership role in the operation.]{.underline}

would be a pale shadow of nato: after Brexit, non-eu countries will

realistically the **[gap-filling could take 15 years]{.underline}** or
so. **[That is a long time for places like Poland and the Baltic

American Progress, official at the U.S. State Department from 2011 to
2017. \[The EU Is the Military Ally the United States Needs: Take the

**[Insisting]{.underline}** that [European states hit **two percent by
2024** is setting up the alliance to **fail**. Not only are these
states]{.underline} [**unlikely** to hit the target]{.underline}, but
[**even if** they did, the results would likely be
**underwhelming**]{.underline}. The two percent metric is, after all,
arbitrary, as it is not tied to specific defense requirements, and is
moreover subject to broader economic fluctuations. Greece, for instance,
hit two percent only because its GDP contracted so dramatically,
increasing its military's share of the shrinking budget. Indeed,
[**marginal increases** in **any single country's defense spending**
won't **automatically help improve** the European pillar of NATO, which
is **plagued with inefficiencies**. EU member states in total spend
roughly **\$200 billion annually** on defense, on a par with
China]{.underline}. But [Europe struggles to **deploy forces**; it runs
**out of munitions** when it fights; and its forces are **seldom
prepared to fight**]{.underline}.

[The problem]{.underline}, then, [is **not really low spending** but
that European defense spending is **fragmented**, **wasteful**, and
**redundant**]{.underline}. For instance, although Germany is the
strongest economic power in Europe, few of Germany's attack helicopters
are ready for combat. France, by contrast, has a very capable military
engaged in active combat operations in the Sahel. But French forces
depend on U.S. support for those operations. When **[European
states]{.underline}** spend on defense, most of them [allocate **too
little of their budgets** to **research and development** and face
**stark tradeoffs** between acquiring **expensive new technologies**
and]{.underline} simply [maintaining the forces they have]{.underline}.
As the European defense analyst Sven Biscop of the Egmont Institute
assesses, ["The status of Europe's armed forces and their dependence on
the US will basically remain unaltered, **even if** they **all** spend 2
percent of their GDP."]{.underline}

A Collective Concern

U.S. leaders have long viewed the EU as just another complicated,
multilateral bureaucracy. To the extent that it got involved in defense,
Washington imagined, the EU would duplicate and undermine NATO's
function. But the EU has transformed since its founding in 1993,
becoming something much more like a state than a multilateral
organization. Europeans in the EU are EU citizens, subject to EU law,
free to live and work where they please in the union. They have their
own currency, a de facto national language (English), and a federal
government in Brussels.

As the union has drawn together, [Europeans]{.underline} have come to
[perceive **defense and foreign policy** as more of **a collective
concern** than **a national one**]{.underline}. Support across Europe
for EU defense is extremely high, consistently polling above 70 percent.
[Within **European states**]{.underline}, however, [there is
**considerably less support** for diverting **national resources** away
from **domestic priorities**, such as health and education, and toward
**the high-end weapons systems** that are required to **marginally
improve** NATO's collective defense capacity. **The lack of national
interest** in **defense spending** is]{.underline} therefore [not **a
short-term problem** for NATO; it is **structural**]{.underline}.

**[AT: INB---No Impact---US increase spending]{.underline}**

**Independent of what Europe does, the US will just increase spending
for strategic and nuclear dominance.**

**Thimm, 18** \[Johannes Thimm, Head of Research Division "The Americas"
at Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, German Institute for International
and Security Affairs, 4-09-2018, 'NATO: US Strategic Dominance and
Unequal Burden-Sharing Are Two Sides of the Same Coin',

/alundy\]

US defense policy is made strictly on US terms.

Second, [the US defense budget does not depend on **Europe's military
spending**]{.underline}. It is misleading to argue that [Europe must
spend more so that the United States can spend less.]{.underline} The
[Pentagon's budget is determined by Washington's assessment of the
capabilities necessary to maintain US **strategic
dominance**]{.underline} -- on its own, not through any alliance. When
[Congress adopts the annual defense budget, European expenditures play a
**marginal role**]{.underline}**.** In 2017, President Trump increased
the US defense budget, despite the fact that European states also spent
more (and Russia's spending decreased by 20 percent). According to
calculations by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, [US
spending on NATO and the defense of Europe amounts to \$30 billion, or
just over 5 percent of its defense budget.]{.underline} Comparing that
figure to the roughly \$240 billion of European spending for NATO, [the
imbalance no longer seems so great]{.underline}. Given these numbers, it
is also hard to argue that Europe is principally to blame for a US
defense budget of around \$600 billion.

Looking specifically at the cost of the US nuclear arsenal, it becomes
even clearer [how detached the US budget is from burden-sharing in
NATO]{.underline}. Washington defines the US [nuclear strategy with
**little regard for Europe**'s policy priorities]{.underline}. Over the
next thirty years (calculated from 2017), Washington plans a massive
qualitative nuclear build-up, spending \$400 billion on modernizing its
nuclear arsenal -- in addition to the costs of maintaining existing
systems. This move was partly a reaction to Russian aggression in
Ukraine, but above all a concession by President Obama to the Republican
Congress in exchange for its approval of the 2014 New START treaty, in
which [the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and Russia
pledged to limit numbers of strategic nuclear warheads.]{.underline} If
Trump were really interested in reducing costs, he would make serious
efforts on arms control. Instead, he refused Russia's offer to extend
the New START treaty beyond its 2021 expiration date and increased
spending on nuclear weapons by almost 20 percent. So, yes, to some
extent Europe is free-riding on US security guarantees. But [the reasons
include the US desire for unrivalled military and nuclear capabilities,

But it is also reasonable to argue that these [**spending gaps** are of
**little consequence**]{.underline}. The important question is whether
it is cheaper to have a foreign policy that relies on sustained
cooperation with allies afflicted by moral hazard than to have a
unilateral policy with no burden-sharing at all. On this view, [as long
as]{.underline} US defense [spending does not exceed **national means**,
it is **hardly tragic** if allies spend **a bit less**]{.underline} as a
proportion of GDP. [There is **no evidence**]{.underline} that [American
defense spending hampers growth or makes the country less
competitive]{.underline}. And [while the defense budget makes up **a
sizable chunk of federal spending**, **a relatively small
portion**]{.underline} of that money [goes to forward basing. To those
who bemoan burden-sharing gaps, **a reasonable rejoinder**
is]{.underline} that [Washington should ensure]{.underline} that [**its
own budget commitments** are sound in **national terms**]{.underline},
rather than preoccupy itself with false equivalence abroad.7

Finally, when we think about the costs of alliances, we should be
mindful that [**alliance agreements themselves** impose **no financial
burdens** on the **US Treasury**. What costs money]{.underline}---and
potentially lives---[is]{.underline} the associated [**force posture**.
Proposals for cutting US alliance spending are]{.underline} usually
[suggestions about curtailing **overseas defense presence**. This is
**not a semantic difference**]{.underline}. It points to an important
reality that many miss when they refer to alliances as extravagant: in
order to generate substantial savings in its own defense budget---that
is, to close the gap between its "allied contribution" ratio and those
of its thriftier partners---the United States would have to close
overseas bases and return the personnel and materiel to the continental
United States. Simply consolidating bases and relying more on rotational
deployments would not generate substantial cost savings.8 Leading
[scholars]{.underline} have [argued for]{.underline} just this kind of
move---[ending alliances and shuttering]{.underline} related
[bases]{.underline} to curb commitments and spending. [**Such dramatic
changes** would require not just a transformed alliance policy but **a
completely different grand strategy**]{.underline}--- one that does not
seek to secure the balance of power in Eurasia through forward defense,
deterrence, and allied assurance and control.

[In December 2021, the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific coordinator,
Kurt Campbell,
[detailed](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/conversation-white-house-indo-pacific-coordinator-kurt-campbell)
the shape of U.S. thinking about China and Asia during a conference on
Indo-Pacific security]{.underline}. He hit all the familiar notes: the
importance of alliances, weapons sales to counter China, the centrality
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the
optimistic view that Sino-U.S. relations could be at once competitive
and stable. In any other era, such talk might have been comfort food for
regional experts and policymakers. [But **absent** from Campbell's
remarks at the conference, which was organized by Australia's Lowy
Institute, was **any meaningful statement about political
economy**---the single aspect of statecraft most crucial to the
Indo-Pacific region's stability. It is in this arena of policy that
China has done more to displace the United States than in any other, and
it **remains the glaring hole in Washington's attempts to craft an
Indo-Pacific policy**]{.underline}. When pressed on this by his host,
Campbell acknowledged that defense initiatives were not enough. But he
could mention no concept, policy, or action to suggest economics was
anything more than a throwaway gesture in a speech. Grand references to
a forthcoming "economic framework" that would be "cutting-edge" lacked
all specifics and stated no purpose other than wanting the United States
to "design" the region's standards. To the extent Campbell's remarks
reflect Washington's view of Asia, they are at once modestly reassuring
and highly troubling. Reassuring because Campbell's bland rhetorical
restraint is a refreshing departure from the volatility and
pugnaciousness of the Trump administration. [Troubling, however, because
the ideas powering U.S. President Joe Biden's Asia policy are **as bland
as the rhetoric itself**.]{.underline} U.S. policy toward the world's
most important region is no more than a mashup of the residual inertia
from Trump's
[military-first](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-10-19/sleepwalking-world-war-iii)
Asia policy with a revival of then-U.S. President Barack Obama's

[heavily
militarized](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2021-03-12/americas-indo-pacific-folly)
agenda. Consequently, [the United States is **misallocating its
attention and influence** relative to what would actually benefit the
region most.]{.underline} [**Economic policy, not defense policy**, is
the **only way to address** the interrelated problems]{.underline} of
development, pandemic recovery, and adaptation to climate
change---issues [that plague policymakers throughout Asia and threaten
to derail the region's peace and prosperity.]{.underline} Washington
must also stop conflating economic strategy with stale tropes on free
trade and coercive sanctions. [This is precisely the trouble with U.S.
engagement in Asia to date: **The United States has no economic
strategy** for the region]{.underline}---at least not since Obama's
ill-fated attempt to negotiate a new U.S.-Asia trade agreement, the
Trans-Pacific Partnership. And [it **is unrealistic to expect any
economic strategy** beyond the free-trade pabulum so sharply at odds
with U.S. domestic political constraints]{.underline}.

MIXED MESSAGES But these same polls illustrate that Biden's gains are
limited, if not tenuous. The 2021 ISEAS [survey showed respondents
believe **U.S. economic influence in Southeast Asia has decreased**
since Biden took office.]{.underline} The survey also found almost half
of respondents think China has greater regional political sway than the
United States. The Lowy Asia Power Index may have found that the Biden
administration restored the United States' diplomatic influence, but it
docked Washington more than ten points (from 61.7 to 51.1) on economic
sway. The index also found the [**U.S. military's relative lead over
China shrank in 2021**---and that was before Beijing conducted its
alarming hypersonic missile tests. For the United States, both these
challenges will intensify. On the economic front, China is expanding its
financial footprint across the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} U.S. allies
such as Australia and Japan have privately pledged to help keep Beijing
out of the CPTPP and to hold a place in the trade agreement for
Washington. But the Biden administration has said it has no plan to
return to the CPTPP, and officials in Canberra and Tokyo warn they
cannot hold off China for more than a few years without some positive
signals from the United States. Meanwhile, in addition to trying to join
the CPTPP, China has also asked to join the Digital Economy Partnership
Agreement (DEPA) with Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore---yet another
economic group with no U.S. seat at the table. The Biden administration
has promised "the development of an Indo-Pacific economic framework"
focused on a patchwork of issues---trade facilitation, digital trade,
supply chain resiliency, clean energy, infrastructure, and worker
standards. [But at best, the United States' closest Asian partners see
the framework as a save-the-date card for what they hope will be the day
when Washington decides to join the CPTPP or a comparable agreement. The
announcement on January 21 of a new U.S.-Japanese economic dialogue
helps, but most Asian policymakers and business leaders view the
vagueness of the Indo-Pacific economic framework as **indicative of a
lack of focus and commitment to deep economic engagement**.]{.underline}
The relative strength of the U.S. economy continues to drive the
region's investment and trade with the United States, but as things
stand, [**Washington is losing influence** over the rules that will
govern trade, investment, supply chains, and ultimately, geopolitics in
Asia]{.underline}. [The administration **has no long-term economic
strategy toward Beijing**. The United States' vague economic policies
extend to its goals with Beijing.]{.underline} The Biden administration
has rightly sought to limit sensitive technology
transfers---particularly of semiconductor- and [artificial
intelligence](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2017-12-05/artificial-intelligence-and-chinese-power)-related
technology---to China. But the administration has no long-term economic
strategy toward Beijing beyond seeking more Chinese agricultural and
energy exports under the 2020 Phase One trade deal negotiated by the
Trump administration to end the trade war the White House started in
2018. U.S. businesses cannot get a clear answer about whether the
administration will promote trade and investment with China in
non-sensitive sectors, such as retail and automobiles. (Washington
originally championed the TPP to gain leverage in economic negotiations
with China, but this tool is now missing.) U.S. defense policy faces
different but equally formidable challenges. The Biden administration
has clearly made gains at [deterring
China](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-05/kevin-rudd-usa-chinese-confrontation-short-of-war)
by strengthening its alliances, but it has been less purposeful about
the types of military capabilities it deploys in Asia---and where it
puts them. [The Defense Department's signature Global Posture Review
resulted in **almost no significant additions to U.S. military forces in
the Indo-Pacific** beyond what the Trump White House already had
planned. The administration and Congress have **failed to properly fund
the new Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI)**, legislation that was
**designed to improve the composition of the military's funding** for
much needed capabilities in the Indo-Pacific theater]{.underline}.
Although many experts expect Congress to increase defense spending next
year, [the crisis in **Ukraine could drain resources** to the continuing
detriment of the Indo-Pacific theater]{.underline}.

Organization and BRICS, India is engaged in active talks with Russia and

surface-to-air missiles in the coming months, which could anger the US

BRUSSELS --- Until this week, [the so-called "pivot to Asia" by the
United States had been more of a threat]{.underline} than a reality
**[for Europe.]{.underline}** But that changed when the Biden
administration announced a new defense alliance against China that has
left Europe facing an implicit question:

Which side are you on? It is a question that European leaders have
studiously sought to avoid since [former President Barack
Obama](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/us/obama-presidential-center-chicago.html)
first articulated that America should ["pivot" resources and attention
to
Asia](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/world/asia/obama-laos-asia-asean-tour.html)
as part of its rivalry with China. [European leaders hoped that the
relationship between the two superpowers could remain stable and that
Europe could balance its interests between the two. Then the Trump
administration **sharply raised the temperature with China with
tariffs** and other trade barriers. And now the Biden administration on
Wednesday announced an alliance between the United States, Britain and
Australia that would help
[Australia](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/us/politics/us-france-australia-betrayal.html)
deploy nuclear-powered submarines in the Pacific ---]{.underline} and,
in doing so, also tore up [a \$66 billion
deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/world/europe/france-australia-uk-us-submarines.html)
for Australia to buy a French fleet of diesel-powered subs. "Europeans
want to defer the moment of truth, to not make a choice between the
two," said Thomas Gomart, director of the French Institute of
International Relations, or IFRI. "The Biden administration, like the
Trump one, is provoking the moment of choice." [France was
enraged](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/world/europe/france-australia-uk-us-submarines.html).
Yet if it was a humiliation --- as well as the cancellation of a
lucrative defense deal --- it possibly did have a silver lining for
[France](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/us/politics/us-france-australia-betrayal.html)'s
broader goals. President Emmanuel Macron of France has been Europe's
loudest proponent of "strategic autonomy," the idea that Europe needs to
retain a balanced approach to the United States and China. "We must
survive on our own, as others do," said Josep Borrell Fontelles, the
European Union's foreign policy chief, echoing the French line. The
French embarrassment --- the Americans also announced the submarine deal
[with little if any
warning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/us/politics/france-us-biden-australia-submarine.html)
--- came after the disastrous fall of Afghanistan. [European allies were
furious with]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration,
blaming the Americans for acting with little or no consultation and
feeding Mr. Macron's argument that the United States is no longer an
entirely reliable security partner. "The submarines and Afghanistan, it
reinforces the French narrative that you can't trust the Americans,"
said Ulrich Speck of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. But whether
France will succeed in turning this bilateral defeat into a way to
promote strategic autonomy is doubtful, analysts suggest. "Many
Europeans will see this as a transparent way for the French to leverage
their own interests," said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, the
London-based research institution. **[Even so, there seems little doubt
that Europe's balancing act is becoming trickier to
maintain.]{.underline}** "Europe needs to think hard about where it sits
and what it does," said Rosa Balfour, director of Carnegie Europe. [A
Europe that spends more on defense is to be desired, but **it also needs
allies**]{.underline} --- [including]{.underline} Britain and [the
United States,]{.underline} she said. And a Europe that does more to
build its own security capacity "is the best way to be listened to more
by its partners," she added. The new alliance, known as AUKUS, is an
effort to integrate Australia and Britain into the broader American
effort to create a security deterrent to China. For Australia, which has
seen its once-strong relations with Beijing deteriorate, America and
Britain provide a much stouter deterrent to China in the Indo-Pacific,
analysts agree, than could the deal with France. "It's sending a very
big signal to Beijing, which is useful for the U.S., but especially
useful to Australia," said Ian Lesser, acting director of the German
Marshall Fund and head of its Brussels office. "And the weight of that
signal is important because of who the partners are." Mr. Lesser also
questioned why the American moves in the Pacific have to be interpreted
as a zero-sum equation in which Europe's importance is diminished. "I
don't see any diminution of American interest and commitment to European
security in the wake of Afghanistan or the moves in Asia," he said. The
biggest issue for the European Union may be finding the political will
for strategic autonomy, a point made by the president of the European
Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in her [state of the European Union
address](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/strategic-planning/state-union-addresses/state-union-2021_en)
earlier on the day the new Asian alliance was announced. France may be
pushing autonomy, but whether the rest of the European bloc has an
appetite for it --- and for creating greater distance from Washington
--- is uncertain. "France could end up isolating itself," said Mr. Speck
of the German Marshall Fund, noting that in nearly every region where
France has security concerns --- including Russia, the Sahel and even
the Indo-Pacific --- the United States continues to be a critical
partner. [There are **deeper questions about America's future
reliability as a security partner,** especially if the conflict with
China turns kinetic,]{.underline} which is part of Mr. Macron's
argument, Mr. Lesser acknowledged. ["For all the U.S. commitment to
Europe, if things go wrong in the Indo-Pacific, that would change the
force structure in Europe **pretty fast."**]{.underline} In Poland, a
strong American ally in the European Union and NATO, the reaction to the
new alliance was more positive, focusing not on a pivot away from Europe
"but on the U.S., with the British and the Australians, getting serious
about China and also defending the free world," said Michal Baranowski,
who heads the German Marshall Fund office in Poland. At the same time,
he said, Poles see another case where the supposedly professional,
pro-European Biden administration "again doesn't consult and shoves
European allies under the bus," he said. "This time the French, but for
us, it was Nord Stream 2, when we were thrown under the bus for
Germany," he said. That was a reference to Mr. Biden's decision to allow
the completion of a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany,
bypassing Ukraine and Poland, that was a priority for European
powerhouse Berlin. "[The U.S. will say again that 'We're building strong
alliances]{.underline}, with Germany and Australia,'" Mr. Baranowski
said. **["But who suffers? Other allies."]{.underline}**

**[AT: INB---Populism Turn---2AC]{.underline}**

**European Defense spending causes populism spread**

**Fay 17**, Director of Defense and Foreign Policy Studies @ Niskan
(Matthew, also cites Andrea Gilli, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford
University's Center for International Security and Cooperation, "THE
PROBLEM WITH EUROPE PAYING ITS DEFENSE BILLS," *Niskan Center*,
<https://niskanencenter.org/blog/problem-europe-paying-defense-bills/>)

The European Union is also unlikely to force member states into a
cooperation arrangement, according to Gilli. Given the rise of
nationalist populist parties across Europe, any such assertion of power
from Brussels will likely create a greater backlash. The two reasons
Gilli notes for the inability of European states to increase defense
spending also raise another question: should the United States want
European states to do so? Writing at the end of the Cold War, political
scientist John [Mearsheimer warned that a Europe free from superpower
domination would return to its **recurrent patterns of interstate
warfare.** Europe's major states would be forced to **pay for their own
defense** absent American and Soviet security guarantees. To convince
domestic populations to support investment in military
capabilities---likely at the expense of welfare spending---state leaders
would likely **lean on nationalist rhetoric** and policies.]{.underline}
According to Mearsheimer, [the reason they have not had to do so was
because the American "pacifier" has remained]{.underline} in place even
after the superpower standoff in Europe ended. An [American withdrawal
as an effort to induce greater defense spending in Europe might lead to
the empowerment of the very **nationalist populist parties** that would
like to see the European Union **dismantled**. The disintegration of
Europe---coupled with increased spending on military capabilities by its
largest states]{.underline}---[could lead to the return of security
competition and the dilemmas inherent in it.]{.underline} Meanwhile,
[smaller states---Estonia just being one example]{.underline}---[unable
to invest sufficiently in]{.underline} their own [defense will be
subject to manipulation and domination]{.underline} by the continent's
major powers. So the question of [whether the Trump administration
should consider withholding defense]{.underline} of America's European
[to encourage them to "pay their bills" hinges on]{.underline} two
things: [whether they can, and if so, whether doing so is worth
potentially undermining the peaceful integration of Europe]{.underline}.

heightens escalation risks**

'

[Leaders who rise to power in lower-probability scenarios
are]{.underline} also [likely to have a greater appetite for risk in
foreign affairs]{.underline}. This matters, as Jeff Colgan notes: \"risk
tolerance leads to aggression in international affairs because it
increases the perceived payoff of risky gambles.\" 17 [Populist leaders
more closely resemble revolutionaries than more established
politicians]{.underline}. [And]{.underline} as Colgan warns, \"[the
ambition]{.underline} of revolutionary leaders also **[contributes to
aggression]{.underline}**. [Ambition makes it more likely that a leader
will reject the status quo internationally as well as
domestically]{.underline}.\" 18 [We can see this kind of ambition on
display among elected populists]{.underline}. Hugo Chávez \[\*30\]
persistently proposed radical alternatives to the Washington Consensus.
One longtime friend of Viktor Orbán noted, \"he has always wanted to
upset the status quo, to become a change-maker.\" 19 Orbán himself, in a
meeting with Polish Law and Justice Party head Jaroslaw Kaczynski,
proposed a \"cultural counter-revolution\" in Europe. 20 Donald Trump\'s
inaugural address categorically rejected the postwar liberal order,
arguing in favor of an \"America First\" approach to international
relations. [Populists are therefore more likely to pursue high-risk,
revisionist foreign policies]{.underline}. [Populist
leaders]{.underline} also care about recognition by others, and [will be
quick to anger]{.underline} if that recognition is not forthcoming.
Populists build their legitimacy on their support from \"their\" people,
but part of that support comes from displays of dominance over others.
Russian president Vladimir Putin is well-known for his over-the-top
efforts to look strong and powerful. These range from his shirtless
photos to videos of him weightlifting to scoring eight goals in an
exhibition game with former NHL All-Stars. 21 In Erdogan\'s first two
years as Turkey\'s president, the government has prosecuted more than
1,800 cases of Turkish citizens insulting him\--including a former Miss
Turkey. 22 Donald Trump has insulted anyone who has criticized him since
he started running for president, ranging from erstwhile GOP rivals to
federal judges to media outlets to a former Miss Universe to Meryl
Streep. When dealing with domestic rivals and critics, such displays of
dominance are an easy strategy for elected leaders to pursue. Populist
leaders engage in such behavior to project their strength and mastery
over the political fates. It is tricky to do this on the international
stage, however. [Populist leaders will]{.underline} therefore [be more
concerned than most politicians about]{.underline} the personal
[respect]{.underline} afforded to them by others. At the international
level, this leads to one of two outcomes: recognition by other heads of
state, or a denunciation of leaders who fail to confer such recognition.
If [populists]{.underline} cannot exploit the respect conferred by
others, they [will be quick to reject and delegitimize the leaders who
spurn them]{.underline}. We can see this kind of pattern at work in how
populist leaders have reacted to setbacks on the global stage. Vladimir
Putin began his tenure in office with a much warmer attitude towards the
West. During the first decade of this century, however, Putin lost an
ally during Ukraine\'s Orange Revolution, and witnessed NATO expanding
to Russia\'s borders. It was at this point that Putin began adopting a
more hostile attitude towards the West. After President Obama cancelled
a meeting with Duterte, the Filipino president responded with a series
of tirades insulting the American president. 23 In Trump\'s first week
as president, he faced pushback from the \[\*31\] Mexican president
Enrique Peña Nieto on his policies for the southern border. In response,
Trump tweeted that Peña Nieto should not bother coming to Washington.
The Mexican president responded by canceling his visit. Populists do not
possess a monopoly on anger in politics, but most populists tend to
project anger as part of their leadership style. Based on their pathway
to power and their philosophy of governance, it should not be surprising
that they are commonly associated with that emotion. As previously
noted, populist parties do particularly well after financial crises.
They are adept at exploiting the (often justified) anger that voters
possess towards authorities that were in charge when the crisis
happened. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage warned of \"political anger\"
if the United Kingdom did not follow through on Brexit. In a press
conference blasting the United States, Duterte said, \"If you Americans
are angry with me, then I am also angry with you.\" 24 During one of the
GOP primary debates, Donald Trump explicitly stated, \"I will gladly
accept the mantle of anger.\" Trump famously refuses to apologize when
he makes controversial or problematic statements. 25 Numerous press
reports suggest that Trump lost his temper with the Australian prime
minister in their first phone conversation. [This wave of populist anger
reverses a centuries-long western effort to contain that emotion in
international relations]{.underline}. 26 Recent scholarship on emotions
in world politics suggest that [sustained levels of anger carry risks in
world politics.]{.underline} Anger was valorized in societies with
strong honor cultures and warrior castes, biologically conditioning
citizens towards that feeling. Furthermore, as Neta Crawford notes,
\"[threats that evoke anger]{.underline} (if they are associated with
perceived insults) tend to [**decrease** the perception of a threat and
simultaneously **heighten risk-taking** behaviors on the part of those
who feel angry]{.underline}.\" 27 This is particularly true if populist
leaders find ways to institutionalize anger and resentment through new
laws, executive orders, or bureaucratic structures. [This tendency
towards angry rhetoric can be exaggerated through misperception and
mistranslation]{.underline}. Conventional foreign policy leaders are
prepped to stay within the lanes of \"accepted\" diplomatic discourse,
so that observers can detect subtle shifts in phrasing as a foreign
policy signal. In contrast, populists scorn diplomatic language as
exercises in sophistry and hypocrisy. They rely on language designed to
appeal to their base, which increases the likelihood that outside
observers misconstrue their words. [Angry tirades from
leaders]{.underline} like Trump, Duterte, or Iran\'s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
have been mistranslated\--and usually in a direction that \[\*32\]
[paints the leader as more bellicose than intended]{.underline}. 28
[Populist leaders will be reluctant to correct such
misperceptions]{.underline}, because that would require them to engage
in the diplomatic discourse they have derided. Displays of righteous
indignation might play well with a populist leader\'s domestic base. The
international effect of angry outbursts, however, is to narrow the zone
of cooperation between countries. If a leader unleashes an angry tirade
against another country, that is sure to gain considerable public
attention in both nations. This automatically raises the \"audience
costs\" for both leaders. The larger the audience that is paying
attention to any dispute, the greater the political costs a leader can
suffer if they back down in that dispute. 29 Displays of temper make it
harder for the populist to compromise, but it will also make it more
politically difficult for the object of the tirade to make any
concessions. Through effects on leaders and populations, [provocations
make negotiations more costly and conflict escalation more
likely]{.underline}. 30 Perhaps the most important intellectual trait
that populist leaders share is their tendency to think like hedgehogs.
According to the classical Greek poet Archilochus, \"a fox knows many
things, but a hedgehog one important thing.\" Isaiah Berlin popularized
that quote, arguing that intellectuals could be divided into foxes and
hedgehogs. This works for decision-makers as well. Foxes will possess
the necessary metacognition to adapt to new facts and new circumstances;
hedgehogs will rely on their core beliefs, fitting the world into their
preexisting worldview. 31 Populists are hedgehogs: the one big thing
that they know is to reject the elites and technocrats who heretofore
governed their country. As Philip Tetlock observed more than a decade
ago, foxes and hedgehogs have different strengths when it comes to
thinking about the world. 32 Foxes are much better than hedgehogs in
their predictive accuracy about world events; simply put, foxes are
better at incorporating new information and updating how they think
about the world. Hedgehogs are better than foxes at anticipating big and
unexpected events happening in the world, such as the collapse of the
Soviet Union, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the 2008 financial crisis.
Anticipating those events requires an assuredness about the way the
world works that hedgehogs are more likely to possess. The effects of
these different intellectual styles on foreign policy are
straightforward. As hedgehogs, [populists are more likely to have their
expectations confounded in world politics]{.underline}. At the same
time, [populist foreign policy leaders will face psychological and
domestic political barriers to admitting error or reversing a failing
policy]{.underline}. Any public recognition of a misstep demonstrates a
leader\'s fallibility\--which is problematic for leaders \[\*33\] who
claim that they can divine the general will of the people. At the same
time, as hedgehogs, populists will be reluctant to take any action that
deviates from the way that they think the world works. Stepping back, we
can proffer some tentative predictions of how populist foreign policy
leaders will behave in the coming years. [Populist foreign policy
leaders are likely to reject the pre-existing liberal international
order and espouse]{.underline} a strong form of [ethnic
nationalism]{.underline}. They might try to create alternative
international arrangements to the status quo, but these efforts are
likely to be Potemkin efforts, with more pomp and circumstance than
substance. [Populist leaders will have greater appetites for risk and
ambition on the global stage]{.underline}. These heads of state will
crave recognition from their fellow world leaders, and be quick to anger
if they are spurned in this area. These displays of anger could become
institutionalized and will increase the audience costs of all the
involved actors, making cooperation less likely. And [populists are less
likely to correctly perceive how the world works]{.underline}, and more
likely to hold firm with policies that are not viewed as working
terribly well. [One disturbing conclusion to draw from this particular
constellation of traits is that populist leaders are more likely to
foment international crises]{.underline}. [Breaking with pre-existing
global governance structures can **guarantee a crisis
escalation**]{.underline}. [An international crisis can trigger
**rally-round-the flag** effects]{.underline} within the domestic
population and make it easier for a leader to suppress domestic dissent.
At the extreme, [one could envision populists threatening or launching
diversionary wars to appeal to a nationalist base in times of
trouble]{.underline}. Vladimir Putin employed this tactic. In early
2014, he was still reeling from protests over his return to the Russian
presidency, and a slowdown in the Russian economy. He responded by
annexing the Crimea after the fall of his ally in Ukraine, and
bankrolling a secessionist conflict in Eastern Ukraine. These efforts
caused his public support to skyrocket even though the Russian economy
contracted in 2014 and 2015. It should be stressed that these are all
probabilistic statements. Many of these traits are hardly unique to
populists; other heads of state are likely to display some subset of
these leadership traits. Still, [this combination of]{.underline}
\[\*34\] [attributes suggest that the world is **experiencing an
increase in the number of revisionist, risky, and violent actions in
world politics.**]{.underline}

**Some examples of specific parties**

**Fay 17** - Director of Defense and Foreign Policy Studies @ Niskan
(Matthew, "THE PROBLEM WITH EUROPE PAYING ITS DEFENSE BILLS," *Niskan
Center*,
<https://niskanencenter.org/blog/problem-europe-paying-defense-bills/>)

Writing at the Washington Post's "Monkey Cage" blog, Andrea [Gilli---a
postdoctoral fellow at Stanford]{.underline} University's Center for
International Security and Cooperation---[identifies some of the
domestic barriers to European states investing in their militaries.
Gilli names]{.underline} three main [constraints]{.underline} on the
ability of European states to balance, but two of them are particularly
important. [The first is the inability of many European states to
contribute financially to their own defense. Some European states simply
do not have large enough economies to adequately invest in military
capabilities]{.underline}. Gilli notes that Estonia is one of the few
European countries to meet the minimum standard of defense spending for
NATO member states---two percent of gross domestic product---but that
still only amounts to \$500 million in defense expenditure. [Larger
states have greater financial resources to invest, but they are tied up
in welfare programs]{.underline}. As Gilli writes, [\[C\]utting welfare
state provisions in Europe to fund defense expenditures is going to be
extremely difficult, if not counterproductive]{.underline}. On the one
hand, [those who receive these benefits are far more numerous, and thus
politically more influential, than those receiving a direct benefit from
military spending]{.underline}. On the other, [**cuts in welfare
spending risk actually bringing additional support to anti-establishment
parties** like the Five Stars Movement in Italy, Die Linke in Germany or
Podemos in Spain --- all of which have strong anti-defense
stances]{.underline}. It is possible European states could combine their
military capabilities, but as Gilli argues, that option is also
problematic. He notes, [With Europe's limited funds to spend on defense,
large cooperative projects will be difficult to launch]{.underline}. In
the past, countries in Europe abandoned cooperative projects because of
their negative domestic implications for jobs, technological know-how or
military exports. [In an age of austerity, amid a refugee crisis and
high youth unemployment, this mind-set is unlikely to change anytime
soon]{.underline}. And [some countries may have little interest in
cooperation.]{.underline} [They may operate in completely different
environments --- Mediterranean vs. North Sea, for example. Or they
perceive a different strategic threat at home]{.underline} --- think
Russia vs. the Islamic State. [Some countries may even have a strategic
interest in leaving unaddressed some capability gaps --- to compel
proximate allies to come to their defense]{.underline}. This was
Finland's military strategy during the Cold War.

**Increased defense spending mobilizes populist voters**

**[Right-wing populist parties in the EU are broadly
nationalist]{.underline}**, sovereignist, and Euroskeptic (Mudde, 2007;
Vasilopoulou, 2018). But while these **[parties sharply oppose
supranationalism and the EU\'s broader integrative
trajectory,]{.underline}** it is less clear whether their anti-EU
sentiment extends to other forms of institutionalized cooperation, and
in particular to coordination or collaboration with other EU member
states on defense.12 We argue that **[populist parties are likely to
constrain European defense cooperation]{.underline}** under the
following two conditions: First, **[populist parties hold strong
anti-EU, anti-globalization, and anti-establishment sentiment and a more
general skepticism over the merits of international
cooperation.]{.underline}** If these preferences are given clear
precedence over national security interests or concerns, **[we are
unlikely to see these parties engage in defense
cooperation]{.underline}**. This form of **[populist challenge to
European defense cooperation may come from either right-wing or
left-wing parties.]{.underline}** While left-wing populist parties
highlight economic anxieties and grievances, right-wing populist parties
**[emphasize threats to national identity, culture, and
sovereignty]{.underline}** (De Vries & Edwards, 2009). They also often
mix populism with nationalism (Camus & Lebourg, 2017). These nationalist
sentiments are likely to stoke intra-EU divisions and constrain defense
cooperation. Second, [European defense is presented as an issue that
populist parties may use to mobilize the mass public**, polarize the
electorate, and win votes.**]{.underline} In other words, populist
parties **[politicize European defense issues for electoral
purposes.]{.underline}** According to De Vries et al. (2021), **[two key
elements lead to the politicization of international cooperation: public
discontent about existing forms of international cooperation and the
mobilization of this discontent by political
entrepreneurs.]{.underline}** Since most mainstream parties have not
politicized European defense cooperation, **[populist parties may
perceive an incentive and opportunity to mobilize opposition on this
issue to attract new voters,]{.underline}** and often in tandem with
anti-immigrant and nationalist messages (Hobolt & De Vries, 2015).

**[AT: INB---Populism Turn---Populism Low]{.underline}**

**Opposition parties are uniting to remove populist leaders.**

**Meyer '22** \[Brett; 6 Jan; Research Fellow; Tony Blair Institute for
Global Change, "A Playbook Against Populism? Populist Leadership in
Decline in 2021,"
https://institute.global/policy/playbook-against-populism-populist-leadership-decline-2021\]

In our annual update to our Populists in Power database, **[we find that
the number of populist leaders in power at the beginning of 2022 is down
from 17 at the beginning of 2021 to 13 -- the lowest since
2004]{.underline}**. Three of the four populist leaders who lost power
were less ideological anti-establishment populists, meaning that the
remaining populists are almost all culturally right wing.

**[Two common factors appear to have contributed to this significant
fall]{.underline}** in the number of populist leaders. First, **[the
pandemic may have reminded the public of the importance of seriousness
and expertise in policymaking]{.underline}**. **[Countries with populist
leaders around the world had higher Covid-19 case and death rates than
those without populist leaders, and populist leaders in Europe have seen
a sustained dip in their polling popularity relative to more
conventional parties]{.underline}** throughout the pandemic.

Second, **[unusually broad opposition coalitions have emerged to depose
populist incumbents. Historically divided opposition parties adopted a
narrow focus in their election campaigns to remove the populist
leader]{.underline}**. This happened in three out of four populist
losses in 2021. **[We also see evidence of opposition parties following
this "playbook" in countries where populist leaders are facing elections
in 2022.]{.underline}**

The danger posed by populism lies in the damage leaders can do to the
norms and institutions of liberal democracy. However, we find that,
**[in most of the cases where populist leaders lost power last year,
there is limited evidence that key norms such as a free press, an
independent judiciary and the peaceful transfer of power have been
obviously weakened]{.underline}**. That said, elections in the coming
years in countries where populist governments have invoked more radical
reform to entrench their positions give less cause for optimism.

Finally, if the formation of broad coalitions provides an emerging
playbook for fighting populism, it's important to examine how stable
these coalitions are once in power. The danger is that, because the
opposition parties have such substantive policy disagreements, they will
prove unable to hold power for long, potentially threatening a reversal.
To avoid instability, these coalitions should focus on a limited
programme of reforms targeted at shoring up institutions against future
populist threats.

The experience of the past four years shows that **[countries with
populist leaders aren't sentenced to autocracy]{.underline}**. But while
**[the wave of early 21st-century populism appears to have
peaked]{.underline}**, it will be some time before we can conclude that
liberal democracy is no longer under threat.

for a panel of 35 non-OECD countries over 1988--2019. A multivariate
regression model based on the augmented production function is used to
achieve the objective of the study. The panel autoregressive distributed
lag (ARDL)/pooled mean group (PMG) technique is employed, while, in
addition the robust least squares and fixed-effect estimators are
implemented for the robustness of the results. **[This study found a
clear negative effect of military spending on economic
growth.]{.underline}** The pairwise Dumitrescu Hurlin panel causality

and economic growth. Overall, these **[estimates provide strong support
that military expenditure is not beneficial rather detrimental to
economic growth.]{.underline}** **[The empirical findings of this study
suggest that policymakers need to redesign the military budget to
stimulate economic growth and improve social welfare.]{.underline}**

The assessment of the economic and social effects of military
expenditure remains an interesting desirable area of research. The
ultimate objectives of underdeveloped and developed countries are to
achieve sustainable economic growth and prosperity in the long-run.
There is a substantial volume of literature about the economic
consequences of military expenditure; however, no consensus has been
developed, whether military spending is beneficial or detrimental to
economic growth. Military spending according to the Keynesian approach
is a component of government consumption, which stimulates economic
growth by expanding demand for goods and services. Military spending
affects economic growth through many channels. When aggregate demand is
lower relative to prospective supply, rises in military spending tend to
enlarge capacity utilization, raise profits, and consequently, enhance
investment and aggregate output ([Faini et al.,
1984](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib33)).
Several prior studies have drawn findings that support the Keynesian
military view of the positive influence of military expenditure on
national output ([Benoit,
1978](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib17); [Khalid
and Noor,
2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib45); [Raju
and Ahmed,
2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib63)). In
a study conducted by [Lobont et al.
(2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib51), it
is ascertained that military spending has several positive effects on
capital, labor, growth, and the effectual use of available resources in
the economy as a whole.

The focus of academicians, researchers, and developmental economists for
peace economics are useable as military spending is one of the main
concerns of countries, regardless of their development status. According
to conventional logic, **[the military formulation is an economic
encumbrance]{.underline}**. **[While comparatively more resources are
devoted to military formulations, and lesser proportion is left for
investment in the education and technology sectors, which play a vital
role in the economic growth process and provide a broader base for
socio-economic development]{.underline}**. Generally, it is believed
that in the insecure region, **[each country deliberately allocates an
uneven share of its meager economic resources to "unproductive" military
expenditure]{.underline}**. In the absenteeism of international
collaboration to minimize political pressure, military expenditures can
be driven more and more across a region as each country goes beyond its
neighbors to safeguard its security, raise the level of regional
military expenditure and bring little rise or even a decline in the
security of all. However**[, there are two direct and interconnected
ways by which higher military expenditure may unfavorably affect
long-run economic growth]{.underline}**. First, **[military spending
upsurge may diminish the total accumulation of existing resources
available for other domestic usages such as investment in prolific
capital, education, and market-oriented technological
enhancement]{.underline}**. Second, **[high military expenditure can
intensify misrepresentations that condense the efficiency of resource
distribution]{.underline}**, thereby **[diminishing the total yield
factor]{.underline}**2.

Military expenditure tends to attenuate productivity because more funds
diversion to **[military expenditure causes the government to either
increase taxes or get loans from the foreign capital market to balance
its budget]{.underline}**. The second alternative **[is therefore
primarily harmful to economic prosperity]{.underline}**, since **[it
escalates the rate of interest, decreases investment and consumer
demand, and drives economic growth sluggish]{.underline}** (Russett,
1969; Borch and Wallace, 2010). In a similar vein, some other studies
including Lim (1983) noted that **[military expenses are harmful to the
growth of any economy.]{.underline}** Even, a study by Dunne (2000)
focusing on the Keynesian framework reveals that military spending has
no influence on growth at best, but most **[probably has an inverse
effect]{.underline}**; obviously, **[there is no indication of a
positive influence of military burden on economic growth]{.underline}**.
This implies that disarmament certainly offers a prospect for augmented
economic performance.

Despite the voluminous empirical studies on the military-growth
connection, the empirical findings are still inconclusive6. The
discussion in the present literature on the influence of military
spending opened with the seminal work of Benoit (1978) which opined that
military spending and growth have a positive correlation. Afterward,
many studies are continuously performed to empirically verify the
relationship between these variables by using different models,
estimation techniques, set of countries, and data period. Several other
studies support the positive effect of defense spending including
Atesoglu (2002), who observed that there exists a significantly positive
association in military outlays and aggregate output in the case of the
United States from 1947:2--2000:2. The empirical analysis of the study
by Yildirim et al. (2005) found that military spending boosts national
income in the Middle Eastern countries and Turkey over 1989--99. Narayan
and Singh (2007) empirically verified that defense expenses Granger
causes exports, and exports Granger causes national income (GDP),
indicating that defense spending indirectly Granger causes national
income in the short-run for Fiji over 1970--01. According to Borch and
Wallace (2010), higher levels of military expenditure are better
prepared to stave off the harmful influences of an economic slump than
states with lower levels of military spending in the 49 U.S. states
during 1977--04. Malizard (2010) observed two-way causality between
military spending and growth in France during 1960--08. Findings of
Farzanegan (2014) study supported the positive impact of the military
outlay on growth in Iran during 1959--07. Khalid and Noor (2018)
concluded that military spending has a positive relationship with growth
in sixty-seven developing economies during 2002--10.

On the other hand, some **[prior studies]{.underline}**, for
example, [Faini et al.
(1984)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib33) **[detected
that a greater military burden is related to sluggish
growth]{.underline}** for 69 countries during 1952--70, whereas **[a
rise of 10% military spending leads to a decrease of annual economic
growth by 0.13%]{.underline}**. [Deger
(1986)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib23) revealed
that overall the direct and indirect effects of military expenditure
will dampen growth rate and impede development in a panel of 50
developing economies during 1965--73. The author suggested that
empirical indication goes against the conclusions of Benoit and others
about the positive impact of military outlay on growth in less-developed
economies. [[Abu-Bader and Abu-Qarm
(2003)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib2)** found
that military expenditure hampers economic growth, but civilian expenses
have a positive impact on growth for Egypt, Israel, and
Syria**]{.underline} (1975--98), (1967--98), and (1973--98)
respectively. **[The empirical findings]{.underline}** of [Klein
(2004)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib46) **[reveal]{.underline}**
that overall **[the military outlay has a negative influence on the
growth]{.underline}** rate of Peru over 1970--96. [Chang et al.
(2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib20) found
that **[military expenditure leads to deleterious growth for low-income
countries]{.underline}** in the whole sample of 90 countries during
1992--06. [D\'Agostino et al.
(2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib32) observed
a significantly negative effect of military spending on growth in 83
countries from OECD over 1970--14. [Saba and Ngepah
(2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib65) examined
the causal link between military spending and economic growth for 35
African countries over 1990--15. The authors found that (i) no causal
link in seven countries; (ii) one-way causality from military spending
to growth in two countries; (iii) one-way link from growth one-way in 14
countries; and (iv) two-ways link in 12 countries. Overall, the GMM
estimates reveal that **[military spending has a significant negative
effect on economic growth]{.underline}** in Africa.

Similarly, other studies provide evidence of mixed results on the
economic effects of military expenses on growth, for example, the study
of [Frederiksen and Looney
(1982)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib37) divided
the economies into financial resource restrained and unrestrained groups
over 1960--78. The findings revealed that enhanced military expenditures
promoted growth in the unrestrained group, but a small visible impact
was found in resource-constrained countries. In a study on three North
American countries namely Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. during
1963--05, [Bremmer and Kesselring
(2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib19) found
that enhanced military expenditure promotes nominal GDP in Canada and
Mexico, while it declines the growth in nominal GDP in the U.S. [Aye
et al.
(2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib8) observed
no Granger causal association between military outlay and growth for
South Africa during 1951--10. However, by using the bootstrap rolling
window estimation approach, the study finds two ways Granger causality
in different subsamples. The results of [Chang et al.
(2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib21) supported
the neutrality hypothesis for France, Germany, and Italy, while, the
military expenditure--growth hampering hypothesis for Canada and the UK,
and unidirectional Granger causality running from national income to
military outlay for China. Moreover, the results supported the
feedback[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#fn7) between
military spending and national income in the case of Japan and the U.S.
over 1988--10. Using the "Hendry General-to-Specific modeling"
methodology, the study of [Abdel-Khalek et al.
(2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib1) fails
to find any causal linkages between military spending and economic
growth in India over 1980--16. Some more related empirical studies are
given
in [Table 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/table/tbl1/).

Several empirical studies are available on the relationship between
military spending and economic growth, but their empirical findings are
yet inconclusive. Undeniably, the economic effect of military
expenditure is an essential issue for the developing world. Therefore,
this research work aims to determine empirically the impact of military
expenditure along with some other control variables on the growth, for a
set of thirty-five countries from non-OECD over 1988--19. According to
the nature of the data, the widely used panel unit tests are employed to
check the order of integration of each variable. The results are found
mixed (i.e., I(0), and I(1)) based on stationarity, and thus, the panel
ARDL/PMG approach is applied. Afterward, the panel robust least squares
and fixed-effect estimators are also employed as analytical techniques
for parameters' estimation to affirm the results, and the Dumitrescu
--Hurlin Granger causality test is employed to find the direction of
causality between the variables.

**[The empirical results of all the methods suggest that military
spending and economic growth have a strong inverse
relationship]{.underline}**, suggesting that **[encouraging military
expenditure is not a good option because it discourages economic
growth.]{.underline}** Moreover, the Dumitrescu--Hurlin Granger
causality test exposes bidirectional causal nexus between military
expenses and economic growth in the sample countries. The bidirectional
causal linkage between military spending and growth though exhibits a
degree of interdependence between military spending and economic growth
policy objectives. Thus, **[the execution of economic growth policies
should not be given more primacy over the military burden while other
than military expenditure factors shall be considered.]{.underline}**

Overall, [**the empirical results validated that military spending is
undesirable for national economic development. The results of the
significantly negative effect of military spending on national income go
against the results obtained by **[Benoit
(1978)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib17)]{.underline},
and others who claim that military expenditure positively contributes to
the aggregate output, while, consistent with the findings by [Dunne and
Tian
(2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib29) for
106 countries over 1988--10, Dunne and Tian concluded that "These
results do seem to provide valuable robustness checks and support
strongly the view that military spending hurts growth" (p.29). The
findings of the present study are technically and statistically
acceptable and plausible for frontwards policy recommendation purposes.

From these findings, **[the unequivocal negative effect of military
spending on economic growth]{.underline}** indicates that non-OECD
countries are developing countries with scarce resources, and these
**[economies can\'t afford military spending]{.underline}**, while when
these economies grow, governments can contemplate rising its military
spending to strengthen its military power. **[Enlarged military spending
can\'t be used to boost economic growth]{.underline}** in the non-OECD
countries, since any positive impacts it would have on the economic
growth through augmented demand, modernization, and resource outset,
would have overwhelmed by the damaging effects on economic growth
through reduced investment. **[Policymakers should thus leave military
spending for security objectives only and restructuring public resources
from the military sector toward civilian
objectives]{.underline}**[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#fn8).
Likewise, policymakers should focus on rationalizing their budget
spending more on improving social welfare. Furthermore, incremental
efforts are required to adopt an effective and prudent policy to further
encourage growth, while shrinkage in military spending can largely
benefit the economies. Therefore, **[military expenditures need to be
reduced]{.underline}** while expenditures on other developmental sectors
including health and education sectors to be increased.

The [Euro]{.underline}pean [debt crisis started as a small local policy
shock in Greece, but it has come to threaten the survival of the euro
with potentially far reaching consequences for the world
economy]{.underline}. Since December 2011 financial markets have
stabilized somewhat, but [**fundamental issues** remain
**unsolved**.]{.underline} This crisis is due partly to fundamental
economic developments, such as growth and competitiveness, and partly to
uncooperative behavior between the main policy makers in Europe. One of
the paradoxes of this crisis is that, despite all its problems, the euro
has remained relatively firm in its internal (inflation) and external
value (exchange rate). Financial markets may be concerned with some
parts of the euro area, mainly in the south, but they still see the euro
as a major currency in the world. However, the euro will only maintain
this role if European governments can get the sovereign debt crisis
under control. Whatever the ultimate conclusion of the drama, the
experience has shown that [Europe needs a much tighter form of economic
governance if it wants to live up to the ambition of providing the
world\'s alternative reserve currency]{.underline}. While a series of
events has progressively deepened the European debt crisis, it is
important to distinguish between sudden shocks and underlying
[**fundamental problems** in Europe's economic governance]{.underline}.
Their interaction has been the specific flavor of this crisis. There are
two views to the European debt crisis. For the "fundamentalists", the
debt crisis is caused by the lack of discipline in sticking to the
principles of "a sound and competitive macroeconomic base and solid
public finance" (Weidmann 2001). Hence, the remedy is to implement
"painful reforms" and consolidate budgets, which would rebuild trust and
confidence in financial markets (Issing 2009). For the "monetarists",
the European debt crisis is a liquidity crisis. [A small local liquidity
shock causes a sudden deterioration in a specific class of asset values,
can cause a **global** systemic **financial crisis**]{.underline} when
the need for liquidity spills over to banks that then get distressed
because the deteriorating asset prices put their balance sheets into
difficulties and reduce bank capital (Chacko et al. 2011). In this case,
a crisis can be stopped by a lender of last resort that provides the
necessary liquidity and stops the crisis from turning into a default
avalanche.

[The trade and investment links between the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and the European Union]{.underline} (EU) [are
significant. Europe consumes twenty percent of U.S. exports and holds
more than 50 percent of U.S. overseas assets,]{.underline} while the
United States holds close to 40 percent of Europe's foreign assets.
[Lower growth and higher volatility in Europe could therefore have
serious consequences for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[hindering export growth and endangering assets]{.underline}. Europe has
already shown itself to be the laggard in the global recovery---in the
first quarter, European GDP was up only 0.3 percent (y/y), compared to
2.5 percent in the United States and 11.9 percent in China---and the
situation may well get worse before it gets better.

IMGXYZ5032IMGZYXThe crisis will likely lead the euro to depreciate
further in the coming months. The euro has already fallen more than 20
percent against the dollar since late November---two months before Obama
unveiled his goal of doubling exports in the next five years---and it
may fall to parity. In sectors where U.S. and European exports overlap
(e.g., aircraft, machinery, professional services), a lower euro will
hinder the competitiveness of U.S. goods on the global market. The
depreciation will also reduce the purchasing power of European tourists
traveling to the United States and make European goods relatively
cheaper in U.S. markets at a time when policy makers are hoping to avoid
a return to high current account deficits. [With imports likely to rise
and exports likely to fall, the U.S. bilateral trade balance with Europe
will likely deteriorate.]{.underline} By definition, the profitability
of U.S. companies operating in Europe will be affected by the Euro
crisis when profits and assets on the balance sheets are expressed in
dollars. U.S. companies selling in Europe and sourcing in dollars will
see even sharper profit declines, though U.S. companies selling into the
dollar area and sourcing in Europe will benefit.

Despite the negative effects a weaker euro would have on U.S. job
creation, [the most important consequences of]{.underline} the [Euro
crisis in the United States will operate through financial and, more
specifically, banking channels]{.underline}. Though the exposure
of [U.S.
banks](http://carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=40707) to
the most vulnerable countries in Europe is limited to \$176 billion, or
5 percent of their total foreign exposure, their indirect linkages to
these countries, which operate through all of the international banks,
are much larger. Not surprisingly, European banks hold large amounts of
their own countries' bonds and, according to a recent World Bank report,
these holdings exceed reserves in some instances. [A string of bank
failures in Europe could well **trigger** another global credit

Ideological incoherence is the main threat to the Western alliance, but
a close second can be found in the West's imperial center---the U.S. And
here, again, we return to Trump. The essence of his complaint about
Europe was not simply that it was not contributing enough; it was that
he didn't really believe in the U.S.-led order itself. [Trump believed
the whole structure was unfair to the U.S.: Why should it shoulder most
of the burden of policing the world? But the thing with
orders---liberal, "rules-based," or any other---is that they need
ordering,]{.underline} and [this is the job of the hegemon.]{.underline}
Burdens can be better shared, and Europe can do more to free America for
its contest with China, but [ultimately the U.S. either **guarantees**
European security or **it doesn't**]{.underline}**.**

[Biden will]{.underline} undoubtedly [speak a familiar language to
European leaders---one of liberal values and the defense of democracy,
and that will be comforting to them]{.underline}. But the question that
nevertheless troubles European politicians, diplomats, and officials is
whether instead of Trump being an eccentric one-off, his instinctive
antagonism to the obligations of global leadership represents a trend in
American public opinion more generally. [The question that follows is
whether the U.S. has the political will to be the hegemonic power it has
been since the end of the Second World War, **the basis on which the
Western world functions.**]{.underline}

As one former NATO insider put it to me, [the alliance's strength is its
strategic capability, and this is possible only because **the U.S.
dominates it**]{.underline}. An alliance of lots of similar-size states
would not be the same: It would be the European Union---a worthwhile
political and trade bloc, but not a capable military grouping. What
happens if Washington decides it no longer wants the role of leader?

One somewhat counterintuitive conclusion from the past 20 years is that,
if anything, [America's relative dominance over Europe has grown, not
declined]{.underline}. After the financial crash, [it was the Federal
Reserve that stepped in to become the global lender of last resort,
while Europe descended into a set of rolling crises]{.underline}. [The
fundamentals of U.S. economic strength remain
**extraordinary**]{.underline}: the dollar, Silicon Valley, America's
universities, Wall Street. Europe lags behind on all of these, and
Germany's sudden commitment to additional defense spending will do
little to bridge the yawning security gap.

The reality is that [the West functions as an American-led alliance, but
it is not clear that Europe entirely agrees on America's principal
strategic threats.]{.underline} Whether Trump returns to the White House
or Biden is the one who returns to some future NATO summit, there will
come a point when Europe and the U.S. must decide whether and how to
renew their alliance for the next challenge---be that Russia, or China,
or something else entirely. And if they do, [it will take far more than
a small uptick in defense spending and a change in energy policy to keep
them **united**]{.underline}**.**

**[Entrapment]{.underline}** could also **[result from transnational
ideological factors]{.underline}**. Driscoll and Maliniak (2016) suggest
that defenders like the **[United States get ensnared in conflicts
"where their national interests are not implicated" for reasons of
"issue slippage" (p. 593). This issue slippage occurs when the alliance
takes on additional purposes, losing sight even of its original purpose.
In the case of NATO, issue slippage ensued when the Soviet military
threat no longer existed and the alliance became instead a political
community based on liberal democratic values]{.underline}**.
Accordingly, an actual or **[potential ally can "position itself in the
imagination of liberal idealists in the West" to maximize external
support]{.underline}** (Driscoll & Maliniak, 2016, p. 594). Similarly,
Cooley and Nexon (2016, pp. 77--82) argue that foreign elites can forge
bonds of trust and friendship with American officials and politicians,
thereby **[eliciting more cooperation than what was strategically
warrante]{.underline}**d. The common mechanism underlying these
arguments is that the ally exploits some transnational connection via
elite networks. This **[connection often has an ideological character
since foreign elites play to the ideological prejudices of the defender
by professionalizing the national bureaucracy]{.underline}**,
highlighting religious and political affinities with the West,
**[contracting with lobbying firms in the defender's capital
city]{.underline}**, and developing embassy connections (Cooley & Nexon,
2016, pp. 88--94; Driscoll & Maliniak, 2016, p. 601). Sometimes they
**[might instead play on ethnic ties if those ties exist]{.underline}**.
The net effect is to make foreign policy-making in NATO capitals more
amenable to a state's particular interests. The **[mechanism
resembles]{.underline}** what Schimmelfennig (2003) calls **[rhetorical
action, which refers to the "strategic use and exchange of arguments to
persuade other actors to act according to one's
preference]{.underline}**s" (p. 5). By appealing to the ideological
sensibilities of the defender's elites, the ally can co-opt that
defender, thereby **[increasing the probability that the defender would

Concerns about a mismatch of goals could be overcome if coalition
participants are more confident in their ability to influence the
coalition's actions. [Potential participants could have concerns about
restraining any ally, but in a Baltic scenario, these concerns are
likely to be most acute with respect to the most powerful and leading

**[weaker states]{.underline}** [are thought to have **less leverage**
in the alliance and, therefore, greater concerns about entrapment by a
stronger ally like the United States.]{.underline}78 However, weaker
allies do have some ways to restrain more-powerful allies. First,
[longstanding **diplomatic and military relationships** among NATO
members mean that states might have **insight into their allies'

processes**]{.underline}.79 Second, [allies also have some sources of
leverage]{.underline} over a coalition leader, including the [**ability

or airspace]{.underline}.80 Such actions could [restrain a coalition
leader's behavior by affecting its ability to carry out operations,
**raising the costs** of a military action, or **undermining** the
domestic or international legitimacy of the operation.]{.underline} To
the extent that a coalition [leader values the support of its allies in
the longer term, threats of exit from the coalition or NATO itself could
**affect a coalition leader's decisionmaking**.]{.underline}81 There is
**[evidence]{.underline}** [that NATO allies **used NATO decisionmaking
structures** to restrain U.S. actions during the air war over
Kosovo]{.underline}. Wesley Clark, who was NATO's Supreme Allied
Commander, complained about the influence of NATO members on military
decisions, including campaign phasing and individual targeting.82 In a
now-famous incident at the Pristina airport, the [**British commander**
of NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps was able to leverage his chain of
command in London to **thwart Clark's plan** to block the airport
runway]{.underline} with helicopters---a move that the British commander
believed could have triggered a security incident between NATO and
Russia.83 Ultimately, concerns about constraints posed by NATO
structures in Kosovo contributed to the U.S. decision to form a
coalition of the willing for initial operations in Afghanistan in
2001.84 NATO members that do not participate could still face direct
Russian retaliation or other consequences. Given that possibility,
members who do not entirely support the aims of the operation might
still participate in order to seek greater influence over operational
decisions than they would have if they were on the outside.85 This logic
appears to have influenced France's decision to join NATO's air war over
Kosovo. French Secretary General for Defense and National Security Louis
Gautier argued that French participation in the operation meant that
France was "able in Kosovo to impose itself in the decisionmaking
process and affect strategy."86

[Conclusion]{.underline}

[American concerns about entangling]{.underline} [alliances]{.underline}
are as old as the Republic itself. [During the post--World War II
era]{.underline}, however, there have been [only five ostensible
episodes of U.S. entanglement,]{.underline} and even [these **cases are
questionable**. The case in]{.underline} [which alliance obligations had
the largest impact on U.S. decisionmaking]{.underline} (the 1995--96
Taiwan Strait crisis[) entailed minimal military action, and the case
that entailed the most military action (the Vietnam War) contained only
a **marginal role for alliance politics** in U.S.
decisionmaking.]{.underline} In the other three cases (the 1954--55
Taiwan Strait crisis and the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo), [both the
effect of alliance obligations on U.S. policy and the costs suffered by
U.S. forces **were moderate**. And beyond these cases,]{.underline}
entanglement was virtually nonexistent in U.S. foreign policy. Against
this limited evidence of entanglement are numerous cases in which
alliances restrained the United States. [Allies]{.underline}
[**dissuaded** the United States from **escalating the Korean War** and
crises in **Laos and Berlin**, and struggled in vain to **prevent** the
United States from entering or escalating other conflicts, the 2003
**Iraq War** being only the latest major example.]{.underline} Indeed,
instances of [alliance-induced **restraint are evident** even within the
five cases of entanglement discussed above:]{.underline} in the 1954--55
Taiwan Strait crisis, [concerns about **European alliances discouraged
U.S. policymakers** from **bombing the Chinese mainland**]{.underline}
and publicly committing to defend Jinmen and Mazu; in the [**Vietnam**
War, allies impeded U.S. entry into the war and then repeatedly implored
the United States to get out; and in **Bosnia and Kosovo**, U.S. allies
initially restrained the United States]{.underline} from lashing out
violently and then provided all of the NATO ground forces and most of
the postconflict peacekeepers for the eventual operations. There [also
are several cases in which the]{.underline} [United States **sidestepped
inconvenient alliance commitments**, restrained an ally from attacking a
third party, or openly sided against an ally]{.underline}---and this
list could probably be expanded by looking within other cases, including
the five ostensible cases of entanglement. As explained earlier, the
United States blatantly [**retracted a pledge to Taiwan** to defend
Jinmen and Mazu in 1955, refused to save the French at Dien Bien Phu in
1954]{.underline}, delegated ground operations and most of the
postconflict peacekeeping in Bosnia and Kosovo to allies, and waited for
eight months and the receipt of private security assurances before
responding militarily to China's provocative behavior near Taiwan in
1995--96. In sum, the empirical record shows that the risk of
entanglement is real but manageable and that, for better or worse, [U.S.
security policy lies firmly in the hands of U.S. leaders and is shaped
primarily by those leaders' perceptions of the nation's core
interests.]{.underline} When the United States has overreached
militarily, the main cause has not been entangling alliances but rather
what Richard Betts calls "self-entrapment"---the tendency of U.S.
leaders to define national interests expansively, to exaggerate the
magnitude of foreign threats, and to underestimate the costs of military
intervention.188 Developing a disciplined defense policy therefore will
require the emergence of prudent leadership, the development (or
resurrection) of guidelines governing the use of force,189 the
establishment of domestic institutional constraints on the president's
authority to send U.S. forces into battle, or some combination of
these.190 [Scrapping alliances, by contrast, would simply unleash the
United States to act on its **interventionist impulses** while leaving
it isolated diplomatically and militarily.]{.underline}

The main problem concerns counterfactuals. [The factors that allegedly
generate entrapment risks can be so wide-ranging that imagining a world
in which they operate differently would require changing other
variables, which in turn can make war more or less likely]{.underline}.
Alternatively, they [might not exclude other factors that could lead to
the same violent outcome]{.underline}. After all, [conflict **drives
both alliance formation and the likelihood of war**. States join
alliances because they assess that the **possibility of war is
non-trivial**.]{.underline} Similarly, a [defender might be receptive to
the overtures of an ally precisely because it has a pre-existing desire
to see conflict with the adversary of that ally]{.underline}. In social
scientific parlance, endogeneity problems are pervasive when trying to
understand whether entrapment has occurred or is at risk of occurring.
The case of the [2008 Russo-Georgian War is instructive by revealing
these ambiguities]{.underline}. Many NATO members---especially those in
Western Europe---were lukewarm towards [Georgia's bid to become a treaty
ally]{.underline}, [arguably because they recognized that Georgia posed
certain entrapment risks]{.underline}. The [United States was the most
supportive of Georgia, but it might have **overstated its support** to
Georgia in order to gain a bargaining chip with Russia.]{.underline} It
might have even done so because Western European countries were so
hesitant, thereby [ignoring Saakashvili's non-democratic
tendencies]{.underline}. But by this very token, the United States
limited its response to the outbreak of hostilities between Georgia and
Russia in August 2008. The Georgian case suggests that [states do not
forge alliances mindlessly nor do they follow their allies off the cliff
thoughtlessly]{.underline}. One [cannot by definition want to be
entrapped]{.underline}. The Russo-Georgian War of 2008 [illustrates the
need to disentangle the factors that push states to fight wars and to
seek alliances]{.underline} while carefully investigating the mechanisms
through which alliances fuel wars. As noted, some baseline probability
of war had already existed between the two former Soviet republics when
Saakashvili became President. Their conflict centered on [an unresolved
dispute regarding the political status of Abkhazia and South
Ossetia]{.underline}. Neither could commit to a durable settlement.
Moreover, territorial concessions and submission to salami tactics could
have signaled Georgian weakness, thereby encouraging new or more
assertive territorial demands. Georgian leaders might have also faced
domestic incentives to stand firm towards Russia---[incentives that
would have existed **independent of NATO**.]{.underline} To the extent
that alliance politics mattered from Georgia's perspective, Saakashvili
might have cherry-picked information that confirmed his beliefs
regarding Western support. Nevertheless, these factors are idiosyncratic
because they stem directly from his personality. [In a counterfactual
world where NATO was not a factor, he could have had these and other
cognitive biases that would have elevated the likelihood of
war.]{.underline} By undertaking this sort of counterfactual analysis,
scholars thus must take care to isolate the effect of an alliance
commitment---to the degree that it exists---from the underlying
propensity of war. Georgia bears a methodological and analytical lesson
for thinking about entrapment: Just because [NATO was an issue for
Georgian security in 2008 does not mean the alliance was causally
responsible for the war.]{.underline} [Future research]{.underline} on
alliances and war **[must not only]{.underline}** **[identify
correlations between alliances and conflict]{.underline}**, but [also
**sort out various causal mechanisms** that connect different causal
factors with war]{.underline}. Carefully disentangling the factors that
could lead to entrapment matters not only for theory and methodology but
also for policy. If entrapment concerns are real, then [defense planners
must have a clear idea as to where they come from]{.underline}. Some
entrapment risks can be attenuated with active policy measures.
[Conditioning a political or military commitment when dealing with a
risk-acceptant ally is one example. But doing so might not matter if we
have reason to think that systemic forces make that ally more
aggressive. Strong commitments could even make seemingly jumpy allies
more secure]{.underline}. And so, armed with a better understanding of
what drives entrapment risks, defense planners would be more confident
in modulating political and military commitments appropriately. As such,
critics of NATO expansion and American foreign policy may be overstating
their case. NATO might bear some indirect responsibility for the
Russo-Georgian War, [but its culpability lessens when we consider the
other factors that increased the likelihood of war: misperceptions,
overconfidence, and the commitment problems underlying the territorial
disputes themselves.]{.underline} If anything, the key policy challenge
is for NATO to determine whether prospective partners like Saakashvili
have psychological traits or cognitive biases that would make them
unjustifiably optimistic about the level of support that they would
receive.

**[Entrapment False---AT: Reputational risk theory]{.underline}**

**Reputation alone is insufficient to trigger entrapment**

Alexander **Lanoszka 17** --- (Alexander Lanoszka; Assistant Professor
at the University of Waterloo, Published: 12-18-2017; \"Tangled up in
rose? Theories of alliance entrapment and the 2008 Russo-Georgian War\";

[Scholars are divided about whether fighting for reputation is a
rational motive]{.underline} for states and thus whether it creates
perverse incentives for allies. Some claim that states calculate the
credibility of an ally or an adversary on the basis of its willingness
and ability to fulfill a threat or promise. [**Credibility** thus **does
not depend on** having a record of keeping **pledges**]{.underline}
(Press, 2005). Accordingly, [states cannot develop reputations for
reliability among their own allies]{.underline} (Mercer, 1996; Tang,
2005). **[Fighting for reputation is irrational]{.underline}**. However,
some dispute the proposition that actions do not matter for building
credibility since actions provide information as to the interests and
resolve of a state. Moreover, a record of standing up to adversaries
could generate credibility, which in turn helps develop a bargaining
advantage (Weisiger & Yarhi-Milo, 2015). Whichever is the case,
**[recent scholarship]{.underline}** [has cast doubt as to whether
reputational concerns worsen entrapment risks.]{.underline} The
[**Vietnam War** is an oft-cited example of the entrapment of strong
states by friendly states, but the evidence shows that American **allies
wished** to **restrain the** **U**nited **S**tates because they feared
that questionable wars of choice would divert resources away from
them]{.underline} (Beckley, 2015, pp. 33--38, pp. 46--47). [Another
weakness of the reputational explanation for entrapment is its
**deceptively simple counterfactual**]{.underline}. Simply stated, the
[counterfactual is that the defender does not care about its
reputation]{.underline}. Yet the implications of this counterfactual are
unclear. For example, does the defender not help the ally at all? And if
it does assist the ally, is it doing so only because of reputational
concerns? By offering an alliance commitment in the first place, the
defender reveals that it has some common security interests with that
ally (Walt, 1987; Yarhi-Milo, Lanoszka, & Cooper, 2016). [A defender
**unconcerned with its reputation** might still help that ally for
various national security reasons, as its decision-makers understand
them. Alternatively, a defender might even **enhance its reputation by
not assisting** the ally in a militarized conflict that the very ally
instigated.]{.underline} The [defender could decide that **following the
reckless ally** into an undesirable war will **undermine its ability to
protect other**, less problematic allies.]{.underline} The [defender
could even limit the damage to its reputation by **deflecting blame**
onto a misbehaving ally.]{.underline} These observations suggest that
the ally might not necessarily want to wager that the defender would
fight on its behalf simply because of reputational concerns. And so an
ally that is willing to make this wager is the sort of state that might
already be pre-disposed to risk-acceptant behavior. [If war does break
out because the ally made that gamble, then the war should not be
attributed to the alliance per se but rather to the ally and its innate
risk propensity.]{.underline}

**[Entrapment False---AT: Cred Theory]{.underline}**

**Cred theory is fake -- allies prefer peaceful policy and minimal
intervention**

Iain D. **Henry 20**, (Lecturer at the Strategic and Defence Studies
Centre, Australian National University, Spring 2020, "What Allies Want:
Reconsidering Loyalty, Reliability, and Alliance Interdependence,"
International Security, Vol. 44, No. 4)//EZAY

The events of the First Taiwan Strait Crisis illustrate the need to
[delineate between innate loyalty and **observed reliability**.
Reliability is a broader and more useful concept that subsumes the idea
of loyalty and reduces its unwarranted prominence.]{.underline} U.S.
[conduct was not judged against an objective standard of loyalty: allies
desiring a confrontational posture, such as South Korea and the
Philippines, invoked Quemoy and Matsu as symbols that required
defending, and encouraged U.S. loyalty to the ROC. **Most allies**,
however, were more concerned about the possibility of war, and so
**discouraged a U.S. defense** of strategically unimportant
territory]{.underline}. These [allies did not mind that this would
involve U.S. disloyalty to the ROC, but instead cared about whether
Washington\'s policy goals were convergent with their own.]{.underline}

In this case study, several [allies **cooperated to restrain** the
United States]{.underline} and [mitigate the risk of entrapment, while
weaker allies fearing abandonment had little option but to complain
about U.S. timidity]{.underline}. In other circumstances, however,
allies fearing abandonment could respond differently. For example, in
May 1950 Japan dispatched a secret delegation to Washington. Citing the
concern prompted by the 1949 withdrawal of United States forces from the
Korean Peninsula, and vacillating U.S. policy toward Nationalist China,
Japan expressed its desire for U.S. forces to stay in Japan, even once
the postwar occupation ended.[123](javascript:;) Similar fears of
abandonment were sparked in the 1970s, when President Jimmy Carter
planned troop reductions in South Korea. In response, Tokyo initiated a
new period of military and economic cooperation with Seoul. As Victor
Cha writes, "The most single decisive factor in this upswing in security
contacts was anxiety over the Carter plan."[124](javascript:;)

As explained, Mercer\'s argument about [reputation is **contingent upon
what constitutes** **desired and undesired behavior**. If]{.underline}
[states do not always desire allied loyalty, then this leaves open the
possibility of interdependence being governed by assessments of
interests and capability]{.underline}, but raises the [question of when
such interdependence might be observed]{.underline}. This article
deployed a within-case study approach, but [interdependence was also
operative across iterative crises: allies were unsurprised by the United
States' initial response to the First Taiwan Strait Crisis]{.underline},
because they had just observed a similarly belligerent approach toward
the PRC during discussions on Indochina. [Although the United States
ultimately **backed down on Indochina** in 1954, this **did not lead**
its **allies to expect** a similar back down over the Taiwan
Strait.]{.underline} This logic supports the argument made by Alex
Weisiger and Keren Yarhi-Milo: by focusing on iterative security crises,
previous research may have overlooked the possibility that during such
events, "information gleaned from past actions ... will have already
been folded into the general assessment of
interests."[125](javascript:;) Studying prolonged security crises, where
assessments of interests are regularly updated in response to new
information, may provide fresh insight into not only how states assess
allied reliability, but when and why these assessments change.

Although this article focuses on alliances, my findings raise new
questions about the possible interdependence of threats. [One
**assumption contested** in this article---that allies always want to
see their ally demonstrate **innate loyalty**---has an equivalent in
deterrence theory]{.underline}. It is assumed that states always want
their adversary to back down, but are there [circumstances in which an
adversary\'s decision to fight is
welcomed]{.underline}?[126](javascript:;) [A state may desire this if it
saps public support, provides geography unfavorable to the adversary, or
ties down an adversary\'s military force in an unimportant
theater.]{.underline} China may not object to a display of U.S. resolve
in the Middle East or Europe if it believes that this decreases the
United States' focus on Asia. This counterintuitive possibility requires
further consideration and, if supported, would be further evidence to
suggest that states assess national interests, rather than national
character.

The policy implications of the alliance reliability concept are
significant, especially given President Donald Trump\'s mercurial
approach to alliance management. How should U.S. policymakers approach
the possibility of alliance interdependence? First, they should realize
that the national character of the United States is not on trial:
[allies will be looking for evidence of **reliability, not loyalty**.
The idea of reliability is especially pertinent to current discussions
about a U.S. withdrawal from the Middle East: allies may not invariably
despair at withdrawal if it enables the United States to **focus on
other issues** of greater allied concern]{.underline}. Second, U.S.
policymakers should consider how specific actions might influence each
ally, as different allies are likely to react in different ways.
Officials will not need a crystal ball: this First Taiwan Strait Crisis
case study suggests that [allies will not hesitate to express their
fears. **Nor will allies rush for the door** at the first **sign of
unreliability**: in this case, their first **instinct was to bargain**
with U.S. leaders and convince them that disloyalty to the ROC was
actually in the best interests of the United States]{.underline}. The
reliability concept shows that state interests are not totally exogenous
to their alliance relationships: alliance unity can require hard
bargaining over how states order their
interests.[127](javascript:;) This bargaining is made more difficult if
states in alliance are reluctant to consider situations where their
interests diverge, even privately, for fear of upsetting alliance
comity. [Such discussions may be difficult, and frustrating for the
United States if it expects unqualified support, but they provide an
opportunity to understand what, in alliance interdependence terms, is at
stake in a crisis]{.underline}. Finally, the United States should
consider the desirability of likely allied reactions and factor these
into decisionmaking. Fighting to preserve allied beliefs about U.S.
reliability may be worthwhile if doing so prevents unwanted reactions
such as dealignment, bandwagoning, or nuclear proliferation. On the
other hand, it may be beneficial for allies to fear unreliability if
this will almost certainly cause them to pursue policies---such as
increased defense spending---desired by the United States.

Today, several flash points around the globe could create problems of
alliance interdependence. The closest parallel to the events of 1954--55
is found in the Sino-Japanese dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands,
which are covered by the U.S.-Japan alliance. Another similar case is
the recent reaffirmation, by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, that the
U.S.-Philippines alliance covers Filipino military assets in the South
China Sea.[128](javascript:;) The instinct of many in the United States
will be to regard any Chinese challenge in these areas as a test of
national character. Instead, policymakers should consider their options
and the likely allied reactions. [Given the escalation risks present
within the U.S.-China relationship, will other allies want to risk
conflict---perhaps even nuclear war---over uninhabited territory of
debatable strategic importance or the sinking of a single naval
vessel]{.underline}?[129](javascript:;) Of course, arguments advocating
disloyalty would have to be weighed against the likely effects in Japan,
or the Philippines. Would Japan abrogate the alliance, conciliate China,
or perhaps develop its own nuclear weapons? Or could it be reassured,
thus avoiding undesired consequences? Would the Philippines react by
bandwagoning with China? These questions will be even harder to answer
during a security crisis, but [neither deterrence theory nor
reputation-skeptic perspectives would prompt decisionmakers to ask
them]{.underline}. The concept of reliability and its effect on alliance
interdependence do not solve such dilemmas, but they help to raise the
right questions and more accurately identify the actual stakes involved.

\*italics in original

After the end of World War II, the US sought a way to protect Europe
from the USSR. Despite acute security concerns, **[fear of
entrapment]{.underline}** in unwanted conflicts [led to limits on
military support]{.underline}. First, as Poast (2019*a*) details, NATO
members disagreed over how to define the North Atlantic area, which was
a key condition on military support. The US and other states argued
about whether France's Algerian colony and Italy should be protected by
the alliance. Second, active [military support from NATO]{.underline}
members [depends on domestic political processes]{.underline}.18
[Isolationists in the US Senate feared that an alliance would force
America to intervene automatically if partners were attacked, bypassing
the power of Congress to declare war and engaging the US in unwanted
conflicts]{.underline} (Acheson, 1969, pg. 280-1).
**[Therefore]{.underline}** [Article V of the NATO treaty states that if
one member is attacked the others "will assist the Party or Parties so
attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other
Parties, ***such action as it deems necessary***]{.underline} (emphasis
mine)." **[Military support was and is not guaranteed]{.underline}**.
Secretary of State Dean Acheson stated as much in a March 1949 press
release defending NATO to the US public, where he said that [Article V
"does not mean that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would
automatically be at war if one of the nations covered by the Pact is
subject to armed attack"]{.underline} (Acheson, 1949). This claim and
the emphases of the press release shows that promises of military
support were highly salient to the US public.

[NATO's best answer to compellence is strategic flexibility and
**ambiguity** of response. While Article V dictates the defense of a
member, it **doesn't** stipulate **what** that defense must be, **how**
it should take shape, or **where** it will be applied]{.underline}. With
U.S. forces in place, NATO members can be assured that Article V will be
triggered, but what happens next should be left a question mark. The
more NATO emphasizes the Russian threat and argues for fixed forces in
place, the less capably it can defend a challenge to its credibility as
an alliance. Anyone can count the order of battle and the balance of
forces. [By introducing **ambiguity** in its potential response once
Article V has been declared, NATO **reduces the chance** it can **easily
be manipulated** into a credibility test]{.underline}. The objective
should be shrouding a Baltic high-end fight in incalculable risk for
Russia while maintaining uncertainty and strategic flexibility with air
and naval assets.

The second part of the counterargument deals with entanglement and
entrapment. [The idea that U.S. presence in an alliance]{.underline}
with an extensive security commitment and an ever-increasing number of
European countries and [can entangle it in a conflict with Russia is
persistent]{.underline} and not entirely incorrect.

On one hand, [the academic literature suggests entrapment is **far less
common** than perceived]{.underline}. Separate [research by Tongfi
**Kim**, Michael **Beckley**, and Alexander **Lanoszka** all finds that
entrapment is an unlikely scenario in international
politics.]{.underline} In fact, the work by [Beckley finds that the
United States has been able to **avoid entanglement** by using a large
alliance portfolio to balance counteracting commitments.]{.underline}

[**Even if** one is]{.underline} still [concerned with the risks of
entrapment, this is a major reason why NATO should adopt a strategy less
focused on deterring Russia.]{.underline} As we noted previously, by
constantly focusing on defense spending and balancing, NATO has
threatened Russia. Thus, our argument actually suggests [entanglement
will be less likely if NATO begins to focus more on cooperative and
humanitarian actions within the alliance.]{.underline}

By the mere fact of its continued existence, [NATO has displayed a
**penchant for adaptation** to new circumstances.]{.underline} To
continue surviving, though, it needs to adapt once again. The focus on
balancing against Russia made sense during the Cold War but has made
Europe less secure while also decreasing the popularity of the alliance.

By [shifting its focus to the promotion of shared values and broader
international political cooperation, NATO can prove Macron incorrect,
and revitalize its existence in a new era.]{.underline}

[A]{.underline} final [risk of continued NATO membership]{.underline}
that Canada must consider [is the possibility of being dragged **in**to
conflict]{.underline}. While the ADM (Policy) at DND claims that NATO
increases global stability by preventing the formation of smaller
alliance blocs, this logic must be re-evaluated in the post-Cold War
era. We can turn to the international relations theory of alliances in
multipolarity, as explained by Kenneth Waltz (and later, Jack Snyder and
Thomas Christensen). [One of the biggest dangers of a military alliance
is **"chain-ganging"**]{.underline}50[: that one ally will recklessly
drag the others into war,]{.underline} as was the case between
Austria-Hungary and Germany in 1914. It is true that the
[NATO]{.underline} alliance [has a **mechanism** to **stop this**:
Article 5 can **only** be invoked by **consensus**, which **prevents**
the shooting down of a Turkish jet by Russia from immediately turning
into global war]{.underline}. However, alliance theory argues that it
isn't about automatic triggers, but survival interests. As Waltz
explained, in 1914, "If France marched, Russia had to follow; a German
victory over France would be a defeat for Russia."51 Similarly, if
Russia today conventionally invaded a Baltic state and NATO ally, it is
difficult to imagine that the alliance would not respond: not for the
first time in its history, Canada would be dragged into a faraway,
conventional European war. However, Canada can support countries around
the world and advocate for their continued survival and independence
without being bound to defend them. Canada's relationship with Israel is
a good example. Canada has supported this precariously situated
democratic country since its creation in 1948, has engaged in numerous
high-level visits and economic agreements with this state, and has
frequently (especially since 2006) taken a stand against condemnation of
Israel at the United Nations at significant cost to its own reputation.
However, there is no defence agreement: should war erupt again between
Israel and its neighbours, Canada would not come to Israel's aid by
sending soldiers. A different example is Canada's relationship with
Kuwait. While there is no long-standing mutual relationship of defence
and support between the two, it was in the interest of global security
to stop Saddam Hussein's invasion of that country in 1990/1991. Canada
answered the call then, but was not bound to support a future mission
against Iraq in 2003.

**[No NATO Entrapment---AT: Article V]{.underline}**

**Wars of aggression are unpopular -- allies won't follow and
credibility isn't sacrificed**

historic decision it made hours after 9/11,\" Business Insider,
https://www.businessinsider.com/nato-still-living-with-consequences-article-5-invocation-after-911-2021-9)//EZAY

The day after [the September 11 attacks, most **NATO countries called
for** the invocation of **Article 5**.]{.underline} This did not
immediately happen since the origin of the attacks had yet to be
determined to the satisfaction of some members.

It [**took until October** 2,]{.underline} 2001 --- [when
then-NATO]{.underline} Secretary General Lord George Robertson
[announced that the attacks had indeed been directed from abroad --- for
Article 5 to be invoked.]{.underline}

This was a [watershed moment for the alliance. **Failure to invoke**
Article 5 would have rendered NATO obsolete]{.underline}. Instead, the
alliance, which had [struggled to find its raison d\'être following the
collapse of the Soviet Union, was propelled into Afghanistan and the
fight against terrorism.]{.underline}

A number of NATO allies were involved in the war from the very
beginning.

The UK participated in the first airstrikes against Taliban and Al Qaeda
targets. German and British special-operations units took part in the
Battle of Tora Bora. A number of NATO countries contributed personnel,
aircraft, and logistical support during 2002\'s Operation Anaconda, the
successful mission to rout out Al Qaeda from Afghanistan\'s Shahi Kot
valley.

After dismantling the Taliban and Al Qaeda networks in Afghanistan,
NATO\'s role there only grew.

In 2003, at the request of the UN and the Afghan government, NATO took
charge of the International Security Assistance Force. This was a
landmark moment for the alliance.

ISAF would be NATO\'s first deployment outside of Europe and North
America. All NATO members would contribute personnel to ISAF --- some
contributed more per capita than the US.

Eventually, the ISAF mandate would expand from securing Kabul to the
whole country. This nominally transferred control of the war to NATO.

[The war exposes NATO\'s weaknesses]{.underline}

Assuming control of such a high-stakes mission provided significant
operational and organizational experience to NATO. However, as the
war\'s toll increased, [weaknesses within the alliance were
exposed.]{.underline}

[Participation in the war in Afghanistan had been a **contentious
issue** in many European countries from the beginning.]{.underline}

In some, like Spain, [**parliamentary approval** had **not been
obtained** to dispatch troops to Afghanistan]{.underline}. In others,
like Germany and Italy, the [deployed troops were limited by legal
constraints,]{.underline} which in some cases prevented them from
actually fighting the Taliban.

Most [NATO members had not fought a war in decades, so even limited
combat casualties caused **significant backlash** at home]{.underline}.
The 2004 Madrid train bombings and the 2005 London bombings --- which
brought Islamist terror to Europe in two of the continent\'s worst
attacks in decades --- [further increased the war\'s
unpopularity]{.underline}.

As a result, many [NATO members only contributed a **few support
troops** and tried to sidle away from combat operations and troubled
areas. France even withdrew its combat forces in 2012. The **lack of
specificity** in Article 5 meant members could abide by their NATO
commitment **without totally participating** in the war
effort.]{.underline}

In 2015, ISAF became the Resolute Support Mission. A non-combat mission,
RSM significantly scaled down the number of NATO troops in Afghanistan
as it focused on supporting and advising Afghan security forces..

The alliance emerges from Afghanistan with a mixed record.

On the one hand, it undertook its largest mission ever and the first
outside its normal area of operations, learning valuable lessons about
organization and interoperability that will be useful for future
deployments.

On the other hand, the [**intractable problem** at the alliance\'s core
was exposed: the near-impossibility of getting all **30 members** to
agree on and commit to military and political priorities.]{.underline}

To apply those lessons and stay relevant, the alliance will need to
ensure that alignment.

As NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg [wrote](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_186490.htm) on
the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, \"Afghanistan will not
be the last crisis for which North America and Europe need to act
together through NATO.\"

Table 1 lists the opportunities to fulfill alliance commitments from
1945 to 2003. This information offers some possible explanations for the
sharp decrease in promise fulfillment after World War II. One thing that
stands out is that offense pacts and neutrality agreements, which are
honored at higher rates than defense pacts and nonaggression pacts, are
less common in the modern era. Only 20% of alliance performance
opportunities from 1945 to 2003 included offensive or neutrality-based
commitments, compared with more than 70% from 1816 to 1944. Changes in
the types of alliance commitments that are invoked in war over time
might partially account for the puzzling trend that we identify. Yet we
still see sizable variation in compliance within the same commitment
type in the two eras. [**Defense pacts**, for instance, were **honored**
61.02% of the time from 1816 to 1944 and only **13.95% of the time
post-World War II.**]{.underline} What else, then, could explain the
changing patterns over time?

The invention of nuclear weapons offers one potential answer. In the
[post-World War II era,]{.underline} the world's most powerful states
possessed nuclear arsenals. Given the destructive power of these
weapons, alliance commitments from nuclear powers -- especially [defense
pacts -- have **rarely been challenged** in war]{.underline} (Fuhrmann
and Sechser, 2014). [As a result, major powers appear just a few times
in Table 1 and relatively weak states account for a sizable percentage
of all "alliance performance opportunities" from 1945 to
2003]{.underline}. This is relevant because state power may affect
alliance treaty fulfillment. Countries should be most likely to
intervene in war when their participation might change the outcome
(Morrow, 1994; Smith, 1995). Relatively weak states, according to this
line of thinking, are less likely to fulfill their alliance promises
because they lack the material capacity to [sway a conflict's
outcome]{.underline}.7 Israel probably would have prevailed in the Six
Day War, for instance, even if Saudi Arabia had joined its allies in the
fight. From Riyadh's perspective, this may have made it easier to
largely remain on the sidelines. This is, however, merely a preliminary
conjecture. [Conclusion]{.underline} This study presented an updated
assessment of the reliability of military alliances. Our analysis, which
extended earlier work to include the post-World War II era and utilized
updated war data, yields three main conclusions. First, the [overall
rate of **alliance fulfillment** in war is **lower** than previously
reported.]{.underline} Second, defense pacts and [nonaggression pacts
are honored much less frequently than neutrality agreements and
offensive alliances.]{.underline} Third, there is a [large **disparity
in** the **rate of alliance fulfillment** before and after World War
II.]{.underline} This offers a lesson for researchers that extends
beyond the realm of alliance politics: trends that apply in one period
may not extend to other eras. It is important to consider whether
relationships of interest vary over time -- particularly when there are
structural shocks, like World War II. What implications does the lower
compliance rate carry for our understanding of alliance treaty
reliability? [Our analysis does not imply that military alliances are
ineffective, **nor does it challenge** the evidence that defense pacts
promote peace through **extended deterrence**]{.underline} (Leeds,
2003b; Johnson and Leeds, 2011; Fuhrmann and Sechser, 2014). The most
effective threat is one that never has to be implemented (Schelling,
1966). NATO does not appear in our dataset, for example, precisely
because potential adversaries perceive it as effective. However, [when
alliance commitments are invoked in war, **allies uphold** their
promises **less often** than the conventional wisdom
suggests.]{.underline} This implies that [leaders are **less
restrained** by treaty commitments than prior research would expect, a
conclusion that carries implications for our understanding of
international institutions]{.underline} (for a review of relevant
literature, see Simmons, 2010). Our analysis opens up avenues for future
research. Scholars could use our updated dataset to revisit enduring
debates about alliance politics, such as whether democracies make more
(or less) reliable allies (c.f., Gartzke and Gleditsch, 2004; Leeds,
2003a). The disparity in compliance rates over time also represents a
puzzle worthy of examination in scholarship. Something may have changed
after 1944 that fundamentally [altered the nature of alliance
politics.]{.underline} We have speculated about the sources of this
variation, but further analysis is necessary in order to achieve more
definitive answers. The disparity in compliance across commitment types
is worthy of further investigation in scholarship as well. Dedicated
studies on why offense pacts are so much more reliable than defense
pacts would be especially welcome. More generally, future research might
consider the implications of our findings for extended deterrence,
war-fighting, and the efficacy of international institutions.

I focus this brief case study on [NATO treaty design for two
reasons.]{.underline} First, information from NATO applies to multiple
alliances, as other US treaties have similar designs. Most US [alliances
have **conditional promises** of military support]{.underline} and
understanding why is important. Second, NATO is also the most important
alliance in international politics, so understanding how the treaty
formed is worthwhile. After the end of World War II, the US sought a way
to protect Europe from the USSR. Despite acute security concerns[, fear
of entrapment in unwanted conflicts led to **limits on military
support**.]{.underline} First, as Poast (2019a) details, NATO members
disagreed over how to define the North Atlantic area, which was a key
condition on military support. The US and other states argued about
whether France's Algerian colony and Italy should be protected by the
alliance. Second, active [military support from NATO members depends on
domestic political processes.]{.underline}18 [Isolationists in the US
Senate feared that an alliance would force America to intervene
automatically if partners were attacked, bypassing the power of Congress
to declare war and engaging the US in unwanted conflicts]{.underline}
(Acheson, 1969, pg. 280-1). Therefore [Article V]{.underline} of the
NATO treaty states that [if one member is attacked the others "will
assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith,
individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it
deems necessary (emphasis mine)."]{.underline} Military [support was and
is **not guaranteed**.]{.underline} Secretary of State Dean Acheson
stated as much in a March 1949 press release defending
[NATO]{.underline} to the US public, where he said that [Article V "does
not mean that the United States would automatically be at war if one of
the nations covered by the Pact is subject to armed attack"]{.underline}
(Acheson, 1949). This claim and the emphases of the press release shows
that promises of military support were highly salient to the US public.
Military [support from Article V did not assuage European fears that if
the Soviets invaded, the United States would not fight. To increase the
credibility of NATO, the United States took **other
measures**]{.underline}. A 1951 presentation by Dean Acheson to Dwight
Eisenhower argued European allies "fear the inconstancy of United States
purpose in Europe. \... These European fears and apprehensions can [only
be overcome if we move forward with determination and if we make the
necessary full and **active contribution** in terms of both **military
forces** and **economic aid**"]{.underline} (Acheson, 1951, pg. 3). The
first part of reassurance was the [creation of the Atlantic
Council]{.underline}, which is an international organization and the
main source of depth in the NATO treaty itself. The United States used
the Atlantic Council to coordinate collective defense and increase the
perceived reliability of the alliance. By [investing in the Atlantic
Council and related **joint military planning**, the US addressed
European fears of abandonment.]{.underline} For example, US officials
thought that the British Foreign Minister viewed US provision of a
supreme commander in Europe as ["a stimulus to European
action"]{.underline} in NATO (Acheson, 1950). Many Senators also opposed
military aid to Europe (Acheson, 1969, pg 285), which limited efforts to
add further treaty depth. These legislative constraints on the executive
branch reduced the formal depth of NATO relative to what many
ambassadors preferred (Acheson, 1969, pg 277[). **Bilateral agreements**
on **troop deployments** then became **another instrument** of
reassurance]{.underline}. In 1950 the [Germans formally requested
**clarification on** whether an **attack on US forces in Germany** would
be treated as an armed attack on the US- which the US said it
would]{.underline} (Acheson, 1969, pg. 395). These [**bilateral
arrangements** and **basing rights** are not covered in the NATO
treaty,]{.underline} but they [**added substantial
depth**.]{.underline}19 NATO negotiations reveal the [tendency of
democracies to use treaty depth **to reassure their allies**, rather
than unconditional military support.]{.underline} [Fear of foreign
entanglement led the United States to offer conditional military
support, but did not inhibit deep military cooperation, which helped
reassure European allies.]{.underline} Limits on the promises of
military support were an important public justification for the NATO
treaty, while the Atlantic Council was less discussed. Still, the power
of treaty ratification in the Senate limited formal NATO depth to the
Atlantic Council. The Atlantic Council and associated bureaucratic
machinery are the formal core of substantial defense cooperation.
Altogether though Article V is limited, the [US used treaty depth to
increase the credibility of NATO.]{.underline}

**[No Turkey Entrapment]{.underline}**

**No turkey entrapment**

-- Interdependence and assurance adjusting checks

-Turkey is a test case for resiliency and restraint

-have too much to lose to do adventurism

**Gulmez 20** (Didem Buhari Gulmez, an Associate Professor in
International Relations at Izmir Katip Celebi University. She worked as
a post-doctoral researcher at London School of Economics and Political
Science and Oxford Brookes University from 2013 to 2015; "The resilience

)//EZAY

Why does the US--Turkey alliance persist despite the low credibility of
the US security guarantees after the Cold War? Both the rise of
contestations against the US hegemony and the establishment of a
single-party government by the AKP in Turkey led to significant
divergences in threat perceptions and worldviews within the US-Turkey
alliance. Given its regional leadership aspirations based on strategic
autonomy, [Turkey can be seen as a critical or 'the least likely case'
(Eckstein, 1975) for the resilience of the US alliances. If the alliance
proves resilient in this **most difficult case**, it is more likely to
**persist in other cases too.**]{.underline}

Several factors such as the [high credibility of the alliance and a
shared sense of belonging in a security community between the allies
explain why an alliance persists]{.underline} (Walt, 1997). [Turkey
maintains the US alliance **in spite** of the low credibility of the US
security guarantees,]{.underline} the perceived [leadership failure of
the US in the Middle East and the divergence of **threat perceptions and
worldviews** between Turkey and the US.]{.underline} As Turkey's US
alliance reflects a combination of transactional and ontological
motivations since its eruption, both transactional and 'order-centric'
arguments contribute to the resilience of the alliance.

[According to the transactional view]{.underline}, the [US alliance has
**served as a 'hedge'** against alternative regional orders led by
**Russia or Iran**. Turkey's security dependence on the US and the costs
of abrogating the alliance **prevail over** the AKP's search for greater
autonomy and a better status in the East.]{.underline} [Turkey's
**energy dependence** on Russia and Iran curtails the AKP's regional
leadership aspirations.]{.underline} Furthermore, [Turkey is
**uncertain** about whether Russia would treat Turkey as an equal if it
abrogates its NATO/US alliance]{.underline} (Turan, 2018). It [failed to
play an important role during the Arab uprisings as it found itself
'punch\[ing\] above its weight' and overinvolved in complex regional
affairs]{.underline} (Öniş & Kutlay, 2017, pp. 176--177). Also, it
[lacks both a **coherent vision** of an ideal world order and the
political will to assume global responsibilities]{.underline} (Parlar
Dal, 2018). Accordingly, Turkey's 'double-track' strategy and its
contestations of the US hegemony can be interpreted as merely a warning
to the West. Turkey would not have pursued a rapprochement with Russia
had the US actively supported Turkey's autonomy-based strategies, its
defence industry and its fight against PKK and Gülen (Erşen & Köstem,
2019).

Alternatively, an ontologically-motivated alliance relies on an
'order-centric' nature that transcends the pragmatic motivations of
transactional and threat-based alliances. By maintaining the US
alliance, [lesser powers like Turkey seek to benefit from the
constitutive and legitimating effects of the alliance on their
agency]{.underline}. Alliance [abrogation means higher uncertainty and
risk in terms of the emergence of alternative regional and global
orders.]{.underline} Hence, Turkey does not abrogate the alliance
because the alliance legitimates Turkey's agency in the current world
order as a rising middle power. [Rather than preventing it, the US
alliance helps Turkey **assert its national role** in world politics as
an actor that transcends the East- West divide]{.underline}. For
example, Turkey [co-sponsors the UN Alliance of Civilisations project
with Spain and it has become 'the only country that co-chairs three
distinct Friends of Mediation groups at three major international
institutions']{.underline}, namely, the UN, the OIC and the Organization
for Security and Co-operation in Europe (Akçapar, 2019, p. 6). It has
recently launched the 'Asia Anew' initiative in August 2019, emphasising
its role as 'the westernmost Asian and the easternmost European country'
(Demirci & Cam, 2019). It participates in both the Western-led 'Geneva
process' and the Russian--Iranian--Turkish trilateral 'Astana process'
about the Syrian conflict. In this context, Turkey's alliance with the
US is embedded in Turkey's national role conception as an actor of world
politics that is in between the East and the West. Hence, the US
alliance's legitimating 'order-centric' effects on Turkey's multifaceted
foreign policy contributes to the resilience of the alliance.

**Turkey won't invoke Article 5 -- low cred and Turkey doesn't think
they say yes**

İbrahim **KARATAŞ 20** (10/20/2020, "Analyzing the Article 5 of the
North Atlantic Treaty as an Assurance of Turkey's Security", Middle
Eastern Studies, 13-2 (2021):155-176//) EZAY

[**Article 5** of the NATO agreement that orders collective defense for
a member that has incurred an armed attack has always been a matter of
debate in Turkey]{.underline}. Turks are [suspicious of it if it
involves Turkey in a likely war or conflict]{.underline}. This study
analyzed whether [Turkey and other members can rely on NATO's assurance
of security stemming from Article 5]{.underline}. After e[xamining
certain events and surveys measuring public opinion of member states
about NATO, it has been concluded that it is **not clear that other
members will defend** Turkey]{.underline} or any other member since the
[article was **invoked only once** in the history of NATO to protect the
US against relatively small states and a terrorist group.]{.underline}
However, [regarding Turkey's position, the claim that NATO will not
protect]{.underline} Turkey cannot be proven since Turkey did not face
an existential threat after becoming a NATO member. In addition,
deterring the Soviet Union from attacking Turkey by making it a NATO
member can be regarded as a benefit of Article 5 without invoking it. On
the other hand, [Turkey's own preferences and compelling reasons in
foreign policy made it to be in contention with its NATO
allies]{.underline}. However, [when NATO members' attitudes are
examined, it can be concluded that they could still have proposed better
solutions for Turkey]{.underline}. In addition to the above, as per
[public opinion surveys, NATO members hint that they may not sacrifice
themselves for others unless (1) **they are at War**, (2) **the enemy
attacks all**, (3) all attack the enemy, and (4) the US
leads.]{.underline} According to surveys, [this thesis is valid for
Turkey since it favors NATO least and does not seem to join a collective
defense of its allies]{.underline}. Yet, NATO's and some members'
[failure or **reluctance to address** Turkey's security problems has a
significant impact on Turkish **people's views**]{.underline}. Surveys
also show that NATO members are [not as much in allegiance to the
organization]{.underline} as they were in the past, [probably due to the
non-existence of an imminent threat.]{.underline}

**Turkey can't entrap NATO\-\--no draw-in, and NATO
[refuses]{.underline}.**

Argument Finds No Takers," Carnegie Corporation of New York, 2-24-2016,
https://www.carnegie.org/news/articles/turkeys-article-5-argument-finds-no-takers/

The ferocity of the [fighting between Syria's]{.underline} government
[forces and]{.underline} various proxies vying for control of territory
and resources has [Turkey]{.underline} on edge and [has already led
to]{.underline} several [deadly clashes involving]{.underline} the only
[NATO]{.underline} member state bordering the civil war.

[With Turkey, Russia, Iran, Iraq, and Gulf states pursuing their
own]{.underline}, often [conflicting aims in Syria]{.underline}, all
against the backdrop of a U.S.-led air and commando campaign against the
Islamic State (IS), [there is]{.underline} renewed [concern at NATO's
headquarters]{.underline} in Brussels [that Turkey could see the next
flare-up as grounds for citing Article 5]{.underline}: in effect,
demanding that its NATO allies deploy forces and come to its collective
defense.

[Turkey has already invoked]{.underline} the lesser-known [Article
4]{.underline}---a demand for an emergency consultation of the
alliance---following the downing of a Turkish warplane under disputed
circumstances last spring. Incidents like this and the threat that
Bashar Assad's forces might launch Scud missiles into Turkey led NATO
members---the United States, Germany, and Spain---to deploy Patriot
anti-aircraft missiles along the border in early 2013, though the German
and American batteries have since been withdrawn. Spain's---a less
capable version of the Patriot---is geared towards anti-aircraft, as
opposed to anti-ballistic missile defense, and therefore deemed more
appropriate

[But could a]{.underline} **[new]{.underline}**
[incident]{.underline}---a missile strike, an IS incursion, or Syrian
artillery bombardment across the border---[bring the]{.underline}
**[full might of NATO into the war?]{.underline}** [Many
are]{.underline} **[skeptical]{.underline}**, and [for]{.underline}
**[good reason]{.underline}**.

[The **history of invocations of**]{.underline} NATO's **[Article
5]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[short]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} somewhat [**underwhelming**. In]{.underline} the **[68
years]{.underline}** of the North Atlantic alliance's history, [plenty
of **low-intensity**]{.underline} [conflicts involving NATO]{.underline}
nations [have raged, from rebellion in France's Algerian departments, to
the U.S. war in Vietnam, through the Balkan wars of the 1990s.
Yet]{.underline} **[only once]{.underline}** [has]{.underline}
**[Article 5's]{.underline}** "all-for-one, one-for-all" **[facility
been invoked]{.underline}**: that was **[September]{.underline}** 12,
**[2001]{.underline}**, the day after the al-Qaida attacks on the United
States.

[Even **then**, its effect was primarily]{.underline}
**[symbolic]{.underline}**. While the United States expressed its deep
appreciation at the time, NATO involvement in Afghanistan would be
minimal for years to come, though British, French, and a handful of
other elite forces arrived as early as November that year. In practice,
though, it was not until late 2003, when NATO assumed command of the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), that alliance troops
arrived in force, and even then often under restrictive rules of
engagement that limited their effectiveness.

Indeed, ISAF, the force NATO led from August 2003 to December 2013, was
a UN-sanctioned operation that included not only forces from NATO's 28
militaries but troops and specialists from 48 states, including such
disparate contributors as Mongolia, Tonga, and Singapore. At its height
in 2010--11, ISAF numbered more than 42,000 troops, augmenting 100,000
U.S. troops.

[Turkey would]{.underline} **[sorely like]{.underline}** [a
commitment]{.underline} of that scale. [Yet the]{.underline} subtle
**[diplomatic realities]{.underline}** [of the North Atlantic
alliance---as well as the very unsubtle nature of its own activity
inside Syria---make this]{.underline} **[highly unlikely]{.underline}**.

For one thing, [Turkey's]{.underline} **[own military]{.underline}** has
[acted aggressively]{.underline} in [targeting]{.underline} Syria's
[Kurdish rebels]{.underline}, the People's Protection Units, or YPG,
which Ankara views as little more than a proxy for the outlawed
separatist guerrillas of the Turkish Kurds, the Kurdistan Workers'
Party, or PKK. Last week, [the Turks opened up on the Kurdish-held air
base at]{.underline} [**Aleppo**, in spite of the fact that the
city]{.underline} [is]{.underline} **[surrounded]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} forces loyal to **[Assad]{.underline}**, the presumed
enemy in Syria. [The act]{.underline} **[enraged]{.underline}** almost
**[everyone]{.underline}**. Russia demanded at an emergency Security
Council meeting a censure of Turkey's violation of Syrian sovereignty,
and President Obama, who regards the Kurdish as the most reliable ground
force in the fight against the IS, urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan in an 80-minute phone call on February 19 to avoid provocative
actions.

[While NATO has taken no]{.underline} **[official]{.underline}**
[position on the question of Article 5---**not surprising**, since
**no**]{.underline} formal **[request]{.underline}** [has been
made---through]{.underline} **[back channels]{.underline}** [the
alliance has been]{.underline} **[telegraphing]{.underline}**
[a]{.underline} **[resounding "no" to Turkey]{.underline}** for weeks.
Last week, [Luxembourg's Foreign Minister]{.underline} Jean Asselborn
[told]{.underline} Germany's [DerSpiegel that "NATO
**cannot**]{.underline} [allow itself to be pulled into a military
escalation with Russia as a result of the recent tensions between Russia
and Turkey]{.underline}."

Whatever the fate of the current U.S.-push to secure a cease fire,
[a]{.underline} **[large NATO ground force]{.underline}**, of the kind
that deployed to Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan, [is **not** on the
table]{.underline}.

**[No Norway Entrapment]{.underline}**

**Norway isn't interested in conflict, but US support causes
deterrence---solves wider scale conflicts**

**Norwegian minister of defense**; \"Norway's defense minister: We must
ensure strategic stability in the High North,\" Defense News,

[The United States and Norway have a strong and longstanding **bilateral
relationship** based on **mutual interests** and common
values]{.underline}. The trans-Atlantic link remains the cornerstone of
Norwegian security, and [our two countries cooperate closely on almost
every aspect of military operations.]{.underline} Looking ahead, the two
key dimensions for [Norwegian security policy are the Arctic and
Russia.]{.underline}

**Strategic environment in the High North**

Since [Russia began its military reform effort in 2008, it has built
layered, integrated and scalable defenses.]{.underline} Russia's armed
forces have become an increasingly [useful political instrument for the
Kremlin across the entire conflict spectrum, from peace to crisis and
war.]{.underline}

The annexation of Crimea in 2014 added a more threatening undertone to
the development. In recent years, Norway has experienced [**Russian
simulated air attacks** on Norwegian targets and **jamming of GPS
signals** that threaten the **security of civilian
aviation**]{.underline}. Last fall, Russia conducted a sophisticated
[cyberattack on the Norwegian parliament, a serious incident that
affected our country's most important democratic
institution.]{.underline}

[The Russian so-called active defense **emphasizes high readiness**,
agility, mobility and close coordination, as well as the ability to
launch massive firepower. Russian prioritization of the Arctic has
resulted in a]{.underline} [**large-scale modernization** of the armed
forces and infrastructure reestablishment in the Russian
north]{.underline}. The key task of the Russian capabilities on the Kola
Peninsula is global deterrence, making horizontal escalation a lasting
concern for Norway. [There is **no indication** that **Russia will slow
down its engagement in the Arctic** --- rather, the
opposite.]{.underline}

China's ambitions and increased involvement in great power competition
introduces new challenges. China's interest in the Arctic is growing,
especially in light of its Belt and Road Initiative. Beijing has a broad
range of means available, as it invests in research, ports and
infrastructure in the region. Although China currently does not pose a
military threat in the Arctic, [Norway closely monitors China's
engagement in the north and its growing cooperation with
Russia.]{.underline}

**Key priority**

[Norway's key priority is to [maintain the Arctic as an area
characterized by cooperation and
predictability](https://www.defensenews.com/smr/nato-air-power/2020/08/06/bring-allied-attention-to-air-power-in-the-arctic/).]{.underline}
The newly published whitepaper on the Arctic emphasizes its strategic
importance for Norway, and our new long-term plan for defense outlines
significant investments in relevant military capabilities.

Furthermore, [Norway welcomes the increased presence of key NATO allies
in the High North]{.underline}. In recent years, the Pentagon has
published Arctic strategies illustrating that the U.S. views the High
North as an area that requires attention in order to preserve strategic
stability and a rules-based international order. [Along with the U.S.
Navy, Marines and special forces, the Air and Space Forces are now
developing strategic cooperation with likeminded nations in the
region.]{.underline} This includes increasingly regular allied naval and
air presence in the High North. [Norway aims to participate in these
activities when they take place in the waters off the Norwegian coast,
in order to enhance allied interoperability]{.underline}. We consider
these activities as a sign of alliance solidarity and cohesion.

[**Norway's allies share their views on the country's new defense
plan**](https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2020/04/16/allies-share-views-on-enhancing-defense-of-norway-and-the-high-north/)

[Norway\'s allies recognize the country as punching above its weight and
playing a critical role in the defense of the North Atlantic and High
North. But there is no time for complacency.]{.underline}

NATO also emphasizes the [**strategic importance** of the
Arctic.]{.underline} Exercise Trident Juncture, hosted by Norway in
2018, [proves that the alliance is able to conduct large-scale exercises
in harsh weather conditions with an Article 5 scenario.]{.underline} As
part of a more persistent allied presence, we look forward to hosting
the biannual exercise Cold Response in 2022. This exercise will also
test allied ability to protect NATO interests in the Arctic. This is
deterrence in action.

**Deterrence and reassurance**

[The balance between **deterrence and reassurance** is our main approach
to **achieve our security goals** for the High North]{.underline}. At
the same time, we continue to be prudent and avoid unnecessary
provocation.

We remain Russia's neighbor, and we [**continue to cooperate with
Russia** on issues such as search and rescue, border patrol, and coast
guard operations to control fisheries.]{.underline} To preserve
stability, [we uphold dialogue while at the same time remain firmly
committed to our values and a rules-based international
order.]{.underline}

I would like to commend the [U.S. for the **continued leadership** in
defense and commitment to European security. Norway and the U.S.
cooperate closely on maritime surveillance and intelligence in the High
North]{.underline}. We also [have **close cooperation** on integrating
fifth-generation capabilities]{.underline} into the force structure, and
our [special forces work shoulder to shoulder around the
globe.]{.underline} As maritime nations, [the U.S. and Norway cooperate
on naval matters around the world. In 2023, we plan to launch two
satellites into orbit in a bilateral effort to establish broadband
satellite communications in the Arctic.]{.underline}

Under shifting administrations, the U[.S. has built lasting
relationships with allies and partners all over the world, including in
the north]{.underline}. We look forward to continuing the close
cooperation with the U.S. and NATO allies to protect our common values
and interests.

**Norway is [stable]{.underline}, covered by [article 5]{.underline},
and [cooperative]{.underline} with Russia**

Centre at the University of Lapland. (Tim, 11-18-2016, "Analysis: The
Arctic conflict - truth, fantasy or a little bit of both?" High North
News,
https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/analysis-arctic-conflict-truth-fantasy-or-little-bit-both)

What do we mean by a conflict? Since [Arctic countries have so much
**practical cooperation,**]{.underline} it is important to ask what sort
of conflicts could occur in the region. [If we are claiming
that]{.underline} the [general deterioration of relations between
Russia]{.underline} and the West [is about to lead to some sort of a
conflict]{.underline}, [it is important to stop and think
what]{.underline} kind of a [conflict]{.underline} we are talking about.
[If a conflict means]{.underline}, for example, [an unresolved dispute
over]{.underline} where [a maritime border]{.underline} should lie, this
does not shock many experts. [Arctic states **have disputed** over their
maritime borders bilaterally and sometimes even at the International
Court of Justice]{.underline}, [but such disputes have been
**settled**]{.underline} sooner or later. [It took]{.underline} more
than [40 years for **Russia and Norway** to resolve a border
dispute]{.underline} [in the Barents Sea]{.underline}, but even this was
settled in 2010. Furthermore, [the dispute did not prevent cooperation
between the countries. Norway]{.underline}, **[a NATO
member]{.underline}**, [and the Soviet Union used to **jointly manage
fish stocks** in the disputed region]{.underline}. In fact, [most of the
Arctic maritime disputes occur between]{.underline} close allies, like
[the United States and Canada]{.underline}. Or, [does a conflict refer
to a single event]{.underline}, which causes diplomatic slanging match?
If, for example, the Coast Guard of the US or Norway seizes a Russian
fishing vessel or a person subject to sanctions travels to Svalbard, can
this be defined as a conflict? [It is very rare that **single events**
escalate into worse conflicts]{.underline} than a mild war of words,
[which is quickly lost]{.underline} in the mists of time. [A case in
point is when a Russian fishing vessel]{.underline} Elektron [escaped
in]{.underline} 2005 from [the Norwegian Coast Guard to]{.underline} the
[Russian territorial waters]{.underline}, [after having been
arrested]{.underline} for illegal fishing. [While the case
lingered]{.underline} for some time, [it did not affect general
long-term Russian-Norwegian relations in the Arctic]{.underline}. [What
would it]{.underline} mean, then, [if the **geopolitical tension**
expanded to the Arctic region]{.underline}? In general, [if **Russian
tensions** grow with **NATO**]{.underline}, it is important to keep in
mind that the Arctic plays a crucial role in Russia's global military
strategy: its Northern Fleet requires access to the Atlantic. We could
also claim that since [Russia has now increased its military presence in
its **Arctic regions**]{.underline}, we have a security dilemma at hand:
Could armament in Russian Arctic also lead to increased military
investment from the part of its neighbors, and such investments
reinforce each other in a vicious circle? [Although the Arctic states
have]{.underline} sometimes [declared they will boost their investments
in]{.underline} measures guaranteeing [Arctic security]{.underline},
[this has not actually occurred]{.underline}. [The United States
has]{.underline} so far [been **unable** to even purchase one new
icebreaker for its Arctic areas]{.underline}. Overall, [it is important
to ask for what purpose Russia is militarily equipping its Arctic
areas]{.underline}. Due to the difficult circumstances in the region,
[militaries are needed in many tasks in the Arctic]{.underline},
[ranging from **rescue tasks** to **safeguarding shipping** in the
Northern Sea Route]{.underline}. It is also important to monitor whether
Russia implements all the planned military investments in its Arctic
areas. They are expensive measures in a country whose economy is not
doing well. It is also important to consider for what strategic purposes
could Russian military act in the Arctic. Russia has demonstrated to
have the ability and will to use also military power to achieve its aims
in foreign policy. This has been visible for a long time, since Russia's
Georgia operation in 2008, and it has accelerated in 2014 with the
annexation of Crimea, war in Eastern Ukraine and military support for
the Syrian government. This consideration leads to two questions:
\"[Could Russia gain anything by military occupation in the
Arctic]{.underline} and what would it even mean in the Arctic?\", and:
\"[What is the difference between Ukraine, Georgia and the
Arctic]{.underline}?\" To the first question: Could it be possible for
Russia to also use military power in forcibly claim the Lomonosov Ridge,
if Denmark-Greenland and perhaps Canada, too, want it? We could also
ask, what would Russia celebrate as a foreign policy win, if it did
conquer the Lomonosov Ridge? It is very likely that Russia receives a
large part of the Lomonosov Ridge and its hypothetical hydrocarbon
resources just by complying with the UNCLOS rules. Furthermore, [most
likely they have nothing **economically exploitable** and even if
something was found]{.underline}, [it would take decades for Russia to
even dream of drilling oil in these areas]{.underline}. As regards the
second question on [differences between Russian actions in the Arctic
and Eastern Europe,]{.underline} [Russia has used military power against
two states]{.underline}, [which both were]{.underline} part of the
[former Soviet Union and]{.underline} which are [not NATO
member]{.underline}s. [It is a different matter to carry out attack in
the Arctic Ocean against **NATO member states**]{.underline}, [which are
covered by **alliance security guarantee**]{.underline}. But could
Putin's regime, then, attack the non-NATO members, Finland and Sweden?
Although these countries are EU member states and thus enjoy a softer
form of security guarantee, the famous fifth article of the North
Atlantic Treaty would not push the alliance to defend Finland and
Sweden. It is important to ask [these]{.underline} types of
[question]{.underline}s, since they [allow us to reflect what Putin's
Russia is **prepared to pursue** with military means in actual
terms]{.underline}. [There are **no signs** of Russia's military
strategy being completely unpredictable]{.underline}. Russia has enabled
the de facto separation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia and
annexed Crimea. All the regions have had a Russian majority, even though
they were part of Georgia and Ukraine. To be sure, safeguarding the
Crimean naval base and access to the Black Sea contributed to the
decision to annex Crimea. Considering Putin's military strategy so far,
it is difficult to draw any parallels between the Georgian regions and
the Crimean Peninsula on one hand and Finland and Sweden on the other.
[The Arctic region **lacks similar reasons** for any **military
confrontation**]{.underline}. If the general tension in the relations ,
however, leads to military actions between Russia and Western powers
elsewhere, however, these confrontations are very likely to expand to
the Arctic region. This is for the present, though, an unlikely course
of events. A more crucial question is this: When do the [relations
between the US and Russia]{.underline} freeze to a point where it starts
to affect [Arctic cooperation]{.underline}, which [has so far been
**largely shielded** from tensions from outside the region]{.underline}?
The recent signs are not promising: The plutonium agreement was
suspended by Russia, the United States and Russia are again on opposite
sides in Syria, and the situation in Eastern Ukraine continues to be
difficult. The situation is constantly changing, and we cannot exclude
the possibility that we reach a point where the deterioration of the
relations also leads to difficulties in the Arctic cooperation. Did we
receive answers to these questions from the election of Donald Trump as
the next US President? On one hand, it seems, Trump and Putin seem to
pull in the same direction, perhaps leading to less confrontational
relations and better Arctic co-operation. However, it is the
unpredictability of Donald Trump that makes it very difficult to say
anything clear on what his foreign policy agenda will eventually look
like. Moreover, the Arctic Council may not be the forum where Trump
would like to pursue his policies, given that the climate change is at
the core of what the Arctic Council does -- a phenomenon that does not
seem to exist for the president-elect.

Whereas the end of the Cold War implied that 'for most other states than
Russia the region has remained either marginal or peripheral', the
[importance of the High North]{.underline} [was revitalised in
Norway]{.underline} with the Norwegian High North strategy from 2005
onwards.73 The [significant Russian military build-up]{.underline} on
the Kola Peninsula from the mid-2000s also [raised concerns]{.underline}
about security among Norwegian politicians, diplomats and militaries. In
particular, the Russian reopening of old military bases, the increased
level of military exercises and, not least, the increase in overflights
of Russian bombers and strategic bombers off the coast of Norway sparked
a new round of 'New Cold War' rhetoric and media headlines.

[Certainly, a more aggressive Russian foreign policy]{.underline}
towards Eastern Europe and Ukraine in 2014 in particular
[has]{.underline} also [put the High North]{.underline}, where Russia
has 'geo-political and military-strategic interests', [back at the top
of the Norwegian security and defence policy agenda]{.underline}.74 For
instance, the main focus of the expert commission was the security
challenges that Russia represents in the region, which they describe as
'an arena for geopolitical struggle'.75 The forward-leaning Russian
foreign policy has also gained a lot of attention in Nordic academic
environments.76 [Even after]{.underline} the [Ukraine]{.underline}
crisis, however, **[Russia has not been considered as a direct threat to
Norway]{.underline}**, at least not at present.77 As formulated by the
head of Norwegian military intelligence, 'Russia has not suddenly become
a military threat---not in the short term. But, in the long term the
picture is more uncertain'.78 Hence the focus on strengthening the
military presence in northern Norway in subsequent defence plans and
reports.79 [Rather than seeing any impending security
threats]{.underline} in the region, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign
Affair's Arctic slogan, '[high north, low tension', emphasises the
safety aspect of Arctic activity.]{.underline}

All of the peacetime, **[cooperative military bilateral and multilateral
arrangements in the Arctic are between the nation states]{.underline}**
in the region. For instance, the Ilulissat Declaration of 2008, signed
by the five Arctic coastal states, established a common framework for
maritime sovereignty in the Arctic Ocean. All [signatories]{.underline}
have [agreed]{.underline} that [claims and disputes are]{.underline} to
be [negotiated between the Arctic coastal states to prevent]{.underline}
the [escalation]{.underline} of political disagreements into security
issues. [Norway and Russia]{.underline}, who have had overlapping claims
in the Barents Sea for decades, finally [managed to conclude
negotiations and sign an agreement]{.underline} in 2010.

The role of NATO in the region has been brought up from time to time.
**[NATO is not]{.underline}**, however, **[likely to increase its
activity in the Arctic in peacetime and]{.underline}** instead
[**encourages the continuation of the coop**eration
**between**]{.underline} all of the **[Arctic states]{.underline}**. The
[defence establishments of the Arctic states promote
peacetime]{.underline} [confidence-building]{.underline} measures.80
[There are regular]{.underline} bilateral and multilateral [military
exercises]{.underline} in the region [that include Russia
and]{.underline} the [individual NATO members]{.underline} among the
Arctic states. There are annual informal meetings between military
leaders from all of the Arctic states where 'soft security' measures and
military support to civilian agencies responsible for safety-related
matters are discussed. [These matters have become increasingly
important]{.underline} with growing levels of human activity in the
Arctic Ocean. This emphasis on safety capabilities corresponds with
recent efforts under the auspices of the Arctic Council that resulted in
a new search and rescue agreement (2011) and an oil-spill preparedness
and response agreement (2013).

The requirement for monitoring and safety arrangements depends on the
volume and scope of future civilian activities. The Arctic may be a
promising area for commercial opportunities. There is a potential for
shorter transcontinental maritime transit though the Northern Sea Route,
increasing the profit and value of extraction of onshore and offshore
petroleum and mineral resources. Analysts, however, have recently
addressed several factors dampening the most optimistic future
predictions. Operations in the Arctic environment can be complex,
difficult (extremely low temperatures and icing contribute to this) and
costly. Profitability of commercial ventures in the Arctic may also be
influenced by the dynamics in the market itself and evolving concepts
for production and distribution.

[The Arctic]{.underline}---where Norway has invested significant
political and economic capital---[can be seen as a unique arena for the
country]{.underline} as a place [where Norway meets and interacts with
many non-Arctic states]{.underline}. Meeting both Arctic and non-Arctic
partners in the High North has been a priority for Norway. For instance,
the rapidly growing economies of Asia have expressed a particular
interest in the Arctic, which has coincided with Norway's recognition of
Asia as an increasingly important arena for Norwegian foreign policy.81
Similar to its other Nordic regional partners, [Norway has been
forthcoming and welcoming of Asian states' Arctic
interests]{.underline}, as **[it encourages broad dialogue
on]{.underline}** issues affecting **[the Arctic and competence
sharing.]{.underline}** Norway welcomes the diverse opinions,
complementary expertise and outside-of-the-Arctic thinking that
non-Arctic states can provide. Norway has developed especially close
bilateral ties on Arctic issues with Singapore, South Korea and Japan.
South Korea has prioritised Norway as a cooperation partner in Arctic
and regular bilateral interactions between Norway and Singapore and
Norway and South Korea have also strengthened collaborative commitments
and interest in the region.82 Norway proclaimed its support of the Asian
states' inclusion in the Arctic Council in early 2013 and continued to
play a role in the states' ultimate acceptance and inclusion in the
council's ministerial meeting in Kiruna, Sweden, in May 2013. This
[receptive attitude]{.underline} [towards]{.underline} the [Asian states
can be]{.underline} in part [explained by a Norwegian interest in
revitalising the Arctic Council]{.underline}.83 [Given its geographic
placement and record in the High North,]{.underline} [Norway can play a
significant role as a gatekeeper and facilitator of non-Arctic states'
interests]{.underline} in the region, [which can in turn have positive
offshoots in other bilateral, regional and international
settings.84]{.underline}

**No Norway-Russia war**\-\--robust [cooperation]{.underline} and
[mutual interests]{.underline}.

Andreas **Østhagen 18**, Senior Fellow at The Arctic Institute, Senior
Research Fellow at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, Ph.D. in International
Relations from the University of British Columbia, "How Norway and
Russia avoid Conflict over Svalbard," The Arctic Institute, 06-19-2018,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/norway-russia-avoid-conflict-svalbard/

In 1977, Norway established a maritime Fisheries Protection Zone (FPZ)
around the Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard. [Norway avoided claiming an
outright]{.underline} Exclusive Economic Zone ([EEZ]{.underline})
[fearing it would be challenged due to]{.underline} stipulations (or
lack thereof) concerning extended maritime zones in [the Svalbard
Treaty]{.underline} from 1920.1) A dispute with Russia over the status
of the Zone arose, although the two countries quickly agreed to disagree
as long as Russian fishermen would have access to fisheries in the Zone.

In the late 1990s, Norwegian fisheries enforcement in the FPZ became
stricter, in tandem with declining fish stocks and fear of considerable
illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Barents Sea.
This led the Norwegian Coast Guard to attempt to arrest Russian fishing
vessels on several occasions, resulting in reactions from Russian
fishermen, as well as officials in Murmansk and Moscow.2) In 1998, 2001,
2005, and 2011 specifically, incidents had the potential to escalate
beyond a fisheries issue.

Today, the [risk of events spiralling out of control]{.underline} in the
FPZ [remains a primary concern for both the Norwegian Coast Guard
and]{.underline} the Norwegian [Ministry of Defence.]{.underline}
Echoing these fears, in 2017 the Russian Defence Ministry deemed
Svalbard a potential area for future conflict with Norway, and in
consequence NATO.3) Given the potential volatility of events in the FPZ,
how do **[Norway and Russia]{.underline}** manage to **[avoid escalation
in the case of a crisis]{.underline}**? Two intertwining relationships
are integral to answering this.

Interest alignment

First, [**coop**eration **can be the product of discord**]{.underline}.
In other words, states cooperate when they disagree. Sometimes
[institutions are needed to overcome the self-help tendencies of the
international system]{.underline}. Along this line of argumentation,
[cooperation between Norway and Russia concerning shared fish stocks,
oil spill response, search and rescue, and ship traffic management are
formalised arrangements]{.underline} set up [to manage]{.underline}
potential areas of [discord]{.underline}. Along the same line of
argumentation, the Barents Sea maritime boundary agreement in 2010 was a
result of interests between the two states converging sufficiently.4)

In other words, **[the reason why Norway and Russia]{.underline}**
manage to **[keep crises from escalating]{.underline}** further **[is
mutual interest in preserving]{.underline}** aspects of their
[**coop**eration]{.underline}; cooperation that benefits both parties.
This relates to multiple issue areas. Concerning resource management,
Russia is assumed to be satisfied with the current quota scheme, in
contrast to what might be achieved if an actual debate over the status
of the FPZ took place.5) Concerning the UNCLOS-regime, [both
parties]{.underline} [benefit from a stable legal regime]{.underline} in
the FPZ specifically, but also [in the Arctic]{.underline} at large.6)
And concerning national security, [both]{.underline} parties [have an
interest in low levels of conflict for fear of coercive efforts by other
actors within and outside the Barents/Arctic region]{.underline}.7)

The interests that drive cooperation might, however, be subject to
change (over time). We can see changes taking place within all the
issue-areas addressed: as climate change continues to alter the marine
resource base in the Barents Sea; as external actors challenge the
validity of the UNCLOS-regime in the Arctic; or as the power relations
between various actors fluctuate. The institutions set up to manage
cooperation are also challenged and questions of institutional
resilience become salient: how will cooperative mechanisms adapt as
conditions influencing the premise for cooperation change?8)

For example, as Norway and Russia struggled to reach agreement on a
reduction of annual quotas for the Barents Sea in the early 2000s,
several institutional measures were taken. In 2002, a harvest control
rule was introduced in the Joint Fisheries Commission to set quotas
according to scientific advice while also limiting fluctuations from
year to year. This has been described as the most important change in
the work of the Commission, removing a source of friction between the
two states (which had spill-over effects into the FPZ).9)

Talking to your neighbour

Second, [as emphasised by officials in the Norwegian Coast
Guard]{.underline}, former Coast Guard officers, [and]{.underline}
multiple [scholarly works]{.underline} written on the management of
shared fish stocks in the Barents Sea, **[personal contact between
individuals constitute a core element of conflict
management]{.underline}** in the Barents Sea. [The importance of
dialogue during a crisis is given]{.underline} much [credit for
**solv**ing incidents between the Norwegian Coast Guard and **Russia**n
fishing vessels]{.underline}. This includes communication between the
Coast Guard and Russian trawlers (including the use of Russian
interpreters); between the Norwegian Joint Military Headquarters and the
Chief of the Russian Northern Fleet at Severomorsk; and between the
negotiating groups in the Joint Fisheries Commission.

[Having various means of communicating, and keeping channels
open]{.underline} as a crisis is unfolding, [constitute central elements
in the management of conflict]{.underline} in the FPZ. This can be
linked to the notion of 'track two diplomacy', albeit without an
immediate large-scale international crisis as an impetus. Still,
**[instilling so called low-level or 'soft' dialogue]{.underline}** in
addition **[to other more formal channels]{.underline}** of
communication, **[have]{.underline}** -- in this case -- **[provided an
effective approach to conflict management]{.underline}**.10)

This concerns the larger concept of personal relations, as social
contact between two or more individuals representing different sides in
a dispute. The theory of socialisation emphasises not only the
communication component, but also the fact that a change occurs between
the parties. Norms (expected behaviour) socialise (change) actors
according to a logic of appropriateness.11) [By interacting regularly
with the same individuals on the same issues]{.underline} (fisheries,
quotas, inspections) [over time, mutual understanding emerges as the
individuals]{.underline} themselves [better comprehend the position of
the other party.]{.underline}

Maintaining low tension

[Personal relations]{.underline} have [formed]{.underline} the basis for
the [institutionalisation of]{.underline} some of the
[mechanisms]{.underline} described above, [that enable **coop**eration
between Norway and Russia]{.underline} in this specific instance.
Examples include the exchange of coast guard officers from Norway and
Russia, as well as the formalised sharing of information and annual
meetings between the Chiefs of the coast guards. This
institutionalisation and its relevance for the issues at hand in the
Barents Sea at large, and the FPZ specifically, played a central part in
sheltering the coast guard cooperation from sanctions and restrictions
put in place between Norway and Russia in 2014.12) **[There
is]{.underline}** thus [**a feedback loop taking place between
institutionalisation and personal interaction**s**.**]{.underline}

This article does not attempt to outline a monocausal explanation for
success in maritime dispute management. Instead, the aim is to showcase
how [multiple explanations]{.underline} [emphasising different aspects
of conflict relations contribute to the outcome]{.underline}. In sum,
several factors concerning the dispute in the Svalbard Zone help explain
why it has been managed adequately in the context of a larger quarrel.

Looking ahead, [the writing on the wall is relatively clear: to maintain
low tension in the zone around Svalbard, Norway and Russia]{.underline}
need both be aware of the factors that [keep their relations
civil]{.underline}. Upholding dialogue between the two countries' coast
guards regardless of fluctuating international relations is crucial. So
is establishing and re-developing cooperative mechanisms such as the
Joint Fisheries Commission, as the resource situation in Arctic waters
might change.

**[No Escalation---Moral Hazard]{.underline}**

**No impact to moral hazard\-\--the [higher the hazard]{.underline}, the
[less likely]{.underline} conflict occurs**

**Benson 14**, Associate Professor of Political Science and Asian
Studies at Vanderbilt University (Brett, "Inducing Deterrence through
Moral Hazard in Alliance Contracts," *The Journal of Conflict
Resolution*, 58.2)

[Do]{.underline} military [alliances cause allies to act]{.underline} so
[aggressively]{.underline} that their behavior undermines the security
goal of the alliance? If so, then leaders may be cautious about joining
an alliance, doing so only if they can select safe alliance partners or
design the terms of the treaty in a way that captures the deterrence
benefits while managing the dangers of overaggression. We show that
[while alliance commitments may cause alliance partners to behave
aggressively]{.underline}, under some conditions the [added
aggressiveness actually **enhances deterrence**]{.underline}. From this
perspective, the effectiveness of an alliance is related both to the
structure and to the content of the treaty.

This view stands in contrast to the standard explanation that the
content of an alliance agreement is designed to balance the benefit of
deterring an enemy against the risk of emboldening an ally (Fearon 1997;
Snyder 1997; Yuen 2009). Our approach builds on existing models of
alliance formation (Morrow 1994; Smith 1995) but adds intra-alliance
contracting over the benefits from successful deterrence. Specifically,
avoiding a conflict that they otherwise might expect creates a surplus
equal to the foregone cost of war, which may be divided among alliance
partners.

To facilitate an understanding of the intuition, we suggest that
military alliances share many similarities with standard insurance
contracts. Much as an auto insurance policy stipulates how much a policy
holder will receive if he or she is in an accident, an alliance
agreement likewise often describes how much aid an ally will provide to
the attacked party if there is a war. For example, the 1656 Treaty of
Defensive Alliance between Brandenburg and France enumerates precisely
the amount and form of aid each ally would provide to the other if it
was attacked: Brandenburg pledged 2,400 men and 600 horses to France
while France promised 5,000 men, 1,200 horses, and artillery to
Brandenburg. In the 1893 Franco-Russian alliance, France promised to
supply 1.3 million troops and Russia pledged to contribute 700,000 to
800,000 troops in a conflict against Germany.1

Furthermore, in an insurance contract, the size of the insurance premium
the insured pays usually depends on the amount of risk being indemnified
by the insurance provider: the more risk for the insurer, the higher the
premium. Our explanation of the content of alliance commitments likewise
ties the level of support to the amount of security risk alliance
partners face. That is, leaders of threatened countries may look to team
up with each other, and the amount of support they promise one another
may depend on the amount of threat each faces. However, insurance
against risk carries with it the potential problem of moral hazard,
which occurs when the guarantee of indemnity distorts the insured\'s
behavior because the insurance policy insulates her from the risks of
her actions (Pauly 1968, 1974; Shavell 1979). Just as insured motorists
may exercise less caution in their driving, states insured by alliance
treaties have an incentive to behave more aggressively in negotiating
with other states.

Generally, scholars of alliances take the position that moral hazard
creates potentially harmful effects. Most notably, Snyder (1984, 1997)
and Christensen and Snyder (1990) claim that alliances "embolden" state
leaders to "entrap" unwilling allies in wars that they would prefer to
avoid. Yuen (2009) shows that moral hazard increases allied states'
level of aggression in crisis bargaining, and this added aggression may
heighten the risk of war or affect the bargaining settlements. [As a
result of the potential harmful effects of moral hazard, scholars argue
that leaders may]{.underline} either [avoid]{.underline}
[alliances]{.underline}, screen alliance partners based on their
likelihood of behaving recklessly, or attempt to design treaties
carefully so as to balance their dueling goals of deterring external
threats while restraining alliance partners (Snyder 1984, 1997; Jervis
1994; Zagare and Kilgour 2003, 2006; Yuen 2009).

A more subtle side effect of moral hazard, however, is that states may
be attracted to alliances because the tendency of an ally to behave
aggressively actually enhances deterrence. The possibility that an
allied state will negotiate aggressively may cause third-party
adversaries to refrain from initiating a crisis. Likewise, a defensive
alliance might make an alliance partner more willing to retaliate if
challenged because it benefits from its ally's support in war; this may
cause a prospective adversary to be reluctant to initiate a challenge
targeting the alliance partner (Smith 1995).

In cases where [moral hazard advances the deterrence objective of an
alliance]{.underline}, [there is little cost to entrapment]{.underline},
[because the]{.underline} third-party [adversary calibrates its
hostility toward the allies based on]{.underline} its [expectation about
its likelihood of winning a conflict if the target of its challenge does
not capitulate]{.underline}. [The combination of added resources from an
ally and the increased willingness of the target to fight
back]{.underline} [**encourages the third party** to refrain from
initiating violence]{.underline}. When encouraging an alliance partner
to fight back if it is attacked enhances deterrence, then the goal of
the contract is to induce a maximal amount of moral hazard so as to
deter potential aggressors to such an extent that the risk of conflict
is negligible. In this case, allies are not called upon to expend costly
resources in support of their partners, as **[no conflict
occurs]{.underline}**. **[Thus]{.underline}**, a priori, **[it seems
equally likely that moral hazard will deter]{.underline}** would-be
challenges or increase the likelihood of **[conflict]{.underline}**.
Therefore, an important challenge for a theory of alliances is to
identify the conditions under which moral hazard serves the deterrence
purpose of the alliance rather than causing harmful effects that
undermine the alliance's objective.

In this article, [we explore the relationship between nuclear umbrellas,
militarized conflict, and crisis bargaining]{.underline}. [Drawing on
existing bargaining theories of war, we argue that, because war is
costly, both parties in a crisis have an **incentive to avoid
fighting**]{.underline}. This implies that---[in
equilibrium]{.underline}---the [impact of a nuclear umbrella on the risk
of war between a client state protected under a nuclear umbrella and a
potential target should generally be **zero**, assuming information is
complete, **commitments are credible**, and the stakes are
divisible]{.underline}. However, this does not mean that such
commitments are benign, or that they pose no risk to potential targets
and nuclear patrons. Instead, [we argue that a client state's
expectation that its power will be augmented in the event of war (by
that of its nuclear patron) will make it more likely to expand the scope
of its demands and seek to revise the status quo.]{.underline} Because
war is generally ex post inefficient, leaders of target states are
likely to offer concessions in the amount that reflects the changed
balance of power, rather than fight a costly war. Thus, we argue that
[the risk of moral hazard from nuclear umbrellas should be observable in
the bargaining outcomes short of war, if not in the observable patterns
of militarized conflict]{.underline}.

[We begin by investigating whether nuclear umbrellas generate a risk of
moral hazard by increasing the risk of]{.underline} militarized
interstate disputes (**[MIDs]{.underline}**). [We find evidence that
protection under a nuclear umbrella **slightly** increases the risk that
a client state protected under a nuclear umbrella will initiate an MID
compared to a state that lacks this protection]{.underline}.
**[However]{.underline}**, [we find that this overall effect is **driven
entirely** by **one-sided** use of force initiated by the client state
protected under a nuclear umbrella that **never escalates** to the
reciprocal use of force by the target state.]{.underline} At the same
time that targets appear to avoid the reciprocal use of force, [we find
strong evidence that a client state's protection under a nuclear
umbrella is **positively associated** with the likelihood that a crisis
will **include a peaceful settlement attempt** and an increased
likelihood that a target will offer policy concessions to the client
state.]{.underline} Together, the results along both
dimensions---conflict and bargaining outcomes---are consistent with the
observable implications of the theory.

**That means the aff is the wrong response---prefer comparative
evidence**

Conclusion

In this article, we address a long-standing question in the academic and
policy communities about the role of nuclear umbrellas in broader
interstate relations. Specifically, we examine how client states behave
under the protection of a nuclear patron by investigating two important
dimensions of behavior: the initiation of militarized disputes and
bargaining outcomes short of war. We find that, although [client states
protected under a nuclear umbrella]{.underline} are no more likely to
initiate MIDs against a target state that escalate to war or the
reciprocated use of force, these states, nevertheless,
[appear]{.underline} more [emboldened to initiate crises.
**However**]{.underline}, [these crises tend **not to escalate** to
higher levels of **militarized conflict** because target states appear
to act in **equilibrium**: preferring to settle disputes **peacefully**
rather than resist militarily through costly fighting]{.underline}. We
find that [client states]{.underline} protected [under a nuclear
umbrella are]{.underline} more [often]{.underline} the [recipients of
**policy concessions** from]{.underline} their [targets compared to
states that lack protection]{.underline} under a nuclear umbrella.
Together, these results provide comprehensive support for our argument
that there is some risk of moral hazard in a client state protected
under a nuclear umbrella, as clients appear more emboldened and more
successful at revising the status quo in expectation of a patron coming
to their aid. The urgency to understand the strategic consequences of
nuclear umbrellas is perhaps most real today, as the United States seeks
to rebalance its overall security portfolio to the Asia-Pacific in
anticipation of a rising China and to provide additional assurances to
its allies in the Middle East in light of potential proliferation
challenges. And yet, we have surprisingly little evidence that such
commitments are effective at reducing the risk of conflict on net, given
the widely presumed, but still untested, risk for moral hazard in the
client state. Meanwhile, policymakers in the United States and abroad
continue to propose expanding the US nuclear umbrella while further
reassuring allies covered within it. Our research suggests that the
expansion of the nuclear umbrella may perversely exacerbate the concerns
of potential targets and inadvertently destabilize the status quo by
increasing the risk of a crisis and the opportunity for bargaining to
fail. If client states protected under a nuclear umbrella are encouraged
to pursue more aggressive military and diplomatic policies toward other
states, this may pose an increased risk of conflict to patrons,
particularly as nuclear patrons like the United States seek to
strengthen and reaffirm their commitments to their allies. Of course,
this risk must be balanced against any risk of moral hazard that might
flow from a client state protected under a nuclear umbrella, or any
potential nonnuclear state, acquiring its own nuclear weapons in the
absence of such commitments (N. Narang 2015). [It may very well be the
case that nuclear umbrellas cause]{.underline} emboldenment/[moral
hazard, but]{.underline} that **[this is nonetheless preferable to the
nuclear emboldenment that would result if the state acquired nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** (Kapur 2007). In so far as the net effect is
unclear, it is possible that **[policymakers might want to persist in
offering nuclear umbrellas to states in order to prevent proliferation
despite their moral hazard inducing consequences]{.underline}** (Mehta
2017).16

This [argument has been supported by the data gathered from the
Correlates of War Project]{.underline}. The data showed that for [both
weak and medium powered states, **alliance membership** with a conflict
originator had a **significant impact** on the decision of the state to
enter into a conflict]{.underline} that it did not initiate. However,
the same level of significance was not found for high-powered states.
Thus, the first hypothesis, that a [**great power** or strong state will
**not necessarily feel compelled** to join in conflicts initiated by
alliance partners because the state is stable enough that changes in the
strength of alliance member **do not impact the security of the state**,
has been supported by this study]{.underline}. The second hypothesis,
that a weak or medium power state will be compelled to join in conflicts
initiated by alliance partners, even when the conflict may go against
the state\'s desires or the mandate of the alliance has also been
supported by the data. This indicates that the explanation of alliance
behavior backed by the logic of rational deterrence is more accurate
than the explanations provided by the grievance model, which predicts
that this joining behavior would not occur across all three groups, or
the Rubicon model, which predicts that it would occur uniformly across
the groups.
