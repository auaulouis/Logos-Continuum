[Trump's musings about a **NATO withdrawal** have served as a **wake-up
call** for some in Europe that Europeans urgently need to assume greater
responsibility for their own security.]{.underline} This realization is
one of the reasons why closer defense cooperation and a greater degree
of strategic autonomy are high on the European Union's agenda. But are
Europeans able to defend themselves? How would they think about their
defense without the United States?

[**A policy game**]{.underline} prepared by Körber-Stiftung and the
International Institute for Strategic Studies sought to answer these
questions this summer in Berlin. [Five country teams with experts from
France, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States
addressed a fictional scenario that involved a U.S. withdrawal from
NATO]{.underline}, followed by crises in a NATO member state in the
western Balkans and across Eastern Europe. How would Europeans react to
such a scenario? What are the red lines, interests, and priorities of
the respective actors? [How might Europeans organize their defense if
the United States withdraws from NATO, and what role could the United
States play in European security after the withdrawal?]{.underline}

The results of the game were sobering, with no clear upside for any of
the participating teams. While a one-time simulation exercise, it
provided valuable insights into the interests and preferences of
European member states.

At the beginning of the policy game, most European teams adopted a
"wait-and-see" approach focused on persuading the United States to
return to NATO, offering concessions that were unthinkable before (from
trade to energy). The unfortunate message for transatlantic relations
seems to be that a threat to abandon NATO might actually yield some
results.

Europeans started to take proactive steps only once the security
situation in the scenario deteriorated significantly, and when it became
clear that the U.S. withdrawal decision --- at least in this simulation
--- was irreversible. Faced with a crisis in a NATO member state in the
western Balkans (in the scenario, a pro-Russian coup d'état with Russian
warships blocking access to the Mediterranean Sea), most teams
anticipated that remaining NATO members would struggle to agree to
invoke the principle of collective defense under Article 5 in this
grey-zone scenario. Instead, the invocation of Article 4 --- which
involves only consultations in case the security or independence of a
NATO member state is threatened --- paired with sanctions on Russia and
a robust response within ad-hoc coalitions were the preferred means of
action. **[Without U.S. security guarantees]{.underline}**, it seems,
the credibility of Article 5 and the [mutual defense commitment are
questionable.]{.underline}

And then it got worse: In case of an escalation in the east (an incident
akin to the Cuban missile crisis, involving an extended-range version of
the SSC-8 Screwdriver land attack cruise missile with a range in excess
of 4,500 km stationed in western Russia), European shortfalls especially
in air and missile defense were identified as an existential risk for
European countries without nuclear capabilities after the United States
has withdrawn all nuclear and missile defense assets in the scenario.
Given that [**filling these gaps** would require **long-term
investment**, Europe would likely remain vulnerable]{.underline} for
years to come in such a scenario.

Especially for Germany, [a U.S. withdrawal from NATO would represent an
**existential security threat**. The German team suggested
exploring]{.underline} the possibilities of the Franco-German Aachen
Treaty of 2019 and [asking **France** and the **United Kingdom** to
**expand their nuclear umbrellas**]{.underline} to other European
countries. Developing a German nuclear weapons capacity was considered
an unlikely option, due to domestic opposition. Yet, [expanding the
British and French nuclear umbrella would come at a significant cost:
The **burden-sharing debate** would return to Europe. Nuclear deterrence
will remain the Gretchenfrage of European security, and if expanding the
British and French nuclear umbrella fails, some teams anticipated a
**proliferation of nuclear weapons in Europe**.]{.underline}

When it comes to institutional frameworks, from a French perspective,
NATO would be dead without the United States: The French team preferred
a new, E.U.-centered collective defense structure in the long term, with
other actors affiliating on a bilateral basis. This position was met
with skepticism especially from the British and Polish side; Germany,
Poland, and the United Kingdom were adamant that the NATO command
structure should be maintained after a U.S. withdrawal and provide
possibilities for the United States to "opt in" to any future security
structure.

A post-Brexit United Kingdom, as envisioned in the scenario, would
consider itself a leading actor in European security, willing and
capable of shaping Europe's future security architecture. Given its
significant defense capabilities, [the U.K. team saw its country in a
powerful negotiating position and was skeptical of French and German
leadership on defense issues. British red lines were]{.underline} the
following: [**No E.U. army**, **no E.U. alliance** or, as they said, the
United Kingdom wants to **design** European security, not just **sign**
on a **dotted line.**]{.underline}

As [the representative for NATO's **most
vulnerable**-feeling]{.underline} eastern [member states, the Polish
team **did not trust** Europe's **ability** to organize collective
defense and was tempted to **conclude bilateral deals** with the
**United States**.]{.underline} As the Polish team said, if the United
States withdraws, the eastern flank should be the last place. [**A
"bilateralization" of security** and defense with the United States,
including bilateral security guarantees, is the likely
consequence.]{.underline} Interestingly, [all teams **rejected Russian
overtures** for **conflict resolution** in exchange for concessions on
security, such as drafting a European security]{.underline} treaty based
on Medvedev's 2008 proposals. This demonstrates that Russia was not
considered a credible security provider in Europe, despite suspicions
that Germany might be tempted to engage in a dialogue with Russia on
this.

Very few Americans could find tiny Montenegro on a map. Fewer still
could offer a cogent description of the differences between Slovenia and
Slovakia.

Most can't name the three Baltic countries. Yet [thanks to Article 5 of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's charter]{.underline}, which was
signed 70 years ago in Washington[, every American is bound by law to
defend with blood and treasure each of those nations, and 22 others to
boot.]{.underline}

To many who lived through the Cold War, [the alliance may seem like an
obvious good deal]{.underline}. [By binding Europe's democracies
together, [NATO **decreased**]{.mark} the chances of the **brutal
[conflicts]{.mark}** [that dominated the continent]{.mark} through the
end of World War]{.underline} II. [NATO provided a **strong
[counterweight]{.mark}** [to Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, and communism
more broadly, helping defeat that ideology virtually without firing a
shot. And when the U.S. went to war in Afghanistan after 9/11, the NATO
allies went with us in their first and only exercise of Article 5.

Most of all, for decades NATO--the alliance for which I was Supreme
Allied Commander from 2009 to 2013--was America's forward operating base
for democracy, embodying shared values that were worth defending and
even dying for.

But the Cold War is long over, and new challenges require clear
thinking, not nostalgia. Originally conceived, as its first leader, Lord
"Pug" Ismay, quipped, "to keep the Russians out, the Americans in and
the Germans down," what exactly does NATO exist to do now? Its expansion
to the tiny countries named above raises legitimate questions of common
purpose and shared values. Russia is back and playing a much subtler
role in undermining and threatening the organization. China's emergence
as America's most powerful global competitor makes NATO seem
anachronistic. Is the alliance, as President Donald Trump called it,
"obsolete"?

The short answer is no. [Many of the American interests it served in the
Cold War are still advanced by NATO today, and [walking away]{.mark}
from the alliance [will]{.mark} likely **[cost us]{.mark} more** than
staying and strengthening]{.underline} it. That shared fate is being
celebrated in early April as NATO marks its 70th anniversary in
Washington with events including an address by its Secretary-General to
a joint session of Congress. But to save the alliance and advance the
democratic values it was founded to defend, its leaders must take
aggressive, creative action.

[The fact is, [NATO is **in trouble.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The original alliance was optimized for the lengthy, bipolar Cold War
and had a relatively simple mission: stop the Soviets. It was a very
costly approach that required massive expenditures on troops in
Europe--around 400,000 at one point, compared with 62,000 today. But
[with only a dozen original members and a few added along the way, NATO
was relatively tight in both size and mission.]{.underline}

After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, NATO 2.0 began with a breath of
optimism, sometimes described as a "new world order," with the U.S.
firmly in the driver's seat and the alliance reaching out in friendship
to the former Warsaw Pact countries--including to the Russian
Federation. This was a sort of springtime in European security when the
idea of a Europe "whole and free" and at peace, as then President George
H.W. Bush envisioned it, felt distinctly possible. [But a combination of
[Russia's]{.mark} **increasing [resentment]{.mark}** as its former
allies joined NATO [and]{.mark} the global drama of the **[9/11]{.mark}
attacks** [created a new reality]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[At the same time, [NATO 2.0 began conducting counterterrorism]{.mark}
and antipiracy campaigns in Iraq, Libya, the Horn of Africa and Syria,
either through formal alliance missions or close cooperation among
alliance members. These "[out of area" operations became]{.mark}
increasingly **controversial and [damaged]{.mark}** not only the
popularity of the alliance with other countries but also political
cohesion within it.]{.underline} I felt this constantly in Brussels as
Supreme Allied Commander, briefing the leadership of the then 28
nations: the air and sea campaign in Libya truly split the alliance; the
Afghan campaign, with its rising casualty count, appeared to be a
quagmire; and, later, debates over whether to have a formal NATO mission
in Syria, on the border of NATO member Turkey, led to difficult sparring
matches in the North Atlantic Council, the governing body of the
alliance. It felt like the organization was fragmenting badly at the
beginning of the second decade of the 21st century.

It [was the avowed NATO hater Vladimir [Putin]{.mark}, ironically, who
**[revitalized the alliance]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} launched NATO 3.0.
Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014 [gave **new
purpose** to NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. I vividly remember attending an
alliance meeting shortly after I took command in 2009 during which
Chiefs of Defense of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania laid out a
passionate, intelligence-based briefing on the possibility of Russian
intervention in the Baltic countries. I assessed it to be a very low
probability at that moment, but in the years afterward, I became
increasingly concerned. We updated our NATO defensive war plans,
conducted significant training exercises and requested additional forces
across the organization to maintain a higher level of readiness.
[[Putin's]{.mark} **subsequent [actions]{.mark}**, including the
shooting down of a Malaysia Airlines jet over Ukraine [and **increased
aggression**]{.mark} in the air and on the high seas [around
NATO]{.mark}'s periphery, **[drew the alliance
together]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

But even as NATO reawakened, the challenge from outside was changing.
[[Putin has practiced "**hybrid warfare**]{.mark}" against his
neighbors, the would-be NATO members Georgia and Ukraine]{.underline}. A
lethal mixture of propaganda, social-network manipulation,
cyberoperations, special forces and unconventional terrorist-like
attacks poses a different kind of threat than the tanks and missiles of
the Cold War. Could Russia make a similar set of moves on a NATO ally?

Unlikely, but possible. And that [[threat]{.mark} only [gets more
difficult to counter with]{.mark} the advent of **[advanced]{.mark}
military [technology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As the tools of
**offensive [cyberwarfare]{.mark}** [continue to grow]{.mark}--making
definitive attribution of an attack difficult to
achieve--[Russia]{.mark} might be tempted to **[subvert smaller]{.mark}
NATO [allies]{.mark}** in the Baltics or the Balkans]{.underline}. Doing
so, Moscow might calculate, could create fissures in the alliance as the
larger nations debate their willingness to fight for a tiny ally. Over
time such a strategy could cleverly apply pressure to the real Achilles'
heel of NATO, its already shaky political will. It would be a smart
tactical move by Putin, who seems increasingly prepared to bet that the
answer to the foundational question--Would you die for NATO?--is, for
many, no.

President Trump is compounding that danger. He excoriated the alliance
during the 2016 campaign and hectors the allies at every turn to
increase their level of defense spending. That tactic admittedly has had
some effect, as several allies have finally stepped up their spending to
pledged levels. But it comes at a cost, creating resentment and division
in response to the President's hostile and threatening tone. Worst of
all, Trump himself has called into question America's Article 5
commitment on multiple occasions, most recently with regard to
Montenegro.

That creeping lack of common purpose poses perhaps the greatest risk to
NATO. Signs of authoritarianism are already emerging in some of the
allied nations, like Poland, Hungary and Turkey. The looming danger of
Brexit seems to cut against the core values of the alliance. And the
abdication of NATO leadership by the U.S., which for so long stood as a
standard of democratic governance for the world, threatens the
foundation on which the alliance rests.

For all those harbingers of trouble, though, by many traditional
measures, NATO remains extremely healthy.

[[It is **powerful**]{.mark}. The 29 nations of NATO produce **more than
50%** of the world's gross domestic product,]{.underline} have well over
3 million troops on duty, operate massive combined naval fleets and air
forces and together spend over \$1 trillion on defense. Indeed, even
with all the frustration over European defense spending not hitting the
2% of GDP goal, the collective European defense budget is the second
largest in the world after the U.S.'s and is ahead of China's and
Russia's--combined.

[It is **[smart]{.mark}**]{.underline}. U[.S. and European defense
**innovation** and production provides a formidable military **research
and development** capacity]{.underline}. Particularly in cybersecurity,
unmanned vehicles, space operations, special-forces technologies,
maritime and anti-submarine capability, and air and missile defense,
NATO is a technology and education superpower.

[It is **[capable]{.mark}**. The alliance boasts a large command
structure of **highly qualified teams** of military officers from all of
the 29 nations]{.underline}. Throughout Europe and the East Coast of the
U.S., [those [teams prepare **war plans**]{.mark}, conduct **training
exercises**, monitor readiness of allied units, **gather intelligence**
about potential adversaries and [run complex operations]{.mark} centers
that cover the entire geographic range of NATO]{.underline}. These
standing staffs, which we rationalized by reducing them 35% while I was
NATO commander, can conduct prompt and sustained combat operations in a
coalition structure on short notice.

Just as important as NATO's health is the fact that we still need it.
Geography matters, and the European peninsula is particularly well
located on the western edge of the Eurasian landmass. When I was the
Supreme Allied Commander at NATO, people would say to me, "Why do we
need all those useless Cold War bases?" My reply was simple: They are
not Cold War bases but rather the forward operating stations of the U.S.
in the 21st century. [When necessary, they allow us to operate in the
Middle East and Africa. But they primarily serve as a bulwark: [NATO is
**not global**]{.mark} in its scope, scale or ambition [and will
remain]{.mark} **tightly focused** [on the North
Atlantic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Moreover, despite all the frustrations of coalition warfare, most
observers would agree with Winston Churchill that "there is only one
thing worse than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without
them." [[The **greatest**]{.mark} **single [advantage]{.mark}** the U.S.
has on the global stage [is]{.mark} our network of **[allies]{.mark},
partners and friends**. [That]{.mark} network [is under]{.mark}
**deliberate [pressure]{.mark}**[: from China]{.mark}, with its "One
Belt, One Road" competitive strategy, [and]{.mark} from [Russia]{.mark},
with its relentless attacks on coalition unity[. A **strong NATO**
means]{.mark} not only having allies in a fight, should it come to that,
but also [a **powerful deterrent**]{.mark} to the aggression of
ambitious adversaries.]{.underline}

[Perhaps [NATO's]{.mark} greatest accomplishment is not even its
[unblemished record of **deterring attack**]{.mark} against its members
but rather the fact that **no alliance nation has** ever **attacked
another**]{.underline}. [NATO's most fundamental deliverable has been
peace among Europe's major powers **[for 70 years]{.mark}** after two
millennia of unhesitating slaughter on the continent. The]{.underline}
disasters of the 20th century alone pulled the U.S. into two world wars
that killed more than half a million Americans.

History provides few achievements that compare to those seven decades of
peace. They were built not on the ambitions of cold-eyed leaders but
something more noble. NATO is a pool of partners who, despite some
egregious outliers, by and large share fundamental values--democracy,
liberty, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, gender equality, and
racial equality. Admittedly we execute those values imperfectly, and
they are stronger in some NATO countries than in others. But they are
the right values, and there is no other place on earth where the U.S.
could find such a significant number of like-minded nations that are
willing to bind themselves with us in a defensive military treaty.

So what can NATO do to ensure the alliance continues to provide value
for all the members in general, and for the U.S. in particular? What
would a NATO 4.0 look like?

[The alliance should up its game in **cybersecurity**, both defensively
and in the collective development of new **offensive
cybertools**]{.underline}. Geographically, [the alliance needs more
focus on the Arctic; as global warming opens shipping lanes and access
to hydrocarbons, geopolitical [competition **will
increase**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We should taper off the Afghan mission,
perhaps maintaining a small training cadre in country and continuing to
help the Afghan security forces push the Taliban to negotiate peace.

There is work to do in consolidating the Balkans, where tensions among
Serbs, Croats and Balkan Muslims threaten to erupt into war again. NATO
can continue to have a small mission there to help continue the arc of
reconciliation. The alliance will need to be forthright in dealing with
Russia, confronting Putin where we must--in its invasion and continued
occupation of Ukraine--but at the same time attempting to reduce
operational tensions and find zones of cooperation.

Geographically, the biggest challenge ahead will be the Middle East. The
NATO nations do not agree on an approach with Iran, which is an
aggressive actor in the region with significant ambitions that will
impact NATO. Developing better partnerships with the Arab world, which
began in earnest with the Libyan campaign and continued into Syrian
operations against the so-called Islamic State alongside various NATO
allies in the U.S.-led coalition, makes sense. Working far more closely
with Israel would pay dividends for the alliance.

And what of other tiny, would-be members, the next Montenegros? NATO
should accept North Macedonia to stabilize the south Balkans, then halt
expansion. It should build global partnerships with democracies like
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, India and other Indo-Pacific nations.

Should we be prepared to fight and die in a NATO campaign? Yes. On
balance, the alliance still provides strategic benefit to the U.S. We
should support this venerable organization, encourage our allies to
increase their defense spending and push them to operate with us on key
challenges. We should demand that they help us build a NATO 4.0 that is
even more fit for the decades ahead.

We should also remember how dangerous the world can be. As NATO's
Supreme Allied Commander for four years, I signed more than 2,000
personal condolence letters; about a third of them were to the grieving
family members of European soldiers. I visited the thousands of non-U.S.
troops in Afghanistan often, and they were uniformly brave, professional
and motivated.

As a democracy, it is right that we should debate whether NATO is worth
dying for. I can tell you that our NATO allies have shown time and again
they are willing to fight and die for us.

#### It's [especially]{.underline} necessary because of Ukraine. [Backing down]{.underline} would be a [catastrophe]{.underline}.

For more than 70 years, [[NATO]{.mark} has acted as the **[guarantor
of]{.mark} western [security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Russian]{.mark}
aggression and [threats against Ukraine]{.mark} [have **nothing to do**
with]{.mark} any **supposed [provocation]{.mark}** [by the]{.mark}
transatlantic [alliance. Demands]{.mark} by the Kremlin [that Kyiv
forswear]{.mark} forever any [ambition to join NATO are a
**smokescreen** for its **real objectives** and,]{.mark} even if acted
upon, [would **not defuse this crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Western
governments would merely be inviting further revanchism by President
Putin if it entertained them for even a moment, let alone acceded to
them.

[The notion of a bar on **accession to NATO** momentarily excited hopes
of a solution to the crisis whereby 100,000 Russian troops have massed
across Ukraine's eastern border]{.underline}. Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine's
ambassador to Britain, appeared to suggest in a BBC interview on Sunday
that Kyiv might abandon the aim of joining NATO as the price of avoiding
war. A spokesman for Mr Putin said that, while this did not mark a
change in Ukrainian policy, it would be a step in the right direction.

Mr Prystaiko swiftly retreated from any such insinuation yesterday,
however, saying his remarks had been misunderstood and that the aim of
accession to NATO remained part of Ukraine's constitution. And so it
does. Ukraine's government has compelling reason to seek a way out of
the crisis and to lift the threat of invasion. Russia's illegal
annexation of part of Ukraine's territory in 2014 and continuing
warfare, with about 14,000 lives lost to date, are a disaster and an
outrage.

Ukraine has requested an urgent meeting with Russian representatives to
discuss the crisis under the auspices of the Organisation for Security
and Co-operation in Europe. And Kyiv might judge that preserving a
circumscribed type of sovereignty, comparable perhaps to Finland's
relations with the Soviet Union in the Cold War, is the least bad
option. But for great powers to compel it to adopt such a policy would
be unconscionable.

Nor would it even work, for [[it would demonstrate]{.mark} to the Putin
regime [that by **threats** and]{.mark} **outright [invasion]{.mark}**
[it can change]{.mark} the **[borders]{.mark} of Europe** [and
dictate]{.mark} the [**alliances** of]{.mark} sovereign [states. Other
nations would be at risk, including]{.mark} the **[Baltic member
states]{.mark}** of NATO that were once subjugated by the Soviet Union.
[This is]{.mark} no way to preserve peace; it is [an **invitation to
aggression.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Kremlin's complaints about NATO are a canard. Russian propaganda
maintains that the United States gave a commitment at the time of German
unification that NATO would not expand eastwards. That account is not
supported by James Baker or Mikhail Gorbachev, the leading diplomatic
players on either side at the time. Ukraine's demands in 2013 were for
closer relations with the European Union rather than NATO. It was this
that Mr Putin could not abide: the prospect of Kyiv allying with western
liberal ideals of constitutionalism rather than Mr Putin's ahistorical
fantasies of a common Slavic civilisation.

Kyiv does not have a right to join NATO, for there are stringent
criteria for accession. It certainly cannot meet these when part of its
territory is under occupation. But it has every right to aspire to
membership, even if there is scant likelihood of its acceding in the
foreseeable future. For bigger states to force it to renounce such a
policy would violate the terms of the Charter for European Security of
1999, which rejects the notion that big powers can legitimately consider
any part of Europe as their "sphere of influence".

Russia is a signatory of that charter and must abide by its terms. NA[TO
is not the aggressor in this crisis; Mr Putin is. NATO powers should
strain to resolve it by diplomatic means, but [lasting peace]{.mark} is
not secured by acquiescence. It [requires]{.mark} resolutely [**opposing
imperialism** and aiding Ukraine's]{.mark} **legitimate
[government]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As in the Cold War, preserving peace
and maintaining deterrence are not alternatives but the same cause.

Why NATO? [Russia's attack on Ukraine and illegal annexation of Crimea
in 2014]{.underline} and the events that followed clarified the state of
the transatlantic security environment and [provided a concise answer to
the question of why NATO is needed today. The Alliance is needed now for
the same reason it was needed when it was created.]{.underline} Now, as
then, the UN cannot guarantee collective security against aggression.
[Transatlantic countries continue to face the **same threat**, albeit in
a different form, that existed when NATO was established. The Alliance
has proven effective in its mission for more than **seven decades** and
continues to be necessary for the **preservation of transatlantic
security** and, by extension, the **liberal international
order**]{.underline}. In short, [we need NATO in order to maintain
**world peace**.]{.underline} Can NATO Endure? The NATO alliance and the
context within which it operates have changed significantly over time.
At its inception, NATO focused on the security of Western Europe, the
United States, and Canada. Today, it protects the majority of European
countries, as well as the United States and Canada. It is comprised of
30 Allies, protects almost one billion people on both sides of the
Atlantic, and represents half of the world's military and economic
might. [The challenges NATO faces and the environment in which it
operates are also notably different than those that existed when the
Alliance was created]{.underline}. In 1949, NATO guarded against the
threat of military attack that could be countered through traditional
military strengths. At that time, the Soviet Union was the primary
threat to the Alliance. [Today, NATO is deterring **Russian expansion**
rather than Soviet expansion, facing an adversary that readily deploys
the means of **hybrid warfare** against its targets in order to achieve
its political goals. It is an aggressor that has successfully melded
hybrid warfare with information, cyber, diplomatic, political, economic,
and social means of warfare.51 Russia is a continually evolving **apex
predator**]{.underline}. Consequently, NATO operates in a rapidly
changing and unpredictable environment fueled in large part by a state
that operates outside the bounds of international law and works to foil
the international system while simultaneously insisting no international
question may be resolved without it. Permanently on guard, NATO has
successfully adapted to political, economic, and social changes that
have altered the international security environment over the course of
more than seven decades. [The Alliance is the transatlantic community's
**perpetual guardian**, its constantly evolving primary line of defense.
As such, it remains an **essential component** of transatlantic security
and the liberal international order]{.underline}. But, can it endure?
Currently, every indication is that NATO is a durable compact: all of
its 16 longtime members have remained in the Alliance, 14 new members
have joined since the end of the Cold War, and additional countries have
joined NATO's Partnership for Peace with the hope of becoming members of
the pact. Despite some assertions that NATO and the ideas that underpin
the liberal world order are obsolete, NATO's image has improved on both
sides of the Atlantic amid growing security concerns. And it is
generally "seen in a positive light across publics within the
alliance."52 [The benefits of membership far outweigh the costs. The
price of peace costs less than the price of **war and
rebuilding**]{.underline}. Maintaining Peace in the Twenty-First Century
[The twenty-first century transatlantic security environment has largely
been shaped by a revanchist Russia, which has emerged as the **single
greatest threat** to transatlantic peace and security in the post-Cold
War era]{.underline}. Over the course of the past 30 years, Russia's
foreign policies and actions have fallen into well-defined historical
patterns. Russia's resurgent expansionism, use of force to change
borders, abuse of its UN Security Council veto, and its hostility toward
its neighbors and the liberal international order have created
comparable conditions to those that led to NATO's creation in 1949. [The
Alliance's success in maintaining transatlantic peace and security
through deterrence, along with Litvinov's, Henderson's, and Kennan's
post--World War II observations, provides policymakers with important
insights into how to approach today's transatlantic security situation
and how to value NATO]{.underline}. In short, Litvinov pointed out that
Russia's desire to expand is insatiable; Henderson observed that its
goals never change; and Kennan advised that Russia understands and
respects the logic of force above all else.53 NATO has been an effective

#### NATO imperialism didn't cause war, Russia's ambitions did.

**Majumdar '22** (Bhaskar Majumdar, Author and graduated from the AMP
from Harvard, "Russian Imperialism, Not NATO Expansion, Caused the
Ukraine War"
<https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/russian-imperialism-not-nato-expansion-caused-the-ukraine-war/>)
//sethlee

As per Mearsheimer's worldview, NATO in general and the US in particular
were at fault for welcoming countries that were in the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact. Admitting the three former Soviet republics in the Baltics was
rubbing salt into wounded Russian pride. [[This view forgets that
the]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian Empire and its successor, the [[Soviet
Union, expanded in western Europe as well as in the east all the way to
the Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}.
In [1979](https://www.britannica.com/event/Soviet-invasion-of-Afghanistan),
the Soviet troops even marched into Afghanistan to protect the communist
government.

[None of the countries that suffered under Moscow's yoke wants to go
back to those. That is what so many of them lined up to join NATO when
the Soviet Union fell. Eastern [European nations]{.mark} also [turned to
the EU because of economic opportunities]{.mark} on offer.]{.underline}
Poles, Lithuanians and even Hungarians prefer to work in France, Germany
and the UK instead of in Russia. In a nutshell**[[, NATO guaranteed
security against an imperial Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}** while the EU
boosted the economy for Eastern Europe. 

An imperial view would see the expansion of NATO as a win for the US and
a loss to Russia. However, [[it might be a good idea not to think of
NATO]{.mark} or even the EU [expanding east but **Eastern Europe moving
westward.**]{.mark}]{.underline} "Go West, young man" had a new meaning
for Poles suffering from nightmares of the
1943 [Katyn](https://www.archives.gov/research/foreign-policy/katyn-massacre) Forest
Massacre when the Soviets slaughtered the flower of Polish society.

Obviously, Russia did not like the eastward expansion of NATO or the EU.
For a historically imperial power, this was deeply humiliating. In
particular, the Soviet collapse scarred Vladimir Putin. This former KGB
officer ended up driving
a [taxi](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59629670) for a bit. As
Atul Singh and Glenn
Carle [write](https://www.fairobserver.com/region/europe/making-sense-of-vladimir-putins-long-game/),
the 1990s deeply traumatized Russians "who interpret almost every US
action and statement as pieces of a long term, coherent plan to
undermine Russia." Russia claims that NATO threatens its sovereignty by
encroaching on its near abroad.

[[The reality is that NATO armies have no designs on Russian territory.
It is Russia that annexed Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark} with impunity and
in contravention of international law. **[[Now, it has attacked Ukraine
without provocation.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It is razing entire cities,
killing civilians and committing atrocities in a classically brutal
Russian way. The history and the current reality of Russia puts fear
into the hearts of its neighbors.  That is why Finland and Sweden have
applied to join **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Their **[[action is
defensive, not offensive.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### NATO is still relevant -- multiple examples

challenges"

[The [N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic [T]{.mark}reaty
[O]{.mark}rganization [is the largest peacetime alliance in the world
and has been arguably the most successful such alliance in
history.]{.mark} [It has had remarkable success in
achieving]{.mark}]{.underline} its basic [[goals: containing Soviet
expansion,]{.underline}]{.mark} checking the rise of nationalism
[[and]{.mark} [helping integrate Europe.]{.mark}]{.underline} [It
provides a model for multinational cooperation, something we desperately
need in today's complex and dangerous world. and **[it has shown an
admirable ability to adapt]{.mark}** to changing needs and
circumstances.]{.underline} Three decades ago, with the collapse of the
Soviet Union, it was possible to think NATO had outlived its basic
mandate. But it found new and important responsibilities in combating
ethnic violence and civil war, as [[in the former Yugoslavia, and
countering terrorism.]{.underline}]{.mark} [It maintains an array of
peacekeeping]{.underline} and training activities in Europe, the
Mediterranean, the Middle East and Africa. [Today, [the crisis over a
possible Russian invasion of Ukraine presents new challenges]{.mark} to
the alliance while reinforcing the fact that **[NATO is as relevant as
ever]{.mark}**. It is essential to the security of our allies in Europe;
and because their security is closely tied to our own, it is essential
to the United States.]{.underline} In a sense, NATO rose from the ashes
of World War II. Europe had been devastated. An estimated 36.5 million
Europeans had been killed, more than half of them civilians. Millions of
people were displaced. America, throwing off its history of
isolationism, created the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe's economy. But
Western leaders worried about the region's military security. Would the
Soviet Union seek to extend its dominance into Western Europe? Would
nationalist militarism bubble up and lead Europe back toward war? [To
address those threats, a dozen nations, including the United States,
signed the North Atlantic Treaty in April 1949. In the treaty's
best-known section, Article 5, the members declared that "an armed
attack against one of them ... shall be considered an armed attack
against all of them." **[It was a pledge for mutual
self-defense.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Within months, the Soviet Union
exploded an atomic bomb, putting an exclamation point on the need for
deterrence. The Korean War and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956
and Czechoslovakia in 1968 tested NATO, but [the alliance
held.]{.underline} It was a measure of the treaty's success that NATO
forces were able to avoid military actions throughout the Cold War. Over
the decades, NATO expanded. Today it includes 30 member nations, three
of them former Soviet republics: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. [It also
claims partner relationships with nearly 20 European countries. NATO
calls its partnership with Ukraine one of its "most substantial" and
says cooperation has increased since 2014, when Russia invaded Ukraine
and seized Crimea.]{.underline} Ukraine has expressed interest in
joining NATO. Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who views Ukraine as part
of "historical Russia," portrays that prospect as an existential threat.
With an estimated 100,000 troops massed near the Ukrainian border,
Russia is demanding a guarantee that NATO won't let Ukraine join. The
threat of a **[[Russian invasion of Ukraine poses a real problem for
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. President Joe Biden said last week that
"there are differences" among alliance members about how forcefully to
respond, depending on what Russia does. Putin is likely to try to
exploit those differences. The best way to resolve this crisis, of
course, is through tough, clear-eyed diplomacy, with a clear message
that Russia will face consequences if it invades. But it's harder to
negotiate from a position of strength when all your allies may not be on
the same page. NATO has achieved remarkable success in maintaining peace
and security throughout its 72-year history. It has demonstrated,
probably better than any other organization, the importance of
multinational cooperation. But as the Ukraine crisis shows, its
challenges are far from over. Lee Hamilton is a senior adviser for the

### 2AC -- Sustainability

#### NATO's sustainable -- U.S. reliance and public support prove.

Simon **Koschut 21**, Heisenberg Fellow at the Otto Suhr Institute of
the Freie University Berlin, Ph.D. from the University of Potsdam,

as We Know It?" *Hegemonic Transition*, Chapter 8,
<https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-74505-9_8>, RMax

**[Despite]{.underline}** these obvious [problems]{.underline}, however,
[it seems **premature** to join in the **swan song** for
**NATO**]{.underline}. Indeed, [with]{.underline} the incoming
**[Biden]{.underline}** administration [there are many indications that
NATO will **continue to exist**. A dissolution or **disintegration of
NATO**]{.underline} cannot be ruled out entirely, but it [is **not very
likely**. This is]{.underline} mainly [due to **two
reasons**]{.underline}.

First, [the US **needs NATO** in its **conflicts** with **other
hegemons**]{.underline}. When the Cold War drew to a close, NATO lost
its central importance in the eyes of many US decision-makers in
Congress and in the White House, e.g., consider the sidelining of NATO
during the so-called War on Terror or the Obama administration's troop
surge in the Pacific region in the wake of the so-called Asian Pivot.
**[Recently]{.underline}**, however, [the organization has regained
importance for the US in the course of]{.underline} the Russian
annexation of [Crimea and the threat to **US security interests** in the
**S**outh **C**hina **S**ea]{.underline}. The US, in particular, is
currently pushing NATO members to invest more in military defense in
order to increase the deterrent potential against Russia and China
(Defense News, 2016).

Second, [**domestic support** for **NATO** remains **high** in the
US]{.underline}. According to a 2016 survey by the Pew Research Center,
[a **majority** of the US population continues to see NATO as "**good
for the US**"]{.underline} (Pew Research Center, 2016).
[This]{.underline} support [has even **increased under
Trump**]{.underline} over the past two years. Granted, this is mainly
due to the support from the Democratic camp. Among [Democrats, support
for NATO is particularly high at **78%**]{.underline}, compared to only
47% among Republicans. In 2016, the gap between the two parties was only
6% (Pew Research Center, 2018a). This shows an intensification of the
party-political division in the US on NATO politics and seems to
indicate that Trump's criticism of the alliance has generated increasing
resonance, at least among Republicans. 48 percent of all respondents in
the US say that NATO is not doing enough to solve problems globally (Pew
Research Center, 2018b). Nevertheless, around
**[two-thirds]{.underline}** (62%) [of Americans see NATO
**positively**]{.underline}, and [the trend is
**increasing**]{.underline}: approval of NATO has improved by 9
percentage points compared to 2017. [It is the **strongest US support**
for the **transatlantic security alliance** in **recent
years**]{.underline}.

The current crisis surrounding **[COVID]{.underline}**-19 [has done
**little to change this**]{.underline}. On an operational level,
COVID-19 has impacted negatively on NATO's missions and overall military
interoperability. Moreover, the immense financial costs of cushioning
the economic effects of COVID-19 will surely affect political debates on
military spending. Some even suggest that NATO deterrence may suffer due
the pandemic (Mölling et al., 2020). On a political level, and perhaps
surprisingly so, the COVID19 crisis has done little to foster political
cohesion and solidarity among NATO members. To be sure,
[COVID]{.underline}-19 [has given attention to **allied resilience** and
**preparedness** according to Article 3]{.underline} of the Washington
Treaty, [and many member states have engaged in civilian and logistical
support in response to the pandemic]{.underline}. For example, NATO's
Rapid Air Mobility initiative has facilitated the delivery of medical
supplies and personal protective equipment to and from several
countries, including the UK, Turkey, the United States, and Italy (NATO,
2020). But NATO, as a military security organization, is not well
prepared to assist in combatting a global health crisis. As a result,
member states have looked elsewhere for international cooperation and
assistance or, as in many cases, pursued national policies.

### 2AC -- AT: Nuclear Sharing -- General

#### Critics of nuclear sharing are wrong.

Tobias **Bunde 21**, postdoctoral researcher at the Hertie School's
Centre for International Security, Director of Research and Policy at
the Munich Security Conference, project lead of the "Understanding
Nuclear Assurance, Deterrence and Escalation in Europe," 1/22/2021,

RMax

[**Proponents** of a withdrawal of U.S.]{.underline} non-strategic
[nuclear weapons from German soil argue]{.underline} that [it would
make]{.underline} Germany and [Europe **more secure** and downplay the
potential **risks** of such a decision]{.underline}. For them, Berlin's
refusal to continually host U.S. nuclear weapons and invest in the next
generation of dual-capable aircraft would neither mean the end of
nuclear sharing nor undermine NATO cohesion. [They]{.underline} often
[try to distinguish between]{.underline} the so-called [technical and
political elements of **nuclear sharing**, arguing that ending the
**former** would **not** necessarily affect the **latter**]{.underline}.
Pointing to states such as Canada or Greece that once hosted U.S.
nuclear weapons but got rid of them a long time ago and still
participate in NATO's Nuclear Planning Group, they argue that Germany
would still be able to influence NATO nuclear strategy, that the United
States would still be willing to protect NATO, and that NATO and the
nuclear sharing arrangement as such would continue to exist and function
well.

[These arguments are based on rather **heroic assumptions**. First, they
assume that it does **not** matter what you bring to the
table]{.underline}. According to Rolf Mützenich, chairman of the Social
Democrats in the Bundestag, [a withdrawal of]{.underline} non-strategic
[nuclear weapons from Germany "would not result in the end of the
American nuclear guarantee nor of Germany's say in nuclear matters ...
as it would still be guaranteed through its membership in the Nuclear
Planning Group."]{.underline} Yet, [it would be **very surprising**
if]{.underline} those [states that]{.underline} actively [contributed to
NATO's nuclear sharing mission didn't have more influence than other
member states]{.underline}. After all, it is well known that [those NATO
members that provide troops to allied operations]{.underline} (in
particular those that carry special risks) [have more influence on NATO
strategy for a given operation than other member states]{.underline}.

[Second, they]{.underline} implicitly or explicitly [argue that it would
not make much of a difference for the security provider, the United
States, whether their protégés participate in the arrangement or
no]{.underline}t. After all, they argue, the United States does not need
the few non-strategic nuclear weapons on European soil to provide
effective deterrence for the whole of NATO. [According to the critics,
these weapons are]{.underline} militarily **[useless]{.underline}**,
because there is no realistic scenario for their use. Yet, [**many
military experts** disagree]{.underline}. They maintain that [even the
current generation of jet fighters could successfully carry out their
mission]{.underline}. Moreover, from this perspective, [jet fighters
carrying gravity bombs provide a lot of **operational flexibility** and
are **valuable tools** for **strategic communication**]{.underline}.

[It could]{.underline} also [be argued]{.underline} that
[these]{.underline} non-strategic [nuclear weapons never]{.underline}
really [had much military use]{.underline} in a narrow sense. Rather,
[they have always been political **symbols**]{.underline}, linking
European security to American security. [It is **important** to
recognize]{.underline}, though[, that "symbolic" does **not** mean
**politically unimportant**]{.underline}. In contrast, [nuclear sharing
has also meant **reassurance** and **risk sharing**]{.underline}.
However, as former U.S. ambassador to NATO, Ivo Daalder, notes,
[reassurance works both ways: "it's a **two-way street**."]{.underline}
For the United States, [it will]{.underline} thus [make a **huge
political difference** whether U.S. allies are willing to continue to
share the risks associated with the nuclear umbrella]{.underline}. In an
article for Der Spiegel, [two experienced Europe hands]{.underline},
former Deputy Secretary of Defense Michèle Flournoy and former Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Policy Jim Townsend, [warned in **no
uncertain terms** that "Germany **walking away** from this vow to
**share** the **nuclear burden**, this expression of solidarity and risk
sharing, strikes at the **heart** of the **trans-Atlantic
bargain**."]{.underline}

Third, the [German proponents of]{.underline} a [withdrawal]{.underline}
of U.S. nuclear weapons [underestimate the role of their own
country]{.underline}. Germany, after all, is not just another member
state. To begin with, [the country's role in NATO was a major reason for
the very creation of this special arrangement. Its departure from NATO's
technical nuclear sharing arrangement would very likely trigger **other
"exits"** and lead to **transatlantic disruption**]{.underline}. While
the nuclear sharing arrangement may survive a Belgian or Dutch exit, [it
is hard to imagine that a German withdrawal would not bring about a
**general crisis** of **nuclear sharing**]{.underline}. According to
Flournoy and Townsend, "[the bargain sustaining U.S. extended nuclear
deterrence to Europe would collapse and the U.S. umbrella would
essentially be decoupled from Europe]{.underline}." At a time of
upheaval for the transatlantic alliance and ongoing discussions about a
potential "decoupling," [this promises to be a dangerous strategy with
potentially far-reaching consequences.]{.underline}

Deterrence,\" *Policy Roundtable: The Future of Trans-Atlantic Nuclear
Deterrence*, Chapter 1,
https://tnsr.org/roundtable/policy-roundtable-the-future-of-trans-atlantic-nuclear-deterrence/,
RMax

What Is at Stake?

In a pre-workshop survey, [we asked expert participants]{.underline} in
our workshop [to rate the performance of the "Atlantic
Charter,"]{.underline} the aspirational set of principles proclaimed by
President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill 80
years ago, in August
1941.[1](https://tnsr.org/roundtable/policy-roundtable-the-future-of-trans-atlantic-nuclear-deterrence/#_ftn1) [Sixty-three
percent of those polled believed the trans-Atlantic community
was]{.underline} "very **[successful]{.underline}**" or "somewhat
successful" [at ensuring]{.underline} that [there are "no territorial
changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the
peoples concerned."]{.underline} Only 27 percent selected "somewhat
unsuccessful" regarding the establishment of "a peace which will afford
to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own
boundaries." No one believed the trans-Atlantic community was "very
unsuccessful" at this task.

**[Nuclear deterrence]{.underline}** may [deserve]{.underline} some of
the [**credit** for this]{.underline} perceived [success. According to
many experts, **nuclear weapons** helped keep the Cold War cold long
enough for the standoff between the Soviet Union and its bloc and the
trans-Atlantic community]{.underline}, led by the United States, [to end
**without a shot
fired**.]{.underline}[2](https://tnsr.org/roundtable/policy-roundtable-the-future-of-trans-atlantic-nuclear-deterrence/#_ftn2) And
yet, nuclear weapons also presented the Cold War's biggest, most
existential risk to humanity --- and they continue to do so. As Ven
Bruusgaard writes in her contribution to this roundtable, "It remains a
fact that nuclear weapons can bring existential destruction to
humanity." It is important not to lose sight of this gruesome fact in
the sometimes technical and often esoteric details of nuclear strategy.

There are questions today about the relative importance of nuclear
weapons in the NATO context. Some of the authors in this roundtable
remind us that the ability of nuclear capabilities to deter conventional
war is an underappreciated reality of nuclear weapons, especially in an
era of "great-power competition." Ven Bruusgaard's essay also argues
forcefully that "U.S. nuclear weapons are likely one factor inhibiting
even more aggressive Chinese and Russian policies in their respective
neighborhoods."

[A related question is whether, when it comes to nuclear weapons, the
trans-Atlantic community should "trade known risks for unknown
ones,"]{.underline} as Ven Bruusgaard puts it. [For all]{.underline} our
[participants, the answer is a resounding "**no**,"]{.underline} which
Bunde illustrates with a metaphor inspired by the late Supreme Court
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: [We may be in a **rainstorm**, and **we are
not getting wet**, so we are considering whether we really need our
**nuclear umbrella**. The inability to see the rainstorm while holding
our umbrella is frustrating, but our panelists make the case for
**holding on**.]{.underline}

#### Alternatives are worse.

Kristin **Ven Bruusgaard 21**, assistant professor of political science
at the University of Oslo, member of the Oslo Nuclear Project,

Nuclear Deterrence,\" *Policy Roundtable: The Future of Trans-Atlantic
Nuclear Deterrence*, Chapter 5,
https://tnsr.org/roundtable/policy-roundtable-the-future-of-trans-atlantic-nuclear-deterrence/,
RMax

This past January, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons
entered into force, after 50 states ratified it.83 This disarmament
treaty is unlikely to contribute to reducing nuclear arsenals, given
that no nuclear weapons state has expressed any interest in joining it.
But the treaty does capture a contemporary sentiment among many
non-nuclear NATO member states: that nuclear deterrence is
unfashionable, untenable, and out of date. Civil society movements and
political youth parties in Europe are pushing the treaty's agenda
hard.84 Nuclear deterrence, to them, has run its course.

[The humanitarian rationale for never employing nuclear weapons is
compelling]{.underline} and a key reason for the popularity of this
anti-nuclear sentiment across Europe.85 It remains a fact that nuclear
weapons can bring existential destruction to humanity. The Bulletin of
Atomic Scientists' Doomsday Clock concludes that we are closer than ever
to midnight.86

[**But** the **security policy rationale** for discarding nuclear
weapons and **nuclear deterrence** without thoroughly assessing their
**alternative** is **much less compelling**]{.underline}. [The argument
that nuclear deterrence is outdated is detached from the rationale for
acquiring nuclear weapons: to **enhance states security**. It disregards
contemporary risks of **great-power confrontation**. **Most
critically**, it fails to consider what **alternative security
measures** states are likely to take in the **absence** of **nuclear
weapons**.]{.underline}

Nuclear Weapons and the Pursuit of Security

[States that have]{.underline}, or aspire to have, [nuclear capabilities
do so because of a **perceived security need**]{.underline}. There is a
reason nuclear weapons remain "the absolute weapon." [The potential of
nuclear weapons to shape the behavior of other states is]{.underline}
simply **[unique]{.underline}**, as characterized by Bernard Brodie.87
The nine states that have acquired nuclear weapons have done so to
provide security against what they perceive to be the most pressing
threats they are facing, whether nuclear or conventional.

The latter point is important. Not all nuclear weapons states have
pursued nuclear capability to match or deter a nuclear threat. Some
states seek to influence a conventionally superior or geographically
dominant enemy. The utility of nuclear weapons is not universal across
nuclear weapons states. Each state's needs differ, including in relation
to other available options they have for preserving their own security.
For Pakistan, for example, nuclear weapons remain an essential tool for
influencing a conventionally superior India. [The states that derive
security from nuclear weapons]{.underline}, through their own possession
of those weapons or through security guarantees from other nuclear
states, [will have to pursue that security by **other means** in the
absence of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. This must inform our analysis
of the consequences of prohibiting them.

Renewed Great-Power Competition and the Risk of Conflict

[The idea that nuclear deterrence is outdated is out of sync with the
contemporary security policy context]{.underline}. International
relations today are deeply colored by renewed great-power competition
between the United States, Russia, and China. The changing distribution
of power may produce less peaceful outcomes than what we have seen over
the past 70 years. U.S. think tanks keep churning out reports on how the
United States should best compete against China.88 China's leaders
remain convinced that the United States is determined to prevent its
inevitable rise. Russia is determined to remain a great power, while the
United States depicts Russia as a declining power and displays little
interest in considering Russian security concerns.

[To all]{.underline} these [great powers, nuclear weapons and nuclear
deterrence remain a **critical security guarantee**]{.underline}. Of the
three, [Russia]{.underline} seems to [rely the most on its nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. But the United States also relies on nuclear
weapons to deter and manage potential crises with either of the other
two countries. Its nuclear arsenal is being modernized to fit this
bill.89 Some argue nuclear weapons play a lesser role in Chinese
strategy as compared to U.S. and Russian nuclear strategies,90 but
recent changes in Chinese nuclear policy raise renewed concerns about
Chinese nuclear intentions.91

How nuclear weapons influence the risk of conflict is contested.
[Many]{.underline} argue that nuclear weapons contribute to deterring
great-power conflict and [point to the]{.underline} fact that the
**[Cold War]{.underline}** remained cold.92 Although this claim is
difficult to prove, [we]{.underline} do **[know]{.underline}** [that
nuclear weapons contributed to significantly shaping superpower behavior
in this era]{.underline}. Moreover, [nuclear weapons states **clearly**
have faith in this **logic**]{.underline}. On the other hand, one could
argue that nuclear weapons pose a significant and growing risk in the
event of a conflict. Any conflict in which the great powers perceive
that their vital national interests are at stake would likely go
nuclear, unless one side were to concede to the other's demands. Many
point to novel risks of entanglement because of an increased commingling
of nuclear and conventional strike systems.93 Other emerging
technologies may also reduce crisis stability and increase the risk of
nuclear escalation.94

[What Are the Alternatives?]{.underline}

So, [should we trade **known risks** for **unknown ones**? We do not
know how the]{.underline} partial or full [absence of nuclear weapons
would affect relations among the great powers. This raises two critical
questions. The first is whether conventional weapons can serve to deter
nuclear threats. The second is what a conventionalized deterrence
landscape would look like.]{.underline}

[Consider a world in which more states sign the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, including]{.underline} some [**NATO
allies**, but in which the nuclear weapons states remain **reluctant**
to engage]{.underline}. Putting aside questions about whether it would
be possible to remain a NATO member while in the treaty,95 or whether
NATO as an alliance would survive this, [treaty proponents argue that
NATO members that choose to sign the treaty should rely on
**conventional capabilities**]{.underline} [to deter **nuclear
threats**]{.underline}. But is this viable?

[Most scholars argue]{.underline} that [**conventional weapons** are
less effective deterrent tools than nuclear weapons]{.underline}.96 [The
rapid and unprecedented destruction caused by nuclear weapons sets them
apart]{.underline}. Making the threat of conventional denial or
punishment credible requires more than nuclear threats: Conventional
weapons inflict less damage than do nuclear weapons and can be easier to
defend against than nuclear weapons. For these reasons, a larger amount
of conventional precision-strike munitions are needed to deter nuclear
threats as compared to nuclear weapons.97 The potential of conventional
missiles is untested in a contested environment. Sustained [arms racing
also serves to **undermine** the deterrent effect of conventional
weapons]{.underline}. States that rely on conventional deterrence may
have to demonstrate their conventional capabilities on a more regular
basis, which could increase the rate and intensity of conflicts.

[A]{.underline} partly or fully **[conventionalized deterrence
landscape]{.underline}** [could be **less stable** and **more conflict
prone** than the **current one**]{.underline}. The [increased U.S.
reliance on conventional deterrence has not led others to follow suit.
Instead, U.S. conventional preponderance has produced an **increased**
adversary emphasis on **nuclear threats**]{.underline}.98 Since the end
of the Cold War, Russia has promised nuclear first use in response to
the conventional counterforce threat from U.S. precision-guided
munitions. These Russian nuclear threats to go first have now produced a
changed U.S. deterrence strategy with expanded nuclear options.99
[Nuclear weapons remain the only credible deterrent of nuclear
employment]{.underline}. Although China seemingly relies more on
conventional than nuclear deterrence, its nuclear deterrent remains
oriented toward the potential threat from U.S. nuclear first use in a
large-scale conflict. For China, U.S. conventional capabilities to deny
China its objectives in the Asian-Pacific theater are potentially of
diminishing concern. U.S. nuclear capabilities to target the Chinese
homeland are seemingly not.

[**U.S. nuclear weapons** are likely **one** factor inhibiting even
**more** aggressive Chinese and Russian policies in their respective
neighborhoods. A world without nuclear weapons could produce **more
frequent** albeit less destructive **wars**. These could cause
**destruction** and **devastation** of a kind that we have not seen
since the last world war]{.underline}. Although we cannot know, [it may
be that nuclear weapons will contribute to preserving the peace among
great powers]{.underline}. The consequences of removing them from
deliberations over the costs of aggression are unknown.

The idea of nuclear deterrence is old, even old-fashioned. However, [the
security threats nuclear weapons continue to mitigate are as pressing as
ever]{.underline}. Although the idea of abolishing these weapons may
seem attractive to publics and politicians alike, the implications of
their abolition are complex and uncertain. Reducing this uncertainty
through a more thorough debate over how states will take measures to
secure themselves, absent nuclear weapons, is critical. That discussion
is fundamental to determine whether a world without nuclear weapons
would be a more peaceful one.

The point is that any country, such as [**France**, that wishes to
**extend nuclear deterrence** in the future would have to significantly
change its **current posture**]{.underline}, which evolved without
considering these issues. It could be, for example, that extended
[deterrence by its nature encourages **larger arsenals**]{.underline}.
Is it reasonable to imagine that [France would significantly expand and
diversify its arsenal to ensure a **second-strike
capability**]{.underline} not only [for the purposes of **central
deterrence**]{.underline} but for extended deterrence as well?
[Sea-launched ballistic missiles (**SLBMs**), for instance, have a
crucial advantage]{.underline} in this respect, since they are less
vulnerable to attack than land-based ICBMs and manned bombers. Would
France send its force de frappe to sea in a big way? Could it?

[**Another important distinction** is **geography**. Both the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the Soviet Union possessed
vast acreage, making the notion of waging an initially **limited nuclear
war** at least theoretically **plausible**]{.underline}. It was possible
to imagine nuclear exchanges at the margins in defense of allies that
left both homelands basically viable. [France is probably **too small
for that**]{.underline}, besides which, for that reason and perhaps
others, [French policymakers **never accepted** the notion of **limited
nuclear war**, or riposte graduée. France instead relies on an ultime
avertissement "**ultimate warning**," which seems to rule out the
concept of **escalation control** for the sake of **starting-point
credibility**]{.underline}. The ability and willingness to escalate a
small confrontation to higher levels of exchange is a critical component
of the credibility of extended deterrence, and the ability and
willingness to "fight" a nuclear war, both limited and full-scale, falls
into that logic. These two elements---[geography and the associated
dynamics of both conventional and nuclear
escalation]{.underline}---[meant that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and the Soviet Union had **more "time"** compared
to other potential nuclear dyads, both before and during a nuclear
exchange. France **doesn't have these chops**]{.underline}, and neither
would Japan if it decides to go nuclear. India makes for an interesting
question in this regard.

Still other issues beg attention. One is allied dialogue and
communication on nuclear strategy. The NATO nuclear planning group and
extended deterrence committees with South Korea and Japan since 2010
formally discuss these things. New suppliers of extended deterrence
would have to establish such formal consultative bodies for their
security guarantees to be credible. Communication, especially in the
face of threats, is everything.

More specifically, [American extended deterrence was shaped by the rigid
structure of the Cold War in such a way that **secondary and tertiary
issues** fell below]{.underline} the [**political threshold** of nuclear
threats and protections.]{.underline} In short, [**the number of
triggers** for a nuclear crisis was **relatively small**]{.underline}.
But if the nuclear club in the Asia-Pacific were to grow robustly beyond
North Korea, a host of new issues might multiply the number of triggers:
strong emotional nationalism, territorial disputes, very asymmetric
conventional and nuclear balances, the maritime context, and the
vulnerability of "young" C3I systems among many.

Just as important, whereas the U.S.-Soviet engagement was both global
and bipolar, engagement would be regional and multipolar, especially in
Asia. Under such conditions, calculating deterrence sufficiency becomes
very difficult. [Smaller nuclear arsenals, too, are much more vulnerable
to **pre-emptive attack**, and hence parties are more likely to adopt
**launch-on-warning** or **launch-on-attack** postures. Each party's
nuclear doctrines, postures, and **chains of command** would **not be
clear** to the other players]{.underline}. They might therefore be much
more risk-averse, but [**risk aversion** would probably be offset by
doctrines of **first-use**, pre-delegation to **forward-deployed** and
widely dispersed weapons, and **geographical proximity**]{.underline}.

The main point is that the [general context of strategic interaction
during the Cold War cannot be superimposed readily on other
situations]{.underline}. Such a simple-minded superimposition was wrong
when it was applied to Iraq before 2003. It was wrong when it was (and
sometimes still is) applied to Iran or North Korea. And [it is wrong
when applied to **France**]{.underline} or Japan or any other would-be
security provider.

### 2AC -- AT: Nuclear Sharing -- Germany

#### End of nuclear sharing with Germany causes extinction. 

Rafael **Loss 20**, European Leadership Network, 2020, "A plea for
realism in Germany's nuclear sharing debate,"
<https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/a-plea-for-realism-in-germanys-nuclear-sharing-debate/>

Dr Mützenich is mistaken. [The removal of]{.underline} US [nuclear
weapons from German soil would **undermine** the Euro-Atlantic security
architecture and]{.underline}, ultimately, [**increase the likelihood**
of war in Europe, including that of **nuclear use**. Exiting nuclear
sharing would also raise concerns in the **Baltics** and **Eastern
Europe** about Germany's **commitment** to protect its immediate
neighbourhood, **end Germany's influence** over launching nuclear
strikes, render German preferences **less relevant**]{.underline} for US
policy, [**remove a geostrategic barrier** to Russian armament and
**unduly jeopardise** the already strained relations with
Moscow]{.underline}.

To be sure, the pace of nuclear disarmament has slowed since the 1990s.
This liberal interlude saw the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the opening for signature
of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Although the
nuclear powers have also cut their nuclear arsenals by some 75% since
the mid-1980s, an estimated 13,355 nuclear weapons remain in the
arsenals of nine countries today. This reduction contains an important
unilateral component; the United States and Russia, which possess the
vast majority of global warheads, have reduced mostly very expensive,
excess stockpiles.

But [the pace of disarmament has **slowed** due to dramatic changes in
the international security environment]{.underline}. If in the 1990s,
Russia appeared to be a strategic partner for the West, then Moscow's
2014 annexation of Crimea and its violation of the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which led to its demise, are only the
latest indicators for Russia's re-emergence as a geopolitical
competitor. President Putin's 2005 state of the union speech, in which
he 'described the collapse of the Soviet Union as the "the greatest
geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century"', announced this shift in
Moscow's strategic thinking. Moscow judged that Western hegemony denied
Russia its rightful great-power status. A more disruptive Russian
foreign policy based on power politics, zero-sum games and spheres of
influence was more suitable for recalibrating the global order to better
accommodate Russian interests. As President Putin put it at the 2007
Munich Security Conference: 'we must seriously think about the
architecture of global security...\[to achieve\] a reasonable balance
between the interests of all participants in the international
dialogue'.

The existing Western rules-based order is incompatible with Moscow's
stated objectives. Dr Mützenich's claim that 'we \[the SPD\] orient
ourselves not only on our own, national interest, but also consider the
interests of other countries, because we know that we can only be strong
together', is thus ideologically commendable but divorced from the
geopolitical realities. [Unilaterally exiting nuclear
sharing]{.underline} is at odds with the SPD's insistence that German
foreign policy must be multilateral and in the European interest. It
[would **prompt questions** in the Baltics and Eastern Europe about
Germany's stated commitment to protect its immediate
neighbourhood]{.underline}. And yes, Canada and Greece ended nuclear
sharing in 1984 and 2001, respectively. But that is precisely why
continuity is needed. As the US ambassadors to Poland and Germany
warned, [Germany's exit from allied nuclear sharing would '**diminish
nuclear capability** and **weaken NATO**' by '**eroding the solidarity**
that undergirds NATO's nuclear deterrent']{.underline}. [Another
unilateral weakening of the existing Euro-Atlantic security
architecture]{.underline}---whether through Russia's violation of arms
control agreements or the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from German
territory---[does not strengthen European security; it merely **removes
the legal** and **geostrategic barriers** to Russian armament. An **arms
race** could ensue, bringing **volatility** rather than
**predictability** to European security. Volatility increases the risk
of **escalation**, whether **accidental** or **intentional**, including
the probability of a **nuclear exchange**]{.underline}. Instead of
unilaterally removing an important element of the security architecture,
the SPD should encourage measures to increase strategic stability.

## NATO Bad

### 2NC -- Sustainability

#### NATO's unsustainable -- Ukraine, midterms, and Eurasian movements.

Peter **Isackson 22**, chief strategy officer at the Fair Observer,
3/3/2022, \"How Coherent Is NATO Today and in the Future?,\" Fair
Observer,

[One of the **longer-term consequences** of the **current crisis** is
something **no one** seems willing to talk about]{.underline} at this
moment as everyone is concerned with expressing their solidarity with
the Ukrainian people. Numerous commentators have interpreted Russia's
aggression as a signal that the West is for once becoming united and
will be stronger than ever when the fighting dies down and Russia is
humbled.

[The question no one wants to assess **realistically** is]{.underline}
precisely [the **evolving image** of **NATO**]{.underline}, particularly
for Europeans. [The idea]{.underline} that [the Russian assault will
**strengthen Europe's commitment** to **NATO**]{.underline} to avoid
future crises [is **naive**]{.underline} at best [and the product of the
kind of **illusion** Biden has created with his rhetoric. What is
happening today is **frightening**]{.underline}, and to the extent that
the problem itself turns around the existence of NATO, without
compromising their empathy for Ukrainians, [Europeans have]{.underline}
already [begun reflecting on the **danger** NATO represents for their
**political** and **economic future**]{.underline}.

[Europeans have **plenty to think about**]{.underline}. Depending on how
the war itself plays out, two things seem likely in the near future.
[The first is that]{.underline}, thanks to the unpopularity of Biden at
home, [it seems **inevitable** that the **Republican Party** will
control Congress in 2023 and]{.underline} that a Republican will likely
defeat the Democrats in [the presidential election]{.underline} of 2024.
This appears even more likely were either President Biden or
Vice-President Kamala Harris to be the party's standard bearer. The
Republican Party is still dominated by Donald [Trump]{.underline}, a
fact that clearly [**unsettles** most **politicians** and political
thinkers in Europe]{.underline}. The marketers of both parties, over at
least the past eight years, have failed to defend their once prestigious
brand.

Depending on Europe's capacity to act independently after decades of
accepting to remain in the shadow of the US, welcomed as their protector
in the aftermath of World War II, [it is **highly likely** that a
**movement** will emerge to create a **European** and possibly
**Eurasian security framework** that could **replace**]{.underline} or,
at the very least, marginalize **[NATO]{.underline}**. And [even
after]{.underline} the fiasco of the **[Ukraine]{.underline}** War
(Vladimir Putin's folly), [that **new framework** might even **include
Russia**]{.underline}.
