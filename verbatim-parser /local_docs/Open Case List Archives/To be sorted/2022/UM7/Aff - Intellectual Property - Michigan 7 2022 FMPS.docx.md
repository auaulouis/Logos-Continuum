The head of NATO's Innovation Unit looks at how the [[Allies]{.mark}
need to [**leverage** comparative advantage]{.mark}, creativity and
capital to win the race to [adopt **emerging** disruptive
**technologies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Dwight Eisenhower, NATO's first
Supreme Allied Commander Europe and later the 34th President of the
United States, argued for the "most defense at less cost with least
delay". He believed that the real challenge was to "build this defense
with wisdom and efficiency. \[...\] We must achieve both security and
solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic
strength." (Congressional Records, 1962) These statements were made
against the backdrop of an existential arms race with the Soviet Union
and the bipolar world of the Cold War. Through America's net assessment
strategy (comparing two systems together and seeking
opportunities/risks), capitalism and competitive spending -- underpinned
by liberal democratic values -- the West used these tools to beat the
Soviets. It worked and that was the "end of history". Maybe not. Today,
[[NATO's]{.mark} [competition is a **global**]{.mark} one and the race
is one of **technological** adoption -- that is, the [**acceptance**,
integration and use of new **technology**]{.mark} in society. From
artificial intelligence to quantum and everything in between,
governments are in a race to [leverage]{.mark} these [**technologies**
at scale and speed]{.mark} -- first adopter advantage for emerging
disruptive tech could not be more prevalent in the world of geopolitics
and deterrence]{.underline}. Indeed, the nations that win this race may
be those with the most agile bureaucracy rather those with the best
technology. [From artificial intelligence to quantum and everything in
between, governments are in a **race** to leverage these technologies at
**scale** and speed In contrast to the Cold War, the United States and
its [NATO Allies are unlikely to simply outspend others]{.mark}.
In]{.underline} a post-Covid-19 world, rebalancing public finances could
see further financial pressure placed on Allied defence budgets. [We now
need a **different** advantage, one which will deliver in the short term
and build **resilience** over the longer term -- more defence at less
cost with least delay.]{.underline} This starts with our people, their
creativity, education and access to funding. It ends with a robust
pipeline of new dual-use (civil and military) technologies constantly
being created, commercialised and capitalised upon. [The Alliance's
transatlantic nature places it in a unique **position** within the
international order to provide both demand-side policies and supply-side
resources that can genuinely build such a **pipeline**, creating not
only innovations but entirely **new markets**]{.underline} -- as
Eisenhower noted: the foundation of military strength is economic
strength. Recent history would suggest, the model of democracy and
Allied governments' willingness to make big bets on mission-oriented
technology does indeed create new markets and it is this model,
underpinned by shared values, which will be key to NATO's longer term
success. But what about now? In the short term, [[NATO **innovation**
needs to lay the **foundations** for Allies to realise]{.mark} those
[benefits of an **Alliance-wide approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Answers
may lay in focussing on two core areas: addressing the fragmentation of
researchers, academia, start-ups and government at the beginning of this
pipeline -- [that is, managing uncertainty.]{.underline} [[being able to
adopt and scale these]{.mark} new [technologies]{.mark} as and when they
are ready -- meaning the necessity of nimble, agile investment and
acquisition entities [across both public and private sectors]{.mark},
all of [which need to be equally incentivised to take]{.mark}
significant levels of [risk.]{.mark}]{.underline} These activities are
difficult in their own right but combining them into an Alliance
innovation pipeline, while attempting to make use of the comparative
advantage each Ally brings to the table, leaves the Alliance with a
"wicked problem". It is wicked because it demands a combination of both
sustained and disruptive innovation (which seeks to radically change the
status-quo) occurring simultaneously across NATO. Leveraging diversity
In aggregate, [the Alliance has an abundance of world-class academic
institutions, the finest scientific researchers, amazingly creative
start-ups and a mature well-resourced financial eco-system. [These
constitute the **core** ingredients]{.mark}, which, [when combined and
**focused**]{.mark}, can solve **dual-use**, '[tough-tech'
problems]{.mark} -- that is, [**challenges** facing both defence and
non-defence sectors]{.mark}, such as augmented reality and quantum
computing. A dual-use model is important for disruptive **defence
innovation** because when we eventually get to commercialising such
tough-tech breakthroughs**, [Allies will need start-ups]{.mark}** [and
tech firms to maximise the]{.mark} reach of their [products]{.mark} by
[looking at '**total addressable problems'**]{.mark} rather than 'total
addressable markets']{.underline}. In other words, we should not want
start-ups building the next wave of technology to have governments as
their only customer. [We want such technologies to benefit society too
and therefore have civil, commercial use. Such commercial use then
drives the subsequent development of said technology, pulling the
government-side along with it, which means better products and
technology all round -- building defence with wisdom and
efficiency.]{.underline} Indeed, dual-use potential will help align the
incentives of our researchers, entrepreneurs and finance communities as
the prospective commercial upside (problem) will be big enough for them
to undertake the investment of commercialisation. The geopolitical
advantage such disruptive innovation fosters (picking winners via big
bets on the next breakthrough) will also be large enough to allow for
its creation via early stage patient public sector capital investment.
But before we get to commercialisation, we need to create the direction
of what it is we wish to see commercialised. Technological disruptive
innovation does not just happen. It starts with a mission-oriented
vision, where measuring risk is impossible and only uncertainty reigns.
It requires bold moves that will signpost the future; the confidence to
place big bets on technology not yet invented; and an ability to pick
winners -- all of which must be underpinned by persistent engagement,
encouragement and enlightenment. Since the end of the Second World War,
only one entity has taken-on such uncertainty: Allied governments (see
image below). Technological disruptive innovation does not just happen.
It starts with a mission-oriented vision, where measuring risk is
impossible and only uncertainty reigns. Step 1: agree innovation
priorities among Allies [The [first step]{.mark} towards [fixing the
**fragmentation**]{.mark} of [Allied disruptive innovation is for
Allies, through the **NATO framework**]{.mark}, to focus on **[agreed
innovation priorities]{.mark}.** This will allow them to pick winners
and invest public patient capital -- the private sector is unlikely to
invest venture capital as the risk is simply too high]{.underline}
(nations tend not to go out of business and can take on such
uncertainty). [This [direction]{.mark} and [investment will help to
maintain NATO's]{.mark} overarching [techn]{.mark}ological
[edge]{.mark}. Indeed, as Keynes and Weber argued, the ability to make
things happen that otherwise would not needs a combination of
technological, policy and bureaucratic skills matched by
investment.]{.underline} Step 2: leverage the comparative advantage of
the Alliance [If Allies are to achieve most defence at less cost with
least delay built with wisdom and efficiency, then it is logical to
[leverage]{.mark} those [natural advantages that geography and skill
sets afford NATO]{.mark} member states. A network of the finest
universities across the Alliance should be established and resourced to
allow cutting-edge multinational research to take place across multiple
disruptive technologies simultaneously.]{.underline} Perhaps Stanford
could lead on relevant AI research, while Delft and the University of
Chicago partner on quantum; maybe Imperial College London looks at
biotechnologies with Johns Hopkins University, while Tallinn University
centres its efforts on next generation cyber defences; and the École
Polytechnique and Massachusetts Institute of Technology examine future
telecommunication needs. [The point is [Allies]{.mark} will [need to
leverage]{.mark} such networks of universities in conjunction [with
national **government** research labs to]{.mark} provide maximum
[innovation coherence]{.mark}. The diversity of multinational,
multi-disciplined defence and security **innovation** research teams,
which NATO can engender, is a huge asset and is the Alliance's
competitive advantage. So to fix the fragmentation at the beginning of
our innovation pipeline, we need to have clear mission-oriented Allied
direction on where to focus resources for disruptive innovation
research, maximising]{.underline} comparative advantage across our
geography(s) and linking up universities with government research
entities. All of this could be funded by Allies through public sector
early stage patient capital. Please see footnote below for source

(French, Polish, Turkish, Russian, Ukrainian editions). As the image
above shows, governments have done this before and the technologies
created (internet, GPS, touchscreen et al, which fed into the building
of the iPod and iPhone) have had a huge impact on the way we live.
However, for all those successes, there will have been many failures and
this is where Allies will need to get comfortable. To quote one
anonymous Allied defence innovator: "if our success rate begins to go
above 35 per cent, I start to worry. It means we've stopped taking big
enough risks." Indeed, obvious research areas Allies might collaborate
on include the follow-on to 5G or the technology needed to enable total
supply chain assurance, for example. Utilise, adopt and scale Where the
first stage of NATO's innovation pipeline should centre on the creation
of disruptive innovative technologies, stage two is all about their
utilisation and adoption at scale. Utilisation This is where initial
public venture capital (VC) entities, such as in-q-tel, NSSIF, DefInvest
and SmartCap, can help 'crowd in' trusted private venture capital to
provide safe financing to NATO's fledgling start-ups, thereby minimising
their susceptibility to nefarious foreign direct investment. This issue
is impacting many start-ups as they raise funds and carries implications
when they wish to export their products but may not be able to, due to
unfriendly foreign ownership and technology transfer concerns raised by
Allied governments. In addition to Venture Capital entities supporting
the trusted financing of Allied start-ups, innovation accelerators -- in
combination with elite universities, and supported by Allied defence
professionals (operators, investors and procurement experts) -- can help
provide the necessary 'polish' to start-ups and their value
propositions. This will create the necessary ecosystem to maximise the
likelihood of commercial success. The United States' Air Force Ventures
is an interesting model of this approach, which helps to acquire new
start-up products at speed without being bogged down by acquisition
bureaucracy. Adoption But even when dual-use disruptive innovation is
commercialised, turned into prototypes and the product/market fit is
achieved, the challenge of getting initial contracts from customers
(both government and commercial) remains. Cash is king for young
companies, as they do not have the financial reserves to work through
long acquisition processes often associated with Allied governments. If
start-ups cannot close deals in a matter of weeks and months rather than
quarters and years, then they would not attempt to (opportunity cost).
Now, some commentators may argue: Why spend so much time discussing
start-ups? Traditional large armaments companies can be innovative. Why
go through all this effort for tiny companies that may or may not make
it? The reason is simple: the competition and creativity generated by
start-ups is good for the Allied defence ecosystem. Allied open
democracies and open educational models bring about levels of creativity
which other forms of government are unable to do. This maximises
disruptive innovation efforts and, as such, forces incumbents (large
companies) to compete with new, fresh thinking -- it builds resilience.
Speaking at a workshop on technology, security and finance, in June
2020, NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoană emphasised that "we
need to develop a culture of innovation, become more agile, have more
flexible governance arrangements and dare to take risks." Such
creativity and disruption is NATO's competitive advantage. Therefore,
NATO needs to adapt its acquisition models to accommodate start-ups,
their timelines and their potential. This fundamentally means our
acquisition professionals should be empowered to take measurable risk.
As one Ally's legislative body recently remarked: "Defence stakeholders
must integrate the risk culture, which is the only way to both enable
innovation in defence and to very quickly capture dual or civilian
innovation. Acculturation to innovation is a priority." Scaling If we
have managed to commercialise new technology, adopt it quickly as a
prototype and now wish to scale, how might this be done? Big tech could
have a role to play here. In May, it was reported that, in the first
quarter of 2020, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft spent
over 29 billion US dollars on research and development (R&D). That is
more than the entire 2020 NASA budget and represents a 17 per cent
increase on the same time period last year. In November 2018, the US
Congressional Research Service noted: "In 1960, the United States
accounted for 69% of global R&D, with U.S. defense-related R&D alone
accounting for more than one-third of global R&D (36%). Additionally,
the federal government funded approximately twice as much R&D as U.S.
business. However, from 1960 to 2016, the U.S. share of global R&D fell
to 28%, and the federal government's share of total U.S. R&D fell from
65% to 24%, while business's share more than doubled from 33% to 67%. As
a result of these global, national, and federal trends, federal defense
R&D's share of total global R&D fell to 3.7% in 2016." Big tech has the
resources and wherewithal to be able to scale new technologies at speed.
[[They could partner with successful **start**-ups]{.mark}, perhaps
through a joint **venture** or [an Alliance-wide **public-private
partnership**]{.mark}, to provide those [scale-up skills that start-ups
lack]{.mark}]{.underline} (for example, compliance, legal support,
production on mass, **[[intellectual property
protection]{.underline}]{.mark}**) without necessarily acquiring these
young companies. Sceptics will say this would present big tech with too
many opportunities for mergers and acquisitions and thus create
monopolistic risk. They might be right and clearly incentives for all
parties would need to be found. [But, if we are to [win the
**technological** adoption race built upon **liberal democratic
values**]{.mark}, [we need to use every **advantage** we have]{.mark}.
[To utilise, adopt and **scale** these **technologies
effectively**]{.mark}, we must have at the [forefront of our
minds]{.mark} the need to work at the [**speed** of relevance rather
than the speed of **approv**]{.mark}**al**. This means [new ways of
**financing technologies**,]{.mark} **interacting** with tech firms both
big and small, and much [more **agile acquisition** models]{.mark},
which carry the empowerment and incentives to those responsible [for
equipping the Alliance]{.mark}. Such a cultural shift will not be easy
-- but **innovation** rarely is.]{.underline} As we look towards NATO
2030 and heed Eisenhower's words of achieving both security and
solvency, while noting that the foundation of military strength is
economic strength, a resilient innovation pipeline that leverages our
comparative advantage, creativity and capital will be critical to the
Alliance maintaining its technological edge built on shared Allied
values. [This is the first of a mini-series of articles in which NATO's
innovation team will focus on technologies Allies are looking to adopt
and the opportunities they will bring to the defence and security of the
NATO Alliance.]{.underline}

July 12, 2021 [[America]{.mark} has been the undisputed [**global**

**century**. [But]{.mark} this global [order is in
**flux**]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}**
extensive [**[investments]{.mark}** and years of strategic
planning---[including]{.mark} strengthening its intellectual property
(**[IP]{.mark}**) regimes]{.underline}---have [[enabled it to
**catch**]{.mark} up to, and in some areas surpass, our
[**capabilities** in]{.mark} artificial intelligence
(**[AI]{.mark}**)]{.underline} and other emerging technologies. Congress
is mulling over legislative proposals to counter China's economic and
geopolitical ambitions for technological dominance and the president is
getting ready to announce a national AI strategy[. [IP **reform** must
be a part of this sea]{.mark} change to ready the United States for the
**AI** era.]{.underline} The newly emerging technologies are vastly
different from technologies of the past. [[AI provides]{.mark}
[computers the ability to learn]{.mark} on their own [and make
decisions]{.mark} that have traditionally required human
intelligence]{.underline}. [And [when combined with other]{.mark}
emerging [tech]{.mark}nologies, [its]{.mark} power [will be]{.mark}
truly **[dramatic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Quantum computers, for
example, which are based on the behavior of energy and materials on the
atomic and subatomic levels, can be millions of times faster than
current classical computers. [Just imagine [military]{.mark} equipment
[driven by AI]{.mark} and operated by quantum computers. The [country
that gains the lead in these]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nologies [will enjoy
towering national security advantages]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} in
[economic and military power]{.mark}.]{.underline} For [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to maintain its **technological**
edge]{.mark}, we must [encourage]{.mark}]{.underline} Americans to make
more [[discoveries in AI]{.underline}]{.mark} and other emerging
technologies. [This in turn requires [providing strong IP rights to
**incentivize** and **protect**]{.mark} the huge [investments]{.mark}
[required]{.mark} to make those **discoveries**.]{.underline}
[**China's** president Xi Jinping **recognizes** the critical role
**IP** plays in innovation and ultimately **national** security and has
underscored its importance to new fields such as big **data**, AI, and
genetic technology.]{.underline} The irony is that China relentlessly
steals IP from the United States, while simultaneously working to
strengthen its own IP system. China now reliably issues patents on
cutting-edge technologies, provides injunctions for infringement of
patented inventions, and has created specialty IP courts with procedures
and rules similar to those of Western courts. China's AI patenting has
increased dramatically in the past few years and is distributed broadly
across its companies, government organizations, and universities, while
U.S. patenting on AI comes mostly from large companies. On the
international stage, [[China uses its **IP**]{.mark} policies [to
attra]{.mark}ct [innovation]{.mark} to its borders and **influence** the
adoption of its technologies as global standards]{.underline}. Although
we are undeniably in a race for technology leadership[, the United
States is failing to leverage IP to its full **advantage**]{.underline}.
By including IP rights in the Constitution, [[America]{.mark} had
[granted]{.mark} itself a global [head start in the industrial
revolution]{.mark}.]{.underline} But the statute that defines the types
of inventions eligible for patent protection has effectively not changed
since 1793, well before any of the technologies of the modern era. This
has left the Supreme Court to hold recently that some of the most
critical inventions at the very core of AI and some other emerging
technologies are outside the scope of our patent laws. [This puts the
United States at a significant disadvantage vis-à-vis our key
competitors. [We are also behind]{.mark} our **[competitors]{.mark}**
[when it comes to IP policies]{.mark} surrounding the [big datasets
necessary for]{.mark} AI.]{.underline} If we are to maintain our
technological lead, [we must reexamine all such key IP weaknesses and
embrace IP policies that will incentivize and protect investments in
creating AI and other emerging technologie]{.underline}s. [[These are
bipartisan issues.]{.underline}]{.mark} As former directors of the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in Democrat and
Republican administrations, we [know that the U.S. government has the
expertise and capabilities to develop comprehensive IP policies to fuel
innovation aligned with our national security interests. This
government-wide expertise must be coordinated.]{.underline} A
whole-of-government approach [to develop comprehensive IP
policies]{.underline} is exactly what has just been recommended by the
National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI). An
independent commission created by Congress, NSCAI recently published a
report that recommends elevating [[U.S. IP policy]{.mark} to a national
priority [**integrated** into our national security
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under NSCAI's proposal, the secretary
of commerce, in coordination with the USPTO director and leaders of
other agencies, would recommend reforms and new policies that strengthen
our IP system and encourage more American innovation. As reflected in
NSCAI's recommendations, public deliberation with stakeholders in
industry and academia will be critical in exploring these issues. If we
are going to win the race for AI and other technologies critical to our
national security, we must use every available tool to expand America's
innovation engine. This means pulling America's IP levers to optimize
technology and economic competitiveness. The United States should
implement NSCAI's IP recommendations.

While some maintain an artificial general intelligence (AGI), i.e.,
human or above human artificial intelligence (AI), is impossible
(Fjelland 2020), others believe an AGI is attainable (Goertzel and
Pennachin 2020; Wang and Goertzel 2012). In the latter instance, that
the world has not attained global peace is a risk factor for the
development of an AGI (Yamakawa 2019). Consequently, the international
defence community is beginning to consider the [national security risk
posed by]{.underline} AGI [development and its implications for
international relations (IR),]{.underline} including calls to act (De
Spiegeleire et al. 2017:107). One risk is that [a [single
**nation--state** developing]{.mark} an AGI could '[lock
in']{.mark}]{.underline} economic or [[**military**
**supremacy**]{.mark} as an 'end point' [to competition in
**international** politics]{.mark}, as that [state would]{.mark} be able
to prevent a rival AGI being developed and through **accumulating**
power would [establish **global domination**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Horowitz 2018:54[). [**AI** is]{.mark} already [a **major national
security** issue]{.mark} because [it can be **militarized**]{.mark},
[employed]{.mark} in adversarial contexts, [and provide a **decisive**
advantage]{.mark} in terms of [**economic, information** and
**military** superiority]{.mark}]{.underline} (Allen and Chan 2017;
Babuta et al. 2020; National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence \[NSCAI\] 2021). Consequently, the 2021 NSCAI report urges
[that the **[US attain military AI readiness]{.mark}**]{.underline} by
2025; thus, [AI is important for waging decisive war.]{.underline} For
the major powers, [**[AI technological supremacy]{.mark}**, generated by
economic power, is already viewed as [**paramount to national security**
and **global leadership**]{.mark}]{.underline} (NSCAI 2021:7): [Military
AI is potentially **revolutionary** as it could outstrip the pace of
**human** decision-making, "potentially resulting in a loss of human
control in warfare]{.underline}" (Congressional Research Service \[CRS\]
2020:37). [It also constitutes an **unpredictable** threat: ["AI
systems]{.mark} capable of [inherently unpredictable actions]{.mark} in
[close proximity to an adversary's systems]{.mark} may result [in
inadvertent escalation or miscalculation]{.mark}"]{.underline} (CRS
2020:37). Additionally, while Baum (2017) found little evidence of
military AGI projects, the 2021 NSCAI report endorses a push towards
more general AI, in a future that it envisages will experience a
societal level of advanced, accelerated adversarial AI attacks and
ubiquitous interstate AI warfare, including by autonomous systems, with
conflict over intellectual property and technological leadership. As
with some previous researchers (e.g., Totschnig 2019), [we maintain that
developing an AGI is not primarily a technological problem but a
political one.]{.underline} However, where most such researchers
consider humanity's relationship with an above-human-intelligence
Artificial Superintelligence (ASI; Bostrom 2014) at [a general
**political** level,]{.underline} this article focuses [on the specific
[**challenge** it poses fo]{.mark}r I]{.underline}R via militarized
ASI-enabled/directed war. Consequently, our research question applies
Bostrom's (2002:25) Maxipok rule of thumb for moral action [for
[**existential** risks]{.mark}, i.]{.underline}e., how is it possible
[to "Maximize the probability of an **okay** outcome, where an "**okay**
outcome" is any outcome that avoids existential disaster?",]{.underline}
to constraining by treaty the risk of ASI-enabled/directed warfare? In
humanity's simultaneously militarizing AI along nation-state lines and
developing ASI projects, it is playing technology roulette. Yet, [formal
cooperation in high-level global peacebuilding presents a realistic
solution that alleviates the 'security dilemma']{.underline} (Tang 2009)
that developing an ASI causes. Former Navy Secretary Richard Danzig
(2018:21) noted, "[If humanity comes to recognize that we now confront a
great **common** threat from what we are creating, we can **similarly**
open opportunities for coming together."]{.underline} In this
cooperative spirit, we constrain the existential risk with the stratagem
of peace-building by treaty. In security terms, steps towards a peace
treaty governing ASI development and deployment, and potentially
reaching out to a future ASI, are a form of misperception-avoiding
reassurance---a probing communication designed to both signal benign
intentions and obtain information via feedback on another party's
intent, as well as a means of resolve (Tang 2010), i.e[., signaling and
operationalizing resistance to a malignly directed or to an
intrinsically malign, expansionist, and hegemonic ASI.]{.underline} This
article hypothesizes [that militarizing AI introduces the risk that [ASI
development is weaponized, or weaponizes itself]{.mark}]{.underline}. We
then argue that [[the **existential** risk that this]{.mark} presents
can be [minimized]{.mark}, or partly 'constrained', in the same way as
other potentially [**catastrophic** risks involving
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, i.e., by treaty. Bostrom (2014) briefly
considers treaty approaches, and one of Allen and Kania's (2017:6)
recommendations is for the US to: "study what AI applications the United
States should seek to restrict with treaties." They focus on an arms
control approach, using the example that AI should never control dead
man's nuclear switches. Another treaty-[[based approach is
**optimising** the likelihood of developing a beneficial
**ASI**]{.underline}]{.mark}, through a comprehensive UN 'Benevolent AGI
Treaty' (Ramamoorthy and Yampolskiy 2018). We consider an alternative,
but potentially compatible, approach, i.e., the Universal Global Peace
Treaty (UGPT; Carayannis et al. 2019), currently under development by
the peacebuilding NGOs-backed Global Ceasefire to Universal Global Peace
Treaty Project. This article's conceptualization of a UGPT transcends
the UN's ongoing COVID-19-inspired Global Ceasefire (Chekijian and
Bazarchyan 2021) to adopt the Kantian concept of a 'perpetual peace',
founded on a cosmopolitanism and a democratic state of states (Terminski
2010), the foundational notion which underpins the UN's transitioning
the world from war to peace. Kantian cosmopolitanism is based on respect
for fellow intelligences and so is of particular relevance to ASI
researchers (Totschnig 2019). The UGPT described herein would formalise
the present quasi-universal status of interstate peace and end the
declaring of war. [It would also seek to end existing interstate hot and
cold wars, as well as internal or civil wars, which might prove to be
flashpoints for a future global conflict; seek to prevent a pre-emptive
war against a non-malign emerging ASI;]{.underline} and seek to
constrain the future actions of both a malign and intrinsically
non-malign but malignly directed ASI to prevent it warring on behalf of
a nation--state, or on behalf of itself, for global domination, which we
term ASI-enabled/directed war[. That an ASI could pose an
**existential** risk is well theorised (Bostrom 2002, 2014). The basic
thesis is, first, an initial [**superintelligence** might
obtain]{.mark}]{.underline} [a]{.mark} decisive strategic advantage such
that it establishes a 'singleton', i.e., global domination (Bostrom
2006). Second, the orthogonality principle suggests that a
superintelligence will not necessarily share any altruistic human final
values. Third, instrumental convergence suggests that even a
superintelligence with a positive final goal might not limit its
activities so as not to infringe on human interests, particularly if
humans constitute potential threats. Consequently[, an [ASI might
**turn** against humanity]{.mark} ('the treacherous turn'[) or
experience a catastrophic malignant failure mode]{.mark}, for instance
through perversely **instantiating** its final goal or pursuing

The external risk is predicated on a [nation-state developing and using
an ASI to optimise itself and wage war, whether cyber, hot, or
otherwise, for global domination]{.underline}, i.e., war by AI-state.
[Such an ASI would affect military technological supremacy and transform
both IR and warfare.]{.underline} AI already adds complexity to national
security (CRS 2020) in bargaining, verification and enforcement,
communication, deterrence and assurance, and the offense--defense
balance, as well as norms, institutions, and regimes (Zwetsloot 2018).
It [contributes to military capacity in intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance; logistics; cyberspace operations; information
operations; semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles; lethal autonomous
weapons (LAWs) systems, and command and control (CRS 2020). [Interstate
ASI-enabled cyberwarfare]{.mark} introduces the possibility of a
successful [surprise attack with]{.mark} covert [capabilities,
**destabilizing**]{.mark} the status quo and [risking a preventive first
strike]{.mark}]{.underline} (Buchanan 2016). [An [AI-state
capable]{.mark} of optimising all these **capabilities** [is highly
desirable for **strategic military planning** and interstate
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} (Sotala and Yampolskiy 2015[). A "one AI"
solution to the 'control problem' of ASI m]{.underline}otivation
(Turchin et al. 2019) [includes the first [ASI being used to assume
global control]{.mark}, providing a [decisive strategic and military
advantage]{.mark} for a superpower.]{.underline} While this may be
acceptable to the [AI-state superpower and its allies, it presents a
'high risk' for others. The race to develop an [ASI is likely to be
**closely fought**,]{.mark} especially given [**competing** major states
with different fundamental ideologies]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bostrom
2014); it [therefore [presents a very **concrete risk**. AI is already
being militarized **and** weaponized]{.mark} by several states,
[including China and Russia]{.mark}, for strategic geopolitical
advantage]{.underline} (NSCAI 2021). [Russia plans to obtain **30%** of
its combat power from remote-controlled and AI-enabled robotic
platforms]{.underline} by 2030 (Walters 2017). Similarly, China's 2017
'A Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan' [views AI
in geopolitically strategic terms, and it is pursuing a 'military-civil
fusion' strategy to develop a first-mover advantage in AI to **establish
technological supremacy** by 2030]{.underline} (Allen and Kania 2017).
In the US, following the National Security Commission Artificial
Intelligence Act of 2018 (H.R.5356; see Baum 2018), AI is being
militarized and weaponized by the Department of Defense, under the
oversight of the NSCAI. [The [AI arms **race is now a self-fulfilling
prophec**]{.mark}**y**]{.underline} (Scharre 2019). [ASI-enabled warfare
poses especial [risks to geopolitical stability]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although Sotala and Yampolskiy's (2015) survey focuses on ASI-generated
catastrophic risks, citing Bostrom (2002), [they acknowledge multiple
risks from a sole ASI, like an AI-state, including the concentration of
political power in controlling grou]{.underline}ps. Citing e.g.,
Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2011), [they note that automation could lead to
an ever-increasing transfer of power and wealth to the ASI's
owner]{.underline}. Citing, inter alia, Bostrom (2002) and Gubrud
(1997), [they also note that ASIs could be used to develop advanced
weapons, plan military operations, and effect political
takeovers]{.underline} (2015:3). [Academic approaches to analysing the
specific risk of an AI-state maintaining or establishing global
domination are relatively novel]{.underline}. In 2014, Bostrom noted
that a "severe race dynamic" between different teams developing ASI
technology could cause shortcuts to safety and potentially "violent
conflict". Subsequently, Cave and ÓhÉigeartaigh (2018:37) described
three dangers associated with an AI race for technological supremacy:
(i) The dangers of an AI 'race for technological advantage' framing,
regardless of whether the race is seriously pursued; (ii) [The dangers
of an AI 'race for technological advantage' framing and an actual AI
race for **technological** advantage, regardless of whether the race is
won;]{.underline} (iii) [The dangers of an AI race for technological
advantage being won]{.underline}. In response, the same authors
recommend [developing AI as a shared priority for global good,
[cooperating globally on AI as it is applied to increasingly
safety--critical **settings**, and responsibly developing AI as part of
a **meaningful** approach]{.mark} to public **perception** that
decreases the likelihood or severity of a race-driven
**discourse**.]{.underline} The obvious risk is that the political
leaders of states engaged in an AI arms race may not heed this advice.
This article focuses on constraining risks associated with Cave and
ÓhÉigeartaigh's (2018) third danger. It does not consider the
philosophical implications of which nation--state might want to develop
an ASI for offensive purposes. [A sufficient literature already exists
on recent nation--states that have sought to establish global domination
through technological suprema]{.underline}cy, for instance the British
Empire (Tindley and Wodehouse 2016), [to confirm [an existential risk
exists.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Following World War II, the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and]{.mark} its **democratic** [allies established]{.mark} and defended
a rules-based [**international** system]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
system was expanded and deepened after the end of the Cold War.
[[Despite]{.mark} its [shortcomings]{.mark}, it has [proven
**unmatched** in]{.mark} its [ability to deliver **peace**,
**prosperity**, and **freedom** to]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates and much of the world.]{.underline} The global order,
however, is at an inflection point. [It is [being confronted by
**revisionist**]{.mark} autocratic [powers]{.mark} --- [China and
**Russia**]{.mark} --- and, at the same time, [contending with a range
of]{.mark} other **[challenges]{.mark}**, [from]{.mark} emerging and
disruptive **[tech]{.mark}nologies** to climate change to a lack of
confidence in open-market democracy.]{.underline} The rules-based system
has been successful in ways that its founders could not have imagined.
But, as the authors of this report have set forth in a series of related
publications, [this [system must be **revitalized** and
**adapted**]{.mark} for a new era. Inclusive
[institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the United Nations (UN),
[have been [limited in their]{.mark} [effectiveness]{.mark}, in part
[because of]{.mark} obstruction by [autocracies that systematically
violate]{.mark} key [tenants]{.mark} of the rules-based
system]{.underline}. New institutions are needed that bring together
powerful and likeminded democracies -- those that are willing to play by
certain rules and use their collective influence to positively shape the
future of the system. Such an approach is particularly necessary to
address [the challenges of emerging technologies]{.underline}. The world
is experiencing a Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). An array of new
technologies are being simultaneously developed and advanced, such as
**[[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence]{.underline}** (AI),
quantum computing, synthetic biology, additive manufacturing, fintech,
and [robotics]{.underline}. [As with previous advances, these new
technologies off er great promise but [also threaten serious downside
risks.]{.mark}]{.underline} Fire can fuel stoves and keep people warm,
but it can also be used to torch villages. Similarly, AI algorithms can
be employed to run efficient smart cities of the future, but can also
guide lethal and destructive autonomous weapons systems. The central
question is how can the United States and its allies harness these
advanced technologies for good while successfully managing their
potential dangers? [Among the greatest challenges in the area of
technology are those posed by **China**. As]{.underline} it acts to
challenge the rules based international system, Beijing is pursuing a
systematic effort to win the race for advanced technologies, and it
appears to be leading in several key areas. [[China]{.mark} has
**[invested]{.mark}** heavily [in r]{.mark}esearch [and]{.mark}
[d]{.mark}evelopment in advanced technologies]{.underline}, from AI to
quantum computing to hypersonic missiles, while also gaining advantages
through unfair practices, [[including]{.mark} the widespread theft of
intellectual property (**[IP]{.mark}**). China's [increasing
capabilities in the tech]{.mark}nology realm [pose **significant** risks
for the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and its **democratic** allies
and]{.mark} partners.]{.underline} These risks are evident across three
main areas: defense and national security, economics, and values[.
[Beijing is]{.mark} using [its increasingly advanced]{.mark}
**technological** [capabilities to **develop** more sophisticated
weapons systems]{.mark}. China's [leadership in advanced
**technologies**]{.mark} could help fuel its economic growth and
[render]{.mark} much of [the world **dependent** on]{.mark} it for
critical [technologies]{.mark}. [Beijing]{.mark} is also [**employing**
new tech]{.mark}nologies [in ways that are **inconsistent** with
**democratic**]{.mark} norms, [such as facial recognition
technology]{.mark} [to]{.mark} assert greater [**surveillance** of its
citizens,]{.mark} and is exporting [these **technologies** to other
autocracies]{.mark}.]{.underline} To be sure, not every aspect of
China's role in developing advanced technology is cause for concern.
Efforts by Chinese scholars to develop AI for medical diagnostics, for
example, could constructively advance scientific knowledge and provide
health benefits for people around the [world. The challenges posed by
[China]{.mark} and other autocracies, [including Russia]{.mark}, stem
from their [disregard of **international** **norms**]{.mark} and
systematic attempts to undermine key **elements** of the rules-based
order.]{.underline} The nation or group of nations that are first to
develop and harness the technologies of the 4IR will enjoy a sustained
economic, military, and geopolitical advantage. The first three
industrial revolutions originated in the West and helped propel
democracies to a position of global leadership that has lasted for
several centuries. [If leading [democracies]{.mark} are [able]{.mark} to
maintain their [technological edge, they will be well-positioned]{.mark}
to sustain their [geopolitical]{.mark}, economic, and military
[advantages]{.mark} and uphold [the rules-based international
system]{.mark}.]{.underline} If, on the other hand, the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) succeeds in deploying advanced technologies ahead
of the democratic world, [it will be in a [much stronger
position]{.mark} to advance a [China]{.mark}-centric system that is more
consistent with its [**autocratic** values]{.mark}. Indeed, the
strategic competition between [**democracy** and autocracy]{.mark} may
ultimately be [decided in the **technological**
domain]{.mark}.]{.underline} For the United States to prevail in this
competition, [it must successfully harness the **technologies** of the
Fourth Industrial Revolution]{.underline}. But to compete effectively,
[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [**cannot** act
**alone**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [It must work closely
with]{.underline}]{.mark} [**democratic** [allies]{.mark} and partners
to [**leverage** shared **capabilities** and **resources**]{.mark}, and
implement joint strategies and policies that are **strategically**
aligned]{.underline}. Several efforts have been initiated to help
strengthen democratic cooperation on the technologies of the 4IR,
including through the G7, the Quad, and the US-EU Trade and Technology
Council. However, while valuable, these efforts have been limited in
geographic and technological scope. [What is missing is an
[**integrated** framework for **technology**]{.mark} cooperation [that
**brings** together]{.mark} leading [**democracies**]{.mark} to advance
a [**holistic**, **coherent**, and **effective** set of
**strategies**]{.mark} across a range of domains.]{.underline}

The hard truth is that a [world]{.underline} that [is]{.underline} [less
free]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [one]{.underline} that is [less
secure]{.underline}, stable and prosperous. The [greatest
dangers]{.underline} to the American way of life [emanate]{.underline}

quick fixes, but [the best [antidotes]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the challenges of [great-power
**[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.mark} **mass [migration]{.mark}**]{.underline} of desperate
refugees [[lie]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[building]{.underline} of [inclusive
**[democratic]{.mark}**]{.underline}
**[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- and working with allied
democracies to sustain the free and open order that China, in
particular, wishes to replace with a world that's safe for autocracy.
The conventional wisdom that authoritarianism has popular momentum is
wrong. No one anywhere is taking to the street to demand more corrupt
governance, the adoption of one-man rule, a stronger surveillance state,
or greater intervention by malign foreign powers. Democratic freedoms
are unquestionably under assault in many nations. Autocrats are
aggressive precisely because of the growing demands for change in their
more modern, connected societies --- and the rising risk that middle
classes in nations such as China and Russia will not be willing forever
to forfeit political rights for prosperity. American retrenchment and
[isolationism]{.underline} [compound]{.underline} the
[danger]{.underline}. It would be nice to live in a world where failed
states and dictatorships were a problem for someone else to worry about.
But rather than producing stability, [Western
[retreat]{.mark}]{.underline} only **[[emboldens]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[autocrats]{.underline}]{.mark} [in ways that amplify]{.underline}
[dangers]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [American]{.underline} [national
security]{.underline}. We know that violent [extremism]{.underline}
[flourishes]{.underline} [under]{.underline} state failure and
[dictatorship]{.underline}. [Broken states become breeding
grounds]{.underline} [for]{.underline} extremist groups because they
leave vacuums that [terrorists]{.underline} are only too happy to fill.
[In nations without democratic accountability]{.underline},
[citizens]{.underline} [become drawn to]{.underline} the only forms of
[expression]{.underline} [available]{.underline} to them,
[which]{.underline} [are]{.underline} often [violent]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [extreme]{.underline}. The good news is that we have
billions of allies around the world: citizens on every continent chafing
for greater freedom and dignity. They do not want U.S. military-led
nation-building. They want peaceful support for their independent
efforts to create democratic space in systems distorted by overweening
government control, dangerous governance gaps and foreign malign
influence. The free world cannot be neutral in the face of autocracy's
resurgence. Rather, it should play to its strengths. The appeal of
democratic opportunity is a strategic asset for the United States ---
despite our own shortcomings --- because people around the world
similarly aspire to live in societies that guarantee justice, rights and
dignity. America's closest allies are democracies. [[Democracies
don't]{.mark} **[fight]{.mark}** [**each**
**other**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[export]{.underline}]{.mark} [violent
**[extremism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[or produce]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} [that]{.underline}
[drive]{.underline} [mass migration]{.underline}. [[Democracies]{.mark}
are [better]{.mark}]{.underline} partners [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[**fighting** **terrorism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, human trafficking and
poverty, as well as establishing reliable trading relationships. [Open

[that]{.underline} [will]{.underline} help [[solve]{.underline}]{.mark}
the world's most [pressing problems]{.underline}, [including **[climate
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Citizens can hold leaders accountable
when they fall short, and democratic institutions are stronger than any
man --- as America itself witnessed after the assault on the U.S.
Capitol on Jan. 6.

Researchers at the Center on Long-Term Risk, a non-profit research
institute in London, have [expanded upon x-risks with the
even-more-chilling prospect of suffering risks]{.underline}. These
["**[s-risks]{.mark}**" [are]{.mark} defined as "**[suffering]{.mark}**
on [an **astronomical scale**]{.mark}, [vastly]{.mark} [**exceeding**
all]{.mark} suffering [that has existed]{.mark}]{.underline} on Earth
[so far]{.underline}." [In these scenarios, life continues]{.underline}
for billions of people, [but the quality is **so low** and the outlook
so bleak that dying out would be **preferable**]{.underline}. In short:
[a future with **negative value** is **worse** than one with **no value
at all**]{.underline}. This is where the "world in chains" scenario
comes in. [[If]{.mark} a **[malevolent]{.mark}**]{.underline} group or
**[[government]{.underline}]{.mark}** suddenly [[gained]{.mark}
world-dominating [power **through tech**]{.mark}**nology**, and there
was nothing to stand in its way, it could [lead]{.mark} [to]{.mark} an
[**extended period** of]{.mark} **abject [suffering]{.mark}** and
**subjugation**]{.underline}. A 2017 report on existential risks from
the Global Priorities Project, in conjunction with FHI and the Ministry
for Foreign Affairs of Finland, warned that "[[a]{.mark} long [future
under a]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly [brutal **global
[totalitarian]{.mark}** [state]{.mark} could]{.underline} arguably [be
[**worse** than]{.mark} **complete [extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}".
Though global totalitarianism is still a niche topic of study,
researchers in the field of existential risk are increasingly turning
their attention to its most likely cause: artificial intelligence. In
his "singleton hypothesis", Nick Bostrom, director at Oxford's FHI, has
explained how a [[global government]{.mark} could form [with
**AI**]{.mark} or other powerful technologies]{.underline} -- [and why
it might be [**impossible** to overthrow]{.mark}]{.underline}. He writes
that a world with "[a single decision-making agency at the highest
level]{.underline}" [[could occur]{.mark} if that agency "obtains a
decisive lead through a technological breakthrough in
**a**]{.underline}rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [or molecular
**nanotechnology**]{.underline}". Once in charge, it [[would control
advances in tech]{.mark}nology [that **prevent**]{.mark} **internal
[challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline}, like surveillance or autonomous
weapons, [and]{.underline}, with this monopoly, [[remain **perpetually
stable**]{.underline}]{.mark}. If the singleton is totalitarian,
**[[life would be bleak]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even in the countries
with the strictest regimes, news leaks in and out from other countries
and people can escape. [A global totalitarian rule would **eliminate**
even these **small seeds of hope**]{.underline}. [To be **worse than
extinction**]{.underline}, "[that would mean [we feel]{.mark} absolutely
**[no freedom]{.mark}**, **[no privacy]{.mark}**, **[no]{.mark}**
**hope** of **[escap]{.mark}ing**, **[no agency]{.mark}** to control our
lives at all]{.underline}\", says Tucker Davey, a writer at the Future
of Life Institute in Massachusetts, which focuses on existential risk
research. "In totalitarian regimes of the past, \[there was\] so much
paranoia and psychological suffering because you just have no idea if
you\'re going to get killed for saying the wrong thing," he continues.
"And now imagine that there\'s not even a question, every single thing
you say is being reported and being analysed." "We may not yet have the
technologies to do this," Ord said in a recent interview, "but it looks
like the kinds of technologies we're developing make that easier and
easier. And it seems plausible that this may become possible at some
time in the next 100 years." Though life under a global totalitarian
government is still an unlikely and far-future scenario, [[AI]{.mark} is
already [**enabling** **authoritarianism**]{.mark}]{.underline} in some
countries and strengthening infrastructure that could be seized by an
opportunistic despot in others. "We\'ve seen sort of a reckoning with
the shift from very utopian visions of what technology might bring to
much more sobering realities that are, in some respects, already quite
dystopian," says Elsa Kania, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for
New American Security, a bipartisan non-profit that develops national
security and defence policies. In the past,
**[[surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark}** required hundreds of thousands
of people -- one in every 100 citizens in East Germany was an informant
-- but now it [[can be done by **tech**]{.mark}**nology**]{.underline}.
In the United States, the National Security Agency (NSA) collected
hundreds of millions of American call and text records before they
stopped domestic surveillance in 2019, and there are an estimated four
to six million CCTV cameras across the United Kingdom. Eighteen of the
20 most surveilled cities in the world are in China, but London is the
third. [[The difference]{.mark} between them [lies]{.mark} less in the
tech that the countries employ and more [in **how they use
it**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

STUTTGART, Germany --- NATO is on a time crunch to develop new cloud
technologies to help set interoperability standards for its members' own
nascent computing infrastructures. One of [[NATO's]{.mark} core
[duties]{.mark}]{.underline} has long been to
[[establish]{.underline}]{.mark} technology [standards]{.underline} and
[[ensure **interoperability**]{.mark} across its **member**
nations]{.underline}. Traditionally, that manifested in areas such as
radio frequencies or data protocols. But with [recent
advances]{.underline} in cloud computing and storage in the private
sector, [[the alliance]{.mark} also needs to move **[quickly]{.mark}**
to [ensure **standardization**]{.mark} in that technological
domain]{.underline}. NATO members France, German and the United States
began fielding their own strategies and directives for using artificial
intelligence. Cloud technologies will enable AI systems, and achieving
results in cloud platforms "can help accelerate AI development and use,"
said Erica Pepe, a senior coordinator for research and a conflict,
security and development analyst at the International Institute for
Security Studies in London, England. "Member nations are developing
their [own]{.underline} artificial intelligence
[[strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}, and NATO [plays an important [role in
**establishing** interoperability]{.mark}]{.underline} standards. In
this context, showing results [quickly is [**important** for NATO to
give a **common**]{.mark} direction]{.underline}," Pepe said. The field
is already becoming ever cloudier, with countries setting up their own
cloud-enabled technology hubs and joint-European programs developing
separate combat-driven systems, such as the Franco-German-Spanish Future
Combat Air System program. Observers say these systems will need to be
interoperable if they are to provide a full range of capabilities, and
they see NATO as the natural lead to develop common standards across its
members' individual efforts. NATO is well aware of its need to embrace
cloud technologies and move ahead on tangible efforts --- defense
leaders were heralding its importance for in-theater operations back in
2015. Since then, the alliance has invested in multiple cloud-enabled
technologies --- much of which remained in research and testing phases
--- and has begun developing policies and strategies to define NATO's
stake in this technology. "We already have a cloud-first strategy in
NATO. Now we need to live it and adopt it," NATO Communications and
Information Agency General Manager Kevin Scheid said at the alliance's
June 2020 virtual discussion on cloud computing, as reported by Mönch
Publishing Group. "It's time to adopt and stop admiring the problem."
One program under the microscope is NATO's Firefly effort to field NCI
Agency's first theater-level, deployable defense cloud capability. The
system will enable troops working under the NATO flag to receive,
analyze and transmit data in real time among static headquarters and
across operational theaters. It will build upon and complement the
alliance's deployable communication and information systems, and provide
a suite of command-and-control services in fewer, lighter hardware
boxes. French company Thales was selected in late 2020 to develop the
Firefly system, and the team is expected to complete the design phase as
well as perform factory testing this year, with production to begin in
2022 and finish in 2023. The contract includes 42 million euros (\$49
million) for up to eight expected systems, but no funds will be
allocated until the completion of the preliminary design review, per the
alliance's NCI Agency. The goal of Firefly is to bring "new modern
technologies" to "the edge of our networks, in hostile environments,"
said Antonio Calderon, acting chief technology officer at the agency.
Thales is performing the majority of the work in-house, but will use
"best-of-breed solutions" from the commercial sector for features such
as cloud storage and firewalls, said Jean-François Connan, the company's
sales director for institutions, network infrastructure and group
strategic alliances. While NATO may have recognized the benefit of such
a system years ago, the cloud technology itself had to mature enough to
make a system like Firefly a reality --- and to convince government
customers that cloud solutions are indeed viable. That confluence only
happened over the past two or so years, Connan noted. "Cloud providers
have been offering solutions that today are satisfying more of the
criteria of the customer: scalability, sustainability, security and, of
course, price," he said. Time is of the essence to field this system
before the technology becomes obsolete and requirements must be reset.
Connan noted that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted Firefly's schedule for
contract negotiations. "We had to reconsider and reevaluate, \[and\] the
technical solutions had to be refreshed to be up to date." It is crucial
for [NATO to have a cloud-based system in the near term to ensure
operators have secure and rapid access to informatio]{.underline}n, Pepe
noted. "[It is important to [show]{.mark} that the technological [edge
is still kept within the alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}," she said.
Firefly's all-in-one system architecture, which includes application
management, IT networks and security, represents a "holistic" approach
to NATO's deployable C2 assets, said Lauren Speranza, director of
trans-Atlantic Defense and Security at the Center for European Policy
Analysis in Washington. The Firefly program is "exactly the type of
approach NATO should be moving toward --- away from having different
platforms and \[toward\] building an overarching system-of-systems
approach that we hear so much about," she added. But as member nations
and other stakeholders develop separate cloud solutions, the key for
NATO is ensuring these systems can communicate and interface among
themselves. "[Even though NATO has **adopted** \[a system\] that should
work across all of the nations, if there are other capabilities out
there at use in the **national** context, [we]{.mark} still [have
limited interoperability]{.mark}]{.underline}," Speranza said. "So that,
I think, is going to be the challenge going forward." [[NATO]{.mark}
[will need to develop]{.mark} more rigid [guidelines]{.mark} and
standards for [cloud solutions as well as ensure those guidelines
resolve the inevitable disagreements related to intellectual property
sharing and data sharing]{.mark} between member nations,]{.underline}
she noted. "As we get into more dual-use technologies, like the cloud,
[there's going to be a whole bunch of regulatory and governance issues

said. For Thales' Connan, [interoperability and open standards are part

[all]{.mark} the [usual IP **issues**]{.mark} associated [with
**developing** software products come into play]{.mark},]{.underline}

[who]{.mark} else [has a **right** to use these]{.mark}. But AI systems
also come with **additional** IP **challenges**. Ownership of [AI

the AI System [Developing an [AI system generally **involves** training

that data which is available for free online can be used for any
purpose. But this generally isn't the case; website terms and conditions
will often state that data cannot be used for commercial purposes, and
using data without permission could also be a breach of third party
copyright or database rights. [In fact, using data without permission

During the last Presidential campaign, [then candidate Biden famously
promised to put an end to fossil fuels]{.underline}. True to his
commitment, President Biden has attempted to make the oil and gas
industry less attractive to both corporations and investors. From
canceling the Keystone pipeline, to canceling oil and gas leases in
Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, to freezing new oil leases on federal
lands, efforts to minimize domestic production of fossil fuel in America
have been enormously successful. The Energy Problem For better or worse,
[policy choices are being made that are intentionally deflating the
supply of domestic oil and gas, which causes inflating
prices]{.underline}. Of course, many disagree and want to blame Russia
for most everything, and while it is an embarrassment that Vladimir
Putin's unprovoked atrocities are not cause for unanimous international
discipline, Russia's invasion has not removed oil from the worldwide
market. In fact, Russia continues to sell oil to Asia despite sanctions.
According to Bloomberg the sales of Russian oil are at steep discounts,
which should be keeping the cost of this worldwide commodity
artificially low, since Asian countries buying cheap oil from Russia do
not need to compete to buy oil elsewhere. The energy problem is
two-fold. First, worldwide supply of oil has decreased at a time
economies are coming out of the pandemic, and demand for energy is
increasing. Second, clean energy solutions are simply not able to
provide an answer to the demands of a 21st century economy. According to
the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), in 2020, the
United States had 135 refineries with the capacity to refine 19 million
barrels of oil per day. Today, there are 128 refineries with capacity to
refine 17.9 million barrels of oil per day. Meanwhile, as the United
States lost refining capacity of 1.1 million barrels per day, another
2.2 million barrels per day of refining capacity was lost worldwide.
Political and financial pressure from investors to move away from fossil
fuels is cited as the reason for the decrease in production, not the
drop in consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. The shift away from
fossil fuel to alternative energy was well underway before the pandemic,
causing oil companies to transition away from refining, and focusing on
an alternative energy future. And recently, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told
Motley Fool that he doesn't think the United States will ever build
another refinery given the lead time, and investment is simply not
economically practical. "You're looking at committing capital 10 years
out, that will need decades to offer a return for shareholders, in a
policy environment where governments around the world are saying, 'We
don't want these products to be used in the future.\'" So[, given the
[shift]{.mark} toward [clean energy and away from fossil fuels]{.mark},
investment in time and money to build new [**refining** capacity just
doesn't make **financial** sense]{.mark}. This artificial restriction of
fossil fuels is for the most laudable of goals, but the
[**justification** doesn't change]{.mark} basic [**economic**
principles, or the science]{.mark} of **extracting** clean power from
nature.]{.underline} A restricted supply of a coveted commodity causes
prices to increase. And recent stabilization of gas prices merely means
that we have finally reached the point where people are behaving
differently, which impacts demand, thus impacting price, and suggests
headwinds for the economy. A Very Fine Mess: Clean Energy is Not Ready
For now, at least, the die has been cast in America. [Russia is selling
their oil into China and India, and reports suggest that European
countries are making the choice to return to coal and build more nuclear
power plants. Meanwhile, rather than produce more domestic oil and
**gas**, President Biden will ask Saudi Arabia to **produce** more
fossil fuels and then **ship** them to America, which seems to defeat
the environmental spirit, if not the **fundamental** purpose behind the
elimination of fossil fuels in the first place. All of this is a very
fine mess, really.]{.underline} Against this sad, bizarre backdrop,
American families are hurting, and there is really no reason to suspect
an end in sight. It should be particularly telling that European
countries, which have long been on the leading edge of environmental
activism, are returning to coal and nuclear options. Why? Clean energy
is simply not ready to replace the power requirements for a 21st century
society---it is that simple. ["No country has been held hostage to
access to the sun; no country has been hostage to the
wind]{.underline}," U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has become
fond of saying, as a rationale for moving with all due speed to a clean
energy future. The problem is, Granholm is precisely wrong---on the
science. [While solar and wind energy do not hold countries hostage
quite like Vladimir Putin holds Europe hostage through dependency on
fossil fuel, clean energy is extraordinarily fickle.]{.underline} Solar
energy cannot work as a reliable solution on any level without
predictable and lengthy access to the sun, and the wind does not always
blow. Because of the vagaries in solar and wind energy, coupled with the
extreme limitations on battery technology, it is simply not possible to
collect appropriate volumes of alternative forms of energy when the sun
is shining, and the wind is blowing for use when the sun is not shining,
and the wind is not blowing. And this is not opinion, it is science.
[Either multiple [paradigms must **shift**]{.mark} in multiple
[tech]{.mark}nology [sectors]{.mark} in order [make alternative, clean
**energy**]{.mark} a viable [solution to **replace** fossil
fuels]{.mark}, or we need [generations of **progress** at the current
pace]{.mark}. Wishing this [**scientific** and technological reality to
be untrue]{.mark} and hoping for a magic wand politicians can wave [will
not eliminate]{.mark} brown outs and black outs and usurious [energy
prices]{.mark} in the meantime.]{.underline} The Patent Problem And if
the Biden Administration does want an alternative energy future, it
[better figure out how to [fix a **broken**]{.mark} American [patent
system where]{.mark} virtually [nothing is patent **eligible**]{.mark},
and it better]{.underline} also figure out how to keep the United
Nations and developing countries from [stealing **proprietary** rights
of innovators. [Innovators need **funding** and you simply cannot
**invest** in what **others** can take]{.mark}. If]{.underline} you
cannot recover sunk costs and turn a profit, investors will turn to
other, safer investments that provide acceptable returns on their
investment without the risk and political uncertainties presently found
in funding the most important innovations. [Witness what is developing
before our eyes not even months after the TRIPS waiver was finalized
relating to COVID-19 vaccine technologies. On the heels of the Biden
**Administration** siding with developing nations in their effort to
appropriate vaccine technology,]{.underline} UN Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres [is calling for all intellectual **property** on clean
energy technologies to be busted, and the innovations handed over to
developing nations for free. Guterres explained:]{.underline}
\[R\]enewable energy technologies, such as battery storage, must be
treated as essential and freely-available global public goods. [Removing
**obstacles** to knowledge sharing and **technological** transfer --
including **intellectual** **property** constraints --- is crucial for a
rapid and fair **renewable energy transition**. Storing renewable
electricity is often cited as the greatest barrier to the clean energy
transition. I am therefore calling for a global coalition on battery
storage to fast-track innovation and deployment -- a coalition led and
driven by governments, bringing together tech companies, manufacturers,
and financiers.]{.underline} Experts predicted that environmental
technologies would be next in line for IP waiver if developing nations
convinced the world to give up IP protections for vaccines. And how
could environmental, clean energy technologies not be on the chopping
block given the precedent that has been set[? [If a crisis]{.mark} can
be so bad [that intellectual property only gets in the way]{.mark} of
the solution, well, [it is hard to imagine]{.mark} that [genie ever
being]{.mark} put back [in the bottle]{.mark}.]{.underline} With These
Kind of Incentives, We're Sunk Gas prices are high, fossil fuel
production is down, clean energy technology is many years---likely
decades---away from being a viable solution. If that wasn't bad enough[,
[the disincentivization of clean energy investors has
begun]{.mark}]{.underline}. As [if it wasn't going to be hard enough to
extract sufficient sums of energy out of solar and wind, and to advance
battery technology by leaps and bounds just because politicians demand
it. Now it [has to happen while the world tells **innovators** and those
who fund **innovation** that they are evil and patents
kill]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the face of everything that is happening
worldwide, the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should return to a
strong **pro-innovator**]{.mark} intellectual property [stance on the
world stage, incentivize **energy** companies to increase supplies of
fossil fuels]{.mark}, and do **everything** possible to [incentivize
clean energy **innovation**]{.mark}, realizing the latter is a long-term
goal for which arbitrary deadlines are meaningless.]{.underline} What is
likely to happen? [The United States will likely **muddle** the
intellectual property issues by continuing to say little and then
agreeing to some **waiver**, continue to pursue policies that will give
oil **companies** and investors every reason to decrease fossil fuel
**capacity**, and [wonder why clean **energy** **technology** doesn't
fuel the planet]{.mark} with zero carbon emissions by their arbitrary
deadlines]{.underline}. Sounds about right, doesn't it?

[[and]{.underline} **[tipping points]{.underline}**]{.mark} (e.g.

2018; Osmond and Klausmeier, 2017; Rothman, 2017; Schuur et al., 2015;
Sims and Finnoff, 2016; Van Aalst, 2006).7

[A possibly]{.underline} **[imminent]{.underline}** [tipping point could
be in the form of 'an]{.underline} **[[abrupt ice sheet
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}** [\[that\] could
[cause]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[rapid sea]{.mark} level
[rise']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Baum et al., 2011, p. 399). [There
are]{.underline} **[many avenues]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[positive feedback]{.underline}** in global warming,
[including:]{.underline}

> [• the replacement of an]{.underline} **[ice sea]{.underline}** [by

> [from]{.underline} **[melting]{.underline}** [reduces the]{.underline}

> **[release]{.mark} of [methane]{.mark}**]{.underline} trapped under
> the ocean floor, [[producing]{.underline}
> **[runaway]{.underline}**]{.mark} [global warming]{.underline}.

[Though there are also avenues for]{.underline}
**[negative]{.underline}** [feedback, the]{.underline} **[scientific
consensus]{.underline}** [is for an]{.underline} **[overall net positive
feedback]{.underline}** (Roe and Baker, 2007). [Thus]{.underline}, the
Global Challenges Foundation (2017, p. 25) concludes, '[The world is
currently]{.underline} **[completely unprepared]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} envisage, and even less **[deal with]{.underline}**,
the consequences of **[CCC']{.underline}**.

[The threat of sea-level rising from global warming is well known, but
there are also other likely and more imminent threats to the
survivability of mankind and other living things. For
example]{.underline}, Sherwood and Huber (2010) emphasize
[the]{.underline} **[adaptability limit]{.underline}** [to climate
change due to]{.underline} **[heat stress]{.underline}** [from high
environmental wet-bulb temperature.]{.underline} They show that
['[even]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[modest]{.underline}**]{.mark} global
**[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}** [could \... [expose]{.mark} large
fractions of the]{.underline} \[world\] [[population
to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[unprecedented [heat
stress']{.mark}]{.underline}** p. 9552 and that [with substantial global
warming, 'the area of land rendered **uninhabitable by heat stress**
would **dwarf**]{.underline} [that affected by]{.underline} rising
**[sea level']{.underline}** p. 9555, [[making]{.underline}
**[extinction]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[much more
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the relatively moderate damages
estimated by most integrated assessment models unreliably low.

[While]{.underline} **[imminent]{.underline}** [extinction
is]{.underline} very [unlikely]{.underline} and may not come for a long
time even under business as usual, the main point is that
[we]{.underline} **[cannot rule it out]{.underline}**. Annan and
Hargreaves (2011, pp. 434--435) may be right that [there is 'an upper 95
per cent probability limit for S \[temperature increase\] \... to lie
close to 4°C, and certainly well below 6°C'. However, probabilities of 5
per cent, 0.5 per cent, 0.05 per cent or even 0.005 per cent of
excessive warming and the resulting extinction probabilities **cannot be
ruled out**]{.underline} [and are]{.underline} [**unacceptable**. Even
if there is only a]{.underline} **[1 per cent probability]{.underline}**
[that there is a]{.underline} time **[bomb in the]{.underline}**
air[**plane**, you]{.underline} [**probably want to change your
flight**. **Extinction of the whole world is [more important to avoid
by]{.mark} literally [a trillion times]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The [world must **thrash**]{.mark} out a new deal for
[nature]{.mark}]{.underline} in the next two years or [humanity [could
be the first species to document our own
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} warns the United Nation's
biodiversity chief. Ahead of a key international conference to discuss
the collapse of ecosystems, Cristiana Pașca Palmer said people in [all
[countries need to put pressure]{.mark} on their governments [to draw up
ambitious global targets]{.mark} by 2020 to protect the insects, birds,
plants and mammals that are vital for global food production, clean
water and carbon sequestration.]{.underline} "[[The loss of biodiversity
is a silent killer]{.mark}," she told the Guardian. "It's different from
climate change, where people feel the impact in everyday life. With
biodiversity, it is not so clear but by the time you feel what is
happening, it may be too late."]{.underline} Pașca Palmer is executive
secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity -- the world body
responsible for maintaining the natural life support systems on which
humanity depends. Its members -- 195 states and the EU -- will meet in
Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, this month to start discussions on a new
framework for managing the world's ecosystems and wildlife. This will
kick off two years of frenetic negotiations, which Pașca Palmer hopes
will culminate in an ambitious new global deal at the next conference in
Beijing in 2020. The loss of biodiversity is a silent killer. Cristiana
Pașca Palmer Conservationists are desperate for a biodiversity accord
that will carry the same weight as the Paris climate agreement. But so
far, this subject has received miserably little attention even though
many scientists say it poses at least an equal threat to humanity. [The
last [two major **biodiversity** agreements]{.mark} -- in 2002 and 2010
-- [have failed to stem the worst loss of life]{.mark} on Earth since
the demise of the dinosaurs.]{.underline} Eight years ago, under the
Aichi Biodiversity Targets, nations promised to at least halve the loss
of natural habitats, ensure sustainable fishing in all waters, and
expand nature reserves from 10% to 17% of the world's land by 2020. [But
many nations have fallen behind, and those that have created more
protected areas have done little to police them. "Paper reserves" can
now be found from Brazil to China.]{.underline} The issue is also low on
the political agenda. Compared to climate summits, few heads of state
attend biodiversity talks. Even before Donald Trump, the US refused to
ratify the treaty and only sends an observer. Along with the Vatican, it
is the only UN state not to participate. Pașca Palmer says there are
glimmers of hope. Several species in Africa and Asia have recovered
(though most are in decline) and forest cover in Asia has increased by
2.5% (though it has decreased elsewhere at a faster rate). Marine
protected areas have also widened. But overall, she says, the picture is
worrying. [The already high rates of biodiversity loss from habitat
**destruction**, chemical **pollution** and invasive **species** will
accelerate in the coming 30 years as a result of **climate change** and
growing human populations. By 2050, Africa is expected to lose 50% of
its birds and mammals, and Asian fisheries to completely collapse. The
loss of plants and sea life will reduce the Earth's ability to absorb
carbon, creating a vicious cycle.]{.underline} "The numbers are
staggering," says the former Romanian environment minister[. "I hope we
aren't the first species to document our own
**extinction**."]{.underline} Despite the weak government response to
such an existential threat, she said her optimism about what she called
"the infrastructure of life" was undimmed. Smoldering Pastureland

convergence of scientific concerns and growing interest from the
business community. Last month, the UN's top climate and biodiversity
institutions and scientists held their first joint meeting. [They [found
that nature-based **solutions**]{.mark} -- such as forest
[protection]{.mark}, **tree [planting]{.mark}, land [restoration]{.mark}
and soil [management]{.mark}** -- could provide up to a third of the
carbon absorption [needed to keep global **warming**]{.mark} within the
Paris agreement parameters]{.underline}. In future the two UN arms of
climate and biodiversity should issue joint assessments. She also noted
that although politics in some countries were moving in the wrong
direction, there were also positive developments such as French
president, Emmanuel Macron, recently being the first world leader to
note that the climate issue cannot be solved without a halt in
biodiversity loss. This will be on the agenda of the next G7 summit in
France. ["Things are moving. There is a lot of goodwill," she said. "[We
should be aware of the dangers but not paralysed by inaction]{.mark}.
It's still in our hands but the window for action is narrowing. We need
higher levels of political and citizen will to support
nature."]{.underline}

Resources, a 30-meter-long]{.underline} (98-foot) [asteroid can hold
platinum worth]{.underline} somewhere from US\$25 billion to US [\$50
billion]{.underline}.\[x\] [These [metals]{.mark} are **highly
useful**]{.underline} and valuable, both [on Earth and in
space]{.underline}.\[xi\] [Third, asteroids give humans]{.underline} the
[potential to [create **tools in space**]{.mark}, since iron, nickel and
cobalt are in abundance]{.underline}.\[xii\] Chris Lewicki, Planetary
Resources CEO, has said, ["Using **3D printing** technology]{.underline}
one [can grab material off asteroids and]{.underline} 3D [print
something]{.underline} that [never]{.underline} has to be [on a
rocket]{.underline}. Tools, [machines and]{.underline} even [habitats
can]{.underline} then [be built off Earth, reducing the cost of
exploration]{.underline} even [further]{.underline}.\[xiii\] [Fourth,
**resource [extraction]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} also becoming
[[a focus]{.mark} for many Middle Eastern nations]{.underline}.\[xiv\]
The Middle Eastern [oil states, such as Saudi Arabia and
the]{.underline} United Arab [Emirates are investing
heavily]{.underline} in this industry as they are looking at space as a
way [[to **diversify**]{.underline}]{.mark} out of [the]{.underline}
earthly [benefits of [fossil fuel]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[xv\]
[Fifth]{.underline}, countries such as [[**India** and **China** are
looking]{.mark} to mine the Moon [for]{.mark} extracting
**[Helium-3]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is considered [a [clean and
**efficient**]{.mark} **form** of energy]{.underline}. It is thought
that [this isotope could provide safer **[nuclear energy]{.mark}** in a
fusion reactor, since it is not radioactive and would not
produce]{.underline} dangerous [waste products]{.underline}.\[xvi\]
[[Finally]{.mark}, the **[water]{.mark}** available in outer space
[could]{.mark}]{.underline} be used to [[make **rocket
propellants**]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to scientists, [since
water is abundant]{.underline} in outer space, in some or the other
form, [it could be extracted]{.underline} and electrolysed [to derive
hydrogen and oxygen]{.underline}, the [key ingredients of rocket
fuel]{.underline}.\[xvii\] Thus, [instead of carrying one's own
fuel]{.underline} all the way, [[asteroids]{.mark} could [serve
as]{.mark}]{.underline} extraterrestrial/[orbital ["**gas stations**"
for]{.mark} fuelling future [**deep space** missions. This
would]{.mark}]{.underline} simultaneously [[make]{.mark} space
[travel]{.mark} more [**cost-effective** and]{.mark}
productive]{.underline}. Such [ventures are]{.underline} also [seen to
be [intrinsic]{.mark}]{.underline} to further science and discovery, in
addition [[to **revolutionising**]{.mark} commercial
**[development]{.mark}** in outer space]{.underline}. The [mining of
asteroids could]{.underline} also [provide [a]{.mark} **near-[infinite
supply]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [precious
[resources]{.mark} for Earth]{.underline} to use. \[xviii\]

https://medium.com/the-mission/humanitys-extinction-event-is-coming-c0f84f1803f\]

But [the reality is that [an **asteroid**]{.mark} impact, a **[change
in]{.mark} our [magnetic field]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark} the **[rising
temperature]{.mark}** of Earth's climate [are]{.mark} all
[events]{.mark} that [we]{.mark} currently [cannot escape]{.mark}. There
is no back-up plan. We are]{.underline}, for better or worse, [tied to
the fate of this planet]{.underline}. [As history has shown, that's not
a good fate to be tied to. In]{.underline} fact on September 7, [2016 a
30-foot asteroid flew between the Earth and the Moon. Our most powerful
instruments]{.underline} only [detected it with two days notice. Two
days]{.underline}. If the asteroid was only 1000-foot wide, [[it would
**destroy all**]{.mark} human [**life** and we'd have no back-up]{.mark}
to get out of it.]{.underline} Even the White House is worried about it.
[[Five]{.underline}]{.mark}, yes five, [major [extinction events have
occurred]{.mark} on our planet that we know about. **[We're due for
another]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And when that happens, what's our
alternative? You can't move to another house. You can't buy survival,
even with a billion dollars in the bank. [The only way out, is up. [We
must find a way to become multi-planetary **if we want to save
humanity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, your family, and yes, even yourself.
Only this can restore the honor we seemed to have lost from the brave
days of the 60s, while also ensuring our survival. It's for the species,
folks. And as a species, we have not allowed ourselves the opportunity
to blast off for the stars. Only the space race in the 60s when we were
afraid enough of a self-inflicted global extinction event (read:
nuclear) that we put forth the funding required to launch into orbit and
onto our moon. We didn't have calculators back then, and now we have
supercomputers in our pocket, but no one is allowed out of our
atmosphere, save for a few communication and spy satellites. Doesn't
that make you mad? It's not some oppressive government that tells us no.
It's us. We pay our taxes. We elect leaders. Those leaders choose
Defense as the primary budget line item, but forget about defending
against the forthcoming apocalypse. Funding for NASA in the United
States has decreased from 4% of the national budget in the 60s to about
0.5% from 2010 onwards. That's just the money side. [But in order [to
move]{.mark} past this threshold from our home planet [to space]{.mark}
and then onto other planets, **[we need]{.mark}** **to do [two things:
Travel there. Survive. ]{.mark}**[Luckily]{.mark}]{.underline}, we can
simplify the problem of passing this barrier by sending machines in our
place. Like TARS from Interstellar, they can go places humans cannot and
explore the environment for habitability and resources, even in
particularly hostile conditions. Maybe not black hole hostile, but
definitely Mars hostile, as the Curiosity Rover has shown. Only now,
with [a few bold, private [startups are]{.mark} we [beginning]{.mark} to
see a [re-emergence of the space industry]{.mark}. We are about to pass
a few very important tests that allow us to explore and visit the
cosmos. The first is launching physical things into space. This is the
catalyst that will jump start a new space race.]{.underline} Prices of
sending cargo are falling dramatically, down to nearly \$500 per pound
of payload with SpaceX's Falcon 9 heavy re-usable rocket. Note that the
re-usable part is key. We can't throw away our "space car" every time we
Uber it. And once that becomes standard and cost-optimized we might be
able to get that down to \$10 per pound. Imagine what could happen when
it costs the same amount to ship something across town as it does into
space. The second, and this is just as important, is the wave of
autonomous machines. [Tesla has popularized the notion of self-driving
cars. SpaceX lands their rocket onto a small barge in the ocean
autonomously. Companies are buying startups in the space. Self-driving
will be our gift, our talisman, on the quest to save the species by
becoming multi-planetary.]{.underline} II. Shipping Ourselves to Space
The graph below is from the Founders Fund manifesto, showing the
[decreasing cost of launching something into space]{.underline}. It
begins with the 1960s US-versus-Russia space race and [extends to the
present day SpaceX-versus-Blue Origin reusable rocket race.]{.underline}
The cheapest method we have today is SpaceX's Falcon series rockets.
With the Falcon 9 Heavy, it's predicted [launching]{.underline} cargo
[into space will be cheaper than ever before]{.underline}, at \$750 per
pound of payload delivered to low earth orbit (LOE)on an expendable
rocket. You have to note here, however, that these statistics are as
cheap as possible. It costs more to deliver payload on a non-reusable
rocket, and on something that's further out than LEO, like
geosynchronous orbit, or to Mars. For example, based on SpaceX's
published pricing, it would be at least 4x more expensive to deliver far
less cargo to Mars. So what happens when we reduce that cost to \$10 per
pound? Namely, an explosion of startups, much like iOS. Instead of
pushing to production for your continuously deployed web and mobile
app[, we will see future developers push to production by deploying
physical things into space.]{.underline} "STAGE" takes on an entirely
new meaning for software developers when it means your automated
regression tests fail, it could blow up a rocket and hurt people on
board. [That's why [SpaceX and Blue Origins]{.mark} exist. To
[make]{.mark} this continuous-[deployment-to-space process as **cheap
and fast** as possible.]{.mark}]{.underline} [By]{.mark} Elon's
calculations, every 15 minutes. III. Self-Driving Space Explorers The
most successful products for space, at least in the beginning, will make
money by pushing this stuff into orbit. Things like science experiments
and new 3D printers. A company called Made in Space creates a number of
these products, including the empty box you see below used for sending
things up with Blue Origin. The box shown in gray is a specialized 3D
printer that works in zero gravity. Remember how most 3D printers work.
It squeezes out a single layer of liquid ooze, and then another, over
and over again until it builds up enough vertically that it creates an
object. This can be simple plastic or more esoteroic metals. But when
you're "dripping" something, held down in place by gravity, the entire
process has to be re-imagined for space. Things in zero-G would just
float away. Enter these chaps. [There's also the very real need for
**oxygen, food, water, and shelter from** the **harsh elements**. Funny
how we will end up recreating Maslow's Heirarchy in every new voyage or
planetoid we want to colonize.]{.underline} And space mining is off to
the races with the recent announcement of Deep Space Industry's
Prospector-1: Their vision is to extract water from asteroids and use
the chemical components to hydrate us, but also as oxygen (breathing)
and hydrogen (fuel). To do that, you have to identify candidate
asteroids, physically get to them, land and attach, and then do
surveying, prospecting, and extraction. In short, you're going to need
some level of self-driving capabilities to make this happen. And
wouldn't it be nice if it "just worked" right out of the box.
Unfortunately, in space you don't have fleets of these space craft,
millions of miles of training data, maps, or an internet connection to
the cloud so how the heck are deep learning algorithms going to work? I
don't think they will. **[And that's what I believe we need a better
approach]{.underline}**

[[The **main benefit**]{.underline}]{.mark} that could be [[provided by
**colonisation of Mars** would be]{.underline}]{.mark} an opportunity
[[to **save**]{.underline}]{.mark} the life of [**[humanity]{.mark}**
when]{.underline} it is [life on Earth will be endangered]{.underline}.
It seems that [the greatest]{.underline} possible [source of dangers
is]{.underline} the **[humanity itself]{.underline}**, but beside it,
the [another]{.underline} greatest danger [is]{.underline} probably [the
**asteroid impact**]{.underline}. To provide survival of humanity, the
easier and the less costly project, as Impey points out, can be an
attempt to reduce threats on Earth, and taking more care for proper
conditions for human survival on Earth \[12\]. [[If we
treat]{.underline}]{.mark} the idea of [[Mars colonisation as an
**alternative** for an **opportunity of survival**]{.underline}]{.mark}
of humanity, the mentioned [[**running out resources** are]{.mark} only
[**one** of possible threats]{.mark}]{.underline} for maintaining life
on Earth. If we take into account such possible threats, [[it is worth
considering Mars as]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [[the **unique
solution** for **further survival of humanity**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Among possible threats on Earth [[we can enumerate]{.mark} such of them
like [**nuclear war**, **environmental catastrophes**, **incurable
epidemic**, **asteroid impact**, or **uncontrolled development of
a**]{.mark}]{.underline}rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence that could be deleterious for
humanity \[12\]. Of course, the concept of the human outer space colony
as a way to solve human life could be applied probably only to some
small part of the entire humanity, for instance, for these ones who
survived one of the mentioned catastrophes. Consequently, [the
**current** work on [**preparation** of the **manned mission to Mars**
can be]{.mark} treated as a [work to provide the **future further
living** of the human species]{.mark} whose further **existence on
Earth**]{.underline} in the next several hundred or several thousand
years [can be **really endangered**]{.underline}.

#### Optimizing IPR for innovation encompasses AND outweighs all existential risks.

If you care about improving human lives, you should overwhelmingly care
about those quadrillions of lives rather than the comparatively small
number of people alive today. [The 7.6 billion people now
living]{.underline}, after all, [amount to less than 0.003 percent of
the population that will live in the **future**]{.underline}. It's
reasonable to suggest that those **[quadrillions]{.underline}** [of
[future people have]{.mark}]{.underline}, accordingly, [**[hundreds of
thousands of times]{.underline}** [more moral
weight]{.underline}]{.mark} [than those of us living here **today**
do]{.underline}. That's the basic argument behind Nick Beckstead's 2013
Rutgers philosophy dissertation, "On the overwhelming importance of
shaping the far future." It's a glorious mindfuck of a thesis, not least
because Beckstead shows very convincingly that this is a conclusion any
plausible moral view would reach. It's not just something that weird
utilitarians have to deal with. And Beckstead, to his considerable
credit, walks the walk on this. He works at the Open Philanthropy
Project on grants relating to the far future and runs a charitable fund
for donors who want to prioritize the far future. And arguments from him
and others have turned "long-termism" into a very vibrant, important
strand of the effective altruism community. But what does prioritizing
the far future even mean? [The most **literal**]{.underline} [thing it
could mean is [preventing]{.mark} human
**[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to ensure that the species
persists as long as possible. For the long-term-focused effective
altruists I know, that typically means identifying concrete threats to
humanity's continued existence --- like unfriendly artificial
intelligence, or a pandemic, or global warming/out of control
geoengineering --- and engaging in activities to prevent that specific
eventuality. [But]{.underline} in a set of slides he made in 2013,
Beckstead makes a compelling case that [[while]{.mark} that's certainly
**[part]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} what [caring about the far
future]{.mark} entails, approaches that address **specific
threats**]{.underline} [to humanity]{.underline} (which he calls
"**[targeted]{.underline}**" [approaches]{.underline} to the far future)
[[have to **complement**]{.underline} "**[broad]{.underline}**"
[approaches, where instead of trying to **predict** what's going to kill
us all, you]{.underline}]{.mark} [just **generally [try to keep
civilization running as best it can]{.mark}**[, so]{.mark} that [it is,
as a whole, well-equipped to deal with **potential** extinction events
in the **future**]{.mark}]{.underline}, not just in 2030 or 2040 but in
3500 or 95000 or even 37 million. [In other words, caring about the far
future **[doesn't mean just paying attention to low-probability risks
of]{.mark} total [annihilation]{.mark}**; it also means **[acting on
pressing needs now]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example: [We're [going
to]{.mark} be **[better]{.mark} prepared** to [prevent extinction from
**AI**]{.mark} or [a **supervirus** or]{.mark} **global
[warming]{.mark}** [if society]{.mark} as a whole [makes]{.mark} **a lot
of [scientific progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And a significant
bottleneck there is that the vast majority of humanity doesn't get
high-enough-quality education to engage in scientific research, if they
want to, which reduces the odds that we have enough trained scientists
to come up with the breakthroughs we need as a civilization to survive
and thrive. [So maybe one of [the **best thing**]{.mark}s we can do [for
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[far future]{.underline}** [is
to]{.underline}]{.mark} improve school systems --- here and now --- to
[[harness]{.underline}]{.mark} the group economist Raj Chetty calls
"lost Einsteins" (**[potential [innovators]{.mark}]{.underline}** who
are thwarted by poverty and inequality in rich countries) and, more
importantly, the hundreds of millions of kids in developing countries
dealing with even worse education systems than those in depressed
communities in the rich world. What if living ethically for the far
future means living ethically now? Beckstead mentions some other broad,
or very broad, ideas (these are all his descriptions): [Help
[make]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[computers faster]{.underline}**]{.mark}
so that people everywhere can work more efficiently
[[Change]{.underline} **[i]{.underline}**]{.mark}ntellectual
**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roperty [[law so]{.mark} that]{.underline}
technological **[[innovation]{.mark} can [happen]{.mark} more
[quickly]{.mark}]{.underline}** Advocate for open borders so that people
from poorly governed countries can move to better-governed countries and
be more productive Meta-research: [[improve]{.underline}
**[incentives]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[norms]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in]{.underline} **[academic
work]{.underline}** to better advance human knowledge Improve education
Advocate for political party X to make future people have values more
like political party X "If you look at these areas (economic growth and
technological progress, access to information, individual capability,
social coordination, motives) a lot of everyday good works contribute,"
Beckstead writes. "An implication of this is that a lot of everyday good
works are good from a broad perspective, even though hardly anyone
thinks explicitly in terms of far future standards." Look at those
examples again: It's just a list of what normal altruistically motivated
people, not effective altruism folks, generally do. Charities in the US
love talking about the lost opportunities for innovation that poverty
creates. Lots of smart people who want to make a difference become
scientists, or try to work as teachers or on improving education policy,
and lord knows there are plenty of people who become political party
operatives out of a conviction that the moral consequences of the
party's platform are good. All of which is to say: Maybe effective
altruists aren't that special, or at least maybe we don't have access to
that many specific and weird conclusions about how best to help the
world. [If the far future is what matters, and generally trying to make
the world work better is among the best ways to help the far future,
then effective altruism just becomes plain ol'
do-goodery.\*]{.underline}

#### [Interoperable]{.underline} intellectual property is [crucial]{.underline} to maintain tech [innovation]{.underline}.

The United States is engaged in a global competition for innovation,
with critical implications for the nation's continued technological
leadership, competitiveness, and security. To win, [the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates will [need to **leverage**]{.mark} its
[advantages]{.mark} at home, including [its robust]{.mark} intellectual
property (IP) rights system and the **innovative** zeal of its
entrepreneurs. It should also look **abroad**---**[set]{.mark}ting**
[the pace for **scientific** **cooperation**]{.mark} with allies and
[**strategic** partner]{.mark}s, as well as [developing shared
**international** technical **standards**]{.mark} through the
contributions of experts from around the **globe**.]{.underline} Most
pressingly, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should not adopt
policies that **weaken**]{.mark} protection of U.S.-owned
[patents]{.mark}---which [would]{.mark} both [disincentivize
innovation]{.mark} in the United States [and support Chinese
efforts]{.mark} to dominate critical standards and other advanced
technologies]{.underline}. Yet a recent proposal of the Antitrust
Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) does just that.
Launched as a consultation, its Draft Policy Statement on Licensing
Negotiations and Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to
F/RAND Commitments is promoted as an effort to encourage good-faith
licensing negotiations and to address the scope of remedies available to
patent owners who have agreed to license their essential technologies on
fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (F/RAND) terms. While this
draft policy seems like an innocuous administrative change, it has the
potential to do significant damage to the United States' innovation
engine and, by extension, to its national security. [The United States
should not adopt policies that weaken protection of U.S.-owned
patents---which would both **disincentivize** innovation in the United
States and **support** Chinese efforts to dominate critical standards
and other advanced technologies]{.underline}. In an unprecedented show
of solidarity over what appears to be a technical issue of DOJ policy on
standards and patents, a distinguished bipartisan group of former
defense, national security, patent, and standards leaders has come out
in opposition to this proposed policy change. They point out that it
would diminish U.S. leadership by weakening protections for
standard-essential patents (SEPs), arguing further that the proposal
would instead aid China in its race to dominate advanced technologies
vital to U.S. national security, such as artificial intelligence (AI),
fifth-generation (5G) networks, and quantum computing. Innovation and
National Security The U.S. innovation system---a network of
capabilities, rules, and policies supporting research, development, and
commercialization of new technologies---is a national strategic asset.
Since the founding of the republic, the innovation economy has served as
the basis for U.S. competitive and strategic advantage, a finding
affirmed in the October 2021 White House National Strategic Overview for
Research and Development Infrastructure. [This [innovation system is
**anchored** by]{.mark} a robust [**framework** of rules governing
**standards** and IP]{.mark} **protection**. [Standards set the pace for
**innovation**]{.mark}, providing shared [platforms]{.mark} [for
industry **participants**]{.mark} to work together [to bring new
**technological** solutions]{.mark} to the marketplace.
[Standards]{.mark} also [promote **interoperability** and
safety]{.mark}, giving consumers more and better
**choices**]{.underline}. Moreover, [secure **property** rights
[encourage]{.mark} smaller firms and individual **inventors** to share
their [new ideas and **collaborate**]{.mark} with others without the
risk of theft]{.underline}. For this reason, the community of small
inventors, universities, startups, and entrepreneurs has repeatedly
spoken about the importance of secure property rights in providing them
a path to market entry. [Importantly, [patents are not a
"monopoly]{.mark}" in the market sense---they are a temporary period of
exclusivity for a particular solution granted in exchange for disclosing
that solution and eventually giving it up as a public good]{.underline}.
[The [patent system for]{.mark} [inventions creates]{.mark}, among other
things, the rents that spur [risk-taking]{.mark} and encourage
entrepreneurship.]{.underline} The 2021 Draft Policy Statement would
weaken this system, hurting U.S. risk-taking, innovation, and
(subsequently) leadership in global technology standards, and is
therefore concerning. Standard-Essential Patents The harm from the 2021
Draft Policy Statement comes from its proposed change to the terms of
licensing negotiations and remedies for SEPs. An SEP is a patent that
can be properly mapped onto a consensus industry standard, such that a
product that conforms to that standard would infringe the patent unless
a license has been granted. SEPs and their licensing are common in the
mobile-wireless and telecommunications industry, a sector that is highly
standardized due mainly to the need for interoperability between mobile
devices. SEPs are also increasingly important in other
internet-of-things (IoT) systems, as well as connected cars, autonomous
vehicles, artificial intelligence, and many other emerging and critical
technologies. Realizing the value of an SEP necessitates cooperation
between the owner and implementer of the patent. However, owners and
implementers can try to take advantage of each other in some situations.
Epstein and Noroozi distinguish between "patent holdup" and "patent
holdout" in these terms: In general, by "patent holdup" we mean the
theoretical claim that innovators of standard--essential patents attempt
to extract excessively large royalties from implementers after those
implementers have committed to a particular technological standard that
requires the use of the patent(s) in question---that is, a standard that
renders the patent(s) "essential." . . . By "patent holdout" we mean the
converse problem---that an implementer refuses to negotiate in good
faith with an innovator for a license to valid patent(s) that the
implementer infringes, and instead forces the innovator to either
undertake significant litigation costs and time delays to extract a
licensing payment through a court order, or else to simply drop the
matter because the licensing game is no longer worth the candle. To
overcome these challenges to collective action, particularly given the
complexity of standards and patents that go into advanced devices,
owners of SEPs often make a commitment to offer licenses on F/RAND
terms. Over the past 10 years, there has been mounting evidence of
patent holdout, seen (for example) in the cases of Huawei in the United
Kingdom and Germany, Haier in Germany, Wiko in the Netherlands, LG in
the United States, and many more. It is therefore important that the
policies determining SEP--F/RAND disputes maintain a balance between the
interests and incentives of innovators and implementers. (Over the same
period, there has been little if any evidence of holdup as a matter of
concern.)

OPINION: When Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin signed the Department's
strategy for Joint All-Domain Command and Control, it officially kicked
off a push towards open architectures, information sharing, and
connected systems across the battlespace. But the capabilities to
execute these concepts are often commercial, software-heavy, and do not
fall neatly into existing budgeting processes. That is why [DoD is
**piloting** a software acquisition pathway and why the Senate has
included a provision establishing a Commission on defense budget reform
in its version of this year's National Defense Authorization
Act.]{.underline} These [efforts are **important** and needed, but there
are [two]{.mark} thorny [issues]{.mark} that [need to be effectively
addressed]{.mark} on [this innovation]{.mark} journey: intellectual
property (**[IP]{.mark}**) [and security]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both
issues have seen increased attention in the past few years, [but they
are starting to go a bit sideways]{.underline}. Some recent requirements
in [[DoD competitions for **unlimited** IP rights]{.mark} have raised
[major concerns with potential **bidders**]{.mark}]{.underline} while
the department's Cybersecurity Maturation Model Certification (CMMC)
initiative has struggled to achieve its desired objective to date.
Fortunately, [there is a real opportunity in the [coming **months** for
DoD to focus on **IP** and **security**]{.mark} to help get us to a
place [that fosters **continued innovation**]{.mark} without losing our
[tech]{.mark}nological edge to **China**. [IP]{.mark} has always been
[key to US **military** strength]{.mark}, but it has taken on a
heightened role in today's digital age with [its focus on **high**-end
commercial technology]{.mark}]{.underline}. The DoD focus on innovation
has been a major theme spanning three administrations, with robust
efforts to spur new entrants and new approaches to national security
challenges in areas such as artificial intelligence, autonomy, and
unmanned systems. As part of these efforts, DoD has begun to rethink its
approach to IP. DoD signed out a relatively little-noticed IP policy in
late 2019 that seeks to rebalance its approach to IP in acquisition. The
essence of the policy is to seek "early and effective understanding,
planning, and communications between the US Government and industry" on
IP. The department is currently preparing to launch pilot efforts and is
seeking industry input to implement this approach. Industry has watched
these developments with great interest --- and real concern --- because
IP is the lifeblood of their business strategy. Both high-tech
non-traditionals as well as more traditional defense firms invest
significant resources on IP to help maintain their competitive edge in
the marketplace. Achieving a balance that enables DoD to effectively
manage emerging capabilities without disincentivizing industry is a
tricky balance that needs careful attention, as my colleagues James
Hasik and Eric Lofgren have also noted. The competing IP needs for both
government and industry are equally valid, but if DoD pushes more for
unlimited data rights, for example, some companies may exit. [One
potential area for practical application is [**negotiating** IP]{.mark}
and data rights [to create mutually beneficial **license**
rights]{.mark}; finding an **appropriate** place in the acquisition
process to have this negotiation will be a central focus in this
discussion. Security is similarly critical to all innovation
efforts]{.underline}. The recently unsealed Department of Justice
indictments of several Chinese individuals raise major concerns. [The
indictments accuse four Chinese citizens of major IP theft and other
crimes between 2011-2018, targeting US government facilities, companies,
and universities looking for defense, biopharmaceutical, and other
technologies]{.underline}. In particular, the large number of academic
institutions targeted shows the risks facing US universities that
support DoD. These threats also underscore the importance of ensuring
that critical DoD suppliers are secure and reliable. The question, of
course, is what to do about it. The administration is rethinking its
approach to CMMC, which is good, but that is only part of the solution.
Some government entities are looking to bring more capabilities such as
software development "in house," but as the Solarwinds cyber attack
demonstrated, that approach entails significant risks as well. Supply
chain visibility, underscored in the recent report of the House Armed
Services Committee Defense Critical Supply Chain Task Force, is one area
for attention. Developing a repeatable approach to examine defense
supply chains by technology area, for instance, could help the
department identify adversary threat vectors on a more proactive basis.
The just-announced government and industry collaborative established by
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is another model
for the department to consider. [The [challenges of IP]{.mark} and
security are [central to military innovation]{.mark} and there are no
easy solutions. The best way forward is to be [clear eyed about the
risks and **opportunities**]{.mark} and tackle these [**thorny**
challenges]{.mark} head on. Government and industry need to maintain a
[robust dialogue and keep **information** flowing in both
directions]{.mark} throughout this critical juncture on our innovation
journey]{.underline}. There is a real opportunity for the still arriving
DoD leadership to chart a path for success in IP and security for this
era of renewed great power competition. Jerry McGinn is executive
director of the Center for Government Contracting at George Mason
University and a former Pentagon official. Success can only be achieved
by finding common ground between the US government's desire for MOSA and
industry's incentive to modify its current business cases. Success can
only be achieved by finding common ground between the US government's
desire for MOSA and industry's incentive to modify its current business
cases. "The question I would have is as we move along is how do we gain
a bit more efficiency at times, and I'm not...for more bureaucracy, but
we kind of have raindrops of software factories out there," Ed Wilson
said. "Not all are created equal. There's more success stories than
others."

#### The DOD needs [clarification]{.underline} on IP. 

**Lopez, 22** \[C. Todd Lopez is a DOD writer, 3-3-2022, accessed on
7-17-2022, U.S. Department of Defense, \"Addressing DOD\",
https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2953893/addressing-dods-tech-focus-areas-requires-new-approaches/\]/ISEE

Earlier this year, the Defense Department\'s chief technology officer,
Heidi Shyu, released a list of 14 technology areas deemed most critical
for investment, including biotechnology, advanced materials, trusted
artificial intelligence and microelectronics. A handful of products
related to those focus areas --- such as hypersonics and directed energy
weapons --- are almost exclusively military-related, but the majority
are already being developed for the commercial market by private
companies that may not have done business with the federal government.
[Those [**innovations** include next-generation wireless
**communications**]{.mark}, microelectronics, and human-machine
interfaces. For DOD to have its needs addressed [by the private sector
with or without **DOD**]{.mark} involvement, the department will need to
do a better job of [engaging with]{.mark} those
**[companies]{.mark}**.]{.underline} DOD\'s Defense Innovation Unit is
one segment of the government already on board with locating companies
involved in the development of critical technologies and helping them
become suppliers. \"[We\'re really [trying to look at]{.mark} what all
of the [**innovative** companies]{.mark} are doing around the country
\... because most of what we need to do to [modernize the
**D**]{.mark}**efense [D]{.mark}epartment** is led by **industry** now;
it\'s commercial technologies,\"]{.underline} Mike Brown, director of
the DIU, said during a discussion Wednesday at George Mason
University\'s Center for Government Contracting in Northern Virginia.
\"We have to be harnessing what the private industry is doing if we\'re
going to be giving our warfighters the capability that they need,\"
Brown said. DIU, Brown said, has been working to accelerate adoption of
commercial technology using \"other transaction authority,\" which is
different from classic procurement contracts and is instead used for
things like research or prototyping. The approach DIU uses is called
\"commercial solutions open,\" and Brown said this includes things like
agile work statements, modular contracts and working at commercial
speeds. \"We don\'t start with requirements, which often dictates how
the department might start to bring in a new capability --- a process
that\'s well-honed if you\'re going to build a new aircraft or tank,\"
Brown said. \"If [you\'re going to look at **commercial** technology,
you don\'t need to start with **requirements**. The commercial market
has already **built** that.\"]{.underline} When DIU was looking at
counterdrone technologies, Brown said, [it didn\'t need to specify
requirements because the commercial [market]{.mark} had already
[developed things DOD **could** use]{.mark}. With modular contracts, he
said, comes the flexibility to bring in different vendors and have them
work together and go from a successful **prototyping** effort directly
into production.]{.underline} Finally, modular contracts can limit the
challenging requirements for intellectual property that might delay the
transition of a capability from the private sector into warfighter
hands, he said. [\"We\'re trying to get companies on contract in 60 to
90 days, in [**commercial** terms]{.mark} --- that means [no onerous
**IP**]{.mark} \[intellectual property\] [requirements for
**companies**]{.mark} that we work with,]{.underline}\" Brown said.
Budgeting is also an issue, Brown said. Traditional budgeting requires
planning as much as two years in advance before dollars can be spent.
[\"That\'s not the agile process we need to compete with China in
technology,\"]{.underline} he said. \"We need to be able to move not the
whole \$750 billion defense budget, but [we need some flexibility at the
edges to respond to emerging threats and plug in new commercial
technology solutions that address those threats.]{.underline} The
Commission on Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Reform, as
directed in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, is looking now
at better solutions to budgeting so that the department can be more
agile in the technology it procures. That's something Brown said he\'s
glad to see. Choose which Defense.gov products you want delivered to

As new competitive realities emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, I noticed
technology policy percolating higher and higher on the list of U.S.
international priorities. During this period, as head of international
affairs at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and
later as the nation's first Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy, I
was front and center of the debates to elevate tech policy to the
highest levels of the U.S. government. I [witnessed firsthand the
growing concerns about the [protection of U.S. **intellectual** property
rights abroad]{.mark} and foreign participation in U.S[. **R&D**]{.mark}
programs without **reciprocal** access for U.S. firms]{.underline}.
[This [transformed global **competitiveness** landscape]{.mark} is, in
part, what inspired the creation of the **Council** on Competitiveness,
of which I am president and CEO.]{.underline} Today, I am encouraged by
a [[renewed vision for American **global** **technology**
diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark} recently laid out by Secretary of State
Antony Blinken. His vision represents a return to a more comprehensive,
strategic approach to the opportunities and challenges technology
affords us. At the National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence's Global Emerging Technology Summit in July, Blinken shared
his experience at the heart of this reinvigorated approach linking
technology and diplomacy: "...I [needed scientists and technologists in
the room just to tell me whether I needed scientists and technologists
in the room to help identify the problems and help identify some of the
solutions.]{.underline} And I became more and more convinced that
virtually everything on our agenda has some tech or science or
innovative component to the solution." As Charles Holiday, Chairman
Emeritus of the Council on Competitiveness and Chairman of Global
Federation of Competitiveness Councils, told me, "Secretary Blinken is
on target with his comments about democracies having to pass the tech
test together." Blinken characterized the ever-growing infusion of
science and technology in the international sphere and echoed the need
to build technology into "nearly all of our diplomatic engagements ---
tech by tech, issue by issue." Technological strength is now the prime
determinant of economic, political and military power, and China and
others have risen as formidable competitors to the U.S. As a result, and
to continue building off the foundation laid at the end of the last
century and into the new one, Blinken's call for the U.S. to "shape the
strategic tech landscape, not just react to it" is more vital than ever.
Threats Abroad China is the driving dynamo of this 21st-century
challenge. The country is increasing its power in international
institutions that oversee global science and technology policies, as
well as making a major push to influence to its advantage international
standards for next generation technology. Additionally, China's Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI) is a major platform for advancing its
geo-political ambitions, including control over critical global supply
chains, global trade, and data flows. In fact, the President of the
Chinese Academy of Science has stated that science, technology, and
innovation are core to the BRI's objectives. These are all part of
China's quest for global technology leadership. China's expansion of its
reach through technology agreements, research centers and alliances in
numerous countries across four continents cannot be overlooked either.
This is being accomplished with investments and exchanges across Asia,
Eastern and Central Europe, Africa and Latin America in a wide range of
technological areas, such as telecommunications, artificial
intelligence, surveillance, clean energy, robotics and smart city
innovations. Unlike what we faced in the 1980s, today's competition is
not limited to a single, or even just a few players. Competitiveness in
the third decade of the 21s century is truly global in scale and scope,
including from long-held allies. For example, the European Union's
sweeping General Data Protection Regulation has already caused U.S.
companies to exit the European market. Other U.S. companies have been
heavily fined, most recently Amazon was slapped with a record \$887
million fine; more U.S. firms are surely in the crosshairs, as other
countries ignore these rules. The EU is also working to set global
standards for artificial intelligence --- which will have vast economic,
social, and ethical implications --- and recently released proposed AI
rules for the continent. Additionally, there is growing global debate on
the regulation of large technology firms, which are veiled efforts
largely aimed at U.S. As Admiral James G. Foggo, former Commander, US
Naval Forces Europe & Africa, recently told me,"Such policy stifles
rather than enhances innovation, while international institutions turn a
blind eye to other competitors who engage in activities like
state-sponsored piracy of intellectual property." Competing in the Next
Economy Last December, prompted by the current state of the global
innovation playing field, the Council on Competitiveness released its
Competing in the Next Economy report. In this report, we make the case
for the U.S. to place technology statecraft at the forefront of its
economic and national security strategy. This includes joining the
global battle in setting the frameworks for international standards and
regulations for emerging technologies and the digital economy;
evaluating foreign investments in the U.S.; and engaging with
international institutions regarding the flows of goods, services, and
data. The report also recommends establishing an International Science,
Technology, and Innovation Corps to increase science and technology
expertise across government personnel engaged in diplomacy, trade
negotiations and promoting U.S. products and services overseas.
Blinken's outline for the Biden administration's approach aligns with
the report and its goals, placing the U.S. front and center in critical
international scientific institutions and global R&D collaborations. He
recognizes the importance of integrating science and technology into our
core diplomatic and foreign service capability, especially as many
government professionals confronting these issues in the international
arena are not brought up on these disciplines. "We need to do a better
job bringing that knowledge, that expertise, that focus into the
department and to everything we do," he said. [**[Science and
tech]{.mark}nology** are more than just taking centerstage in the
international arena; technology revolutions [are transforming the global
**economy** and **societies**]{.mark} around the world. [Being on the
forefront]{.mark} of global science and technology policy --- whether
through investment, expertise, or innovation itself --- [is crucial for
the U.S. to **remain** at the top
**competitively**]{.mark},]{.underline} especially against foes with
interests outside those of the international community. Secretary
Blinken gets it right when he concluded, "[[Nothing is more
consequential to our **competitiveness**, to our security and]{.mark},
ultimately, to our **[democracy]{.mark}**" [than ensuring our position
as a scientific and **technological** leader.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The growing prevalence of personalized
[[autocracies]{.underline}]{.mark} is cause for concern because they
tend to [produce the worst outcomes of any type of political regime:
they tend to [produce]{.mark} the most [**risky** and
**aggressive**]{.mark} foreign [policies]{.mark}; the most likely to
[invest in nuc]{.mark}lear weapons]{.underline};7 [the **[most likely to
fight wars]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against democracies]{.underline};8
[[and]{.mark} the **most likely to [initiate]{.mark} interstate
[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.9 [As the **adventurism**]{.underline}
[of Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Uganda's Idi Amin, and North Korea's Kim
Jong-un suggests, a **[lack of accountability]{.mark} often [translates
into]{.mark} an ability to take [risks]{.mark}** that other dictatorial
systems simply cannot afford]{.underline}.

[[Russia underscores the link between rising personalism and
**aggression**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Although Putin's actions in Crimea
and Syria were designed to advance a number of key Russian goals, it is
also likely that Putin's lack of domestic constraints increased the
level of risk he was willing to accept in pursuit of those
goals]{.underline}. Putin's tight control over the media ensures that
the public receives only the official narrative of foreign events.
Limited access to outside information makes it difficult for Russians to
access unbiased accounts of the goings-on in the rest of the world and
gauge Putin's success in the foreign policy arena. Putin's elimination
of competing voices within his regime further ensures that he faces
minimal accountability for his foreign policy actions.

[Politics in **China** show many of these same trends. Xi's
**increasingly aggressive posture in the South China Sea**]{.underline}
[has occurred alongside the rising personalization of the political
system. Xi has amassed substantial personal power since coming to office
in 2012 and continues to roll back the norms of the post-Mao collective
leadership system. [If Xi]{.mark} further [consolidates control]{.mark}
and limits accountability---particularly over military and foreign
policy bodies---research suggests that [he]{.mark}, too, [could feel
free to **further escalate**]{.mark} **his aggressive rhetoric and
actions [in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea**]{.underline}.

[Not only do personalist dictatorships pursue aggressive foreign
policies---they are also often **difficult and unpredictable
partners**]{.underline}. [Research underscores that, thanks to [limited
constraints]{.mark} on decisionmaking, personalist leaders generally
[have]{.mark} the **latitude to [change their minds on a
whim]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[producing **volatile**]{.mark} and
erratic [policies]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 [Moreover, personalist
leaders---think Putin, Bolivian President Evo Morales, and Venezuelan
President Nicolás Maduro---are among those [autocrats]{.mark} who are
most **suspicious of U.S. intentions**]{.underline} [and who [see the
**creation of an external enemy**]{.mark} [as a]{.mark}n effective
[means of boosting]{.mark} public [support]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Anti-U.S. rhetoric, therefore, is most pronounced in personalist
settings.

[democratic peace hypothesis]{.mark} represented as the democracy
score(s) of the stronger country]{.underline}, that of the weaker
country, the interaction of these two, and several control variables. In
the first set of models, we entered the five indicators of constraint
one by one along with our control variables. Figure 3 summarizes the
results from these models. Complete estimation results in table form
with all control variables are found in Appendix Table A-1. The first
model (called 'Electoral accountability') enters the three terms based
on the electoral accountability index along with control variables. The
estimates from this model are printed in green color at the top of the
figure. [The points represent the estimates and the whiskers their
estimated **95% confidence interval**]{.underline}. [The two main terms
are both positive]{.underline}, although that for the weaker country is
not statistically significant. The interaction between the index values
for the two countries in the dyad, on the other hand, is negative and
highly significant -- [when both countries score highly in terms of
electoral accountability, [the **risk of fatal dispute is**]{.mark}
**much [lower]{.mark}** [than if either have low
scores]{.mark}]{.underline}. In line with expectations, we show in
Appendix Table A-3 that the effect of electoral democracy is driven by
the "Schumpeterian" core dimensions tapping into contestation -- whereas
suffrage does not play an independent role in promoting peace. [The
second model enters the 'Legislative constraints' index terms. Again,
the interaction term is negative and significant, whereas the main terms
are positive and significant. Similar patterns are observed for the
other three individual indicators]{.underline}. [[Figure 4 shows]{.mark}

**consistent with**]{.mark} **the [democratic

dotted and solid lines show the same when the index is one standard

marginal effect of this relationship -- it shows the change in the
estimated probability of a fatal dispute]{.underline} when comparing a

respectively, as a function of the index for the stronger country[. Both
these [graphs show a **clear**]{.mark} **dyadic [democratic peace
in]{.mark} terms of [all]{.mark} our [indices of

serve as a proxy for one of the other]{.underline}. We investigate which
of them are relatively most important along two routes.

Intellectual property (**[[IP]{.underline}]{.mark}**) is [[a
pharma]{.mark}ceutical or biotech [company's most **valuable**
resource]{.mark}, and [its protection is a key to that company's future
**success**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Recent challenges over patents for HIV
drugs has reminded the industry [that [progress is still needed in
balancing]{.mark} the [**opposing** forces of innovation through
**protection** of **IP**]{.mark} rights, versus the provision of
**affordable** drugs for the developing world. [Pharma]{.mark}ceuticals
companies must face the [daily **challenge** of creating **value**
through the **exploitation** of IP rights]{.mark}, but [avoiding
considerable **reputational** harm]{.mark}]{.underline}. This situation
was well illustrated in [South Africa during the late 1990s when the
balance between IP protection and the urgent needs of patients were not
align]{.underline}ed. Since then, [companies have become more aware of
the potential damage that can be caused by too strict an interpretation
of IP rights]{.underline}. Working in collaboration with national
governments, trans-national organisations such as the WHO, and
non-governmental organisations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, [[pharmaceuticals c]{.mark}ompanies have begun to find ways
through the [minefield of IP protection in]{.mark} less **developed**
countries, and most now have donation schemes for drugs [to treat
**diseases**]{.mark} such as leprosy and HIV.]{.underline} In relatively
strong emerging markets such as China and India though, additional
issues prevail. Multinational pharmaceuticals companies require and
expect IP rights to be strictly enforced in countries where there are
countless local manufacturers with the ability to produce cheap
counterfeit copies of patented drugs, which often find their way back to
western markets. At the same time, the implementation and enforcement of
IP laws in India and China is improving. Combined with the ability to
leverage lower cost expertise, on the whole, these countries are still
very much an opportunity rather than a threat. Nevertheless, companies
need to be aware of and able to manage the considerable risks of doing
business there. Closer to home, drug patents are coming under increased
attack from generics companies who believe they have identified a
weakness in the IP protecting a product. **[For]{.underline}** instance,
in 2004 a major ulcer treatment drug was the subject of a patent
challenge in the US by a generic manufacturer just three years after its
launch. [With the generics industry [**consolidating** and becoming more
**aggressive**]{.mark}, [pharma]{.mark}ceutical [**companies** are
facing more **rigorous** and **frequent** challenges to their
**intellectual property monopolie**s]{.mark} and growing pressure
**internally** to bring the **realisation** of **value** in **R&D**
forward, without compromising standards or **regulatory**
compliance]{.underline}.

Just as post-World War II [trade agreements aimed at **facilitating**
access to foreign markets for **physical** goods in a deliberate effort
to maximize the gains from **comparative** and **competitive**
advantage]{.underline}, so would the approach outlined in this paper
seek to do this for services and knowledge-based goods, but [with the
aim of maximizing **innovation**]{.underline}. However, there is
[[nothing **inevitable** about]{.mark} the process of countries pursuing
ever-closer economic integration or working to address modern barriers
to trade and [innovation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Policymakers face a
similar challenge in deciding what policies they should enact to give
their workers and firms the best opportunity to thrive. [[IP-based
**innovation** should]{.mark} be a key [**focal** point]{.mark} in the
process]{.underline}. As part of this, [[countries need to
**recognize**]{.mark} that [they can support their own ability to
**innovate** and compete in new **technology**]{.mark} [without
undermining]{.mark} the **ability** of [others to successfully
compete]{.mark} and contribute to the world's overall ability to drive
innovation]{.underline}. These [goals are not mutually
exclusive.]{.underline} Furthermore, as it relates to the traditional
dichotomy that still permeates the ideological opposition to
intellectual property at the international level[, [it is not about
"North vs. South]{.mark}" anymore, it is about [whether one **lives** in
a country whose policymakers understand that **stronger**
i]{.mark}ntellectual [p]{.mark}roperty rights [are beneficial for
**innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline} and economic growth. Recognizing
this, [[countries need to adjust]{.mark} their [**traditional**
pursuit]{.mark} of economic policy, including [**intellectual property,
at the international level**, and pursue a new approach]{.mark},
as]{.underline} the costs of the status quo (in terms of the rules set
by TRIPS) and stasis (in terms of new rules and debates) [will only
continue to rise as the gap between these rules and modern technology
and business practices grows. The ideas outlined in this report make the
case for the world's top innovators to lead the charge in shaping a new
agenda, and explain how they can achieve this.]{.underline} The ideas
are based on some degree of continuity with current trade policies and
institutions, and to a degree on new ones[. At its heart, the strategy
recognizes that [leading countries need to take charge in order to break
through the stalemate]{.mark} at the multilateral level, and to not
allow opponents' ideological anchoring to hold back efforts to build an
international framework for intellectual property that better supports
global innovation.]{.underline}

Last month, the venerable Economist newspaper published an editorial
decrying the state of the patent system. They rightly condemned the
"parasitic ecology of trolls" that has bruised the patent system in
recent years. But then the Economist went much further, claiming that
while "today's patent regime operates in the name of progress, instead
it sets innovation back." This is hardly surprising for a publication
that throughout the 19th century openly called for the abolition of the
patent system. They did so, mind you, even as the patented inventions of
Matthias Baldwin, Samuel Morse, Alexander Graham Bell, and Thomas Edison
were unleashing the railroad, telegraph, telephone, and electrical power
industries and transforming the face of human society. But no matter,
let's take the Economist's central claim at face value --- that patents
"set innovation back" rather than promote it --- and see if it holds up
to scrutiny. Let's start with the basics: What causes innovation in the
first place? [[Economists]{.mark} have repeatedly [**demonstrated** that
inventors are driven **primarily**]{.mark} by the expectation of
[profiting]{.mark} from owning the rights to their
inventions]{.underline}. Zorina Khan of Bowdoin College, whose 2005
classic The Democratization of Invention: Patents and Copyrights in
American Economic Development was awarded the prestigious Alice Hanson
Jones Prize for outstanding work in economic history, observed that
"Ordinary people \[are\] stimulated by higher perceived returns or
demand-side incentives to make long-term commitments to inventive
activity." She also found that "their patterns of patenting were
procyclical \[and\] responded to expected profit opportunities." Along
with her colleague the late Kenneth Sokoloff of UCLA, Professor Khan
then summarized the role of patents in helping U.S. startup businesses
grow the economy from an agrarian backwater into the most powerful
industrial economy on the face of the earth: [The U.S. patent system had
a [powerful impact on the patterns of inventive activity]{.mark}. Its
provision of broad access to property rights on new inventions, coupled
with the requirement of public disclosure, [was extremely effective at
stimulating the growth of a market for technology and promoting
technological change]{.mark} \[emphasis added\].]{.underline} Then, as
now, the American formula for success was simple: Startups + patents =
jobs and economic growth! Over the last 50 years, economists have found
that patents continue to foster ex ante innovation --- meaning, they
induce people to invent because of the prospect of profiting from those
inventions. The work of economists such as Arrow (1962), Griliches
(1963), Schmookler (1966), Kitch (1977), Reinganum (1981), Klemperer
(1990), Romer (1990), Giulbert and Shapiro (1990), Grossman and Helpman
(1991), Scotchmer (1999), and Gallini (2002) on this issue is mostly
available for free online at the Social Science Research Network. One
especially interesting 2007 study by Arora, Ceccagnoli, and Cowen
entitled \"R&D and the Patent Premium\" found that \"the [[patent
premium for innovations that were **patented**]{.mark} is substantial.
Firms earn on average a 50[% **premium** over the no patenting case,
ranging from 60% in the health related]{.mark} industries to about 40%
in electronics." Sure, one should be cautious about academic research,
especially given the old joke about how an **economist** opens a can of
soup]{.underline}. (Answer: assume a can opener.) [But real-world
economics clearly confirms the research findings. Consider, for example,
that the biggest job-creating new industries of the last 60 years ---
semiconductors]{.underline} (consumer electronics), PCs, software,
biotech, mobile telephony, and Internet e-commerce --- were all launched
and grew strong on the basis of patented inventions created by startup
businesses. As the CEO of Juno Therapeutics, Hans Bishop, and ARCH
Venture Partners co-founder Bob Nelson recently wrote in Forbes: "Let us
be clear: investments in the biotech industry are based entirely on
patents[. Without strong patents, we cannot raise money to find cures
for disease." Moreover, the evidence that patents foster innovation is
not confined to the U.S., nor is it limited only to developed
countries.]{.underline} In 2008, a study by the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that "stronger levels
of patent protection are positively and significantly associated with
inflows of high-tech product \[and\] expenditures on R&D." And in
another study that attracted wide attention, Shih-Tse Lo of Concordia
University in Montreal found that the 1986 reforms strengthening the
Taiwanese patent system "stimulated additional inventive activity,
especially in industries where patent protection is generally regarded
as an effective strategy for extracting returns, and in industries which
are more R&D intensive. The reforms also seemed to induce additional
foreign direct investment in Taiwan." Interestingly, the evidence also
shows that rather than hindering knowledge sharing, as the Economist
claims, patents actually promote it. Acemoglu, Bimpikis, and Ozdaglar
(2008) observed that "patents improve the allocation of resources by
encouraging rapid experimentation and efficient ex-post transfer of
knowledge across firms." [Indeed, it turns out that the [patent system
is one of the most effective tools for knowledge-sharing and
**technology** transfer ever devised]{.mark}.]{.underline} A 2006 study
by French economists Francois Leveque and Yann Meniere found that 88
percent of U.S., European, and Japanese businesses said they actually
rely upon the information disclosed in patents to keep up with
technology advances and direct their own R&D efforts. This is hardly a
new phenomenon. [The 19th century inventor Elias E. Reis reported that
when he read about an 1886 patent issued to Elihu Thomson for a new
method of electric welding, "there immediately opened up to my mind a
field of new applications to which I saw I could apply my system of
producing heat in large quantities."]{.underline} Thomas Edison was
known to frequent the patent office in order to study other inventors'
patents and hopefully spark ideas of his own. As for Edison himself, a
2013 study found that rather than blocking further invention, his
seminal 1880 incandescent lamp patent (No. 223,898) actually "stimulated
downstream development work" that resulted in "new technologies of
commercial significance \[including\] the Tesla coil, hermetically
sealed connectors, chemical vapor deposition process, tungsten lamp
filaments and phosphorescent lighting that led to today's fluorescent
lamps." A simple thought experiment suggests why this is so. As UCLA's
Sokoloff and Yale's Naomi Lamoreaux observed in a 1997 paper, "[The very
act of establishing exclusive property rights in invention not only
protected patentees but also promoted the diffusion of information about
technology. To see why, imagine a world in which there was no patent
system to guarantee inventors property rights to their discoveries. In
such a world, inventors would have every incentive to be secretive and
guard jealously their discoveries from competitors \[because those
discoveries\] could, of course, be copied with impunity.]{.underline}
This is the world of trade secrets. "[By contrast," the authors noted,
"in a world where property rights in invention were protected, the
situation would be very different. Inventors would now feel free to
promote their discoveries as widely as possible so as to maximize
returns either from commercializing their ideas themselves or from
\[licensing\] rights to the idea to others.]{.underline} The protections
offered by the patent system would thus be an important stimulus to the
exchange of technological information in and of themselves. Moreover, it
is likely that the cross-fertilization that resulted from these
information flows would be a potent stimulus to technological change."
In the real world, one need only look at the smartphone industry to see
the truth in that thought experiment. Does anyone believe that global
smartphone use would have experienced such extraordinarily rapid growth
under a trade secret regime? Impossible. Only a strong patent system
enabling the licensing and cross-licensing of proprietary technology
across four very disparate industries ---telephony, electronics,
computing and software --- could have produced the hugely successful
smartphone industry that we enjoy today. The response of some critics to
all this evidence is, "Yes, but you can't prove causation." And it's
true, one cannot prove theoretically that the patent system by itself
causes higher rates of innovation and economic growth. That's because
the exogenous factors --- the dynamism of markets, the efficacy of legal
and governmental institutions, the availability of capital, and the role
of countless other factors --- are far too complex and interdependent to
isolate causation to patents alone. It's like trying to pinpoint
ultimate causation in the weather. It can't be done. But by the same
token, one also cannot prove that free market capitalism --- isolated
from all the legal, educational, economic, governmental and cultural
institutions that surround it in any country --- causes more economic
growth than a government-run socialist economy. Yet we all know without
a doubt from real-world experience --- including the fact that 74 years
of socialism in the Soviet Union failed to produce even a decent
refrigerator --- that free markets are strongly correlated with greater
economic prosperity. [The same is true of the [patent system: on
**balance**]{.mark} and over the [**long term**, patents are **strongly
correlated**]{.mark} with increased [**innovation**, knowledge
**sharing**]{.mark}, and economic **growth**. I'm all for stopping the
patent trolls who pillage innocent businesses rather than create
anything useful. But if we want **[America to keep inventing the future,
we'd better keep patenting.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### [2AC\-\--Emerging Tech\-\--IP Works\-\--Warming]{.underline}

#### IP is the lynchpin of sustainable innovation. 

**Krul, 20** \[Ruben Krul has a Bachelor's degree in Law and Economics
and his master's degree in International Political Economy at Radboud
University, July 2020, accessed on 7-16-2022, Theses.ubn.ru,

The goal of this research was to explore the relationship between IPRs
and sustainable innovation, thereby being the first study to explore
this relationship using an econometric model. This relationship is
explored by using two main roles of IP, namely the incentivizing role of
IP and the role of IP in technology diffusion. A panel data analysis was
performed in order to gain more insights in this relationship. IP was
measured by two slightly different indexes: the Ginarte and Park index,
which is solely focused in patents, and the Global Competitiveness
Report index, which is a more general IP index that includes other IP
rights too, such as design rights and copyrights. Based on the
literature, [hypothesis 1a stated that the [IP]{.mark} system
[**incentivizes** sustainable **innovation**]{.mark}, [because it does
so for general **innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This hypothesis
cannot be confirmed for the general IP index, since the statistical
analysis shows mixed results, with sometimes a positive and sometimes a
negative coefficient, which is also not in all cases significant.
However, an [[inverted U-curve]{.mark} relationship [seems to
exist]{.mark}, meaning that up to a certain threshold, the [IP system
does **stimulate** **sustainable** **innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
On the other hand[, patent laws seems to be stimulating sustainable
innovation, because [they show a positive and often significant
relationship]{.mark}, although this assessment is based on a limited
amount of observations, and this conclusion must thus be drawn
carefully]{.underline}. However, based on the results of this study, for
patent laws, [the first hypothesis can be confirmed]{.underline}. This
difference between the indexes comes from the fact that the patent-index
is solely focused on patents, which are the 'ultimate' drivers of
innovation, while the general IP index also includes other rights that
might mitigate the overall impact of IP compared to the patent-index.
The results also suggest that this IPRs are not negligible in the
process of sustainable innovation, as the relative value of the general
IP indexes is average compared to the other variables, and even high for
the patent index. Hypothesis 2a stated that [[the IP **system** is not
yet designed to promote sustainable innovation]{.mark}, because there
are hardly any factors within this system [that are focussed
specifically on environmental technologies]{.mark}. T]{.underline}his
hypothesis was tested using a green patent-policy variable, showing
mostly negative outcomes. The results indicate that this subhypothesis
can be confirmed as there was no significant relationship. [The second
hypothesis **focused** on the second role of IP, and stated that
**IPRs** are an enabling factor in the diffusion of **sustaianble**
innovations]{.underline}. This hypothesis can not be confirmed for
patent diffusion. The results of the analysis on the green patent
diffusion-database showed mixed results, although most results were
negative and insignificant. The negative value could be an indication
that stricter patent laws also have more expensive and time-consuming
application procedures, meaning that it is less attractive to a lot
patent holders. A positive note is that relative to the other
variables[, IP is really important, which means that a change in the [IP
**system** should lead to a lot more patent
diffusion]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, the results for this
relationship slightly differ when looking at technology trade. A
positive, but insignficant relationship exists between IP and
sustainable technology diffusion, although the relationship [between
[**patent** laws and sustainable technology diffusion]{.mark} [seems to
be]{.mark} more s[ignificant]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, as these
results indicate, this hypothesis can also not be confirmed. The
conclusion of this study is thus that IPRs are not contributing (yet) to
to the development and spread of sustainable innovation. The main
hypotheses are rejected, meaning that there is not a signficiant role
yet for IP in sustainable innovation. As pointed out earlier, the IP
system is currently still only focused on general innovation and has no
or too little characteristics that stimulate the development and
diffusion of sustainable innovation. This has to change, considering
climate change is one of the biggest challenges in current times. An
example of a policy could be an easier and cheaper application process
51 for green patents. [Moreover IP seems to be an **important** factor
in climate change, because IP seems to be important in all analyses that
are performed. So changing the [IP system]{.mark} would be of [great
importance]{.mark} in [fighting]{.mark} the [environmental
problems]{.mark}. It is thus recommended to focus more on the IP system
as an environmental policy tool, as it will make a
difference.]{.underline}

[We have assumed that [humanity's future]{.mark} will unfold in a way
that avoids any of a number of global disasters for Homo sapiens
sapiens]{.underline}. An equally [reasonable but less [**optimistic**
assessment]{.mark} could take exception to that position]{.underline}. A
variety of things could go badly wrong for humanity. Global human [[N
may not **stabilize** at]{.mark} or below where it stands now without
being pushed there by some form(s) of [crisis that result from humans
exceeding global K]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result, anthropogenic
factors from the intentionally harmful (e.g., warfare) to the
unintentionally disastrous (e.g., agricultural practices leading to
topsoil erosion and desertification) could occur singly or in
conjunction with one another, with a variety of natural disasters (e.g.,
volcanic eruptions, earthquakes), and with disasters that straddle the
boundary of natural and anthropogenic, the sorts of scenarios that
otherwise could have been avoided or their impacts lessened with more
forethought (e.g., outbreaks of infectious disease that move easily
through dense human population centers and cannot be readily treated due
to pathogen drug resistance). Although we cannot rule out such
eventualities, [[**speculation** about the future of humanity is
inherently]{.mark} more interesting if it proceeds on the
[**assumption** that the species]{.mark} will be at least moderately
successful beyond the short- to medium-term.]{.underline} However, it
may not, and the potential failure of our species has considerable
biological implications. From [[an ecological or evolutionary
**perspective**]{.mark}, few events are good or bad in absolute terms:
they simply [favor different **organisms**]{.mark}. So while [we would
view a precipitous dro]{.mark}p in human N, perhaps even [**human
extinction**,]{.mark} as bad news, a more objective position would [see
it as bad news only for one particular primate]{.mark} and the minority
of species]{.underline} (e.g., cockroaches, Norway rats) [that thrive in
the environments we maintain and the **pathogens** and parasites that
rely on us for food and habitat]{.underline}. In areas where humans are
partially excluded (e.g., demilitarized zones such as the one between
North and South Korea), wildlife thrives \[35\]. The same would be true
if humans were absent from much---or, indeed, all---of the world. [Some
of the richest speculations about future vertebrate evolution extend the
time scale over which humans are absent to cover millions of
years]{.underline} \[36\]. By and large, however, we consider a
short-term perspective much more manageable. In some respects, [the
human future will be very different from the human past]{.underline}.
Regardless of whether human N and per capita resource use decrease
sooner or later, future [generations will see less wildlife than their
ancestors.]{.underline} Organisms across a wide range of taxa, most
visibly large mammals but also birds and amphibians, will become extinct
due mainly to multiple stresses caused by human actions. [For now, the
full **ecological** and evolutionary consequences of these extinctions
remain unknown, although the greater the magnitude of extinctions, the
higher the likelihood that they will negatively impact human life.
Future humans will inhabit a world in which some niches are liable to be
left vacant until new organisms arise to fill them]{.underline}. What
these species will be, how they will function in the communities they
occupy, and what ecosystem services they will directly or indirectly
provide or facilitate will depend on the magnitude of human impacts. At
all time scales, species assemblages and associations characteristic of
particular communities today will likely change. How much will depend on
the pace at which human population growth and resource use change.

Emerging pathogens Although we are made up of human cells, we have
almost ten times that of bacteria just in our guts and more on our skin.
These microbes not only affect locally but also affect the entire body.
There is a balance between the good and bad bacteria, and any change in
the environment may cause this balance to shift, especially on the skin,
the consequences of which are unknown. Although most bacteria on and
inside of us are harmless, gut bacteria can also have viruses. [[If
viruses don't kil]{.mark}l the [bacteria]{.mark} immediately, [they can
incorporate into the **bacterial** genome and stay latent]{.mark} for a
long time [until reactivation by environmental factors]{.mark}, when
they can become pathogenic. They can also escape from the gut and enter
other organs or the bloodstream. Bacteria can then use these viruses to
kill other bacteria or help them evolve to more virulent
strains.]{.underline} An example of the evolution of pathogens is the
cause of the current pandemic, the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several mutations are now known that make
the virus more infectious and resistant to immune responses, and
strengthening its to enter cells via surface receptors. The brain [There
is evidence that the [SARS-CoV-2 can also affect the brai]{.mark}n. The
virus may enter the brain via the olfactory tract or through the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) pathway. Viruses can also affect
our senses, such as a loss of smell and taste, and there could be other
so far unkown neurological effects.]{.underline} The loss of smell seen
in COVID-19 could be a new viral syndrome specific to this disease. Many
books and movies have described pandemics caused by pathogens that wipe
out large populations and cause severe diseases. In the essay, the
author provides a hypothetical scenario where a gut bacteria suddenly
starts producing viral proteins. Some virions spread through the body
and get transmitted through the human population. After a few months,
the virus started causing blindness, and within a year, large
populations lost their vision. [[Pandemics can cause other **diseases**
that can **threaten** humanity's entire existence]{.mark}. The COVID-19
pandemic brought this possibility to the forefront[. If we continue
disturbing the **equilibrium** between us and the environment]{.mark},

the Guardian: "Growthmania is the fatal disease of civilisation - it
must be replaced by campaigns that make equity and well-being society's

growth drive soil degradation and biodiversity loss, the new paper
warns. "More people means that more synthetic compounds and dangerous
throwaway plastics are manufactured, many of which add to the growing
toxification of the Earth. It also increases the chances of pandemics

great common endowment of negentropy is being irreversibly degraded into
entropy on a cosmic scale. These are resources that an advanced
civilization could have used]{.underline} to create value-structures,
such as sentient beings living worthwhile lives. The rate of this loss
boggles the mind. One recent paper speculates, [using]{.underline} loose
theoretical [considerations based on the rate of increase of entropy,
that [the loss of]{.mark} potential [**human lives** in]{.mark}
[our]{.mark} own galactic [supercluster is at least]{.mark} \~**[10\^46
per century of delayed colonization]{.mark}**.]{.underline}\[1\]
[This]{.underline} estimate [assumes]{.underline} that all the [lost
entropy could have been used for productive purposes]{.underline},
although no currently known technological mechanisms are even remotely
capable of doing that. Since the estimate is meant to be a lower bound,
this radically unconservative assumption is undesirable. [[We
can]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [[get a lower
bound]{.underline}]{.mark} more straightforwardly [[by]{.mark} simply
[counting]{.mark} the number or [stars in our]{.mark} galactic
[supercluster]{.mark} [and multiplying]{.mark} this number [with the
amount of **computing power** that the **resources of each star** could
be used to generate]{.mark} using technologies for whose feasibility a
strong case has already been made. We can then divide this total with
the estimated amount of computing power needed to simulate one human
life.]{.underline} As a rough approximation, let us say the Virgo
Supercluster contains 10\^13 stars. One estimate of the computing power
extractable from a star and with an associated planet-sized
computational structure, using advanced molecular nanotechnology\[2\],
is 10\^42 operations per second.\[3\] A typical estimate of the human
brain's processing power is roughly 10\^17 operations per second or
less.\[4\] Not much more seems to be needed to simulate the relevant
parts of the environment in sufficient detail to enable the simulated
minds to have experiences indistinguishable from typical current human
experiences.\[5\] Given these estimates, it follows that [the potential
for [approximately 10\^38 human lives is lost every century that
colonization]{.mark} of our local supercluster [is delayed]{.mark};
[or]{.mark} equivalently, about [10\^31]{.mark} potential human [lives
per second]{.mark}.]{.underline} While this estimate is conservative in
that it assumes only computational mechanisms whose implementation has
been at least outlined in the literature, it is useful to have an even
more conservative estimate that does not assume a non-biological
instantiation of the potential persons. Suppose that about 10\^10
biological humans could be sustained around an average star. Then the
Virgo Supercluster could contain 10\^23 biological humans. This
corresponds to a loss of potential equal to about 10\^14 potential human
lives per second of delayed colonization. What matters for present
purposes is not the exact numbers but the fact that they are huge. [Even
with the most conservative estimate, assuming a biological
implementation of all persons, the [potential for **one hundred
trillion**]{.mark} potential **[human beings is lost]{.mark}** for every
second of postponement of colonization of our

Torres's argument [fails to **mention** the possibility of
extraterrestrial **life** and especially **extraterrestrial**
intelligent life; in this he is quite similar to many other philosophers
discussing the future of **humanity**]{.underline} (e.g., Kahane 2014;
Klee 2017). [This is important in two different respects. The first is
that by relinquishing space colonization, humans obviously leave all
available cosmological resources to other intelligent
species]{.underline}. (Of course, some of them might be swayed by
arguments of extraterrestrial Torresanalogs and relinquish space
colonization, but there is no guarantee that all of them will do so,
esp. since -- as shown above -- the arguments are not that persuasive[!)
This will enable **dramatic** expansion of an alien **colonizing**
species, which will fill the universe with their own values, entirely
different from human/posthuman]{.underline} values. This might or might
not be desirable -- depending on the character of alien values -- but in
any case, it would not be particularly appealing from the narrow human
perspective. [Those averse to s-risks should clearly be against this
scenario, since there are no guarantees that aliens would not be more
efficient than humans in inflicting suffering onto themselves and
others]{.underline}. The second part of the story is harsher.
[Ironically, if Torres were right that space colonization would always
lead to war between diverging factions, the situation would have been
hopeless for humanity, 9]{.underline} Was King George justified in
denying those pesky New England colonists "representation rights"? And
would he have been justified if he could somehow predict the suffering
inflicted by such increase in diversity not only in the Revolutionary
War, but also the war of 1812, etc.? 10 It is irrelevant for present
purposes that a great deal of this argument could apply to Bostrom's
singleton as well. Moral aspects of singletons have not been
sufficiently studied thus far; it is entirely conceivable that all
singletons or all realistic singletons are repugnant in this sense as
well. In any case, any conceivable risk of totalitarian usurpation of a
future singleton is inherent in the argument that space colonization
should be suppressed in order to prevent diversification of future
(post)humanity. since one or another alien faction would have found it
both expedient and easy to exterminate or enslave the Earth-bound
humanity. By the very logic of Torres's narrative about hyperweapons,
the Earth would remain an easy target for any interstellar colonizing
faction (and there is no reason to assume that aggressive factions would
limit their aggression to their phylogenetic relatives). Thus, Torres's
argument is actually self-defeating in [the presence of extraterrestrial
intelligence -- acquiescing to it would directly contribute to the
ultimate harm]{.underline}. Perhaps a skeptic wants to believe (as a
kind of anti-agent Moulder, of the X-Files' fame) that extraterrestrial
intelligence is non-existent or vanishingly rare? To begin with, it
would be strange to bet the long-term future of humanity on such a
technical astrobiological issue, on which we can exert no influence
whatsoever. [[E]{.mark}xtra[t]{.mark}errestrial life [either **exists or
it does**]{.mark} **not**, [irrespectively of]{.mark} any amount of our
ethical or [**political** hand-wringing]{.mark}. So, lacking specific
information for one or the other, [we should]{.mark} certainly make
[strategies for **both options**. Further]{.mark}, the advances of
astrobiology over the last quarter century offer many reasons for
cautious belief in the conclusion that life and intelligence are
reasonably abundant in astrophysically and astrochemically permissible
ecosystems.]{.underline} Some of the arguments to that effect are
summarized in Ćirković (2012).11 Even if, by some quirk of
astrobiological evolution, humanity is the first intelligent species to
arise in the Milky Way (as, for instance, per the well-known argument of
Carter 1983, 2008), following Torres's advice and [[relinquishing space
colonization]{.mark} will simply [ensure that the second, third, or
275th]{.mark} intelligent [species to evolve will]{.mark} indeed
[colonize]{.mark} the Galaxy [instead of humans.]{.mark}]{.underline}
If, on the other hand, Torres is wrong and it is possible to colonize
the Galaxy in a peaceful and prosperous manner, [[humanity might survive
on Earth in a kind of zoo or preserve]{.mark}, surrounded by [friendly
and considerate interstellar aliens]{.mark} -- but obviously [failing to
realize its creative potential]{.mark}]{.underline} (which would also
count as [an [existential catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline} in Bostrom's
taxonomy).12 There is simply no way out of that quandary, unless one is
a creationist who believes that humanity originated by Divine
supernatural act and there is exactly zero probability of
abiogenesis/noogenesis occurring elsewhere. In general, no naturalistic
utilitarian calculus of various scenarios for the future of humanity
could be complete if it does not take extraterrestrial intelligence into
account. [A basic tenet of most space exploration has been to sterilize
all spacecrafts in order to avoid potential contamination of space from
Eart]{.underline}h. A relevant incident occurred as a public faux pas in
July 2017. The US Vice President was touring the Kennedy Space Center,
and passed some equipment destined for space travel. A sign said
'Critical space flight hardware---Do not touch', but he accidentally did
just that while on television. This story links to our essay\'s primary
theme and the tacit message of the signage: 'Do not touch to avoid
contamination'. To the contrary, we suggest that it is now time to
rethink this 'contamination' policy, including plans and protocols to
track accidental introduction and, in parallel, developing a protocol
for \'controlled colonizing\' of another planetary body, if this is
decided to be humanity\'s long-term goal. [Our message in this paper
intends to convince that substituting the more forward-looking term
microbial 'introductions or release' into space would be more realistic
than using the negative term 'contamination']{.underline}. Also, the
current planetary protection policy is not consistent with future plans
to ultimately colonize space.

[International space [**microbial** policy]{.mark} started with

(**[OST]{.mark}**),]{.underline} and especially Article IX, which has
this statement (Rummel and Billings 2004)---'[States shall pursue

Planetary Protection Guidelines
(http://w.astro.berkeley.edu/∼kalas/ethics/documents/environment/COSPAR%20Planetary%20Protection%20Policy.pdf;
COSPAR 2003). A major tenet of these guidelines includes, [\'COSPAR
**maintains** and [promulgates **planetary protection** policy]{.mark}
for the reference of **spacefaring** nations, both as an international
standard on procedures to avoid organic-constituent and biological
[contamination in space exploration, and to provide accepted

[[well-intentioned set of actions]{.mark} meant to avoid [unintentional
contamination of extraterrestrial habitats]{.mark} during the
exploratory phase of the solar system with earthly organisms (e.g.

logical tact, since space exploration in the last century was pushing
quickly for new boundaries of the unknown, and discovery of a new life
form would probably be very different from that of Earth (Kminek and
Rummel 2015). Humanity had to verify that no extraterrestrial life

[Most treatments of [**postbiological**
evolution]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} including ones of Kurzweil
(1999, 2005), Moravec (2000), Smart (2012) and [others suggest that
postbiological evolution will open new **design** spaces and lead to
[unprecedented **diversification** of future
(post)**human**]{.mark}**ity**]{.underline}. Traditionally, that has
been regarded as a merit rather than a demerit of postbiological
evolution. Most of the phenomena alleged to be risky by Torres, such as
"cognitive-emotional diversification", "the lack of common ontological
ground", "phylogenetic diversity" are not only feasible, but rather
highly likely to occur without space colonization either. [Even
inflicting "eternal punishment" has been conceived and discussed on web
fora without any reference to space travel and colonization. All this
[betrays strong conservatism regarding possible]{.mark} and plausible
progress in [the social domain]{.mark}: the assumption that improved and
[more peaceful forms o]{.mark}f social organization [will not
emerge]{.mark} in the future]{.underline} (even cosmologically distant
one). In other [words, [space colonization is rather peripheral
here]{.mark}.]{.underline} In its core, Torres's argument implies an
argument against diversity as such and whether such diversity is
achieved on Earth or in the near-Earth space or on Mars or in another
galaxy is of secondary importance.8 [And of course, [if we once accept
that future **diversity** on Earth]{.mark} will be much [higher than
anything **encountered** so far in the course of biological
evolution]{.mark}, the size and nature of [**planetary** ecosystem make
the conflict much more **feasible**]{.mark} -- and hence likelier for
rational actors capable of modeling and [prediction to **achieve** their
aims -- than in the **cosmic** case]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Aggressive actors, if they emerge in the first place (and as per Section
2, I find it unlikely), will have it much easier time in getting to
their opponents on Earth, than at distances measured in kiloparsecs.
[Therefore, [**diversity and possibility** of divergent
evolution]{.mark} need to be suppressed (]{.underline}if necessary, by
brute force of Hobbesian "Leviathan") [[here and everywhere]{.mark}. It
is hard to understate the [repugnant nature of this conclusion]{.mark}.
The whole tradition of liberalism and the Enlightenment is based on
**assumption** [that free choice, as a source of all **diversity**, is
of an **intrinsic** value]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the historical
record, the greatest evils inflicted by humans on themselves and their
surroundings have not been caused by diversity, but by the exactly
opposite tendencies: suppression of diversity and forceful imposition of
uniformity. Hence wars of religion, genocides and inquisitions, the
Holocaust, Stalinist and Maoist purges, "the killing fields" of Cambodia
and other monstrosities of human history. [The idea that all this (and
immense other) violence is created by **diversity**, rather than by
[attempts to impose **uniformity**, is tantamount to the infamous
**anti-Semitic meme**]{.mark} that only countries and **populations**
which are already]{.underline} Judenfrei are free of antisemitism. In
fact, the suppression of diversity occurred exactly through the immoral
violence of Hobbesian "Leviathan" which Torres -- incomprehensibly and
repugnantly -- regards as desirable and dubs the consequences "the minor
cost of some civilizational freedoms" (p. 79). A very unfortunate
consequence is the authoritarian manner in which Torres treats
human/posthuman rights. Among many, one rather poignant example is the
sentence which starts with "If 'morphological freedom' is granted to
martian citizens..." (p. 82) which betrays authoritarian bias --
freedoms are not granted, they either are rights or not. If they are
rights, then their suppression or revocation is immoral, pure and
simple. And it makes Torres's later concern about "the formidable
question of what central decision-making body would decide which updates
to make" (p. 83) a bit hypocritical. If Pyramids were built by slaves,
the undertaking would be immoral, since slavery is inherently immoral;
oh, but the Pharaoh could perhaps revoke some freedoms, appropriate for
the time, for some "Leviathanic higher purpose", couldn't he? Even on
skeptical (non-radical!) negative utilitarianism, it is at best unproven
that such suppression of diversity would not in itself bring about
greater suffering than the diversity itself could bring about. To those
of us who regard suppression of personal freedoms -- including the
essential freedom to diversify -- as comparable to, or even worse than,
personal extinction, the implications of Torres's argumentation are
positively threatening; or at least they would have been, if other parts
of the argument were more persuasive.

Torres's arguments often rely on [[conflation]{.mark} of what can be
dubbed "reasonable" and "[unreasonable"
speculation]{.mark}]{.underline}. For [example, to assume that
(post)humans will one day colonize and perhaps terraform Mars is a
reasonable speculation; to assume that (post)humans will one day
[develop "weapons that could destroy entire **galaxies**"]{.mark} (p.
82[) is]{.mark} an [unreasonable **speculation**. There are no
indications]{.mark} whatsoever [that the latter is **physically**
pos]{.mark}]{.underline}[sible.]{.mark} For instance, the binding energy
of the stellar subsystem of the Milky Way is about --6  1050 J; if
"destruction of the Galaxy[" [means unbinding all its
stars,]{.underline} ]{.mark}[this would imply [the **hyperweapon**
capable of **releasing**]{.mark} at least t[hat much energy, equivalent
to completely **converting**]{.mark} more than [3,000 Solar-mass stars
into usable energy]{.mark}]{.underline} [(as per]{.mark} E = mc2 ).3
This is significantly more than the output of the most energetic known
natural processes, including supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and the most
violent QSOs; even more importantly, we cannot envision -- if [our
current astrophysics is correct and there is no bulk antimatter
**anywhere** in the universe -- the kind of energy-releasing process
**necessary** for this task]{.underline}. Even if our distant posthuman
descendants manage to discover and control such a process, the timescale
for such a destruction would of necessity be measured in multiples of
107 or 108 years, which sounds a bit unreasonable in the tactical sense.
And even if a military operation spanning 100,000,000 years or so could
be palatable to a hypothetical future immortals, its efficiency would be
doubtful, since not only would the adversary have enough time to
prepare, but the unbinding might not automatically mean the destruction
of adversary's material and industrial capacities. (And similar
objections could be posed to other construals of "destruction", e.g.,
attempting to collapse all baryonic matter into the central supermassive
black hole.)

Which leads us to further examples of conflation. Torres fails to
[clearly distinguish between [different kinds of space
**colonization**]{.mark} which correspond to [astrophysical distribution
of resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Colonization of our Solar
System]{.mark} [is one]{.mark} such [kind]{.mark}, [interstellar

and the [intergalactic colonization]{.mark} suggested by Armstrong and
Sandberg [yet a third]{.mark} one]{.underline}. Neither motivations,
[not technologies, nor timescales, nor cultural **consequences** of
these kinds are the same, and [it is highly **misleading** to treat them
on the same footing]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, latency delays
of the order of minutes and hours (the Solar System colonization) are
rather trivial, those on the order of years or decades (interstellar
colonization in Sun's Galactic vicinity) are comparable to those of
ancient empires, esp. when human/posthuman life extension is taken into
account. Only larger latencies, on the order of millennia (Kardashev
Type 3 Galactic civilization) or millions of years [or more
(intergalactic colonization) are those which imply at least some of the
**consequences** Torres ascribes to all kinds of space colonization. In
the sense that **colonization** of the Solar System is a necessary
precondition for almost any other colonization-related **endeavor**, we
would expect that arguments claiming to overturn the standard way of
thinking apply in the strongest to this kind of
colonization]{.underline}. However, it is exactly the opposite in
Torres's account. [By far [the most **problematic** aspects]{.mark} of
space colonization [apply to the nebulous distant future of galactic
**colonization**]{.mark}; the suggestion that [establishing a human
colony on Mars would lead to speciation and deadly conflict]{.mark} --

disincentive to hiring the long-term experts DoD needs, GAO said. So
far, [DoD has allocated nearly \$5 million for the cadre in 2020 and
2021. "While [DoD]{.mark} has [develop]{.mark}ed a [conceptual
framework]{.mark} intended to guide its operations, we found that the
department has not yet [detail]{.mark}ed how the IP Cadre will meet its
[broad responsibilities]{.mark} or determined whether it has the
capacity to do so,"]{.underline} the report states. [There are also
issues in the organization of the cadre as well. "The members of the
**IP** Cadre expect to tap into a larger pool of IP experts across DoD
to support program offices by helping them develop IP strategies and
negotiate with contractors, among other things,"]{.underline} the report
states. "However, DoD has not yet detailed how the Director of the IP
Cadre and the DoD will work with these other experts." DiNapoli's team
found that DoD lacks expertise in two areas as well: IP valuation and
financial analysis. DoD is currently undertaking a pilot project to
study valuation strategies. "The pilot program will study valuation
strategies used by one major Army weapon system and three smaller Navy
programs to identify practices that can be shared across DoD and
incorporated into department-wide guidance," the GAO authors wrote.
Outside of the cadre, GAO found DoD's current instruction on IP to be
lacking. "While the IP instruction emphasizes the importance of
acquiring and licensing IP early in the acquisition process, officials
from the IP Cadre and military departments stated that the instruction
and department-wide guidance do not address DoD's ability to acquire
detailed manufacturing or process data," the GAO authors wrote.
DiNapoli's team gave DoD four recommendations. It suggested a planned
guidebook on IP to clarify how DoD personnel can pursue detailed
manufacturing or process data. The team said DoD needs to better
coordinate staffing and funding and ensure DoD collaborates with the
Defense Acquisition University on IP tasks between 2023 and 2025.
Finally, the team recommended developing guidance to help component
heads identify personnel in key career fields who would most benefit
from IP training. --- SM

[WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Chris Coons
(D-DE), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), and Rick Scott (R-FL)
recently introduced bipartisan legislation to prevent China from
stealing **i**ntellectual **p**roperty]{.underline} from American
companies through their corrupt court system. For years, China has
knowingly engaged in the ongoing theft of U.S. patents, copyrights, and
trade secrets. Now, China seeks to bar the ability to litigate patent
rights within the United States. Recently, Chinese courts have
increasingly issued so-called "anti-suit injunctions," which limit the
ability of American companies to file or maintain claims related to
patent infringement in U.S. courts or the International Trade
Commission. [The **[D]{.mark}**efending **[A]{.mark}**merican
**[C]{.mark}**ourts **[A]{.mark}**ct would impose
**[meaningful]{.mark}** [disincentives]{.mark} for bad actors [seeking
to enforce]{.mark} such a foreign **[a]{.mark}nti-[s]{.mark}uit
[i]{.mark}njunction** in the United States.]{.underline} It prohibits
these bad actors from seeking review of the relevant patent at the
Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and if they are found to have infringed
the patent, the bill requires certain presumptions that make enhanced
damages and attorney fees more likely. It would also require the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office to perform a study of the harms resulting
from these anti-suit injunctions. "The Chinese Communist Party's attempt
to make Chinese courts the world arbiter of intellectual property must
be stopped. Their attempt has one goal in mind: to steal U.S. inventions
and technology[. The use of so-called '[anti-suit' injunctions]{.mark}
is an insult to [American companies]{.mark} and the rule of
law,"]{.underline} said Senator Tillis. "[American companies have every
right to challenge patent infringement from Chinese companies, and any
effort by the Chinese courts to invalidate these challenges hurts
American companies and workers. **I am proud to introduce this
[bipartisan legislation]{.mark} to [protect American innovation]{.mark}
and the sovereignty of our court system**."]{.underline} "American
innovation, and a strong IP system to support it, are vital to advancing
our economic and national security interests," said Senator Coons. "The
broad 'anti-suit injunctions' being issued by foreign powers harm U.S.
companies, innovation, and the rule of law. The Defending American
Courts Act will help protect critical patent rights and the sovereignty
of U.S. tribunals, and I'm glad to partner with a bipartisan group of my
colleagues to introduce this important bill." "We shouldn't allow the
Chinese Communist Party to use its corrupt courts to excuse the theft of
American intellectual property," said Senator Cotton. ["Our bill will
help protect **[U.S. innovation]{.mark}** from these lawless "anti-suit
injunctions"---a naked attempt to steal American IP."]{.underline} "The
U.S. patent system has long been the engine that drives American
leadership in innovation. But that system is under attack. Foreign
courts are using so-called 'anti-suit injunctions' to strip American
courts of their rightful power to enforce U.S. patents," Senator Hirono
said. "The Defending American Courts Act would reclaim the jurisdiction
of American courts by introducing strong disincentives for any person
that seeks to enforce a foreign anti-suit injunction. In this way, U.S.
patent holders can be confident that a U.S. court will rule on their
U.S. patents." "We know Communist China steals American technology and
takes our trade secrets. If Chinese companies act in bad faith, they
should be punished," said Senator Rick Scott. "I'm proud to join my
colleagues to introduce this legislation which will strengthen
intellectual property protections in American courts and penalize
foreign companies that try to shield themselves after hurting American
innovators."

[Reports of the [death of **bipartisanship**]{.mark} in Washington are
[greatly **exaggerated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. From making drinking
water safer to improving surface transportation to declaring Juneteenth
a federal holiday, lawmakers from both parties continue to collaborate
on important policy challenges, large and small. These successes do not
mean legislative deal-making is easy, of course. A frustratingly large
number of issues in desperate need of action remain mired in partisan
posturing, stuck in social media quicksand or sacrificed for fundraising
fodder. Yet, below the radar of the angertainment industry's outrage
machine, diligent work and cooperation [persist. Three areas in
particular seem especially [**ripe** for deal-making in
**Congress**]{.mark}, the ABC's of [bipartisanship]{.mark}:]{.underline}
Not surprisingly, these three issues are connected. After a global
pandemic in which the digitized thrived and the disconnected failed,
when dominant companies extended their influence and geopolitical
imbalances in our supply chain highlighted unacceptable risks, lawmakers
all agree that digital connectivity is critical to how we work, live,
play and learn. Policymakers now turn to the questions of how to make
the internet better, more resilient, ubiquitous and competitive.
Bipartisan proposals are on offer, with lawmakers working to find
compromises across the aisle on each of the ABCs. Antitrust Many
observers worry about the state of online competition and undue impact
of a few data-dominant players. Such concerns are not without
justification. Several of the most ubiquitous platforms now exceed
trillion-dollar market caps on the strengths of their value, creativity
--- and dominance. In response, regulators around the states and around
the world are pushing back with ideas to enhance consumer protection
(e.g., privacy) and ensure fairer competition. Several bills now before
Congress explore the state of market competition, reassessing whether
antitrust laws born in the industrial Gilded Age still fit our
information era. Almost all of these proposals start with bipartisan
sponsorship (if not always majority support), with divisions emerging
along economic worldviews more than team red versus team blue. It is
telling that President Biden's pick to chair the Federal Trade
Commission, Lina Khan, received 69 votes in support, more than seven of
the 15 Cabinet nominees voted on by the Senate to-date. Broadband
infrastructure So far this Congress, lawmakers have introduced more than
170 pieces of legislation specifically calling-out support for
broadband. All agree on the "problem" --- persistent digital divides,
both in terms of availability and adoption, based on income, geography
or education exacerbate inequality and reduce societal resilience. Most
policymakers agree on the set of solutions, at least broadly: support
build-out to areas where market forces alone have not incentivized
deployment and subsidize lower-income consumers for whom the monthly
cost of connectivity competes with housing, health care or subsistence.
Of course, differences emerge among lawmakers of different ideologies
and geographies, with some emphasizing access and others preferencing
affordability, some urging greater government control and others
demanding less regulation. But room exists for constructive compromise,
especially if Congress follows the core principles that powered three
decades of American global broadband policy leadership: technology
neutrality (avoid picking winners and losers); private sector leadership
(trust competitive markets to innovate faster and operate more
efficiently than government entities); and bipartisanship (the Telecom
Act of 1996 passed with 91 votes in the Senate and 414 in the House).
China After decades of bipartisan support for "constructive engagement"
with China, Washington policymakers increasingly believe policies of
cooperative accommodation failed to induce desired results. Admitting
China into the WTO did not catalyze the promised economic, social and
political liberalization, with the bilateral relationship growing more
fraught for American workers, businesses and regional allies. A [new
[bipartisan consensus emerged]{.mark}, marrying more direct
confrontation]{.underline} (over trade, cyber, **[[IP
protection]{.mark},]{.underline}** market access, human rights) [[with
more aggressive efforts]{.mark} to improve America's [**competitive**
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. A large, bipartisan Senate majority
recently passed legislation to advance the latter, critically including
\$52 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing and \$1.5 billion
to accelerate deployment of open-RAN 5G networks. The partisanship that
so often paralyzes us has many causes and overcoming it will take
significant reforms, most especially to our political processes. But
most members of Congress ran for the right reasons. They share the
public's frustration with the hyper-partisanship pervading too much of
our modern society. And they want to get things done to improve the
lives of their constituents. Opportunities for progress exist, starting
with the ABCs. Bruce Mehlman served as assistant secretary of commerce
for technology policy and co-founded the DC-based Internet Innovation
Alliance (IIA).

### 2AC\-\--AT: ADV CP\-\--R&D

#### R&D [doesn't solve]{.underline} innovation.

**Mazzucato, 13** (Mariana Mazzucato, Professor in the Economics of
Innovation and Public Value and Director of the Institute for Innovation
and Public Purpose at University College London, 2013, accessed on
3-23-2022, Anthem Other Canon Economics, "The Entrepreneurial State:
Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths", Anthem Press, pg. 37-45,
HBisevac)

The [literature on the economics of innovation]{.underline}, from
different camps, has often [**assumed** a direct causal link between
**R&D and innovation**]{.underline}, [and between innovation and
economic growth]{.underline}. [Yet,]{.underline} surprisingly, [there
are **[very few studies]{.mark}** which [prove]{.mark} that]{.underline}
[[innovation]{.mark}]{.underline} carried out by large or small firms
[actually [increases]{.mark} their growth
[performance]{.mark}]{.underline} --- the macro models on innovation and
growth do not seem to have strong empirical 'micro foundations'.34
[Some]{.underline} company level studies [have found]{.underline} a
positive impact of innovation on growth35 while others no significant
impact.36 And [some [studies]{.mark} have [found]{.mark} even a
[negative impact of R&D on growth]{.mark}, which is not surprising: if
the firms in the sample don't have the complementary characteristics
needed, **R&D becomes only a cost**.]{.underline}37 It is thus
fundamental to identify the company specific conditions that must be
present to allow spending on innovation to affect growth. These
conditions will no doubt differ between sectors. Demirel and Mazzucato,
for example, find that in the pharmaceutical industry, [only those firms
that patent five years in a row]{.underline} (the 'persistent'
patenters) [and which engage in alliances achieve **any growth** from
their R&D spending]{.underline}.38 Innovation policies in this sector
must thus target not only R&D but also attributes of firms. Coad and Rao
found that only the fastest growing firms reap benefits from their R&D
spending (the top 6 per cent identified in Nesta's report 'The vital 6
per cent').39 And Mazzucato and Parris find that this result, of the
importance of high growth firms, only holds in specific periods of the
industry life-cycle when competition is particularly fierce.40
Myth-busting 2: Small is not necessarily beautiful This finding that the
impact of innovation on growth is indeed different for different types
of firms has important implications for the commonly held assumption
that 'small firms' matter (for growth, for innovation), and hence for
the many different policies that target SMEs. The hype around small
firms arises mainly from the confusion between size and growth. The most
robust evidence is not on the role of small firms in the economy but the
role of young high growth firms. Nesta, for example, claims that the
most important firms for UK growth have been the small number of fast
growing businesses that between 2002 and 2008 generated the highest
amount of employment growth in the UK.41 And while many high growth
firms are small, many small firms are not high growth. The bursts of
fast growth that promote innovation and create employment are often
staged by firms that have existed for several years and grown
incrementally until they reach a take-off stage. This is a major problem
since so many government policies aim to target tax breaks and benefits
to SMEs, with the aim of making the economy more innovative and
productive. Although there is much talk about small firms creating
jobs,42 this is just a myth because while by definition small firms will
cause jobs to increase, in fact many small firms also destroy a large
number of jobs when they go out of business. Haltiwanger, Jarmin and
Miranda find that there is indeed no systematic relationship between
firm size and growth.43 Most of the effect is from age: young firms (and
business start-ups) contribute substantially to both gross and net job
creation. Productivity should be the focus, and small firms are indeed
often less productive than large firms. Recent evidence has suggested
that some economies that have favoured small firms, such as India, have
in fact been punished. Hsieh and Klenow, for example, suggest that
40--60 per cent of the total factor productivity (TFP) difference
between India and the USA is due to misallocation of output to too many
small and low productivity SMEs in India.44 As most small start-up firms
fail, or are incapable of growing beyond the sole owner-operator,
targeting assistance to them through grants, soft loans or tax breaks
will necessarily involve a high degree of waste. Bloom and Van Reenan
argue that small firms are less productive than large ones because they
are less well managed, and subject to provincial family favouritism.45
Furthermore, small firms have lower average wages, fewer skilled
workers, less training, fewer fringe benefits and are more likely to go
bankrupt. They argue that the UK has many family firms and a poor record
of management in comparison with other countries such as the USA and
Germany.46 Among other reasons, this is related to the fact that the tax
system is distorted to give inheritance tax breaks to family firms. Some
have interpreted the result that it is high growth rather than size that
matters to mean that the best that governments can do is to provide the
conditions for growth innovation. Bloom and Van Reenan argue that
instead of having tax breaks and benefits target SMEs, the best way to
support small firms is to 'ensure a level playing field by removing
entry barriers to firms of all sizes, reducing barriers to growth,
enforcing competition policy and strongly resisting the lobbying efforts
of larger firms and their agents'.47 But as we will see in chapters 3
and 5, often the most innovative firms are precisely those that have
benefitted the most from direct public investments of different types,
making the case much more complex. Myth-busting 3: Venture capital is
not so risk-loving If the role of small firms and R&D is overstated by
policy makers, a similar hype exists in relation to the potential for
venture capital to create growth, particularly in knowledgebased sectors
where capital intensity and technological complexity are high. Venture
capital is a type of private equity capital focused on early-stage,
high-potential, growth companies. The funding tends to come either as
seed funding or as later growth funding where the objective is to earn a
high return after the IPO of the company or sale. Venture capital fills
a void of funding for new firms, which often have trouble gaining credit
from traditional financial institutions such as banks and thus often
have to rely on other sorts of funding such as 'business angels'
(including family and friends), venture capital and private equity. Such
alternative funding is most important for new knowledge-based firms
trying to enter existing sectors or new firms trying to form a new
sector. Risk capital is so scarce in the seed stage because there is a
much higher degree of risk in this early phase, when the technological
and demand conditions are completely uncertain. The falling risk in the
different phases falls dramatically with the seed financing occurring
when there is the most uncertainty about the potential of the new idea
(table 1). Figure 2 shows the usual place that it is assumed that
venture capital will enter the stage of the invention-innovation
process. In reality the real picture is much more non-linear and full of
feedback loops. And [**many firms die** during the **transition**
between a **new scientific** or **engineering discovery** and its
successful commercial transformation and application]{.underline}. Thus
the third phase shown in figure 2 of commercial viability is often
referred to as the valley of death. Figure 2 does not illustrate how
time after time it has been public rather than privately funded venture
capital that has taken the most risks. In the USA, government programmes
such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programme and the
Advanced Technology Program (ATP) in the US Dept of Commerce have
provided 20--25 per cent of total funding for early stage technology
firms. Thus government has played a leading role not only in the early
stage research illustrated in figure 2, but also in the commercial
viability stage. Auerswald and Branscomb claim that government funding
for early stage technology firms is equal to the total investments of
'business angels' and about two to eight times the amount invested by
private venture capital.50 Venture capital funds tend to be concentrated
in areas of high potential growth, low technological complexity and low
capital investment since the latter raises the cost significantly. Since
there are so many failures in the high risk area, venture capital funds
tend to have a portfolio of different investments with only the tails
earning high returns---a very skewed distribution. Although most venture
capital funds are usually structured to have a life of ten years,
because of the management fees and the bonuses earned for high returns,
venture capital funds tend to prefer to exit much earlier than ten
years, in order to establish a track record and raise a followon fund.
This creates a situation whereby [[v]{.mark}enture [c]{.mark}apital
[funds]{.mark} therefore [have]{.mark} a [**bias** towards]{.mark}
investing in projects where the [**commercial viability**]{.mark} is
established [within]{.mark} a [three]{.mark} to five [year]{.mark}
[period]{.mark}]{.underline}.51 Although this is sometimes possible (eg
Google) it is often not. And surely, in the case of an emerging sector
like biotech or green tech today, where the underlying knowledge base is
still in its early exploratory phase, such a short term bias is damaging
to the scientific exploration process, which requires longer time
horizons and more willingness to risk failure. The role of US venture
capital that worked was to provide not only committed finance, but also
managerial expertise and ensure the building of a viable organisation.52
The problem has been not only the lack of venture capital investment in
the most needed early seed stage, but also its objectives in the
process. This has been [strongly evidenced in the biotech industry where
an increasing number of researchers have criticised the model of venture
capital in science, indicating that significant investor [speculation
has]{.mark} a [detrimental effect on]{.mark} the underlying
[innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}.53 [The fact that so many
venture-capital-backed biotech [companies]{.mark} end up [producing
nothing]{.mark}, yet [make millions]{.mark} for the venture capital
firms that sell them on the public market, is highly problematic for the
role of venture capital in the development of science and its effect on
the growth process]{.underline}. [The increased presence of patenting
and venture capital is not the right one for allowing risky and long
term innovations to come about]{.underline}. Pisano in fact claimed that
the stock market was never designed to deal with the governance
challenges of R&D entities.54 Mirowski describes the
venture-capital--biotech model as: commercialized scientific research in
the absence of any product lines, heavily dependent upon early-stage
venture capital and a later IPO launch, deriving from or displacing
academic research, with mergers and acquisitions as the most common
terminal state, pitched to facilitate the outsourcing of R&D from large
corporations bent upon shedding their previous in-house capacity.55 The
problem with the model has been that the 'progressive commercialisation
of science' seems to be unproductive, with few products, and damage to
long-run scientific discoveries and findings over time. Myth-busting 4:
A patent doesn't necessarily mean progress A similar misunderstanding
exists in relation to the role of patents in innovation and economic
growth. For example, [when policy makers look at the number of
patents]{.underline} in the pharmaceutical industry[, they presume it is
one of the most innovative private sectors in the world]{.underline}.
[This [rise in patents does not]{.mark} however [reflect]{.mark} a rise
in [innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but]{.mark} a [change in patent
laws]{.mark} and a rise in the strategic reasons why patents are being
used]{.underline}. This has caused their importance to be greatly hyped
up---mythologised. The exponential rise in patents, and the increasing
lack of relationship this rise has had with actual 'innovation' (eg new
products and processes), has occurred for various reasons. First, the
types of inventions that can be patented has widened to include publicly
funded research, upstream research tools (rather than only final
products and processes) and even 'discoveries' (rather than only
inventions) of existing matter such as genes. The 1980 Bayh-Dole Act,
which allowed publicly funded research to be patented rather than remain
in the public domain, encouraged the emergence of the biotechnology
industry as most of the new biotech companies were new spin-offs from
university labs with heavy state funding. Furthermore, the fact that
venture capital often uses patents to signal which companies to invest
in means that patents have increased in their strategic value to
companies that need to attract financing. All these factors have caused
the number of patents to rise, with most of them being of little worth
(eg very few citations received from other patents) and without
resulting in a high number of innovations, eg new drugs in pharma
(figure 5).

Economists measure productivity by comparing the amount of input into
production with the amount of output that emerges. In this sense the
large [pharmaceutical companies have been fairly
unproductive]{.underline} over the last few years [in the production of
innovations]{.underline}. As figure 5 shows [[there has been an
**exponential rise** in R&D spending]{.mark} by members of
the]{.underline} Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
([PhRMA]{.underline}) [[with **no**]{.mark} corresponding increase in
the number of **[new drugs]{.mark}**,]{.underline} commonly known as new
molecular entities (NMEs). Figure 6 shows that this also holds for
patenting: while the number of patents has skyrocketed since the
Bayh-Dole Act (1980) allowed publicly funded research to be patented,
most of these patents are of little value. When patents are weighted by
the amount of citations they receive (the common indicator of
'important' patents), the figure is relatively flat---there are few
important patents. Between 1993 and 2004, of the 1,072 drugs approved by
the FDA, only 357 were NMEs rather than just variations of existing 'me
too' drugs. The number of important 'priority' new drugs is even more
worrying: only 146 of these had priority rating (NME with P rating). In
figure 7 we see that only 14 per cent were seen as important new drugs.
For the sake of the argument being made in this pamphlet, what is
important is that 75 per cent of the NMEs trace their research not to
private companies but to National Institutes of Health (NIH), publicly
funded labs in the USA or other public labs across the globe, such as
the MRC in the UK. So while the state-funded labs have invested in the
most risky phase, the big pharmaceutical companies have preferred to
invest in the less risky variations of existing drugs (a drug that
simply has a different dosage than a previous version of the same drug).
All a far cry, for example, from the recent quote by UK based
GlaxoSmithKline 76 CEO Andrew Witty: 'The pharmaceutical industry is
hugely innovative\... If governments work to support, not stifle,
innovation, the industry will deliver the next era of revolutionary
medicine**.'** 7 \*\*\*\*CAPTION ENDS Thus directing too much attention
to patents, rather than to specific types of patents, such as those that
have high citations, risks wasting much money (as argued below for the
patent box case). Researchers have argued that many of the recent trends
in patents, such as the increase in upstream patents (eg patenting of
'research tools'), has caused the rate of innovation to fall rather than
increase as it blocks the ability of science to move forwards in an open
exploratory way.56 The effect has been especially deleterious to the
ability of scientists in the developing world to repeat experiments
carried out in the developed world, before undertaking their own
developments on those experiments, thus hurting their ability to 'catch
up'.57 Notwithstanding the fact that most patents are of little value,
and the controversial role that patents play in innovation dynamics, the
UK Government insists that patents have a strong link to ongoing
high-tech R&D and must thus be incentivised in order for the UK to have
innovation-led growth. Thus in October 2010 Osborne announced a patent
box policy, due to begin in 2013, which would reduce the rate of
corporation tax on the income derived from patents (to 10 per cent).
This of course fits with the current government's belief that investment
and innovation can be easily nudged via taxes. The Institute for Fiscal
Studies (IFS) has argued against this policy, claiming that the only
effect it will have is to reduce government tax revenue (by a large
amount) without affecting innovation. It is argued that R&D tax credits
are enough to address the market failure issue around R&D, and that the
patent box policy is instead poorly targeted at research, as the policy
targets the income that results from patented technology, not the
research itself (a similar claim we make around R&D tax credits when
they are not subject to control). A recent report by the IFS claims:
Once a patent is in place, a firm has a monopoly on the use of those
ideas, and so can capture all of the returns and therefore faces the
correct incentives to maximise the related income stream. In addition,
to the extent that a Patent Box reduces the tax rate for activity that
would have occurred in the absence of government intervention, the
policy includes a large deadweight cost.58 Furthermore, the authors
claim that the patent box policy will also add complexity to the tax
system and require expensive policing to ensure that income and costs
are being appropriately assigned to patents. They claim that the great
uncertainty and time lags behind creating patentable technologies will
counteract the incentives, and since international collaborations are
increasingly common, there is no guarantee that the extra research that
is incentivised will be conducted in the UK.59 This chapter shows that
many of [the assumptions that underlie growth policy should not
necessarily be taken for granted]{.underline}. Over the last decade or
so, policy makers searching for proxies for economic growth have
alighted on things they can measure such as R&D spend, patents, venture
capital activity, and the number of small firms that are assumed to be
important for growth. We have attempted to demystify these assumptions
and now turn to the largest myth of all: the limited role for government
in producing entrepreneurship, innovation and growth.

BRUSSELS --- The United States and its European allies on Thursday
commemorated the 75th anniversary of D-Day, which freed the Continent
from tyranny. But at the same time, the two sides are squabbling
bitterly over the future and funding of European defense. Washington has
been pressing the European Union to spend more and do more for its own
defense for well over a decade, with President Trump just the latest and
loudest to do so. Now that the European Union is actually responding,
with a defense fund and a project for military cooperation and
development, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is [criticizing how
it's being **done**]{.mark} and complaining that the moves could [harm
trans-Atlantic cooperation and preven]{.mark}t American [companies from
competing]{.mark} for potentially lucrative contracts]{.underline}. If
anything, the spat is another reminder of the sour state of relations
between the Trump administration and the European bloc and of the
divisions on issues such as trade, climate change and Iran. The fact
that a European plan to increase military spending --- acceding to a
demand from Mr. Trump --- has degenerated into acrimony only emphasizes
the split. European diplomats say the issue recently boiled over at a
private meeting in Washington. A senior American diplomat, Michael J.
Murphy, a top official at the Bureau of Europe and Eurasian Affairs,
lectured European Union ambassadors about the United States' unhappiness
with proposed restrictions on third-country participation in European
Union defense projects. Mr. Murphy warned that [the European initiatives
"[could **undermine** trans-Atlantic security by duplicating **NATO**
efforts]{.mark} and [diverting]{.mark} valuable
**[resources]{.mark}**"]{.underline} and ["[make all of us less
safe,]{.mark} Americans included.]{.underline}" Some countries, he said
in remarks obtained by The Times, "are pursuing an industrial policy
under the veneer of a security policy," with a priority on supporting
national defense industries and trying to cut out participation and
competition by nonbloc countries like Canada, Norway, the United States
--- and importantly, after Brexit, Britain. [European ambassadors who
were there, members of the Political and Security Committee of the
European Union, which deals with the bloc's foreign and defense policy,
said that the atmosphere was tense and that Mr. Murphy's remarks did not
leave time for discussion afterward. The envoys requested anonymity
because they were not authorized to speak publicly about closed-doors
meetings.]{.underline} "It was quite a tough presentation, which took
some of the colleagues by surprise," said one European ambassador who
was there. "The substance was not especially new to us, but we were
surprised by the tone and toughness." There was a similar but less
aggressive meeting at the Pentagon, the diplomats said, and there was
more time there for conversation and discussion. The confrontation is
centered on two new European military spending initiatives. For the
first time, there will be a European Defense Fund, taken from the
European Union budget for research and development, planned with a
relatively modest start of 13 billion euros, or about \$14.6 billion,
over the 2021-27 budget. There is also a program called, in
Brussels-speak, "permanent structured cooperation," or Pesco, in which
25 of the 28 member states agreed to work on cooperative military
projects. Small coalitions of member states are already proposing
projects to build attack helicopters and armored infantry vehicles. But
London and Washington have expressed concern that their defense
contractors will be shut out of such projects, since the program
specifies that third parties may only "exceptionally participate." The
current draft regulations, Mr. Murphy said, "risk delinking the North
American and European defense sectors after decades of hard work to
increase our integration" and "would only help our adversaries and
create a new irritant in trans-Atlantic relations." A number of
Europeans find that language overblown and believe that, seeing as the
Pentagon spends American taxpayer money on mostly American defense
manufacturers, Europe should do the same. [Increased military spending
is a hot-button topic in Europe]{.underline}, especially with a widely
disliked Mr. Trump pushing the issue, and [European politicians need to
show that such spending will produce jobs at home.]{.underline} "The
Trump administration can't have its cake and eat it, too," said Stefano
Stefanini, an Italian former ambassador to NATO and now a consultant in
Brussels with Project Associates, a consulting firm. "If the U.S.
rightly wants the Europeans to spend more for defense, the end must be
more European capability to contribute to common security,'' he added.
''To do so, Europe needs to strengthen its industrial base, and one tool
to do it are the initiatives undertaken by the E.U." A senior State
Department official, explaining the context for Mr. Murphy's remarks,
said that discussions and maneuvering were continuing. But the official,
who requested anonymity to speak publicly about private talks, also
complained that the Europeans had leaked to the news media a May 16
letter to Washington even before the Americans had received it. That
letter was in response to a May 1 letter from two senior Defense and
State Department officials raising concerns about third-party
participation that was sent to the European foreign policy chief,
Federica Mogherini. Officials in Washington also warn of a possible
backlash in Congress if lawmakers deem that the European regulations are
unfair. Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union,
said that deeper integration of military supply chains "is in the
interests of both the U.S. and Europe, because it produces the best
results for trans-Atlantic security.'' ''For this reason,'' he added,
[''we want to avoid a situation where Congress or the administration
could see a need to respond to anything that looks unilateral or
protectionist]{.underline}." For its part, the European Union is
divided. Countries such as Poland and the Baltic States --- Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania --- are more worried about Russia and want to stay
close to Washington. Other countries, such as the Netherlands and
Sweden, are also sympathetic to American concerns and want to avoid a
confrontation. But larger countries with significant defense industries
or ambitions for European strategic autonomy, like France, Italy and
Spain, are taking a tougher line. [[France and Spain]{.mark} have been
[**particularly** firm]{.mark} in trying to [**restrict third-country
participation,** with strict regulations to ban the transfer of
**intellectual property** developed in European]{.mark} defense
projects, including to American companies that have European
subsidiaries]{.underline}. But all the European nations say that Pesco
is intended to coordinate with NATO and to work on projects that fill
alliance shortfalls or gaps, and they deny that the intention is to
delink the European Union from the pact. With 22 of the bloc's 28
members in NATO, European diplomats say, there is no reason for
Washington to fear that an enhanced European defense sector would be
allowed to damage the trans-Atlantic alliance, its military capabilities
or its integration. In a study by Globsec, a security think tank, the
authors, including Mr. Stefanini, concluded that Europeans should spend
the 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense --- as agreed by NATO
--- and move on. "[Europeans need to spend more and better on defense
and security," the report says]{.underline}. "It will only be
sustainable if the European defense industry is a beneficiary and if the
E.U. industrial base is consolidated and strengthened." American
officials point to existing military cooperation, like on the F-35
fighter jet, a helicopter with the Italian firm Leonardo and the
Marines' use of Swedish-made rifles. Both sides argue about how much
money each gives and gets. The Europeans maintain that the American
military-industrial complex is so dominant, and the sums in the European
defense fund so modest, that Washington should relax. Ms. Mogherini
said, "At the moment, the E.U. is actually more open than the U.S.
procurement market is for European Union companies and equipment."
Ursula von der Leyen, the German defense minister, said that the
Europeans "are doing what our American friends have been demanding we do
for years." The regulations on third-party participation in the fund are
essentially done, the Europeans say, though the Americans intend to keep
pressing for changes. The regulations for Pesco are still being debated,
with a decision probably slipping to July. "It's not finished, and it's
up to us to raise these concerns," the senior State Department official
said. "We do support European defense initiatives, the idea that we
don't is simply untrue. [But we have real concerns that [it shouldn't
duplicate **NATO** and should be open to third-party]{.mark}
[states]{.mark} and [not harm the way our **military** industries
already work together]{.mark}."]{.underline}

#### EU intellectual property [protections]{.underline} are [insufficient]{.underline}. 

**Stevens, 22** \[Colin Stevens is the social copy manager for ING,
4/27/22, accessed on 7-18-2022, Eureporter, \"Intellectual property is
not fully protected in the EU\",

Intellectual property rights play a big role in a knowledge-based
economy: they ensure that businesses and designers are able to profit
from their creations. They also provide assurances to consumers in terms
of quality and safety. But in a special report published today, the
European Court of Auditors warns that the [[EU's]{.mark} legal
**framework** for protecting [i]{.mark}ntellectual [p]{.mark}roperty [is
not]{.mark}]{.underline} as **[[effective]{.underline}]{.mark}** as it
could be. Although the framework in place gives some guarantees, [[a
number of **shortcomings**]{.mark} remain, in particular in the EU
**Designs** Directive and the EU **fees** mechanism.]{.underline} The
auditors also highlight that EU and national systems would benefit from
being better aligned. Intellectual property rights (IPR) are crucial to
the EU's global competitiveness. IPR-intensive industries generate
almost half (45 %) of the EU's economic activity, worth €6.6 trillion,
and provide nearly a third (29 %) of total EU employment. [Each year,
counterfeit products are estimated to lead to €83 billion in lost sales
in the legitimate economy.]{.underline} If the problem of counterfeit
products were tackled effectively, the EU economy would gain 400 000
jobs according to a recent estimate of the EU Intellectual Property
Office (EUIPO). Counterfeit products also have considerable safety
risks, as was recently illustrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. For
these reasons, the European Commission, other EU bodies [such as the
EUIPO, and Member State authorities make **considerable** effort to
ensure that intellectual property rights are respected throughout the EU
single market.]{.underline} "Intellectual property rights are vital for
the EU economy: they encourage innovation and investment, and discourage
counterfeiting and its harmful effects", said Ildikó Gáll-Pelcz, the ECA
Member responsible for the audit. "But the current EU framework doesn't
give all intellectual property rights the protection they need. We hope
that our recommendations will help the EU to increase that level of
protection to the level that the single market requires." The auditors
note that legislative and support measures are in place to protect EU
trademarks. But at the same time, they point out shortcomings in the EU
Designs Directive, which should have equal effect throughout the EU. As
it stands, [the EU's [regulatory framework]{.mark} for designs [is
**incomplete** and **outdated**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a result,
national and [EU [systems are not **aligned**]{.mark}, allowing
divergent practices between Member States during the [**application**,
**examination**, publication and registration processes]{.mark}, leading
to [legal **uncertainty**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In addition,
the auditors draw attention to the lack of an EU-wide protection regime
for all products. [The EU's geographical indication **framework** does
not concern non-agricultural products, such as crafts and industrial
designs, although some Member States have legislation in place to
protect them.]{.underline} The auditors also question the [EU's fees
mechanism,]{.underline} observing significant [disparities between EU
fees and those charged by the national authorities]{.underline}. They
found that the [[EU's **intellectual** propert]{.mark}y rights
[fees]{.mark} structure [do]{.mark}es [not **reflect** real
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}. While criteria exist for fixing fees at EU
level, the auditors consider that there is no clear method for
determining their structure and amount, resulting in an excessive level
of fees that produces accumulated surpluses (over €300 million in
EUIPO's 2020 accounts). The auditors highlight that this is contrary to
the principle of a balanced budget stipulated in EU law. Although an EU
intellectual property rights enforcement framework is in place and
generally works well, the auditors highlight some shortcomings in its
implementation. In particular, the Intellectual Property Rights
Enforcement Directive is not uniformly applied throughout the EU, so it
fails to ensure a consistently high level of intellectual property
protection in the internal market. Weaknesses and inconsistencies in
customs controls in the Member States also adversely affect enforcement
and the fight against counterfeits. The protection of intellectual
property rights in the EU therefore varies according to the place of
importation. The auditors also note that different practices exist
within the [EU for destroying counterfeit goods, which may lead
counterfeiters to import their **wares** into the [EU in places with
less stringent controls and sanctions]{.mark}, the auditors
warn.]{.underline} Background information The EU regulatory framework
for intellectual property rights is based on EU regulations, directives
and existing international intellectual property agreements. It is aimed
at providing protection in all EU Member States by creating a single EU
system consisting of EU and national intellectual property rights.
Special report 06/2022, "EU intellectual property rights -- Protection
not fully waterproof", is available on the ECA website (eca.europa.eu).
In 2019, the ECA also published an Opinion concerning the proposed
financial regulation of the EUIPO's budget committee in which it called
for a productive use of surplus money. The ECA presents its special
reports to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, as well as
to other interested parties such as national parliaments, industry
stakeholders and representatives of civil society. The vast majority of
the recommendations made in the reports are put into practice.

The products of the human intellect that comprise the subject matter of
intellectual property are typically characterized as non-rivalrous
public goods. Essentially, this means that the same product may be used
simultaneously by more than one person without diminishing the
availability of that product for use by others. The law of intellectual
property can be seen as analogous to the law of tangible property in
that both consist of a bundle of rights conferred upon the property
owner. However, the law of intellectual property is separate and
distinct from the law of tangible property. Where the right of exclusive
possession is at the core of the bundle of rights protecting real and
personal property, land and chattels, the same can not be said of
intellectual property. The law of intellectual property is commonly
understood as providing an incentive to authors and inventors to produce
works for the benefit of the public by regulating the public\'s use of
such works in order to ensure that authors and inventors are compensated
for their efforts. Congress derives [its power to regulate patents and
copyrights from the \"intellectual property clause\" of the
Constitution. See U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8. Congress\'
[power to regulate trademarks]{.mark} is [constitutionally grounded in
the Commerce Clause]{.mark}. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO)
is responsible for issuing and monitoring federally registered patents
and trademarks]{.underline}. [Although [patents are exclusively governed
by federal law]{.mark}]{.underline}, trademarks may also be regulated by
State law. Copyrights are exclusively regulated by federal law and must
be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office to be enforceable. Trade
secrets are primarily regulated at the State level, and are

[The world has changed dramatically since the European Commission issued
its January report on the global challenges of protecting intellectual
property.]{.underline} But it appeared to be business as usual for those
on both sides of the law when it came to the barbed conclusions of a
survey, which presented a litany of bad practice among many countries
outside the trading bloc. [The biennial report in effect delivers a
[scorecard]{.mark} on a list of the EU's trading partners and how well
or [**badly** they are enforcing IP **protection**]{.mark} in their
jurisdictions.]{.underline} In this year's report, China again ranks as
Europe's "priority 1" worst offender, thanks to the scale and
persistence of its policies, practices and negligence, which all thwart
EU trademark and patent owners' goals. China and its territory Hong Kong
deliver more than 80 per cent of the counterfeit and pirated goods
seized by EU customs authorities, according to the report. It also
grants dubious patents, allows courts to invalidate patents of foreign
companies and encourages "patent thickets", dense groups of IP rights in
certain fields, which hinder the task of patenting genuine innovation.
In this environment, "Chinese companies widely use these technologies
without paying adequate royalties," the report states. [Investors do not
become aware of such problems until they [confront]{.mark} them [on a
case-by-case]{.mark} basis]{.underline} While China had made some
progress in improving protection of intellectual property rights,
"serious concerns remain about the quality of granted invention
patents", in a country where patent applications are "growing
exponentially", the report adds. The scale of China's trading
relationship with European countries makes it a particular cause for
concern. [But aside from the detailed listing of China's failures in the
update, [other countries also face criticism for widespread dereliction
in upholding IP rights]{.mark}.]{.underline} India, Indonesia, Russia,
[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark} and Ukraine are listed as ["priority 2"
countries where "serious systemic [problems" in IP protection and
enforcement]{.mark} in these countries are "[causing **significant**
harm]{.mark} to EU businesses]{.underline}". [[Little or no progress has
been made in addressing these **concerns** since the last report, it
says.]{.underline}]{.mark} Nigeria and Saudi Arabia have been added to
the list of "priority 3" countries --- alongside Argentina, Brazil,
Ecuador, Malaysia and Thailand --- hurting European interests, though
the scale of damage emanating from these countries is less than that
caused by China and priority 2 states. The commission's findings in part
mirror the conclusions of other monitoring bodies such as the US Patent
and Trademark Office, according to IP lawyers. The detailing of failures
by China and other emerging economies in IP protection coincides with
much broader clashes between the US and Beijing over their trading
relationship. "I do think this is not something to be viewed in
isolation, but really as part of a global trend towards the
identification of IP rights as an important part of policy and trade,"
says Arthur Artinian, a partner in the London office of K&L Gates. The
report's data is "important for people looking to do business and to
expand their footprint, to understand, you know, the state of play", he
says. "[It's quite difficult to get this type of information and data in
isolation, so having it done in this more structured way, both from the
EU side and the US side is quite helpful,"]{.underline} he adds.

[We]{.mark} absolutely [need to be teaching **copyright**
issues]{.mark}]{.underline} as an integral part of all composition
courses, but particularly in first-year composition. I agree with Ashley
Hall, Kathie Gossett, and Elizabeth Vincelette that our focus as
instructors should not be "lament\[ing\] \... the immoral and
unconscionable actions of our students." Rather, our focus should be [on
teaching the [**ethics** and **politics**]{.mark} of copyright and on
[teaching students to be **advocates** of f]{.mark}air use as well as of
[copyright]{.mark}. So, we all agree, we should be teaching students
about **intellectual property.**]{.underline} The tougher question,
though, is the how question: How should we teach intellectual property
and fair use accurately, responsibly, effectively? Thus far, we
composition teachers haven't done a very good job teaching copyright
accurately. Both Janice Walker and Steve Westbrook point out that many
textbooks and style guides in our field still misrepresent copyright
issues and/or do an inadequate job of explaining their intricacies and
nuances (e.g., Walker's discussion of the 2009 MLA Handbook). TyAnna
Herrington [says that "[misperceptions and **inaccuracies**]{.mark}
regarding [i]{.mark}ntellectual [p]{.mark}roperty [law are both
extreme]{.mark} and **ubiquitous** [in this age of digital
**communication**]{.mark}."]{.underline} Alas, especially among
composition teachers, it seems. Westbrook points to some confusions in
our composition textbooks---including in some big-name, big-selling
textbooks; textbooks often do not acknowledge that "the conditions for
determining fair use are independent of documentation." [This is a key
distinction, and one that our field has not fully addressed. Citing the
authors of a work may satisfy the conditions for academic integrity, but
that is not the same as satisfying the conditions for fair
use.]{.underline} Westbrook suggests that composition teachers
themselves need to understand these realms better than they do.
Sometimes when we teach intellectual property and fair use, we slip into
fallacies of oversimplification. One fallacy that Westbrook discusses
errs on the side of excessive liberty---that is, the assumption that
merely citing your sources is good enough. That fallacy confuses the
realm of academic integrity and citation practices with the realm of
copyright. But another fallacy exists in excessive constraint: The
guideline that insists we should "always ask permission" is bad advice,
too. As Westbrook says[, "[it **oversimplifies** the complexity]{.mark}"
of how **fair use** operates and has the secondary effect of
"[**obfuscat**\[ing\]]{.mark} or even eras\[ing\] [the **concept of fair
use**]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark} "Always ask permission" is a bad
guideline because it contributes to the erosion of the Fair Use
doctrine---and this also can impede our First Amendment rights as well.
[Powerful interests have used the threat of copyright infringement as a
way to block the exercise of free speech, as both Herrington and
Westbrook discuss. Westbrook cites the example of how Diebold used the
threat of copyright infringement to stifle journalistic information
about the unreliability of Diebold voting machines]{.underline}. This is
a great example, first, because it highlights the importance of
protecting the Fair Use provision of U.S. Copyright Law as integral to
First Amendment rights, but also because Judge Fogel's decision in the
case (Online Policy Group v. Diebold, Inc., 2004) [models the kind of
step-by-step reasoning that is fundamental for writers making a fair use
determination. As Westbrook says, it is that form of reasoning and
analysis [we should be teaching in composition.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Liberal Property Rights Good

#### Liberal norms and institutions can be turned [against]{.underline} the violence of white property relations [despite]{.underline} their repressive history. Rejecting them wholesale [dooms]{.underline} radical social change.

**McCann and Lovell, 18**---Gordon Hirabayashi Professor for the
Advancement of Citizenship at the University of Washington AND professor
of political science, department chair, and the Harry Bridges Endowed
Chair in Labor Studies at the University of Washington (Michael and
George, "Toward a Radical Politics of Rights: Lessons about Legal
Leveraging and Its Limitations," *From the Streets to the State:
Changing the World by Taking Power*, Chapter 7, 139-141, dml)

[In]{.underline} our [aspirations for progressive change]{.underline},
[engaging with the law is **not a free choice** among
tactics]{.underline}. [It is a **necessity**]{.underline}. Egalitarian
[[activists are]{.mark} **routinely [forced]{.mark}** [into legal
engagement by the **omnipresence** of law]{.mark} as a **violent force**
imposing hierarchical order and]{.underline} harsh [punitive
constraints]{.underline} on oppressed populations. Although activists
are often motivated by the quest for legal recognition of rights claims,
[offensively mobilizing law to support egalitarian struggles is only a
**small part**]{.underline} of movement appeals to law. [Defensive
actions to **evade** law's repressive force or to **protect** previous
gains are often **much more significant**]{.underline}. In our view,
there is surprisingly little rigorous theorizing about the different
types of struggles on the terrain of law, the most useful indicators of
effective legal action, and especially the measures of egalitarian or
inclusionary change.1

[Law is an **enduring site** for progressive democratic
contestation]{.underline}. [[Although]{.underline}]{.mark} official law
is [[**often** a tool of **repression**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[legal
norms and institutions can **also** be resources for]{.mark}
**egalitarian rights claims**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, at
certain historical moments, [even **[social
transformation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [No matter how radical
one's]{.underline} political [aspirations]{.underline}, [the
**necessarily [long-run]{.mark} character** of [revolutionary]{.mark}
social [transformation **requires**]{.mark} a series of **[intermediate
steps]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[including]{.underline}** those [[on the
**terrain of law**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the British socialist E. P.
Thompson (1975) asserts,

Most \[people\] have a strong sense of justice, at least with regard to
their own interests. [[If the law is evidently]{.mark} partial and
[unjust]{.mark}]{.underline}, [then [it will]{.mark} **mask**
nothing]{.underline}, [**legitimize** nothing]{.underline},
[[**contribute** nothing to]{.mark} **any** class's
[hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}. The essential precondition for the
effectiveness of [[law]{.underline}]{.mark}, in its function as
ideology, [is]{.underline} that it shall display an independence from
gross manipulation and shall seem to be just. . . . The rhetoric and the
rules of a society are something [a **great deal more than
sham**]{.underline}. In the same moment they may modify, in profound
ways, the behavior of the powerful, and mystify the powerless. [They
[may **disguise**]{.mark} the true realities of
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[at the same
time]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [they [may **curb** that]{.mark} power [and
**check** its intrusions]{.mark}]{.underline}. . . . And [it is often
from **within**]{.underline} that very rhetoric [that]{.underline} a
**[radical critique]{.underline}** of the practice of the society [is
developed]{.underline}. (436--39)

In this chapter, we describe legal mobilization as the articulation of a
social interest, general policy, or a societal vision in terms of legal
entitlement. As Frances Kahn Zemans (1983) famously put it, legal
mobilization entails that "a desire or want . . . is translated into a
demand as an assertion of one's rights" (3). [Since legal language is
**indeterminate** and **polyvalent**]{.underline}, [it is
**contestable**]{.underline}. [Dominant legal norms are **incomplete**
and **rife with tensions**]{.underline}, [and they **adapt** as
the]{.underline} perceived [interests of dominant groups respond
to]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} occasionally [converge
with]{.underline}, [the demands of oppressed groups]{.underline} (Bell
1980). Although much legal contestation occurs between recognized
rights-bearing subjects over the authoritative meaning of clashing
liberal legal principles, [[legal mobilization]{.mark} also [involves
oppressed groups **mobilizing liberal principles** against
**illiberal**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[repressive]{.mark} modes** of
social [control]{.mark}]{.underline}. These [contests over]{.underline}
ascribed race, gender, sexual, immigrant, and other [marginalized
identities often **expand** the rule of liberal legalism]{.underline}
(Smith 1997; Orren 1992). More importantly, [struggles by progressive
[activists can use the **liberal principle**]{.mark} of equal
citizenship [to **counter**]{.mark} **the [property- and
contract-based]{.mark} principles of [capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline},
thereby [[**challenging** unequal]{.mark} resource [distribution
and]{.mark} class [exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Brown 2003; Smith
1997). As Stuart Scheingold (1974) argues, "**[law cuts both
ways]{.underline}**," [both for and against]{.underline} egalitarian
[social justice]{.underline} (91; see also McCann 1994).

When, how, and [to what degree legal discourse and institutions provide
resources for oppressed groups **depends**]{.underline} largely [on the
**mix of legal**]{.underline} and especially extralegal [**factors** in
a given]{.underline} historical [context]{.underline}. Our research
devotes considerable attention to the changing features of the cultural
and institutional terrain that delimit the possibilities and forms of
contestation within and against law. Of course, [fighting for control of
legal institutions and principles **does not guarantee** radical social
change]{.underline}. [But [succumbing to anti-legalism **cedes
control**]{.mark} [over]{.mark} the terms of **institutional
[organization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[instrumental
[rule]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[and]{.mark} **regime
[legitimation]{.mark}** [to dominant forces]{.mark} propelling
capitalism and other hierarchies]{.underline}.

We recognize that our approach is at odds with some important recent
movements and their interpreters. Arguably, the Occupy movements in and
beyond the United States expressed a notable disdain for legal rights
claiming, litigation strategies, and general appeals to legal strategies
(Almog and Barzilai 2014). This disenchantment with law, legal
processes, and lawyers is understandable in the post-civil rights era
and the immediate post-recession moment. Indeed, [wariness about law is
always sound]{.underline}. Moreover, Occupy did profoundly reorient the
dominant agenda in many parts of the global North. It put "deficit and
debt hawks" on the defense and elevated concerns about economic fairness
and the political accountability of private financial managers. [At the
same time]{.underline}, Occupy espoused and enacted little in the way of
institutional changes within government and capitalist society. By
[**shedding any reliance** on discourses of rights]{.underline}, Occupy
arguably **[limited]{.underline}** its [use of **important ideological
resources**]{.underline} in the neoliberal context (Brown 2003; Obando
2014).

It is noteworthy that [many movements]{.underline} inspired by the
Occupy movement--- especially among low-wage workers and advocates for
corporate accountability--- [have **recovered** and **prominently
invoked** rights claims and legal resources]{.underline}. Indeed,
[[there has been a]{.mark} recent [**convergence** around
rights]{.mark}-based [claims by campaigns for a **minimum wage** and
**sick pay**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for [[**immigrant rights** and
**support**]{.underline}]{.mark}, for **[[LBGTQ
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for the **[[B]{.underline}]{.mark}**lack
**[[L]{.underline}]{.mark}**ives **[[M]{.underline}]{.mark}**atter
movement, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} for [[other]{.mark} progressive and
radical [causes]{.mark}]{.underline} in the United States. [Their
[reliance on]{.mark} lawyers and [litigation has **varied**]{.mark}
**widely**]{.underline}, [[but **none**]{.mark} of these movements
[**discount** them]{.mark}]{.underline} as much as did the earlier
Occupy movement. Furthermore, [many grassroots [struggles]{.mark} in
both the **global North** and **South**]{.underline}---[[against
**apartheid**]{.underline}]{.mark}; [[for **indigenous**]{.mark}
**people's [sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline}; for socioeconomic
entitlements to **[[housing]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[health-care]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[education]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.mark} **minimum
[income]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[also [appeal to

#### Liberal international law and sovereignty [reduce international violence]{.underline}.

**Gill-Tiney, 22**---Lecturer, Department of Politics and International
Relations, University of Oxford (Patrick, "A Liberal Peace?: The Growth
of Liberal Norms and the Decline of Interstate Violence," Journal of
Conflict Resolution, 2022, Vol. 66(3), 413--442, dml)

This article shows that [[liberal]{.mark} interpretations of
**[sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which [emphasize]{.mark}
**[i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[interdependence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[free
[trade]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[democracy]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**individual [rights]{.mark}** and **freedoms**]{.underline}, [have
become **increasingly prevalent**]{.underline} in UN Security Council
resolutions since 1970. Given that two non-western states, Russia/Soviet
Union and China, are permanent members, I argue that the content of
these resolutions reflects broad consensus between major powers---both
western and non-western---as how these norms should be interpreted. This
is not the same as arguing that these states share preferences or
interests, rather, substantial differences remain, largely along the
cleavage between the United States, Britain and France on the one hand
and China and Russia on the other (Einsiedel and Malone 2018, 156-58).1
Yet, the collective positions of these states have evolved over time,
suggesting a shift in how sovereignty is understood. The dominant role
that these states have in shaping the international order means that
[their collective understandings may be taken as representative of the
**normative structure** of international society at any point in
time]{.underline}, [with the expectation that this impacts **all**
states in the system]{.underline}.2

I argue that [[as liberal]{.mark} interpretations of these fundamental
[norms **increase**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the **likelihood
of**]{.underline}]{.mark} a dispute participant resorting to
**[[violence decreases]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Through content analysis
of all UN Security Council resolutions between 1970 and 2014 I first
create a measure of the strength of liberal interpretations of
sovereignty. This is then utilized in quantitative analysis of dispute
participants in the period to explain the variation in the level of
violence employed. [I find **statistical** and **substantive support**
for my theory]{.underline}, [showing **[empirically]{.mark}** that [the
growth]{.mark} in liberal norm interpretations [is **negatively
associated**]{.mark} with the likelihood of]{.underline} a state
resorting to [violence]{.underline} in an interstate dispute.

[This is [not]{.mark} to argue [that structural]{.mark}
[arg]{.mark}ument[s]{.mark} [are **wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}, far
from it, [nor is it to **reject** the roles of conventional and nuclear
capabilities]{.underline} in shaping interstate conflict behavior.
[[Rather]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[state power does
matter]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that is why the collective
interpretations of the permanent members of the UN Security Council are
used to understand the system. Domestic veto players, intergovernmental
enforcement mechanisms, and trade dependency all do shape the responses
of policymakers during an interstate dispute. However, [the
**intersubjective ideas** they carry with them into disputes
are]{.underline} also [**crucial** to understand why some disputes
**escalate**]{.underline}, [and others do **not**]{.underline}.

This article contributes to our understanding of the role that ideas
have in shaping interstate conflict in two ways. Firstly, I contribute
to the large literature which has sought to understand the role which
norms play in selecting for certain behaviors over others. Most of the
work within this area has been qualitative and has either charted the
development of specific bundles of norms over long periods (Keene 2012,
2013; Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999; Sandholtz 2007) or focused on the
life-cycle of specific norms (Eckstein 1988; Finnemore 2000; Finnemore
and Sikkink 1998; Krook and True 2012; Nadelmann 1990; Sandholtz 2007;
Sandholtz and Stiles 2008). I build upon these insights by arguing that
the norm of sovereignty has been re-interpreted over time, and that the
collective nature of reinterpretation means that it can be used to
examine its impact in interstate conflict.

Secondly, this article provides an innovative means of exploring ideas
in a quantitative framework. The quantitative interstate conflict
literature has heavily favored structural and power-based explanations
for actor behavior. This has come at the particular expense of norms.
Whilst there is widespread acceptance that norms matter amongst these
scholars, they have tended to set aside norm-based explanations given
the difficulty of objective measurement. This difficulty revolves around
the problem of having surety that multiple actors share an idea, that
is, intersubjective understanding. The most obvious sources of data to
assess this would be a survey of policymakers or the content of
international legal documents. This first avenue is incredibly difficult
to gain anything but anecdotal responses too. Policymakers are hard to
get access to and may misrepresent their own thoughts and actions to
show themselves in as best light as possible. Ensuring that any
respondents have understood the survey in the same way is difficult
given language differences, whilst response rates are likely to be so
low as to prevent a non-random sample from being acquired, even if the
potential pool of relevant participants is widened to include all senior
politicians and bureaucrats, both incumbent and preceding.

Some of these problems are resolved by utilizing the texts of
international legal documents. Given that these are generally carefully
and cautiously written the researcher is more certain that the drafters
actually share an understanding of the topic. Recent work by Allee and
co-authors (Allee, Elsig, and Lugg 2017; Allee and Lugg 2016) have
innovatively utilized content analysis of interstate trade deals to
explore how much is replicated in subsequent deals, which sheds light on
the relative power of the participants. This has certainly gained deeper
understanding of the topic, but is not a suitable approach for this
research questions for two reasons. Firstly, these deals are generally
drafted by small numbers of states, that is, they may not be assumed to
represent the preferences and interests of nonparties. Secondly, whilst
interpretations are spelled out, these may be mechanistic rather than
ideational, making it unclear what the broader normative position may
be. This is made more acute by the drafting being down by bureaucrats
and lawyers rather than policymakers themselves. Whilst some direction
is no-doubt given by the latter, assuming a high level is problematic.
Utilizing the content of UN Security Council resolutions addresses these
problems because the documents may be assumed to be political, that is,
though member states are represented by ambassadors, a high-level of
involvement by their state governments is typical given the importance
attached to security issues. Moreover, since the permanent membership is
diverse in interests and preferences, and these members can veto
unpalatable resolutions, they may be reasonably assumed to provide
insight into intersubjective understandings.

Existing Explanations of Interstate Conflict and the Role of Norms

Two existing literatures are built on here, firstly, the broad
democratic peace literature, including its offshoots and opponents, and
secondly, scholarship on the evolution of international norms. The
former literature initially focused upon regime type, and over time has
been widened to include more fine-grained analyses of domestic political
structures in any state (Bell and Quek 2018; Fearon 1994; Gries et al.
2020; Huth and Allee 2002; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020; Weeks 2012;
Weiss 2013; Weiss and Dafoe 2019). However, the approach in all of these
works is to examine structures, that is, formal institutional
constraints encountered by decision makers, rather than norms, that is,
the role of shared principles, perceptions and expectations of behavior.
The distinction between norms and structure is not rigid. This is most
clearly seen in the term "institution" which is commonly used to mean
both formal structures which limit the agency of decision makers, but
also a set of norms, rules, and practices which govern a specific area.
To clarify the distinction being made in this article, I adapt the
nomenclature used by Reus-Smit (1999) who distinguishes between
constitutional institutions, norms without which a society of states
could not exist, and fundamental institutions, which facilitate
cooperation. The former includes sovereignty, as well as the rights of
self-determination and nonintervention, and the latter contractual
international law and the organizations which enforce it (both internal
and external to states). In this article, I term the former "norms" and
the latter "structures."

The democratic peace literature has spurred several offshoots, the most
relevant of which are those which have argued that rather than regime
type the "peace" is generated by economic factors including trade
interdependency and level of development (Gartzke 2007; Hegre 2000; Kim
2014; Kinne 2012; McDonald 2009, 2010; Mousseau 2013; Schneider and
Gleditsch 2010) or shared intergovernmental organization membership
(Appel 2018; Kinne 2013a, 2013b; Prorok and Appel 2014). More general
critiques have argued that any effect seen is due to the prior
settlement of territorial disputes (Gibler 2012; Gibler and Tir 2014;
Owsiak 2012), nuclear weapons (Waltz 1990), alliances (Kydd 2005),
unipolarity (Monteiro 2014) or military power (Layne 1994; Rosato 2003)
instead. With the exception of the latter critiques, this debate has
broadly accepted the importance of norms (Doyle 1986; Moravcsik 1997;
Owen 1994; Russett and Oneal 2001), especially as the "good" functioning
of domestic and international structures, particularly veto players,
requires political actors to have the right norms.

This relationship between norms and structures has been more closely
addressed through the focus on contracts, that is, to hone in on
specific economic norms and structures characterized as allowing an
economic market to function "with extensive and regularized transactions
among strangers that require an element of trust" (Mousseau and Xiongwei
2018, sec. Emergence Contractualist Peace). This literature argues that
the relationship between peace and democracy is spurious, and rather,
that both are explained by "contracturalist" norms and structures (Gelpi
and Grieco 2008; Mousseau, Hegre, and O'Neal 2003), which builds upon
the work of (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Dahl 1997; North, Wallis, and
Weingast 2009). Yet, the literature still relies upon
operationalizations which are essentially structural, that is, whilst
recognizing the importance of norms, the empirical testing has fallen
short.

A comparatively small subset of the literature has examined norms as an
explanation for the democratic peace. For Deutsch (1957), though NATO is
understood as a structure, a security community is more crucially formed
around shared values (norms). Kahl argues that the basis of the
democratic peace is collective identity rooted in liberal democracy
interlinked by intergovernmental organizations (1998). For Risse, the
influence of NATO allies upon the foreign policy of the United States
demonstrates the importance of liberal norms, through a mechanism which
relies upon the similarity of domestic political institutions in these
liberal democracies and coalition-building (1995). Though valuable
additions to the literature, and in Deutsch's case systematic in its
treatment of the subject, these works fail to tackle the question of
whether the democratic peace is structural or norm based since the two
are entwined throughout. The difficulty in conceptualizing, isolating
and operationalizing norms is a clear problem. Broadly, it is hard to
isolate a norm from either the structure in which it exists or from
other norms for analysis. It is also a challenge to show that any norm
is truly intersubjective in understanding or to measure its effect upon
some outcome of interest. Yet, without attempts to do so we are left
with a partial picture, particularly for those emphasizing the
importance of structures---be these domestic or international---for
reducing interstate conflict. In short, the existence of a domestic
legislature, independent judiciary, or interstate treaties, is only
relevant if the individuals which employ them do so appropriately. To
understand this necessitates exploring the ideas in the heads of these
individuals, and particularly, how these ideas are shared.

In contrast to the large, predominantly quantitative, literature which
has examined the democratic peace and wider questions linking regime
type to the onset, conduct and termination of interstate disputes and
wars, the broader literature on interstate norms has tended to be
qualitative and highly focused. This has resulted in detailed work on
human rights (Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999), humanitarian intervention
(Wheeler 2000), and nuclear weapons (Rublee and Cohen 2018; Tannenwald
1999). There is no doubt that this has contributed to our understanding
of interstate relations, yet the clear shortcoming is generalizability.
That is, the specificity of these approaches, necessary to make any form
of causal claim, is in a sense also the undoing.

In this article I focus on the reinterpretation of the sovereignty norm
by powerful states. I argue that they have a dominant role in shaping
the normative landscape of the international system by being tasked with
the interpretation of norms and the maintenance of international society
(Hurrell 2007; Wight 1978; Saunders 2006). Operationalizing this, I
utilize UN Security Council resolutions as a means of assessing what the
consensus position of the permanent members is. Content analysis is used
to examine the normative framing of resolutions, allowing both an
exploration of change over time, and quantitative measures of the
relative strength of these ideas to be derived which can then be used in
regression analysis.

The Constraining Effect of Liberal Interpretations of Sovereignty

Norms are dynamic, and undergo processes of evolution, creation and
destruction. Change may occur gradually as actors shift their
understandings towards an alternative, or suddenly through systemic, and
thereby social, change. In international relations, the latter is
tightly linked to sudden shifts in great power authority, which has
typically occurred due to defeat and a subsequent realignment of
international order. War, and its aftermath, can lead to substantial
rearrangements of international order, meaning both a new distribution
of power, but also a re-interpretation of international society. In
examining change in understandings of sovereignty I term gradual change
"evolution" and sudden change "tectonic."

Interpretations of Sovereignty

The post-World War Two era allows examination of both evolutionary and
tectonic change in understandings of sovereignty. Evolution occurs
during relative peace, whilst tectonic change is part of major
realignments of international order. The end of the Cold War, though
non-violent certainly led to significant power shifts, resulting in a
tectonic change. The pre- and post-Cold War eras are eras of evolution.
Assessing rivalrous interpretation of norms is crucial to understanding
these changes. I outline a divergence between traditional and liberal
interpretations which are used to examine change in norms, and the
effect upon international conflict.

Over the post-World War Two period two interpretations of sovereignty
have existed, firstly, that emphasizing territorial sovereignty and
non-interference in the domestic affairs of others, and secondly, that
emphasizing international law, interdependence, free trade, democracy
and individual rights and freedoms in international affairs. I term the
former approach to sovereignty "traditional," and the latter "liberal."
A liberal interpretation of sovereignty, therefore, is one which places
emphasis upon the actions of states, particularly those between a
government and its citizens. Sovereignty in this understanding implies
not only the exercise of power over a territory and people (as in the
traditional understanding), but also that there are limits to the
exercise of power and duties to a people (Sandholtz and Stiles 2008,
287-88).3 This has been most clearly stated in the Responsibility to
Protect doctrine. I examine the relative balance between these two
interpretations over time, arguing that this balance alters how
sovereignty is understood, and thereby is related to the likelihood of
escalation in interstate disputes.

My expectation is that the relative balance between these two modes of
interpretation has shifted over the post-World War Two period to favor a
liberal interpretation. This does not mean that traditional
interpretations are irrelevant, rather, that they have been
de-emphasized in international discourse relative to the latter. A
spectrum in which purely traditional and purely liberal interpretations
mark the poles is conceived of as existing, with great powers occupying
positions between the two. The effect that this shift toward a liberal
interpretation of sovereignty has occurred on international conflict
escalation is now examined.

Understandings of Sovereignty and Conflict Escalation

How understandings of sovereignty impact international disputes may be
explored in terms of the conflict life-cycle, that is, why a dispute
emerges, why violent conflict breaks out, and how the conflict ends, or
in terms of participant conduct during war. Here, I examine the effect
of change in the collective understanding of sovereignty upon
escalation, meaning that I assume the prior existence of international
disputes. Whilst the effect of norms upon the onset of disputes is an
important question, very few disputes result in the use of violence,
that is, though onset is a necessary condition for violence, it is far
from sufficient. I examine escalation from a nonviolent dispute to a
violent dispute---the use of armed force in international
relations---because this is of greater substantive significance to state
leaders and their citizens. Moreover, whilst reducing the likelihood of
dispute onset would likely result in less international violence, [the
more normatively important question is how to avoid
**escalation**]{.underline}, [as this **reduces the costs** of
war]{.underline}: human death and economic destruction.

This is not to trivialize dispute onset, and logically we might expect
the growth of liberal understandings of sovereignty to also reduce onset
rates as well as escalation likelihood. However, there are two reasons
why we may doubt the substantive significance of this, firstly, dispute
onset is a relatively low threshold, and secondly, onset is often
triggered by events beyond the direct control of a state. To this first
point, a dispute simply means that two or more actors disagree over
something, oftentimes the behavior of the other side or the distribution
of some good (for instance, territory). This article utilizes
Militarized Interstate Disputes as the operationalization of dispute,
and many disputes are comparatively minor events, with the threshold
being that one of the two parties has a minimum level of militarization
as part of the dispute (for example, the issuance of a deterrent, or
compellent, threat). A focus on onset, therefore, would prevent
observation of substantively more important actions, that is, the actual
use of force against another. Secondly, many disputes begin due to
accident and/or the decision making of low-level military commanders or
political officials who are neither in the position to consider national
interests nor strategic interactions. This means that onset may
essentially be an apolitical decision which takes little or no account
of the broader strategic landscape nor the structural and normative
context. It is after onset, that is, when escalation is considered by
policymakers, that the stakes are higher and when causal mechanisms
common to this topic are most active.

[Escalation]{.underline} then, [is a **political**
decision]{.underline}. In making the choice to escalate, or not,
[policymakers are]{.underline} impacted by a range of strategic factors,
but crucially, are also [constrained by **norms**]{.underline}. [The
[use of force]{.mark} in international relations [must be
**justified**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and since 1945 the UN Charter
specifies just two: self-defense and collective peace enforcement. To
this, we might also add humanitarian intervention, though this remains
contested. As a baseline, therefore, when faced with dispute onset,
policymakers must justify their actions with reference to one of these
reasons. Moreover, [[in making the **decision to
escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[policymakers are]{.mark} also
**[constrained by liberal values]{.mark}** which emphasize
diplomacy]{.underline}, [cooperation]{.underline}, [international
law]{.underline}, [international organizations]{.underline}, [the rights
of the individual]{.underline}, [and to question the legitimacy of the
march to war]{.underline}. Taken [together]{.underline}, [[this **slows
the decision to escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[since legal
justification is **needed**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[diplomacy is
**necessary**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and potential]{.mark} economic and
human costs **[understood]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**calculated** and
**defended**]{.underline}. [A shift toward liberal interpretations
thereby means a **reduced probability of escalation** to
violence]{.underline}, tacitly assuming that the risk of a dispute
arising in the first-place is unchanged. This leads me to my first
hypothesis, which relates to the evolution mechanism of change:

Hypothesis 1: [Given an international dispute]{.underline}, [the risk of
escalation **decreases** as liberal interpretations
**increase**]{.underline}.

An alternative explanation is that any impact of normative change is
actually a result of the end of the Cold War, that is, the
redistribution of power between great powers, typically resulting from
system-wide conflict results in qualitative differences in
interpretations of fundamental norms between peace-periods. Whilst the
end of the Cold War did not involve a system-wide war, it did mark the
end of sustained rivalry between great powers. The pre- and post-
periods can thereby be compared. Given the rivalry of the United States
and Soviet Union during the Cold War, and the relative dominance of the
United States post-Cold War, we might expect qualitative differences in
conflict behavior to be observable in the two time periods,
attributable, perhaps, to a greater emphasis upon liberal
interpretations in the post-Cold War era. The dramatic change in the
distribution of power triggered a significant change in the consensus
surrounding interpretation of fundamental norms of international
society. This leads me to my second hypothesis, which captures the
tectonic change mechanism:

Hypothesis 2: [The risk of dispute escalation decreases given a systemic
increase in **liberal interpretations of sovereignty**]{.underline}
attributable to the end of the Cold War.

Method

I use multiple logistic regression to estimate the effect of change in
the normative landscape on the use of force by dispute participants. To
address the underlying selection problem, that is, that dispute onset is
non-random, I also estimate maximum likelihood and twostep Heckman
selection models. Substantive significance from the logistic regression
is then explored utilizing the observed values for predicted
probabilities approach (Hanmer and Ozan Kalkan 2013). Standard errors
are robust and clustered by year, where model specification allows (that
is, not in the Heckman twostep model). This is to take account of the
data structure since years differ by the number of Militarized
Interstate Disputes (MIDs) which onset and the number of participants in
these MIDs. Because the independent variables are annual values, the
same value is given to all dispute participants in the same year. If
standard errors were not clustered by year then there would be
substantial withincluster correlation.

[This]{.underline} paper [models]{.underline} the hostility level of
interstate [disputes as a **monadic** phenomenon]{.underline}. [Much of
the literature]{.underline} on democratic peace theory [utilizes a
**dyadic** setup]{.underline}, either directed or undirected. I opt for
a monadic structure for three reasons, firstly, because [many of the
theoretical explanations for the democratic peace are]{.underline} in
essence, **[monadic]{.underline}** explanations, with a dyadic version
layered on top. For instance, the core claim of much of the literature
is that democracy reduces the hostility of foreign policy, a monadic
claim, because leaders are accountable to citizens who have a low
tolerance for the costs or war, and because legislatures and a free and
independent media provides greater scrutiny of policymaking, slowing the
march to war. The dyadic version of this---the interaction of joint
democracy---relies on the signals that these same processes provide to
another actor. It is puzzling, therefore, that empirical findings have
tended to show support for the latter, but not for the former. Secondly,
[the **difficulty** in finding empirical support for any monadic
explanation means that [a **higher threshold** is]{.mark} being
[set]{.mark} here [by]{.mark} using [a monadic
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thirdly, the argument I make, that
liberal norms reduces the hostility level of interstate disputes, may
have varying effects according to the regime type of dyads. However,
that claim is not made here, rather I argue that these norms exist for
all in international society, not for a subset, and that they act
directly upon policymakers, not only when policymakers interact with
their international counterparts.

Graduate Center, City University of New York (Charles, interviewed by

CM: [Liberalism is attractive on both **principled** and **strategic**
grounds]{.underline}. You're completely right, of course, about [the
[**failures** of]{.mark} actual historical
[liberalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [are **manifest**, indeed
**ubiquitous**, all around us. But what is the **source** of these
failures? If liberalism has never lived up to its]{.underline}
ostensible principles and [values]{.underline}, [that [**goes no way**
in proving that the]{.mark}]{.underline} principles and [[values are
**themselves unattractive**]{.underline}]{.mark} ones. [The]{.underline}
illuminating [way to [understand]{.mark} these [violations of]{.mark}
(ideal) [liberal norms]{.mark}]{.underline}, I suggest in the book, [is
[**not** as]{.mark} the consequence of [an **intrinsic**]{.mark}**ally
self-undermining** "[illiberalizing" dynamic]{.mark} within liberalism
[but]{.mark} rather as a manifestation of the [corrupting
results]{.mark} of **group power**]{.underline}, whether of the
privileged classes, men, or the dominant race, for liberal theory and
practice. Hence the creation of a bourgeois, patriarchal, or racial
liberalism (usually all three combined, of course).

[But [we can appeal to the **idealized**]{.mark},
**non-group-restricted** versions of [liberal]{.mark} principles and
[values to **critique** the exclusionary
versions]{.mark}]{.underline}---indeed, [[that is]{.mark} precisely
[what **most**]{.mark}]{.underline} American [[**progressive social
movements** have]{.mark} historically [done]{.mark}. Particularly at
[the present]{.mark} time of authoritarian ethnonationalism's [attack on
liberal norms]{.mark}, it [is]{.mark} **all the more [reason]{.mark}**
[to affirm them]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, liberalism as I
understand [it is **certainly not committed** to an opposition to
socialism in the social democratic sense]{.underline}---arguably,
**[that's just left-liberalism]{.underline}**. And any other variety of
hypothetical socialism---market socialism, workers' democracy---would
presumably strive to sell itself by promising a deeper and more
extensive realization of liberal values, not their abandonment. So I
would claim that the socialist case can indeed be made within a liberal
framework. It's noteworthy that Rawls---surely a respectable
liberal!---says explicitly in A Theory of Justice that his theory
"includes no natural right of private property in the means of
production."

As for the strategic reasons: [[Liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} (in the
broad-spectrum sense that includes right-wing "classical" liberals)
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} uncontroversially [[been]{.mark} the
**[dominant]{.mark} political ideology** in US history]{.underline},
albeit in the restrictive incarnations just delineated. [So in trying
[to win]{.mark} over [a **broad**]{.mark} **political
[audience]{.mark}** [rather than **preach to the choir**]{.mark},
as]{.underline} I presume [progressives **want to do**, [one]{.mark}
immediately [has the **immense advantage** of]{.mark} invoking
[the]{.mark} political [ideology]{.mark} nominally [endorsed by the
majority]{.mark}. [You **don't have to require** them to]{.mark} first
**[convert]{.mark}** to Marxism or Foucauldian-ism or
whatever]{.underline}; you can just say, "If you're a good liberal, you
should support this." [That **doesn't mean** that you can't get valuable
insights from Marx or Foucault]{.underline}, of course, [but they
are]{.underline} ultimately [going to have to be "**translated**" into a
liberal framework]{.underline}.

And insofar as [[legal change will be **crucial for
progressive**]{.mark} **structural [reform]{.mark}**---[**necessary** if
not **sufficient**]{.mark}---need I make the **obvious point**
that]{.underline} the American and broader Western [juridical systems
are **founded** on liberal principles and assumptions?]{.underline} The
"**[[Black radical liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**" I am advocating
[will]{.underline} thus [be able to **[engage]{.mark} directly**
[with]{.mark} its [conservative]{.mark} juristic [opponents in a way
that nonliberal]{.mark} political [ideologies will
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark}
generally, and the Federalist Society specifically,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} certainly [[in **no doubt**]{.mark}
themselves [about the importance of]{.mark} fighting for particular
[interpretations of]{.mark} the Constitution and [the
law]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is precisely why they set out years ago
to gain control of the courts. [Black rights]{.underline}, and nonwhite
rights in general, [will have to be advanced by **liberal arguments**
and **liberal jurisprudence** in this **liberal**]{.underline} (in the
broad sense) **[arena]{.underline}**.

DSJ: In a retrospective 2015 forum devoted to The Racial Contract in the
journal Politics, Groups, and Identities, you issued a response to your
critics which you entitled "The Racial Contract revisited: still
unbroken after all these years." What do you see as remaining
fundamentally unbroken, and given your commitment to liberalism, what,
if anything, has changed? What gives you hope?

CM: [What I saw as unbroken]{.underline} at the time [was the continuing
reality of **unjust structural white domination**]{.underline} and
unjust structural white advantage, even in the final years of the Obama
presidency. [The racial contract can survive]{.underline} such
[**changes of personnel** in governing circles]{.underline}; [what
**counts**]{.underline}, as I've emphasized throughout, [are the
**structures** and **institutions**]{.underline}. And I should stress
that [[liberalism is **not**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in my reading,
[[**committed** to]{.mark} the **[optimistic]{.mark}**]{.underline} Whig
[**[progressivism]{.mark}** traditionally ascribed to it]{.underline},
especially when we need to think of it as predominantly a racialized
liberalism historically.

In my 2015 response, I cited a statistic mentioned by New York Times
columnist Charles Blow that a 2011 survey had revealed that a majority
of white Americans saw themselves as the primary victims of racial
discrimination. Not an encouraging figure! But [even before the Floyd
killing, and before last summer's huge multiracial
demonstrations]{.underline}, such [[white racial
attitudes]{.underline}]{.mark} had **[[shifted]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
So [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} is the [kind of development]{.underline}
that [[gives me **hope**,]{.mark} along with the potentiality
for]{.underline} the huge [wealth disparities]{.underline} of the "New
Gilded Age" [[to create]{.mark} the objective basis for [a **transracial
class alliance**]{.mark} of the socially disadvantaged. But [a **nonzero
chance of positive racial change**]{.mark}, however small, [is]{.mark}
obviously going to be **[diminished]{.mark}** even further [if one
adopts]{.mark} a **political [quietism]{.mark}** [predicated on
**assuming**]{.mark} **its [hopelessness in
advance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### 2AC\-\--Private Property Good

#### Legalism good. The law can challenge western individualization; the flaws of bounded property logic are reasons to [expand]{.underline} it, not [reject]{.underline} it.

**Nash, 19**---Professor of Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies at
Duke University (Jennifer, "love in the time of death," *Black Feminism
Reimagined: After Intersectionality*, Chapter 4, 121-126, dml)

This book began with substantial engagement with intersectionality's
origin stories, examining how the question of where the analytic came
from, who coined it, and who deserves "credit" for its rise and
circulation have come to predominate in black feminist scholarship.
Curiously, though, none of these widely circulating origin stories
contend with intersectionality's connections to the juridical, or think
deeply about intersectionality as a legal project. Though
[this]{.underline} book [**eschews** [simple origin stories that
**presume**]{.mark}]{.underline} that intersectionality has [a
**[singular history]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in this section, I advocate
for remembering intersectionality's connections to critical race theory,
and thus its intimate relationship with **[remaking law]{.underline}**.
I invest in this project because intersectionality [[has been **swept**
into a larger black feminist conversation that **presumes**]{.mark}
**the [violence]{.mark}** [of the juridical]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[ignoring]{.underline}]{.mark}** both intersectionality's loving
investment in the juridical and [[the juridical as a potential site of
**loving practice**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Put differently, in
[this]{.underline} section, I emphasize intersectionality's location in
critical race theory, in Left legal projects, to [move **beyond**
the]{.underline} now **[knee-jerk]{.underline}** Left (and black
feminist) [sense that radical and transgressive projects are
**necessarily antistate**]{.underline}. In place of this now familiar
political terrain, I seek to ask different questions: [[Is it
**simply**]{.underline}]{.mark} collusion or "**[[cruel
optimism]{.underline}]{.mark}**" for black feminists [[to **seek
engagement with the state**]{.underline}]{.mark}?31 Can we imagine black
feminist engagements with the state as [taking forms **other** than
seeking **redress** and demanding **visibility**]{.underline}? Are there
ways to imagine black feminist legal engagement that circumvent the
uncomfortable and problematic position of being "at home with the law"?
How can black feminists [[reimagine law as a site for]{.mark} staging
[**productive intimacies** and enacting **radical
vulnerabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}?

In its juridical iteration, intersectionality emerged in a moment where
critical race theorists offered analytical tools to upend prevailing
fictions of law's objectivity, to reveal the quotidian nature of racism
and sexism, and [to argue for **fundamental [transformations]{.mark}**
[in legal pedagogy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Critical race theory, then,
[[was born of]{.mark} a [**sustained attention** to law's
failures]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even as it
**contained**]{.underline}---at times---[certain kinds of **faith** in
law's **potentiality** and **promise**]{.underline}. Critical race
scholars were a post--Brown v. Board of Education generation who
witnessed the end of the Warren court's promises of integration and
inclusion. They saw affirmative action rolled back, transformed from a
substantive remedy for past and ongoing discrimination to a promise of
"diversity" to benefit white students who would be changed into global
citizens ready for corporate employment thanks to their "exposure" to
socalled racial difference.32 They witnessed the ratcheting up of
standards for proving employment discrimination from racially disparate
effects to discriminatory intent, effectively making it harder for
minoritarian plaintiffs to prevail in discrimination suits. They
emphatically asked, then, whether the goal of antiracist legal scholars
should be inclusion in white institutions or whether it should be, for
example, the creation of robustly funded and supported black
institutions. They interrogated whether the Warren court's landmark
decision in Brown would have better served its black plaintiffs if it
equally funded black schools, rather than championing desegregation and
then mandating integration at "all deliberate speed." They debated
whether affirmative action should be supported if the only logic to
support it is "diversity," where students of color provide a pedagogical
value for white students. Critical race theory, then, was never an
embrace of an ethic of inclusion, or even a form of advocacy for new
forms of redress. Instead, it was undergirded by an investment in
revealing that racial progress was the result of "interest convergence"
rather than a genuine investment in antisubordination, and by a
fundamental belief that law would look and feel different if it "looked
to the bottom."33

While critical race theorists offered [[critical interrogations of law's
imagined progress]{.underline}]{.mark}, treating it as evidence of US
self-interest rather than a genuine investment in racial redress, they
**[also]{.underline}** routinely [[offered ways of **imagining law
otherwise**]{.underline}]{.mark}, refashioning antidiscrimination law,
conceptions of evidence, property, and contract. They imagined a form of
law that eschewed color blindness and argued that any legal regime that
sought to contend with American racial violence had to be deeply
color-conscious to exact meaningful remedies. [[They advanced **new
methods**]{.underline}]{.mark}---**[narrative]{.underline}**,
**[parable]{.underline}**, **[allegory]{.underline}**, **[speculative
fiction]{.underline}**, **[storytelling]{.underline}**---in an effort
[[to **jam** the fictions of **objectivity** and
**neutrality**]{.underline}]{.mark} and to expose that law is itself a
racial project, never removed from the racial regimes it purports to
disrupt. In other words, [they sought to use their locations in the
legal academy]{.underline} and in the legal profession [to **radically
remake law**]{.underline}, [to **push the boundaries** of how legal
doctrine could be **written**]{.underline}, **[imagined]{.underline}**,
[and **enacted**]{.underline}. [They aspired to make law]{.underline}
into something [**unrecognizable** and **unimaginable**]{.underline}, to
push at its very parameters in the pursuit of a "jurisprudence of
generosity."34

My entry point for thinking through law as a site of black feminist
love-politics is through the work of Patricia J. Williams. Her book The
Alchemy of Race and Rights is complex in its form and its argument---it
is memoir, "diary," legal treatise, and critical theory at once.
Williams presents herself as professor, consumer, daughter,
granddaughter, train rider, and "crazy" black woman exhausted from the
ordinary and spectacular raced and gendered brutalities of American life
and the project of teaching law at a historically white law school. The
project, then, is a rumination on the felt life of racial and gendered
violence, and a critical analysis of the myriad spaces where this
violence unfolds, from the media onslaught against Tawana Brawley to the
experiences of being a black female faculty member at a law school.

Williams's inquiry, though, is not simply about documenting the ubiquity
of racial and gendered violence but also about engaging and describing
the lived experience of racialized and gendered vulnerability, what she
terms "spirit murder." For Williams, "spirit murder" is the psychic and
spiritual wounding that unfolds as a result of racial violence. "Spirit
murder" describes the wounds left on the flesh, psyche, and even soul of
those who experience violence and the wounds, often invisible, that
haunt perpetrators of violence, including a willingness to accept, and
to render unseen, those who are dispossessed. Williams's task, then, is
to imagine what law could look and feel like if it accounted for "spirit
murder," a form of violence that she argues includes "cultural
obliteration, prostitution, abandonment of the elderly and the homeless,
and genocide. . . . What I call spirit murder---disregard for others
whose lives qualitatively depend on our regard---is that it produces a
system of formalized distortions of thought."35 Williams argues that "we
need to elevate spirit murder to the conceptual---if not punitive---
level of a capital moral offense. . . . We need to eradicate its numbing
pathology before it wipes out what precious little humanity we have
left."36 [Williams's [conception o]{.mark}f]{.underline} "**[[spirit
murder]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[imagines law's capacity to
**remedy**]{.underline}]{.mark} forms of [[**violence** against the
psyche and soul]{.underline}]{.mark}, [a terrain [that has been
**unimaginable** to law]{.mark}]{.underline} precisely because of its
commitment to remedying only visible and legible harms, and law's
ability to be mobilized "conceptually"--- but not punitively---to
respond to violence. In other words, [the endeavor]{.underline} of the
text [is to [imagine a legal project]{.mark} **capacious** and
**creative** enough [to attend to]{.mark}]{.underline} what it has
always ignored: the [[**violence** inflicted on the
**psyche**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Williams effectively invites us to
imagine how [we might **feel differently** toward each
other]{.underline}, and toward law itself, [if we had **legal
obligations toward mutual regard**]{.underline}, [if we knew that law
**took seriously** spirit murder]{.underline}.

If Williams seeks [[to **use law**]{.underline}]{.mark} to exceed what
it aspires to do, **[[to respond to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the "cultural
cancer" of **[[spirit murder]{.underline}]{.mark}**, her book also
contains a resounding, and even surprising, redemption of rights as a
key strategy for reforming law. An embrace of rights [**might**
sound]{.underline} like a **[deeply conventional]{.underline}**
strategy, mobilizing law to do what it has long claimed to do on behalf
of racialized and gendered minorities: confer rights. Despite her
lengthy engagement with state violence, her exacting
[[critique]{.underline}]{.mark} of how law permits rather than redresses
spirit murder, Williams [[ends **not** with]{.mark} an [**abandonment of
the state** but with a **deep affection** for what rights could
**accomplish**]{.mark}]{.underline}. She writes:

[The task is to **[expand]{.mark}**]{.underline} private **[[property
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}** into a conception of civil rights, [[into
the right to **expect civility**]{.mark} from others]{.underline}. . . .
Instead, society must give them \[rights\] away. Unlock them from
reification by giving them to slaves. Give them to trees. Give them to
cows. Give them to history. Give them to rivers and rocks. [[Give to
**all**]{.underline}]{.mark} of society's objects and untouchables [[the
rights of **privacy**]{.underline}, [**integrity** and
**self-assertion**]{.underline}]{.mark}; [give them **distance** and
**respect**]{.underline}. [Flood them with the animating spirit that
**rights**]{.underline} mythology [**fires** in]{.underline} this
country's most [oppressed psyches]{.underline}, [and **wash away** the
shroud of **inanimate-object-status**]{.underline}, so that we may say
not that we own gold but that a luminous golden spirit owns us.37

If critical legal studies called for the abandonment of investment in
rights, treating rights as relatively unsuccessful in securing social
change and as promoting problematic conceptions of individualism,
Williams makes a plea for a dramatic expansion of rights and a
surprising reconceptualization of the labor of rights. Rights, she
argues, should not be the purview of those who can explicitly and
legibly name harm. Cows, history, and rocks should have rights,
including rights to "privacy, integrity and self-assertion." Rights
should not be "reified" but generously bestowed upon everyone and
everything; rights should not be used to shore up ideas of property and
ownership, to allow us to claim that "we own gold," but instead to
ensure a deep spiritual connection between us. In so doing, [[law
could]{.mark} **[remake]{.mark}**]{.underline}
"**[[society]{.underline}]{.mark}**,"
**[[transforming]{.underline}]{.mark}** its [[**investments** in
rights]{.mark} [as something that **protects property holders**
into]{.mark}]{.underline} rights as [[something that can ensure]{.mark}
our **[mutual accountability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and reminds us of
the "luminous golden spirit \[that\] owns us" all.

It is easy to read Williams as optimistically rehabilitating rights from
the critical legal studies' critique of rights, and problematically
investing in precisely the doctrinal formulation that has consistently
failed minoritarian subjects. In this reading, Williams is imagined as
paradoxically investing in precisely the site of violence she carefully
documents with far too little explanation for how rights can circumvent
the problems of racism and sexism she delineates. Yet I read Williams's
visionary account of rights differently. For her, [[law can be mobilized
**not** to]{.mark} produce **new causes of action**]{.underline}, [to
simply **[make visible new wounded subjects]{.mark}** who can make
appeals to redress]{.underline}, [[but to **imagine new** and **radical
vulnerabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [As it is **currently
structured**]{.underline}, [property **deeply organizes
sociality**]{.underline}, [and law operates to **protect
property**]{.underline} from trespass and theft. Thus, law operates to
create categories like property holder (owner) and trespasser (thief),
and to organize the social world around proximities to ownership.
Williams uses her capacious conception of rights to imagine another way
of organizing sociality: around vulnerability. Indeed, Williams asks:
How are we bound up with others? What is our responsibility to ensuring
the vital "spirit" of others, and to demanding the protection of our own
"spirits"? What happens when we harm things that can't articulate
injuries (trees, rocks, rivers) but can only make that injury visible
and oftentimes in ways that we refuse to recognize, or that might even
make that injury visible in another time, in decades or centuries when
we are not even here to be accountable? What happens when we take
responsibility for our capacity to wound and for the histories of
wounding and violence that have unfolded, often in our names? And what
happens when [[law becomes a **critical tool** in making visible
**mutual vulnerability**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [in insisting that we
recognize that we can]{.underline} "**[undo each other]{.underline}**,"
[and in demanding that we **take seriously** our indebtedness to each
other]{.underline}? For Williams, then, [[expanding rights becomes a
strategy for **transforming law** to be a space that **enshrines** a
vision of **interdependence** and **shared
vulnerability**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Decolonial thought, accordingly, breaks with the fundamental "myth of
modernity," embracing instead practices of "epistemic delinking" from
the binary of coloniality/modernity created by the political and
economic systems that originated in Europe and spread to the colonies.
More specifically, "\[d\]e-coloniality turns the plate around and shifts
the ethics and politics of knowledge. Critical theories emerge from the
ruins of languages, categories of thoughts and subjectivities (Arab,
Aymara, Hindi, French and English Creole in the Caribbean, Afrikaans,
etc.) that had been consistently negated by the rhetoric of modernity
and in the imperial implementation of the logic of coloniality." Through
this emphasis on centering marginalized categories of thought,
decoloniality provides a useful theoretical frame for thinking across
racial and national identity categories, in ways that aid in undoing
anti-Blackness, anti-Indigeneity, and anti-Asianness, among others. As
José David Saldívar explains, decolonial theory is a useful tool for
thinking the politics of "becoming minor," and the epistemic
marginalization that accompanies them. In the context of intellectual
property law, decoloniality is useful in advancing critiques of the area
of law's consistent inability and refusal to recognize the full
personhood, therefore creatorship and citizenship, of people of color,
and building models of engagement that recognize multiverses of
knowledge production, knowledge making, and indigenous wisdom, apart
from their commodity value. It is also useful in thinking about
policymaking as a practice of working from the bottom up instead of the
top down. Deconstructing the racial logics of intellectual property law
creates space for new ideas that are grounded in Otherness. Such ideas
are not, by definition, emancipatory ones. However, they are
prerequisites to building knowledge futures that are emancipatory. While
Mignolo sketches the importance of epistemic delinking from modernity,
the specifics of his project are not always clear. Given the
embeddedness of the nation-state, including its management of normative
citizenship, with (neo)coloniality certainly requires moving away from
inclusionary politics as a strategy for gaining full intellectual
property citizenship. As Mignolo writes, "The emergence of 'modern
nation-states' in Europe, means two things: that the state became the
new central authority of imperial/colonial domination and that the
'nation' in Europe was mainly constituted of one ethnicity, articulated
as 'whiteness.'"30 White colonial nation-states became the arbiters of
citizenship, in part through the creation of hierarchies through which
they deemed themselves superior to (neo)colonial states and in part
through the legal manipulation of the category itself.31 They also
became arbiters of the legitimacy of knowledge, specifically who has and
does not have the capacity to create. The [[project of **remaking**
i]{.mark}ntellectual [p]{.mark}roperty [law]{.mark}, then, [must address
the **centrality** of the state]{.mark} and the centrality of
**whiteness** [in the formation of]{.mark} **intellectual property
[policy]{.mark}** and its underlying ideologies and cultural formations.
This does not [mean doing **away** with the nation-state or completely
**disempowering** white people]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, it means
[[**confronting** the role of the nation state]{.mark} in epistemic
violence and its **complicity** in white supremacy.]{.underline}
Decoloniality, as a tool of a larger, interdisciplinary [Critical Race
IP agenda, "[**creates space for a complex and multifaceted engagement**
with race and]{.mark}, (neo)coloniality that addresses [the fundamental
**historical power dynamics**]{.mark} that shaped laws of knowledge
production." For instance, [decolonizing intellectual property law
requires **undoing** the state's oligopoly on defining and enforcing
conceptions of infringement and the public
domain]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It also requires pushing back
against the implicit whiteness in state and cultural conceptions of
creativity, innovation, progress, and A2K. Both of these are necessary
but not sufficient for intellectual property justice. Darrel
Wanzer-Serrano writes: "Decoloniality is an alternative accent--- one
marked by pluriversal commitments, geo-historical attentiveness, and
bio-graphical [considerations." In order to get to a place in the
context of intellectual property law where that trio of goals is
possible, anti-racist and anti-colonial activists must persuade
lawmakers that knowledge production comes in a variety of forms, not of
all of which comport with notions of Romantic authorship]{.underline}.
This project is an ongoing one, though it is sometimes impeded by
commitments to incrementalism, inclusion, or capitalism. Approaching
such issues from the vantage point of pluriversality, historicity, and
contextual specificity forces engagement with intellectual property
law's tendency to mark some people as less than human and prefigure
solutions through racial capitalist lenses. Important questions in
building egalitarian copyright, patent, and trademark policies, then,
include: "Whose labor is valuable? How is it valued? What systems
underpin those definitions of labor? And how do we alter and remake the
systems that undervalue the knowledge of people of color and maintain
systems of white supremacy?" Storytelling, protecting traditional
knowledge, and A2K are important parts of the answers to those
questions, as the three case studies in chapter 4 demonstrate. But they
are necessary though not sufficient solutions to the circulation of
racial scripts that this book traces. Derrick Bell argues that making
visible the racial non-neutrality of law is a central part of the
project of CRT. Similarly, unveiling the nexus between
coloniality/modernity is a core part of the project of decolonial
theory--- and one that is helpful in reimagining copyright, patent, and
trademark law. Making visible intellectual property law's racial
non-neutrality and investments in (neo)colonial flows of power has been
a core aim of this project. [While scholars in a variety of disciplines
have begun to [work throug]{.mark}h the [histories of **intellectual**
property]{.mark} and race in particular instances, a great deal more
work needs to be done in [**theorizing** how **copyrights, patents, and
trademarks**]{.mark} have played important roles in racial formation,
how their racial scripts evolve and [pervade public **culture**, in
**discursive** and **material**]{.mark} ways, and how political economy
is tied up with questions of race]{.underline}. Coming to grips with
intellectual property law's stubborn doctrinal and discursive resistance
to creating narrative space for non-white creators and their full
personhood renders legible those discourses that subtly but persistently
normalize Enlightenment views of creatorship, infringement, and
concomitantly race. In the United States and globally, the struggle over
creating equitable intellectual property law is a struggle about the
ways in which Americans imagine, feel, and commodify knowledge in
intersectionally raced and (neo)colonial ways. [[Reimagining]{.mark}
intellectual property [through the lens of decoloniality]{.mark} is also
a [rhetorical project]{.mark}, one in which a developing theory of
Critical Race IP can assist.]{.underline} The examples of Prince's name
change, Lynch's Beast Mode®, decolonial vernacular in the Yoga Wars, and
dewesternization through the TKDL demonstrate the broad spectrum of
resistive performances and practices through which people of color
remake notions of creatorship, citizenship, and personhood. They also
concretize decoloniality in ways that are helpful for thinking about
praxis in all its material realities. Decolonial theory posits, as a
core practice of decolonization, the idea of delinking. [Decolonizing
intellectual property requires delinking it from the epistemological
foundations of modernity/coloniality, particularly with respect to the
category of creatorship and, relatedly, its articulations with
citizenship and personhood.]{.underline} Darrel Wanzer-Serrano explains
the practice of delinking decolonially as: [any practice, discursive or
otherwise, that facilitates a divestment from modernity/coloniality and
invents openings through which decolonial epistemics can emerge. . . .
Delinking requires changes in both content and form . . . It requires
being oriented toward shifts in our genealogies of thought, including
drawing authority from colonized spaces/voices and resisting latent
imperialisms---even when such [resistance]{.mark} may [not]{.mark} be
[exclusively]{.mark} [oppositional]{.mark}]{.underline}.35 In this way,
decolonial theory and praxis conceive of "epistemological
reconstitution,"36 in order to facilitate the making of "another
rationality which may legitimately pretend to some universality." From
this understanding of decolonial delinking, we can move between theory
and practice to imagine how it might look to delink intellectual
property law from its modern/colonial investments in
creatorship/infringement. We can also imagine ways of undoing
creatorship as it forms racial assemblages with national identity and
citizenship, two categories that must also be decolonized. The praxis of
decolonial delinking is far more complicated than the conceptualization
of that which must be done, however. For instance, Prince and Lynch
succeed in decolonial delinking even as they work to build space for
Black capitalism to thrive. Similarly, the dewesternizing restructuring
and spectacular nationalism that the TKDL prompts, even while
encouraging the development of decolonial vernacular, is a move toward
decolonial intellectual property. Yet both of these examples point to
the tendency of resistance to be embedded within unsustainable systems
and ideologies of racial capitalism and racial liberalism. Anti-racist
and anticolonial scholars ought to contemplate how to take
decolonization even further, past beyond existing imaginaries.

The emergence of a knowledge-based economy has taken place in some
general sense gradually for centuries. If one has to point out a period
of time when the economies in the major industrialized countries began
to be dominated in some economic sense by knowledge and IC, it is the
1980s and 1990s. Looking at the causes behind this emergence, [there are
[strong reasons to be **techno-centric**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[emphasize]{.mark} the [significance]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the **long
[accumulation]{.mark}** [of **new**]{.mark}
**[tech]{.mark}nologies**]{.underline}, i.e. new technical knowledge.8
[In relation to **resources** and **capital**]{.underline} in general,
[[knowledge has **special properties**]{.mark} which enable cumulation
of value and long term wealth and welfare creation]{.underline}. For one
thing, knowledge is not worn out or consumed but continues to grow, in
an absolute sense, not the least through new combinations of existing
knowledge elements, combinations which in turn constitute new
recombinable knowledge elements etc. In relation to knowledge in
general, [technical knowledge]{.underline} in turn [has]{.underline}
further [special properties which make it [particularly]{.mark}
cumulative, recombinant and **[value-creating]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
an economy.9 Most notably, [new information and communication
technologies have through digitalization [enabled]{.mark}]{.underline}:

1\. **[[Radically expanded]{.underline}]{.mark}** and faster
[[production]{.underline}]{.mark}, [retrieval]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
[global distribution]{.mark} and exchange [of]{.mark}]{.underline} big
sets of data, information and [[knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[resulting in]{.mark} various [developments]{.mark}]{.underline} and
applications becoming more sensor-, data- and computer-driven;

2\. [**[Reduction of search costs]{.mark}**, interaction costs and
transaction costs]{.underline} on markets in general, including markets
for ideas, knowledge, technology markets and information markets, some
of them with many small micro-transactions, [whereby]{.underline} old
[[markets]{.mark} become]{.underline} larger and [[more
effective]{.underline}]{.mark} at the same time as completely new
markets are created;

3\. Increasing temporary privatization on the whole of data, information
and other intellectual resources and their flows of returns through both
legal and technical means (e.g. encryption, electronic codes, locks and
firewalls, and streaming);

4\. [Creation of [network]{.mark}-based scalable [platforms]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [fast]{.mark} and large-scale **[communications]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[info]{.mark}rmation [exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline},
social media and organized relation building and control (cf.
e-commerce, e-government, e-research, etc.);

5\. **[[New]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology
[combinations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, e.g. in "intelligent" or "smart"
products, processes and systems of widely varying types such as cars,
houses, phones, weapons, materials, implants, etc., i.e. in various
forms of machine intelligence, moreover to be connected by the "Internet
of things" (IoT), and what could be called artificial intelligence (AI)
and machine media, hybridizing with social media.

The collective stock of knowledge thus grows in an absolute sense
(catastrophic destruction apart). This does not mean that neither
economically useful knowledge, nor IC more generally will necessarily
grow, since knowledge, and technologies not the least, may become
obsolete and substituted for by new knowledge over time. Nor does it
mean that IC will grow relative to other forms of capital, since
scarcity of a vital primary physical resource (such as potable water)
may conceivably arise to the point where its economic value growth
contributes to a relative decline in IC's share of capital formation,
and thereby possibly eliminates its dominance. Intellectual or
intangible capital is moreover inherently difficult to measure.
Nevertheless, many attempts have been made to do so and make comparisons
with (more accurate) measures of tangibles. A number of indicators
showed in the 1990s that IC had become ever more important, even
dominant in the 1990s, such as investments in R&D, and economic outcomes
in terms of innovations and wealth growth. The question then is if any
dominance of IC in an accounting sense is temporary or permanent. As it
turns out the dominance of IC, expressed in stock market valuations
around the world, was temporarily reduced but not permanently erased,
neither by the bursting of the so-called information technology (IT)
bubble and its affiliated "dotcom bubble" in the early 2000s, nor by the
financial crisis in the late 2000s. However, fluctuations in company and
asset valuations on financial markets appear to have become larger and
more frequent and thereby leading to higher levels of more permanent
volatility and risks in the economy which more easily could lead to
reversals of any dominance of some capital component in the economy.10
Keeping all these cautious remarks in mind, Table 1.1 gives an overview
of various indicators of the multi-faceted nature and importance of IC.

***[\*\*TABLE OMMITED\*\*]{.underline}***

Accounting for IC and related concepts (intangibles, knowledge, human
capital, etc.) involves many difficulties which have been described in
the literature and will further be described in Chapters 2, 3 and 11.
The difficulties derive from a variety of definitions, typologies and
operationalizations of IC related to various accounting entities (firms,
nations, etc.) with separation and aggregation problems, and from data
unavailability and incompatible data sources and scales.11 Many of these
accounting issues are well recognized, but new ones also appear as a
result of new technologies. Just to mention a few new issues in IC
accounting: Should the development of machine intelligence be accounted
for as a type of physical capital or IC comparable to human capital and
then what about humanoid capital? Should development of IoT
communications be accounted for as relational (or network) capital
comparable to relational capital among humans? Accounting difficulties
apart, one could claim that developments like these will lead to
increases in IC, as will big data analytics and developments in sensor
technologies. The accounting difficulties are compounded when any
measure of IC is to be compared with measures of physical capital and
its share of total capital, and further compounded if comparisons of
absolute levels and relative shares over time are attempted. Just to
mention one more issue: If a balance sheet is attempted at national or
global level, and the inflow of solar energy or new space resources are
accounted for, will that outweigh any increases in knowledge and IC?
Accounting difficulties notwithstanding, it is important to get some
handle on the developments of IC for learning and policy decisions. To
use a variety of indicators as illustrated in Table 1.1 is a first step,
leaving refinements and aggregations to further research.12 A question
then is what indicates that the economy could be characterized as being
or moving towards intellectual capitalism. [Intellectual capitalism
would be present (or approaching) in a strong sense if the share of IC
as input and output in total capital formation is dominant]{.underline}
([or increasing]{.underline}). That would be difficult to assess
quantitatively in the present state of knowledge due to the accounting
difficulties mentioned above. However, one can talk about intellectual
capitalism in a weaker qualitative sense with references to various
indicators showing IC to be of major importance, if not dominant, in
different contexts. One can note here that the contemporary economy is
frequently characterized as a knowledge-based economy, an
innovation-based economy or an information-based economy, with little or
no quantitative evidence. If that characterization is accepted then one
question to be addressed is how the basic capitalist institutions --
firms, markets, private profits and private property rights -- are
faring in the economy and how they are affected by IC.13 This question
will be briefly dealt with next and then returned to in Chapter 11. As
to firms, Table 1.1 and the references therein show that many, if not
most, firms are IC based, consistent with previous research, although
any trend in this respect is more of an open question after the
financial crises in the early and late 2000s. IT firms like Amazon,
Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc. are certainly IC based and so
are technology-based start-ups but so are also many firms based on
natural resources. At the same time the large firms in the world economy
account for most of the world's R&D and patents. As to markets,
technology markets and data/information/knowledge markets more generally
are growing nationally and internationally as also shown in Table 1.1.
In periods and places [**[international tech]{.mark}nology
[trade]{.mark}** [grows]{.mark} even **[faster]{.mark}** [than]{.mark}
international [trade in physical goods]{.mark}]{.underline}.14 The
increasing use of various external technology acquisition and
exploitation strategies, i.e. increasing use of open innovation,
increases the demand for and supply of new technologies on technology
markets (see further Chapter 2). The [[developments]{.mark}
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} "big data" and information gathering
technologies and the **[[rights in data]{.underline}]{.mark}** (with the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as just one example) can be
[expected to [generate **further importance**]{.mark} and **growth of
data** and **information markets**]{.underline}, and the increasing
demand for intellectual talent and skills [[will]{.mark} further
**[foster human capital markets]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Private profits
and accumulation of private wealth many times derive from innovations
and various types of intellectual assets, and several individuals could
in fact be characterized as intellectual capitalists. Lists of wealthy
individuals suggest that original (as opposed to inherited and the like)
sources of personal wealth are increasingly intellectual in nature,
although such lists must be interpreted with much caution. Private
property rights have gradually since the nineteenth century become
extended with intellectual property rights, although there are inherent
differences between physical and intellectual property and it is
disputable to what extent IPRs should in fact be considered as "true"
property rights. Nevertheless, IPRs are property-like in some important
aspects and they are functional for trade in disembodied intellectual
products. Some new types of sui generis IPRs, like database rights, have
also been created. The surge in patenting, copyrights, trademarks,
design rights and other IPRs indicate a rapidly growing role of them in
the economy, as will be dealt with in the next section.
[[IPR]{.mark}s]{.underline} have also moreover [[affect]{.mark}ed other
institutions]{.underline} in recent decades, [notably
**[universities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Universities]{.underline} are
not a basic capitalist institution but have [increasingly
[become]{.mark} an **[economic]{.mark}
[institution]{.mark}**]{.underline} and as such indeed based on IC. [As
an economic institution universities have become an [important component
in **national innovation systems**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Universities
have also become more active in propertizing their IC with proactive
patenting organized in technology transfer offices and the like, run by
a new breed of university IP professionals. Finally, most countries in
the world have adopted capitalist economic institutions and most
significant countries have some form of innovation policies and some of
these, like China, India, Japan and S. Korea, are explicitly aiming at
becoming innovation-based states, as will be described in the book.
Although not phrased in terms of IC the close connection between
innovation and intellectual capital justify talking of some countries as
IC based, especially countries poor in indigenous natural resources like
Japan and S. Korea.15 Thus, one is led to conclude that a [[new type
of]{.mark} [econ]{.mark}omy has]{.underline} by and large
[come]{.underline} to stay; an economy which is new in the sense that it
has fairly recently begun to be dominated in some sense by knowledge and
IC as pointed out by many scholars. The expression "the new economy" as
used in the early years of the twenty-first century was rather
misleading, though, being a suggestion that a wholly new economy had
emerged and quickly replaced an old economy, while in fact all old,
[basic [institutions in]{.mark} a [capitalistic]{.mark} economic
[system]{.mark}]{.underline} -- private firms, markets, private profits,
private property rights and a complementary government maintaining these
institutions -- were basically preserved. Rather, these institutions
[were [**reinforced** and]{.mark} further
**[internationalized]{.mark}**]{.underline} during the 1990s after the
fall of the Soviet empire and the changes in Asia, especially in the
Chinese economic system. [This [new]{.mark} type of
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline} could consequently be [[called]{.mark}
**[intellectual capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}.16
