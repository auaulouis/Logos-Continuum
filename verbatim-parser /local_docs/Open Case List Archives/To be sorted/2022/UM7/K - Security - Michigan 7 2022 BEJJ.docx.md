#### The Aff's speech act around the securitization of NATO and [the West]{.underline} is [empirically]{.underline} used to justify [militarization]{.underline} and [endless]{.underline} [violence]{.underline}---NATO relies on [narrative]{.underline} and [threat]{.underline} construction to justify its existence.

//AW

Debates over the future of NATO easily transform into debates about
whether 'Western civilization' and 'the West' as a whole might be in
decline or whether they are the winner of the Cold War's ideological
battles (cf. Huntington, 1993; Fukuyama, 1989). [[Compared to
NATO]{.mark}, however, a [Western security community]{.mark} seems to be
[quite prosperous]{.mark} despite continuing conflicts between NATO
members]{.underline} (Cox, 2005; Pouliot, 2006). In this chapter I have
tried to show that a [[transatlantic alliance]{.mark} was
([re-)constituted via]{.mark} the mobilization and re-[articulation of
**foundational narratives**]{.mark}]{.underline} by the [allies in order
**[to justify]{.mark} the [existence]{.mark}, continuity, and
transformation** [of NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. Foundational narratives,
then, direct our attention exactly to the politics of security and
identity where political subjects are formed in the first place and help
to understand how security communities are constituted instead of
postulating that they are already existing (Adler and Barnett 1998, p.
3; contrary: Deutsch et al., 1969). In conclusion, I want to highlight
how [[NATO's re-constitution relates to]{.mark} the overall theme of
this volume, '[the West']{.mark}. It is not surprising that [NATO
allies]{.mark} often [referred to 'democracy',]{.mark} 'individual
liberty', or '[the rule of law']{.mark} in order [to justify NATO
as]{.mark} a geo-political community]{.underline} of solidarity with
defensive and peaceful intentions. Accordingly, it is not surprising
that the Soviet Union was repeatedly accused of modernizing its military
capacities, harboring expansionist intentions, and being an aggressive
opponent in an ideological struggle between 'freedom' and 'communism'.
This rather plain self/other construction, however, was quickly modified
in the early 1990s by declaring an 'end of the Cold War', invoking the
CEE as a distinct political subject, and by focusing on new risks and
challenges different from the past focus on territorial defense.
Moreover, NATO had 'gone global' in order to 'bring stability to other
parts of the world' (Daalder and Goldgeier, 2006, p. 105; Brzezinski,
2009). While this [global NATO is depicted as a result of changing
security politics, in particular as a consequence of globalized
terrorist threat]{.underline}, it is short-sighted to argue that these
transformations are merely a reaction to external pressures. [Grand
narratives about a '[Cold War' and a 'War on Terrorism']{.mark} are as
much [produced by]{.mark} a [**transatlantic security discourse**
intended to make sense of the world]{.mark} as they serve **[to justify
political decisions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is a [moot question
whether the global [**projection of power** by 'the West' caused
**violent opposition**]{.mark} around the globe or whether '[new wars'
and terror networks caused]{.mark} a transformation of
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It is puzzling, though, that NATO
has managed to secure its survival and to transform. I have argued that
the creation and repetition of foundational narratives -- in particular
the invention of a geopolitical community of solidarity and a political
community according to Article 4 of the Washington Treaty -- made sucha
two-sided re-constitution of continuity and transformation possible.
This also implies that NATO will persist and at once change as long as
the allies carry on re-articulating this foundational narrative. Such a
[[foundational narrative]{.mark} serves its integrating [function only
against]{.mark} the [background of 'the West']{.mark} as a shared yet
unspecified signifier, which is [implicitly represented as]{.mark} a
[threatened referent object of security]{.mark}]{.underline}. 'Europe',
the 'transatlantic area', respectively 'the [[West' are]{.mark} the
[endangered subjects of NATO's strategic discourse justifying]{.mark} a
durable and institutionally dense [military
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} of its member states and a
nuclearizaiton of its defense strategy. Whenever allies pursued (
national) security policies without consultation, conflicts and crisis
within the alliance were foreseeable. It [was [only through NATO]{.mark}
that 'the [West' could utilize]{.mark} its [power position
through]{.mark} a specific form of
[self-authorization]{.mark}.]{.underline} NATO\< respectively Western
states, presented 'democracy', 'human rights', the 'rule of law', and
'market economy' as normatively unquestioned principles they had already
realized[. [Others]{.mark} had [only one choice]{.mark}: to [comply
or]{.mark} to [resist.]{.mark} The normative attractiveness of 'the
West', thus, also implies the temptations of self-authorizing and
securitizing practices where a culture of [legal formalism]{.mark} is
[marginalized]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wæver, 1995; Koskenniemi, 2001). Yet
'Others' might only be known as defectors to a Western project of
modernization and democracy.

#### The alternative is the process of de-securitization.

**Wilhelmsen 2017** (Julie Wilhelmsen, Senior fellow at the Norwegian
Institute of International Affairs, "How does war become a legitimate
undertaking? Re-engaging the post-structuralist foundation of
securitization theory", <https://www.jstor.org/stable/48512937>)
//sethlee

Moreover, [**[alternative articulations]{.mark}** of the Self/Other
boundary which attach a lower level of threat to the Other [**can emerge
and render emergency measures illegitimate**. This would be a process of
**de-securitization. A first step towards such a re-interpretation**
would be to substitute]{.mark} Austinian [speech act with]{.mark}
post-structuralist **[discourse]{.mark}** as the core concept in the
theory.]{.underline} Discourse, not Austinian speech act: According to
Copenhagen School ST[, [threats and security are determined through the
speech act.]{.mark}]{.underline} Understood as a speech act[, 'security'
means that]{.underline} the very identification, [the articulation of
words that describe something as a security threat, is an
act]{.underline} (Wæver, 1995b: 55). The weight given to words in this
explication seems to match post-structuralists' foregrounding of
language, but it is still not useful to theorize securitization as a
speech act. It is an impossible attempt at reconciling relationalism
with actor-centric understandings of social change. The initial focus on
actors implicit in Copenhagen School ST is amplified with the adoption
of speech act in the Austinian 'once said, then done' way. [Not only is
the securitizing actor projected as the driving force in the
process,]{.underline} but also his words are accorded status as final
and decisive. Thus, the audience is certainly not significant and the
intersubjective process is lost (for a similar critique see Balzacq,
2005: 182--183; Stritzel, 2014: 20--24; Taureck, 2006: 52-- 61). [By
adhering firmly to relationalism and placing agency not in an actor, but
in the discursive practices that comprise a securitization, a
post-structuralist approach offers a less contradictory theoretical
framework and one that gives priority to intersubjectivity]{.underline}.
[[**Discourses** are seen as structures of signification which
**construct social realities**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The understanding
of significative construction which informs most post-structuralist work
is taken from the structuralist linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure
(1974). [He held that [language is not determined by the reality]{.mark}
to which it refers]{.underline} [-- [it should be understood as a
**system of sign**s]{.underline}]{.mark}[, with the meaning of each sign
determined by its relation to other signs. [A sign is thus part of a
structure]{.mark} together]{.underline} with other signs that it differs
from, and it gains its specific value precisely from being different
from other signs. [The assumption, prevalent in most post-structuralist
international relations (IR) work, that [discourses are structured
largely in terms of binary oppositions]{.mark} draws on the work of
Jacques Derrida]{.underline}. According to Derrida (1981), [[language is
a system of differential signs and meaning is established]{.mark} not by
the essence of a thing itself but [through a series of
juxtapositions]{.mark}, where one element is valued over its
opposite**[. Binary oppositions]{.mark}**]{.underline} are not neutral,
they **[[establish a relation of power]{.underline}]{.mark}** such that
one element in the binary is privileged. [[Discourses are seen as made
in a process of social practical interaction]{.underline}]{.mark} and
are always textually interconnected; as such, they are a set of
collectively articulated codes and are intersubjectively embedded at the
outset. Moreover, they are continuously conditioned by intersubjectivity
-- because, despite being highly structured, they are seen not as stable
grids, but as open-ended, changeable and historically contingent
(Milliken, 1999: 230). [This aspect of discourse implies that there is a
play of practice, or struggles over which discourses should prevail[.
Some **fixations**]{.mark} of meaning [become so conventionalized that
we think of them as **natural**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Other fixations
are always possible, but may become temporarily excluded by these
hegemonic discourses (Laclau and Mouffe, 1985). [The first argument for
[replacing]{.mark} Austinian '[speech act' with post-structuralist
'discourse']{.mark} is, therefore, that it [enables us to move
from]{.mark} a self-contained and [definite core concept]{.mark} in the
theory [to]{.mark} an inherently intersubjective and [process-oriented
concept]{.mark}]{.underline}. But also, if we consider what a
securitization would look like in the empirical world, a more reasonable
understanding would be that a 'securitizing attempt' consists of a
series of utterances. Nothing can be constituted as an existential
threat on a political arena through a 'speech act' in the 'once said,
then done' sense[. As Butler (1993) points out, [the power of speech
acts]{.mark} (not to be confused with Austinian illocutionary speech
acts) [lie in their iterability;]{.mark} that is, [they can be cited,
recited and changed]{.mark} through such citation. It is only through
iterability that utterances have transformative potential.]{.underline}9
[This makes it more appropriate to explicate 'securitizing moves' as the
onset or strengthening of a discourse that constructs something as an
existential threat.]{.underline} Finally, as regards the application of
securitization to understand how war becomes acceptable, a discursive
approach simply seems to have greater explicatory clout. The Second
Chechen War and the acceptance of this violent undertaking in the wider
Russian public cannot be thought of as a single authoritative act: it is
better grasped as an evolving intersubjective process. The purpose of an
enquiry informed by post-structuralist ST is to study how this
intersubjective process of securitization unfolds.

## Framework

#### Language is its own creator and creation---the absolutization of language creates an ontological negotiation, excluding existence beyond the world language has created

and BSc in economics and Management of the Arts from Bocconi University,

"First Hypostasis: Absolute Language" pg. 65-67//ekc

Since we are investigating [the underlying principles that give rise to
a specific kind of world, we shall look at language through the lens of
what language does]{.underline}, that is, what it produces when it is
used. [Any time we put forward a linguistic statement, every time we
express a linguistic unit]{.underline}, we are suggesting to our
interlocutors that a certain figure (an object, property or relation)
[be admitted as legitimately present in the world]{.underline}. The
interlocutors\' acceptance of [our linguistic utterance as meaningful,
grants legitimate presence in the word to the suggested
figure]{.underline}- thus making it available to be employed in the
larger game of linguistic exchange and recombination. The same happens
in a soliloquy or at the level of one\'s conscious thinking - though the
rapidity with which we accept our own linguistic proposal as plausibly
present in the world, tends to obfuscate this questioning process. And
of course, the same also applies to cases in which the utterer or
interlocutor is not a human, but a machine.

In this sense, [language\'s production is fundamentally ontological,
consisting in a continuous negotiation on which figures could or should
be included in the catalogue of the world.]{.underline} Every linguistic
unit thus takes on the form of a candidature and of a proposition.
Equally, the world becomes the negotiating table onto which the figures
of our daily experience are alternatively granted or denied legitimate
ontological status as 'present'. [In this sense, language functions as a
way to manage what entities make it onto the catalogue of the
communicable and operable layer of reality.]{.underline}

However, [when language is taken absolutely, that is when it is unbound
(ab-solutus) from any external constraint or from any other principle
outside itself, the world that it creates suddenly becomes the only
possible ontological field]{.underline}. When language becomes absolute
language, its cosmogony [ceases to be just one possible way of looking
at the world]{.underline} (namely, in terms of which figures have a
legitimate presence in it, as communicable and operable items) becoming
instead an all-encompassing terrain. [Outside of it, nothing is
permitted; outside of negotiated linguistic 'presence', nothing is
allowed,]{.underline} not even existence as it stands ineffably in
itself. Existence is substituted by presence, and its stability is taken
over by the negotiating process of language. [Language creates the world
in its own image, and when it becomes absolute, suddenly there is no
longer outside the world]{.underline}.

The [process of ontological negotiation that normally takes place at the
level of language, now becomes fully internal to language
itse]{.underline}lf; it is no longer an extra-linguistic interlocutor
that [accepts or rejects candidates to presence in the
world,]{.underline} but [it is the very fabric of language that absorbs
or rejects possible figures as they emerge from language
itself]{.underline}. In the state in which it becomes absolute[,
language presents itself as supposedly uttered by no mouth; rather, it
is claims to be at once its own creator and creation]{.underline}. *"I
suo fattore non disegno di farsi sua fattura."* Equally absolute
[language presents itself as unrestrained]{.underline} by any specific
extra-linguistic localization; a linguistic figure c[an take place
anywhere within the field of language, and, what is more, can do so
simultaneously in multiple instances.]{.underline} Taken in its absolute
form, language thus condenses that principle of seriality which we
observed in its symptomatic manifestations in the first chapter, during
our discussion of measure as the geometric centre of Tehcnic's
historical force.

To better elucidate the quality of language as understood absolutely,
let us bring in our first example of an archetypal incarnation of a
hypostasis. The archetypal incarnation of the first hypostasis in
Tehcnic's chain of emanations, consists in a suggested equivalence
between truth and representation, according to which: *truth is
representation and representation is truth.* We can find this
equivalence at work in countless aspects of our contemporary experience
of the world, in all fields of human activity. Let us unpick it piece by
piece, starting with its first element: truth.

For the sake of brevity, and being aware of endorsing one possible
definition over others, [we can that predicating the truthfulness of
something, means claiming that something is 'the case'. If I say that it
is true that a brick's colour is red, for example. What I mean is that
'it is the case' that red is the brick's colour.]{.underline} If
[I]{.underline} say that is it true that something happened, I mean that
it 'is the case' that it happened, and so on. [This might appear at
first as merely a matter of plain description; yet, if we consider truth
as a mechanism within a cosmogonic force, the extent of its influence
will soon become apparent]{.underline}. [Considered ontologically,
truth's reference to something 'being the case', takes the place of
something simple 'being']{.underline}. By assuming the truth-mechanism
as a crucial element in the architecture of a cosmogonic force, we
witness a shift from a condition in which 'existence' was the most basic
attribute for something to be able to enter reality, to a condition in
which this attribute becomes its 'being the case'. In metaphysical
terms, we can say [that this is a passage from a world of 'things', to
one made up of 'states of affairs'.]{.underline} This passage is
pregnant with the consequences on several levels. [While something can
'be' or 'not be' just in itself, the fact of its 'being the case' or
'not being the case' relies entirely on an external
sanction]{.underline}. For something to 'be or not the case'[, we
require both a context within]{.underline} which their 'being or not the
case' takes place, and an enunciation of their truthfulness or falsehood
as states of affairs. [Whatever 'is or not the case', relies entirely on
the enunciation that sanctions its claim, and on the context within
which such claims to truthfulness or falsehood is
meaningful.]{.underline} Thus, while 'things' can exist fully and
autonomously, states of affairs are present only precariously and
subordinately. [Namely, they are subordinate to the sanction bestowed
upon them by the linguistic context within which they are suggested as
taking place]{.underline}. This aspect of truth, adopted as an
ontological principle, [refers to the way in which, within language
taken absolutely, things are reduced merely to the 'being the
ca]{.underline}se'(or, as we called it in Chapter 1, 'activation') of a
grammatical position. Within absolute language, things are reduced to
states of affairs that require the series in which they are inserted,
both to acquire signification and to be enunciated. In themselves,
[before the series 'speaks' them and makes them present within itself,
they are nothing at all, since they don't even reach the stage in which
they can be discussed in terms of existence and
nonexistence.]{.underline} We have seen in the previous chapter how this
abstract mechanism translated in the daily functioning of historical
series such as those of finance, big data, neuroscience, citizenship and
so on.

#### Inertia DA -- countering securitizing discourse via debates usurps hegemonic narratives.

In the present paper elements of institutional theory, [policy
networks]{.underline} and analytical governance [are used to complement
discourse]{.underline} theory. This leads us to propose the
conceptualisation of discourse inertia. [In]{.underline} terms of
[discourse, inertia]{.underline} is considered to
[represent]{.underline} the [persistent promotion and **dominance** of a
**perception** of reality. This leads to]{.underline} the [continuous
**reproduction** of]{.underline} certain **[storylines]{.underline}**
and elements of a discourse. [Sanctioned discourses]{.underline}, often
ones that are institutionalised, are thought more likely to achieve or
[display inertia due to]{.underline} the involvement of path dependent
tendencies and powerful [entrenched interests]{.underline}.

[Discourse is]{.underline} considered to be [**dynamic**, even where
**discourse inertia** is present, as discourses must constantly be
**represented** and **reinforced**. Once]{.underline} an actor\'s, or a
group\'s, discourse becomes [dominant, it is **fiercely
defended**]{.underline}. Subsequently, dominant discourses are
constantly reinforced and embedded. This can lead to certain narratives
becoming entrenched within both institutions and political and social
practices, thus reaching an ideational status. These [privileged
narratives become taken for **granted**]{.underline} and
self-reinforcing, making them prone to discourse inertia. More shallow
narratives can function over privileged narratives to achieve an
interest or align with an outside commitment. These narratives are more
fluid and flexible and are, therefore, easily manipulated.

The concept of discourse inertia reflects how a discourse may persist
and resist pressures for change. It contributes to our understanding
discourse dynamics, dissonance and governance. [Discourse inertia may
aid in understanding]{.underline} the [persistence of]{.underline} a
certain [policy pathway]{.underline}, despite evidence of its
ineffectiveness or the presence of more suitable alternative approaches.

[Discourse inertia is illustrated by utilising]{.underline} and
extending Den Besten et al. (2014) '**[discursive-institutional
spiral]{.underline}**' (Fig. 1). The discursive-institutional spiral
demonstrates how discourses evolve. A [spiral exists between
actors]{.underline}, their [ideas, subject areas and]{.underline}
institutional [initiatives]{.underline}. Moments of institutionalisation
start each loop of the spiral, which then leads to [discussion and
debates]{.underline} that [draw in new actors. The more
actors]{.underline} that become [involved, the more]{.underline} likely
that [new ideas]{.underline} and concepts will be
[introduced]{.underline}. The expansion of actors and ideas subsequently
leads to [institutionalisation]{.underline}, which
**[narrows]{.underline}** the [discourse. Certain ideas are
**excluded**]{.underline} and actors are empowered or disempowered.
Institutionalisation then begins the next loop of the spiral as well as
the inception of new ideas and rise of critical discourses. [Power can
be exercised by excluding or including]{.underline} actors or
[ideas]{.underline} in the discursive-institutional process (Den Besten
et al., 2014).

[This]{.underline} concept [is extended through]{.underline} the
proposal of a [narrowing]{.underline} discursive-institutional
[spiral]{.underline}. Here, a process akin to institutional path
dependency occurs within the spiral, which restricts the entry of new
actors and ideas into the discourse. As a result, the [evolution and
expansion]{.underline} of the discursive-institutional spiral [is
limited]{.underline} (Fig. 2 and 3). [Certain discursive elements that
become institutionalised may be **self-reinforcing**]{.underline} along
subsequent spirals. These elements may consistently exclude other
elements and actors. [This can]{.underline} further [limit the
ability]{.underline} of new actors [to access]{.underline} the
[discourse, which reduces the]{.underline} introduction of
**[alternative]{.underline}** ideas

#### Communities of Practice DA -- uncritical acceptance of discourse embeds problematic practices that disrupt implementation.

from a Modernist Social Constructivism Perspective"; 2021; Springer;

Discourses play a significant role in this process of construction of
meaning: "[The world is not **objectively accessible**, but]{.underline}
instead is [imparted through language through discursive
processes]{.underline} and symbolic interpretations" (Uther 2014: 60).2
This means that much of the [meaning-construction]{.underline} of social
reality, which the brand of social constructivism espoused here relies
upon, [is done through]{.underline} what many authors call
[discourse]{.underline}. The frames that are studied in this analysis
are considered as elements in discourse. Discourse, here, is understood,
following Maarten Hajer, as "an ensemble of ideas, concepts, and
categories through which meaning is given to social and physical
phenomena, and which is produced and reproduced through an identifiable
set of practices" (Hajer 2006: 67). This captures the simultaneous
constructedness and constructiveness of the social meaning of material
objects: [Through language]{.underline} and practice
[humans]{.underline} both [capture]{.underline} the
[meaning]{.underline} material objects have, [and]{.underline} change or
[reproduce]{.underline} this [meaning]{.underline}. Similarly, Dryzek
defines discourse as "a shared way of apprehending the world. Embedded
in language, it enables those who subscribe to it to interpret bits of
information and put them together into coherent stories or accounts"
(Dryzek 2005: 9). This means that [meaning is constructed in discourses
in "**supra-individual** and]{.underline} rather [**unconscious**"
ways]{.underline} (Methmann et al. 2013a: 6).

At the same time, [human actors]{.underline}, in this study, will not be
considered as entities subordinate to a super-human structural power of
discourse. Actors, according to Uther's discussion, [are]{.underline}
both [constructed and constructing]{.underline} (see Uther 2014: 55).
Following her approach, actors are considered to be the
[central]{.underline} active agents [in]{.underline} any
[meaning-making]{.underline} situation, [and]{.underline} thus [not
**helpless pawns**]{.underline} in the flow of discourse: "The actor is
not passively subdued to the discourse, as, for example, the subject of
Foucault, but it actively participates in shaping the discourse through
its own interpretive achievements" (Uther 2014: 66).3 This two-fold
characterization of actors as both constructed and constructing is
captured by practice theory. The terms 'practice' and 'discourse' are
considered to not be antithetical to each other: [Practices
are]{.underline} "meaningful [patterns of action]{.underline}, which, in
being performed more or less competently, simultaneously embody, act
out, and possibly reify background knowledge and discourse in and around
the material world" (Adler and Pouliot 2011: 4). Thus, (non-linguistic)
practices are understood to interact with (linguistic) discourses and in
this interaction construct or deconstruct meanings. Other authors
reconcile linguistic and non-linguistic elements of meaning-construction
by subsuming both under the term 'discourse'(see Anshelm and Hultman
2015: 11; Methmann et al. 2013a: 6) As Dryzek (2006: 3) argues,
"[discourses are a matter of practice as well as words,]{.underline} for
actions in the social realm are always accompanied by language that
establishes the meaning of action" (see also Adler 2008: 198). I assume,
in line with these authors, that meaningful action---or practice---and
meaningful talk---or discourse---construct or deconstruct the ideational
meaning of an object. Further, I assume that practice is meaningful
action which acts out certain meanings about the world, thus making it
causally relevant.

Practice theory provides tools to put actors center stage as practice as
meaningful action depends on the existence of an actor. Adler and
Pouilot describe practice theory as an "invitation \[...\] to conceive
of the social as bundles of ideas and matter that are linguistically,
materially, and intersubjectively mediated in the form of practices"
(Adler and Pouliot 2011: 14). Practices as "meaningful patterns of
action" (Adler and Pouliot 2011: 4) can more specifically be defined as
a type of action, which, in turn, is a type of behavior. As Adler and
Pouliot (2011: 5) describe: "\[A\]ction is behavior imbued with meaning.
Running in the streets aimlessly is mere behavior, running after a thief
is an action endowed with meaning." For an action to be a practice, it
needs to fulfill additional criteria: "Practices\[...\] are patterned
actions that are embedded in particular organized contexts and, as such,
are articulated into specific types of action and are socially developed
through learning and training" (Adler and Pouliot 2011: 5). Accordingly,
a [practice is]{.underline} behavior endowed with meaning,
"**[embedded]{.underline}** in an organizational context, [repeated over
time]{.underline} and [space, constituted by knowledge]{.underline}
\[...\], and articulated as part of a complex set of other social
performances \[...\]" (Adler and Pouliot 2011: 6). The knowledge in
question is in part tacit, and it not only constitutes practices, but is
also bound up in them. Adler and Pouliot call this 'background
knowledge': "[**expectations**, **dispositions**, **skills**,
**techniques**, and **rituals**]{.underline} that [are the basis for the
constitution of practices]{.underline} and their boundaries" (Adler and
Pouliot 2011: 17). This background knowledge "does not create uniformity
of a group of community, but organize\[s\] their differences around
pervasive understandings of reality" (Adler and Bernstein 2005: 296).

Ontologically, practice theory is understood by its proponents to
provide a way out of the dichotomy of agency versus structure, or to
conceptualize the two-fold characterization of actors as both
constructed and constructing (see above). The agency-structure-dichotomy
describes an analytical problem similar to the one of hen and egg:
Should agents inside of the structure be understood to have final causal
power over phenomena in the social world, or is it the structure, which
was in turn constructed by agents, that finally influences what happens?
For example, should developments in global climate policy be accorded to
the UNFCCC (structure) or to efforts of the government of small island
states (actor)? According to the structuration theory by Giddens (1984),
actors and structures determine and influence each other. Practice
theory can give a more detailed insight into the workings of this
reciprocal constitution:

\[P\]ractices are both individual (agential) and structural \[...\].
When 'disaggregated', practices are ultimately performed by individual
human beings and thus they clearly are what human agency is about.
\[...\] **[Recursively]{.underline}**, in and [through practice, agents
**lock in** structural meaning]{.underline} in time and space. (Adler
and Pouliot 2011: 16)

Adler argues that these agents, these

> ['carriers' of social structures across]{.underline} functional and
> geographical [boundaries are]{.underline} not necessarily states or
> societal networks, but '**[communities of practice]{.underline}**'

In the analysis of the discursive construction of CE, the tool of the
Communities of Practice (CoP) approach is applied. The CoP approach
allows for the analysis of actors which transcend national borders, such
as transnationally active scholars, researchers and scientists as well
as political and economic actors, all of whom can conceivably influence
the social construction of CE---both of its ideational meaning and its
causal materiality. The focus in this study lies on academic actors as a
community of practice. It needs to be kept in mind, however, that
communities of practice can be characterized as both actor and
structure:

> Communities of practice are intersubjective social structures that
> constitute the normative and epistemic ground for action, but they
> also are agents, made up of real people, who -- working via network
> channels, across national or organizational lines, and in the halls of
> government -- affect political, economic, and social events. (Adler
> 2008: 199)

The Epistemic Communities (EC) approach (see Haas 1992; Adler and Haas
1992), an approach "considered to be the most influential" (Beck 2015:
286) in the debate on the role of academic and other experts in global
governance, can, according to Adler, be understood as the description of
the role of a very specific type of community of practice (Adler 2008:
199). This approach provides the background for the explication of one
of the central ontological assumptions of this study, namely that the
academic discussion is particularly relevant in the construction and
enactment of the legitimacy or illegitimacy of CE as measure to address
climate change.

To sum up, the moderately idealist social-constructivist ontology
defining the understanding of reality in this study means that
**[specific]{.underline}** communities of [practice
can]{.underline}---in interaction with other factors---constitute the
meaning of an object and, by enacting this meaning through
practice---again, in interaction with other factors--- [cause material
change]{.underline} in the configuration of objects in the world. For
example, a community of practice constituting the "normative and
epistemic ground for action" (Adler 2008: 199) on cyber security such as
the German Chaos Computer Club regularly constitutes the meanings of
objects such as virtual networks or computer viruses [by
defining]{.underline}, for the former, their
**[vulnerability]{.underline}** to attack, [and]{.underline}, for the
latter, their **[threat potential]{.underline}**. This is done, for
example, in interviews or reports. The community also enacts these
meanings through practice, e.g. by interacting with federal offices and
agencies in order to change the material configurations in our reality
according to the meanings applied to objects, e.g., changing the
material basis of digital infrastructures in order to make them more
resilient.

In this study, the academic [community]{.underline} researching CE
constitutes the community of practice that is most interesting as it [is
assumed to play a significant role in the]{.underline} early
construction of the [**legitimacy** or **illegitimacy** of]{.underline}
CE as [a **measure** to address climate change]{.underline}.4 This
community constitutes the legitimacy or illegitimacy of these approaches
[through **framing**]{.underline} them, for example in academic
publications, which present a form of practice as these publications
carry the framings of CE into the public, thus enacting these framings.
However, it is important to note that [this framing is]{.underline}, in
most publications, [not the **main intention**]{.underline} of the
respective authors: Other than epistemic communities in their original
conception, the group of academics researching and discussing CE
approaches is not united in a common policy endeavor. The main intention
of this diverse group of actors is the publication and discussion of
research results. I claim, however, that [even]{.underline} this
[**disinterested activity** can]{.underline}, when it concerns a set of
physical objects that remain to be materially developed,
[influence]{.underline} the **[legitimacy]{.underline}** or illegitimacy
of these objects---in this case, CE approaches---[even if this was not
the intention of the actor]{.underline}.

## Discourse Shapes Reality

### 2NC\-\--General

#### [Argumentative]{.underline} discourse [determines]{.underline} the [value]{.underline} and [outcome]{.underline} of policy.

University of Hong Kong, 2020, "Discourse inertia and the governance of
transboundary rivers in Asia," Earth System Governance,

Institutional and governance approaches and theories have been widely
utilised in the study of governance issues. However, it is argued that
such approaches would be strengthened if greater attention is given to
the ideational dimension (i.e., the ability to influence the perceptions
and beliefs of others regarding specific issues (Mirumachi, 2015)). This
is because [discursive factors tend to be eclipsed by more formal and
prominent governance and institutional perspectives]{.underline}. This
is due to the predominance of positivist and neopositivist approaches
towards international relations and political studies (Fischer, 1998;
Phillips et al., 2004). Therefore, [a [discourse-centric approach that
**highlights**]{.mark} the role of [discourse]{.mark} and allows a
**focus** on the interactive and dynamic processes that [are
**determinative of policy**]{.mark} is proposed. Discourse comprises the
**group of ideas**, **concepts** and **categories** that are produced,
reproduced and transformed in a certain nexus of practices. Social and
physical [relations are **given meaning**]{.mark} in this
manner]{.underline}. Discourses are context dependent and cannot be
separated from the social practices within which they are fashioned
(Jӓgerskog, 2002; Mirumachi, 2015). [[To create material change]{.mark},
social [agents]{.mark} first [need to work on a **discursive
level**]{.mark} [by creating]{.mark} significant and **stable
[meanings]{.mark}** to the territory within which they are
competing]{.underline} (Rear and Jones, 2013). Discourses can become
sanctioned. This essentially means that they become unquestioned and
dominant. With resources such as water, issues such as nationalism can
become intertwined in the sanctioned discourse. As a result, decision
makers may not always implement the most seemingly rational policies
(Jӓgerskog, 2002). Assumptions that dominate the sanctioned discourse
will act to constrain the options available to policymakers and in doing
so signal policy outcomes (Dayton, 2000; Gerlak and Schmeier, 2014).
Thus[, changes in the sanctioned discourse can indicate changes in
**policy direction**]{.underline}. However, identifying discourse change
is difficult. Change can occur slowly, over a long time period, or be
sudden and dramatic. What initially appears to be change may just be a
continuation of a larger story or the same discourse in an alternative
form. [Thereby, discourse can appear to change when in reality it has
co-opted elements from another discourse. Normative concepts, such as
'sustainable development', are particularly susceptible to being
co-opted]{.underline} (Christoff, 2013). Exogenous events or crises that
confront the sanctioned discourse can effect a change in discourse.
Pressure from foreign governments or financial/donor institutions may
incentivise a shift in discourse to align with a certain perspective.
[[Actors]{.mark} may also intentionally [try and effect change **through
discursive strategies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such strategies include
constructing narratives and counternarratives, exclusion strategies, as
well as employing normative power and delegitimising tactics. The
success and extent of change is dependent on the power, position and
resources of those seeking to effect the change, and the level of change
being sought (Leipold and Winkel, 2013). [Discourse can be used to
consider **how issues reach** and stay on the political agenda and
become polic]{.underline}y. Discourse can show how broader interests
underlying policies are shaped into physical consequences, which then
indicates policy [direction. [The way discourse is **formulated** shapes
how]{.mark} the problem or [issues]{.mark} around which it is
**constructed [are framed]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[**[interpreted]{.mark}**, [**discussed** and **analysed**]{.mark}.
Therefore, [it implies the favoured solutions]{.mark}, how policies are
to be implemented and their potential success]{.underline} (Crow-Miller,
2015). Policy documents also instruct what needs to be done, what stands
to reason and what is unquestionable (Apthorpe and Gasper, 2014; Bacchi,
2000). Issues are not seen as political problems unless they are
constructed as such by influential actors or society (Hajer, 1995). The
framing of policies can immediately close off some responses while
making others seem self-evident. It is also rare for a problem to be
'solved'. Instead it can be removed from the discourse or discussed as
if it were a different problem. Policies may be utilised to this effect
to constrain the impact of reform initiatives (Bacchi, 2000). The
argumentative approach to discourse holds that policymaking reflects
competition over meaning. Therefore, policies are the result of
competing interests that strategically utilise discourse and is,
therefore, a social phenomenon (Taylor, 2004). Policy discourse is thus
the group of ideas, concepts, frames and definitions that provide
meaning to a real-world phenomenon and structure it as a policy problem
(Hajer, 1995, 2006). Policy creation, change and continuation are held
as an interactive process of discursive struggle between actors.
Policymaking is considered the competition over meaning, with policies
being the result of competing interests that employ discourse
strategically (Taylor, 2004). [[Policy creation]{.mark}, change and
continuation [are interactive processes of **discursive
struggle**]{.mark} between actors. [Through **argument**, actors
position themselves]{.mark} or try to impose their views on to others
[during negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fischer and Forester, 1993).
Institutions can be mobilised and solutions sought once a problem
definition is established (Hajer, 1995). Within policymaking,
[[discourses are **essential** in finding settlements]{.mark} [between
**conflicting interests**]{.mark} and this assists in regulating
underlying social conflicts]{.underline} (Taylor, 2004; Hajer, 1995).
Here, discourse is concerned with redefining a social phenomenon in a
manner that allows a solution to be identified (Hajer, 1995).
[[Discourse can move policies **up or down** the]{.mark} political
[agenda]{.mark} through **depoliticising or securitising**
moves]{.underline} (Zeitoun et al., 2011). Depoliticising the policy
process acts to distance policy makers from the policy\'s impacts
thereby removing responsibility for the policy\'s outcome. Foucault
(2009) utilises the concept of 'political technology' to illustrate how
issues that are essentially political are removed from policy discourse
and reframed in neutral scientific language. The role of expert
knowledge in designing institutional procedures is essential to this
process (Shore and Wright, 1997). When policies become highly
politicised, they become securitised and are regarded as high priority
issues that constitute an issue of national interest and essential to
state sovereignty. As a result, exceptional measures are, or may be,
legitimised (Buzan et al., 1998; Allan and Mirumachi, 2010). The
securitising actor\'s ability to convince the audience and elicit a
certain action/reaction is decisive to the securitisation process
(Mirumachi, 2015). Once a common understanding of a threat is formed
between the securitising actor and the audience, securitisation is held
as successful (Trombetta, 2011). The main objective of a securitising
discourse is to allow potential violations of rules that would not
otherwise be accepted. Threats do not have to be real or in existence
for a securitising act to occur (Stritzel, 2007; Mirumachi, 2015).

#### [Social]{.underline} reality is preceded by [practice]{.underline} and [linguistics]{.underline}. The [performance]{.underline} of the 1AC is [directly involved]{.underline} in the construction of it.

[[Discourses play a]{.mark} **significant [role]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
this process of [**construction** of meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}:
"[[The world is **not objectively accessible**, but]{.mark} instead is
[imparted]{.mark} **through language** [through discursive
processes]{.mark} and symbolic interpretations"]{.underline} (Uther
2014: 60).[2 This means that **much** of the meaning-[construction of
**social reality**]{.mark}, which the brand of social constructivism
espoused here relies upon[, is done through]{.mark} what many authors
call **[discourse]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The frames that are studied in
this analysis are considered as elements in discourse. [Discourse, here,
is understood, following Maarten Hajer, as "an ensemble of ideas,
concepts, and categories through which meaning is given to social and
physical phenomena, and which is produced and reproduced through an
identifiable set of practices"]{.underline} (Hajer 2006: 67). This
captures the simultaneous constructedness and constructiveness of the
social meaning of material objects: [[Through language and practice
humans]{.mark} both [**capture** the]{.mark} meaning material
[objects]{.mark} have, [and]{.mark} **change or [reproduce]{.mark}**
[this meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, [Dryzek defines
[discourse as]{.mark} "a shared way of apprehending the world.
**[Embedded in language]{.mark}**, it [enables those]{.mark} who
subscribe to it [to interpret]{.mark} bits of [information]{.mark} and
put them together into **coherent stories** or accounts]{.underline}"
(Dryzek 2005: 9). This means that meaning is constructed in discourses
in "supra-individual and rather unconscious" ways (Methmann et al.
2013a: 6). At the same time, human actors, in this study, will not be
considered as entities subordinate to a super-human structural power of
discourse. Actors, according to Uther's discussion, are both constructed
and constructing (see Uther 2014: 55). Following her approach, actors
are considered to be the central active agents in any meaning-making
situation, and thus not helpless pawns in the flow of discourse: "[The
actor is not passively subdued to the discourse, as, for example, the
subject of Foucault, but it actively participates in shaping the
discourse through its own interpretive achievements]{.underline}" (Uther
2014: 66).3 This two-fold characterization of actors as both constructed
and constructing is captured by practice theory. The terms 'practice'
and 'discourse' are considered to not be antithetical to each other:
Practices are "meaningful patterns of action, which, in being performed
more or less competently, simultaneously embody, act out, and possibly
reify background knowledge and discourse in and around the material
world" (Adler and Pouliot 2011: 4[). Thus, (non-linguistic) practices
are understood to interact with (linguistic) discourses and in this
interaction construct or deconstruct meanings]{.underline}. [Other
authors reconcile linguistic and non-linguistic elements of
meaning-construction by subsuming both under the term
'discourse']{.underline}(see Anshelm and Hultman 2015: 11; Methmann et
al. 2013a: 6) As Dryzek (2006: 3) argues, "[[discourses ar]{.mark}e a
matter of [**practice** as well as **words**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [for
[actions]{.mark} in the social realm [are **always accompanied** by
language that **establishes the**]{.mark} **meaning** of
[action]{.mark}]{.underline}" (see also Adler 2008: 198). I assume, in
line with these authors, that meaningful action---or practice---and
meaningful talk---or discourse---construct or deconstruct the ideational
meaning of an object. Further, I assume that practice is meaningful
action which acts out certain meanings about the world, thus making it
causally relevant.

For a more radical version of the claim that [[reality itself is
**socially constructed**]{.underline}]{.mark}, yet one that sometimes
(but not always) seems consistent with an ontological framework of
common sense realism, [we can turn to the work of a number of social
psychologists, notably the group known as **discursive
psychologists**]{.underline}. 3 Within the discipline of psychology,
[this approach is marked by]{.underline} [turning its attention away
from the cognitive study of individual minds, which it sees as
inaccessible, towards the study of **our interactions** with each
other]{.underline}. As Jonathan Potter and Margaret Wetherell put it,
"for [research purposes [we are **inevitably faced with
discourse**]{.mark}]{.underline} ... Given the essentially performative
and indexical nature of language use how can researchers construe it as
a neutral record of secondary phenomena, in this case cognitive or
mental states?" (1987: 145). This is a kind of sceptical empiricism that
takes talk as empirically accessible but radically questions claims that
talk tells us anything about what lies behind it: not only whether it
tells us anything about the individual or the mind that is taken by
other psychologists to have produced it, but also whether it tells us
anything about what it purports to be about. From this perspective,
[[our sense]{.mark} of what is real [is a product of
**discourse**]{.mark} **or of rhetoric**]{.underline}. According to
Potter, for example, "[[Reality enters]{.mark} into human practices [by
way of the **categories** and **descriptions**]{.mark} that are part of
those practices]{.underline}. The world is not ready categorized by God
or nature in ways that we are all forced to accept. [[It is
constituted]{.mark} in one way or another [as people
**talk**]{.mark}]{.underline} it, **[[write]{.mark}]{.underline}** it
**[[and argue]{.mark}]{.underline}** it" (1996: 98). From a critical
realist perspective, it is surprising to find these statements
juxtaposed in this way. As Chapter 7 argued, for example, it seems
overwhelmingly likely that there are natural kinds in the world, but
this is a separate question from the question of how we categorize the
things of the world; the relation between natural kinds and linguistic
categories is an open one and a fallible one. Potter's last sentence,
therefore, would be entirely acceptable to realists if it said that the
world was categorized as people talk it, write it, and argue it. But for
a critical realist there is a logical gap between his second sentence
and the argument that the world is constituted in this way. The world is
already constituted, and in the case of ordinary material objects
(disregarding any physical part that humans may have had in their
shaping) this is independent of our talking, writing, and arguing. But
from the kind of perspective adopted by writers like Potter, it seems
that there is nothing we can say about how the world is, independently
of our talking, writing, and arguing, so in discussing how it is
constituted we can only be discussing how our accounts of it are
constituted. Nevertheless, [there is still a sense in here of a basic
realism, a sense that although the world is not ready categorized, it is
nevertheless somehow there before we constitute our accounts of
it]{.underline}. Potter explicitly distances himself from the view that
our descriptions lead to the material world "literally springing in to
existence as it is talked or written about" (1996: 98) in some kind of
"mystical process" (Potter 1996: 177). As Laclau and Mouffe have put it,
"[[What is denied is]{.mark} not that such [objects]{.mark} **exist
externally** to thought, but the rather different assertion that they
[could constitute themselves]{.mark} as objects **[outside]{.mark} any
[discursive conditions]{.mark}** of emergence]{.underline}" (1985: 108).
Burr suggests that Foucault thinks in similar terms: He does not deny
the materiality of events, but says that [our only way of apprehending
reality is through **[discourse]{.mark}**, which **[determines]{.mark}
our [perceptions]{.mark}** [of reality]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a sense,
Foucault brackets off the question of reality. Since [[we can never have
**direct access** to a reality beyond discourse]{.mark} we cannot
concern ourselves with its nature.]{.underline} (2003: 90) This kind of
thinking has been counterposed to realism most provocatively in Edwards,
Ashmore, and Potter's well-known paper 'Death and Furniture', which
seeks to undermine classic realist responses to radical social
constructionism by analysing the rhetoric that is used in them (1995).4
[The paradigm case they examine is that of the **realist** seeking to
demonstrate the existence of material reality by [thumping on a
table]{.mark}. But such thumping, they argue, [is in itself a
**discursive act**]{.mark}: The very act of [producing a]{.mark}
**non-represented, [unconstructed]{.mark}** [external world is]{.mark}
inevitably **representational, [threatening]{.mark}**, as soon as it is
produced, to turn around upon and **counter** the very position it is
meant to demonstrate.]{.underline} Furniture 'arguments' perform
categorization and relevance via semiosis. (Edwards et al. 1995: 27)
[[Realist arguments]{.mark}, they are suggesting, [fail to prove]{.mark}
that there is [a world **beyond discourse** because **they are
themselves** discursive acts]{.mark}]{.underline}, even in the case of
thumping on a table.

Cyber Pearl Harbor in the news

The analysis above provides an account of the emergence and evolution of
cyber Pearl Harbor among elite actors like government officials and
industry experts. But, as James Wirtz notes, the notion of a cyber Pearl
Harbor "is reinforced by recurring media reports" \[22\]. To map how
those [recurring reports foster the public imagination about what cyber
Pearl Harbor entails and the seriousness with which it is
invoked,]{.underline} we performed a content analysis of a sample of 203
articles from U.S. newspapers spanning the period from 1991 to early
2016.

First, cyber Pearl Harbor's 25-year presence in news media reporting has
been marked by certain moments of intense interest that correspond with
the emergence of other prominent national security concerns (see Figure
1). Concern with cyber Pearl Harbor spiked after 1995, declined around
2003 and spiked again in 2011 and 2012. The first uptick in interest
corresponds with U.S. officials' growing concern with the possibility of
mass casualty, new technology-enabled, "new terrorism." Reasons for such
concerns could be found in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 1995
Aum Shinrikyo nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and the 1995
Oklahoma City bombing. The possibility for cyber terrorism piggy-backed
off of concerns about other, similar kinds of terrorism, e.g.,
bioterrorism, agricultural terrorism, etc. (Carter, et al., 1998;
Hoffman, 1998; Laqueur, 1999; Lifton, 1999). Similarly, Secretary
Panetta's public statements drove much of the coverage of cyber Pearl
Harbor in 2011 and 2012. These statements were provoked by a series of
retaliatory cyber attacks on the United States and its Persian Gulf
allies by Iran in response to the U.S.-Israeli Stuxnet attack on Iranian
nuclear facilities. In both cases, increased concern with cyber Pearl
Harbor in the news corresponds with other, pressing (but not necessarily
cyber-related) national security concerns of the day.

Mentions of cyber Pearl Harbor in major U.S. newspapers

Figure 1: Mentions of cyber Pearl Harbor in major U.S. newspapers.

Content analysis also reinforces the importance of our close analysis of
cyber Pearl Harbor's origins because government officials remain
primarily responsible for spreading concern about the possibility of a
cyber Pearl Harbor. An overwhelming 60 percent of cases where cyber
Pearl Harbor received news attention as a realistic threat, government
officials were promoting the idea. Interestingly, in 65 percent of cases
where cyber Pearl Harbor was portrayed as unlikely or unrealistic, news
reports cited private actors such as industry experts, academics, or
journalists (see Figures 2 and 3).

[Officials promoting a cyber Pearl Harbor doomsday find willing allies
in the news media. The vast majority of news stories (77 percent)
presented only the perspective of those promoting the idea of possible
cyber Pearl Harbor]{.underline}. On only a few occasions did news
articles provide a balanced view, including perspectives skeptical of
cyber Pearl Harbor alongside those promoting the idea (three percent),
or providing a purely negative assessment of cyber Pearl Harbor (18
percent; see Figure 4). Interestingly, there has been less skepticism
and more positive reporting about the potential for cyber Pearl Harbor
over time (see Figure 5).

Figure 5: Cyber Pearl Harbor sentiment over time.

As we might expect based on the analysis of key texts above, news
coverage of cyber Pearl Harbor is largely unclear about just who might
carry out such an attack (see Figure 6). In a 38 percent plurality of
articles, the potential perpetrator (threat subject) is illusive and
unspecified. Next is a laundry list combination of perpetrators at 27
percent, meaning that in over half the mentions of a cyber Pearl Harbor
no one is quite sure who is actually planning to implement such a
tactic. Only at the most abstract levels can patterns suggest that an
evolution in thinking about cyber Pearl Harbor has occurred. Generally,
more concern is expressed over non-state actors; however, over time news
articles demonstrate an increasing concern with states (see Figure 7).

Cyber Pearl Harbor threat subjects

Figure 7: Cyber Pearl Harbor threat subjects (State vs. non-state),
1991--2016.

In media reports that sustain the concern over cyber Pearl Harbor, like
the key texts that promoted it, civilian infrastructure experiences the
greatest likelihood of being a target of such an attack with 55 percent
of mentions. However, there are also a significant number of articles
that do not specify a target for such an attack or merely provide a
laundry list of potential targets (35 percent), which has the effect of
leaving the question of referent object, or who and what is at risk,
largely unanswered (see Figure 8).

Cyber Pearl Harbor: Referent objects

Figure 8: Cyber Pearl Harbor: Referent objects.

The last notable similarity between key texts and news articles is
promoting the seriousness of the cyber Pearl Harbor threat by pointing
to prior cyber incidents or vulnerabilities (41 percent). Fictional
scenarios (15 percent) and reference to non-cyber events (nine percent)
are also deployed as reason for concern about cyber Pearl Harbor. Most
problematic, however, is that many news articles (24 percent) provide no
clear reason or evidence at all in support of the idea that cyber Pearl
Harbor is realistic or likely (see Figure 9).

Analogy, framing, and fear

Mapping the use of cyber Pearl Harbor in both elite stakeholder
discourse and broader media coverage in our analysis highlights the
ubiquity of its use and the preferred meanings that have attached to the
analogy over time. [The enduring nature of these meanings and uses has
consequences for the cyber security terrain that they shape. Various
observers, including promoters of the idea of a cyber Pearl Harbor, like
John Hamre, have worried, rightly we will argue, that the metaphor's use
might have **negative implications for our ability to understand and
respond appropriately to contemporary cyber threats**.]{.underline} This
is a risk made more prescient by the 2016 interference by Russia in U.S.
election systems and its campaign of information warfare carried out by
social media manipulation and other cyber tactics.

[Decades of research in a number of disciplines, from cognitive science
to communication studies and more, argue that language and rhetoric has
an important structuring effect on how we see and respond to the world
around us; that "language, perception, and knowledge are inextricably
intertwined"]{.underline} \[23\]. Far from being "a matter of \... mere
words," leading researchers Lakoff and Johnson argue that, "human
thought [processes are largely metaphorical \... the human conceptual
system is metaphorically structured and defined" \[24\]. But, this is
not just an individual affair; our use of language helps "to structure
collective, human knowledge" and to "bridge the gap between individual
human cognition and collective understanding and action"]{.underline}
(Lawson, 2012). What's more, like potato chips, with metaphors it is
hard to have just one. This is because individual metaphors often come
with "entailments" that necessarily implicate other, related metaphors
\[25\]. Even more important is that because metaphors can also operate
as normative "structuring devices" \[26\], they can entail, "often
covertly and insidiously, natural 'solutions'" \[27\]. [The **language
we use,** our metaphors and analogies, **can enable or constrain our
perceptions and understanding of the world** around us, as well as our
avenues of possible action in response \[28\].]{.underline}

Military and national security professionals have increasingly
recognized the importance of language, including metaphor and analogy,
for correctly framing and responding to national security threats. Top
leaders in these services have promoted this idea and, in the case of
the Army, have incorporated it into official doctrine and officer
education (Mattis, 2008; U.S. Department of the Army, 2015; School of
Advanced Military Studies, n.d.). As a consequence, the cyber security
debate has not been immune to this rhetorical turn in national security
discourse. As early as 1997, Martin Libicki worried about the use of
facile metaphors in the information warfare debates of the day. He
warned, "To use metaphor in place of analysis verges on intellectual
abuse. It invites the unquestioning extension of a logic that works
across the looking glass but lacks explanatory power in the real world.
Those who forget this are apt to try to make their metaphors do their
thinking for them" \[29\].

More recently, U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and its former parent
organization, U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), officially recognized
the critical importance of language and analogy for understanding cyber
threats and then developing and carrying out a cyber strategy. In 2009,
USSTRATCOM released The Cyber Warfare Lexicon. The document began with a
series of epigraphs. The first, from Dee Hock, read, "Language is only
secondarily the means by which we communicate, it is primarily the means
by which we think." The second informed readers, "You can't talk about a
subject if you don't have the words. And, some psychologists would
argue, you can't even think about it. At least not very productively."
And finally, the document quoted Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper (USMC, Ret.) as
saying, "The seeming inability to express ideas clearly, loose use of
words, and ill-considered invention of other terms have damaged the
military lexicon to the point that it interferes with effective
professional military discourse." \[30\]

In the world of cyber warfare, appropriate conceptual tools and
metaphors for navigating emergent threats comes with the highest stakes:

"Without a shared understanding of the accurate meanings of a
significant number of frequently used terms, it will be difficult to
make progress on the more complex and unresolved technical and
operational issues for non-traditional weapons: actionable requirements,
technical and operational assurance, effective mission planning
techniques, and meaningful measures of effectiveness." \[31\]

Recognizing the gravity of this concern USCYBERCOM launched the Cyber
Analogies Project at the Naval Postgraduate School in 2012 with the
mission "to assist U.S. Cyber Command in identifying and developing
relevant historical, economic, and other useful metaphors that could be
used to enrich the discourse about cyber strategy, doctrine, and policy"
\[32\]. Ultimately, the report argues that appropriate "analogies,
metaphors, and parables" are necessary to facilitate learning,
communicating, and "winning H.G. Well's 'race between education and
catastrophe'" \[33\].

Second, we also [know that news media not only plays an important role
in **promoting policy-makers'** preferred agendas and problem frames for
a wider public, but also in shaping policy-makers' understanding of the
world.]{.underline} In this literature, "frames" are "schemata of
interpretation" for individuals and groups to "locate, perceive,
identify, and label" occurrences and events \[34\]. These "interpretive
frameworks embedded in media messages" aid individuals and groups in
"forming political attitudes and value judgments" by "evok\[ing\] as
well as constrain\[ing\] the interpretative activities of audiences"
\[35[\]. Policy-makers are not immune from such effects; "In some such
cases the media can participate in a positive feedback loop, which
drives upward policymaking attention and outcomes very rapidly" (Wolfe,
et al., 2013). This feedback loop is at work in the case of cyber Pearl
Harbor too. Peter Singer of Brookings has been extremely critical of
this situation, saying,]{.underline}

"\[T\]here is the histrionic --- the "get scared" --- category \[of
cyber security writing\], then repeated back in the wider media, such as
through the half-million references to "cyber 9/11." Journalists need to
be more discerning consumers when they hear that kind of thing. There is
a joke in our field that there should be a drinking game based on any
time someone references a "cyber Pearl Harbor." More seriously, when
someone says that, journalists should be prepared to follow up. Those
phrases are the bumper stickers, not the end of the statement or
argument. Yet they are used in business pitches, governmental speeches
and Congressional hearings in that way. We've been caught between this
state of ignorance and this fear factor. That's not a good place for
anybody, either in the public space or on the journalistic side."
(Singer and Wihbey, 2014)

[There is reason to believe that reliance on cyber Pearl Harbor to frame
our thinking and responses has had **real, negative
impacts**.]{.underline} General Alexander's internal 2012 memo about
preventing a cyber Pearl Harbor indicates that this analogy and metaphor
is not merely used by officials in public speeches, which is then picked
up and repeated uncritically in news media, but that it also feeds back
into the system of internal cyber security discourse and strategizing as
a device that structures official thinking and planning behind the
scenes (Alexander, 2012). We got a preview of those in 1996 in Sen.
Nunn's questioning of DCI Deutch, whose understanding of cyber threats
had been shaped by the vision of cyber Pearl Harbor and whose "natural"
solutions entailed militarization, deterrence, and even offense.

[But there is reason to be concerned that these public appeals to fear
of catastrophic cyber Pearl Harbor may also have negative impacts on
discourse and decision-making more broadly. The continuing use of cyber
Pearl Harbor, despite recognition of its failures, is exemplary of the
fact that policy-makers and news media often rely on appeals to fear in
their efforts to promote a policy agenda and frame issues for the public
and themselves]{.underline} (Altheide, 2006, 2002; Glassner, 1999).
However, a growing body of research in communication studies (Peters, et
al., 2013; Pfau, 2007; Walton, 2000; Witte, 1996; Witte and Allen,
2000), psychology \[36\], and even information security (Lee, et al.,
2006; Herath and Rao, 2009; Pfleeger and Caputo, 2012; Siponen, et al.,
2014; Boss, et al., 2015), demonstrates that such rhetoric can have a
negative impact. [One recent study suggests that depictions of cyber
doom scenarios in popular media "can lead to a sense of fatalism and
demotivation to act" and "could impair efforts to motivate appropriate
policy responses to genuine cyber security threats" \[37\].]{.underline}

Similarly, there is evidence to support Healey's concern that constant
worry about cyber Pearl Harbor has distracted us from the real threats
we face, both cyber and non-cyber. In the cyber realm, Peter Singer
writes, "Indeed, while the focus of US debate is more frequently on
fears of a so-called 'digital Pearl Harbor', the more serious problem
may actually be a long-term economic 'death by a thousand cuts'."
\[38\]. Likewise, we can see repeated examples over the years of
officials and experts warning of imminent cyber doom, or even ranking
cyber threats higher than threats of terrorism or weapons of mass
destruction, all while the real world continues to defy their
predictions (Lawson, 2016). While officials and experts worried about
cyber terror attacks against the World Trade Center, al-Qa'ida plotted
to bring down the Twin Towers with box cutters and airplanes.
Nonetheless, we worried that "the next attack" would certainly be a
cyber attack. But still terrorists attacked using cars, bombs, guns, and
their very bodies. In more recent times, we have been warned that state
adversaries would soon carry out a cyber Pearl Harbor, or perhaps that
they already have, as when Director of NSA called the North Korea hack
of Sony a cyber Pearl Harbor. Meanwhile, in reality, the North Koreans
have stunned the world with their brazen tests of missiles and nuclear
weapons. For their part, in cyberspace, the Russians have not carried
out catastrophic cyber attacks on the U.S. power grid, but have instead
attempted to manipulate the U.S. presidential election in a manner to
which Washington seems unprepared to respond.

++++++++++

Conclusion

For 25 years, cyber Pearl Harbor has remained a go-to analogy and
metaphor for officials and others looking to raise awareness of, and
motivate a response to, perceived cyber threats. Because of this
effective service life, Cyber Pearl Harbor is not going away any time
soon, no matter how inaccurate it is as a descriptive device. This is
because its rhetorical force and appeal are not a product of its ability
to accurately describe, but rather, of its users' belief, rightly or
wrongly, that the fear it evokes in listeners can call attention to and
motivate a response to cyber threats, whatever their true nature may be.
[On the other hand, our ongoing, incorrect use of this analogy may have
set in motion a **self-fulfilling prophecy of militarization**,
including development and use of offensive cyber capabilities, which may
have actually made the kinds of scenarios envisioned in cyber Pearl
Harbor rhetoric more, rather than less, likely.]{.underline} More
research is needed, however, that traces the ongoing use of the cyber
Pearl Harbor analogy since 2016, as well as its resonance with public
audiences.

In the face of increasing criticism combined with an ongoing penchant
for appealing to fear, one option for the future of cyber Pearl Harbor
is rehabilitation through redefinition. This involves redefining cyber
Pearl Harbor as many small attacks, or even large attacks, that occur
but somehow go unnoticed. In short, it involves exaggerating the impacts
of actual events, as when the NSA Director called the hack of Sony a
cyber Pearl Harbor in February 2015 (Lyngaas, 2015). Examples of this
rhetorical move have been ubiquitous over the years (Deutch, 1996;
Blitstein, 2007; Singel, 2009; Censer, 2012; Whitlock, 2014; Geraghty,
2015; Weisman, 2015; Robb, 2015; Carman, 2015). But, as Tim Stevens
notes, these kinds of redefinitions of cyber Pearl Harbor serve to
"pluralize\[\] the previously singular 'event' and locat\[e\] them
across multiple sectors \... The integrity of the historical event is
subverted still further by reference to the possibility of multiple
'small-scale' digital Pearl Harbors." In particular, he calls Clarke's
assertion of daily digital Pearl Harbors "an idiosyncratic leap of logic
too far, which all but destroyed any sensible use of the metaphor"
\[39\]. It is hard to see, therefore, how redefining and "pluralizing"
cyber Pearl Harbor will clarify our understanding of the real threats we
face.

In the end, we would prefer to see the analogy abandoned altogether.
What's more, there is no shortage of other, potentially more appropriate
and useful analogies and metaphors that may be enlisted to help us think
about cyber security challenges. These can include other forms of
conflict or weapons systems like piracy, counterinsurgency, political
warfare, biological weapons, or even non-war analogies and metaphors
such as the immune systems, public health, ecosystems, or complex
adaptive systems. A number of scholars, technologists, and policy-makers
have begun to think along these lines, offering many possibilities for
moving away from the stale, inaccurate, and potentially detrimental
threat of a cyber Pearl Harbor (Charney, 2011; McMorrow, 2010; Liles,
2010; U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2011; Lapointe, 2011;
Lawson, 2012; Axelrod, 2014; Jensen, et al., 2019).

[The importance of language and rhetoric for appropriately framing and
responding to problems is abundantly clear.]{.underline} Increasingly,
military and national security professionals are coming to this
understanding as well. [This includes those who are wrestling with
complex problems like threats to cyber security, where there is
increasing recognition that hyperbolic analogies and metaphors like
cyber Pearl Harbor are not only inadequate, but **may actually be
harmful to our ability to understand** and respond to the cyber threats
we face today.]{.underline} It is our hope that the research presented
here can aid scholars and policy makers in understanding the emergence,
evolution, and persistence of the cyber Pearl Harbor analogy as a first
step towards developing more appropriate and productive frames for
navigating cyber security threats.

### 2NC\-\--AT: Security Doesn't Shape Reality

#### Specifically, [securitization]{.underline} shapes reality.

Giovanni **Ercolani 11**, Ph.D., member of the "Centre for Energy and
Environment Security" (Nottingham Trent University, UK), Thesis Adviser
at the "Peace Operations Training Institute" (USA), 2011, "Keeping
Security and Peace: Behind the Strategicalization of NATO\'s Critical
Security Discourse," Security Strategies Year: 7 Issue: 14 \[ML\]

I have based my methodological approach on the assumption that
"[['Security']{.mark} is the move that [takes politics beyond
the]{.mark} established [rules]{.mark} of the game and frame the issue
either as a special kind of politics or as above politics.
Securitization can thus be seen as a more extreme version of
politicization]{.underline}. In theory, [[**any** public issue can
be]{.mark} located on the [spectrum ranging from]{.mark}
[non-politicized]{.mark}]{.underline} (meaning the state does not deal
with it and it is not in any other way made an issue of public debate
and decision) through politicized (meaning the issue is part of public
policy, requiring government decision and resource allocations or, more
rarely, some other form of communal governance) [[to securitized]{.mark}
(meaning [the issue is presented as an]{.mark} [**existential
threat**,]{.mark} requiring **emergency measures** and [justifying
action **outside**]{.mark} **the [normal bounds]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
political [procedure]{.mark}]{.underline})" (Buzan, Waever, de Wilde,
1998, p.23-24). Then it is extremely clear how [the process of
[securitization becomes a **political process**]{.mark} in which the
**narrative** has its primary importanc]{.underline}e. "[[The
**process**]{.mark} **of securitization** [is what in language theory is
called a **speech act**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [is not interesting as
a sign referring to something more real; [it is the utterance
itself]{.mark} that is the act. [By **saying the words**, something is
done]{.mark} (like betting, giving a promise, [naming a ship]{.mark})"
(Buzan, Weaver, de Wilde, 1998, p. 26]{.underline}). But whereas "by
saying the words, something is done", [in this specific case of
"securitization", [when we use the very word "security]{.mark}",
something more is done: [an **emotional element** has been added]{.mark}
to the narrative.]{.underline} Here I will use a discourse analysis lens
because discourse analysis represents a general term for a number of
approaches to analysing written, spoken, signed language use or any
significant semiotic event. Indeed, I could say that like Don Quixote
and Sancho Panza (the two fictional figures of the famous book of Miguel
de Cervantes Saavedra) our condition is to be completely surrounded and
immersed into stories. Stories which are told to us through the use of a
language, images, media, etc\... However, [the story can be a language
because "[language itself conditions, limits, and predetermines what we
see]{.mark}. Thus, [**all reality is constructed** through
language]{.mark}, so that nothing is simply 'there' in an
unproblematic]{.underline} way -- everything is a linguistic/textual
construct. [**[Language]{.mark}** does not record reality; it shapes and
[creates it]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} so that the whole of our
universe is textual" (Barry, 2002). Moreover, when we look at our
capacity to memorize, neuroscience has proved that "the brain has two
memory systems, one for ordinary facts and one for emotionally charged
ones" (Goleman, 1996), and indeed our brain is formed by two opposite
hemispheres, the right and the left one.

#### Security rhetoric shapes reality and legitimize policy actions that construct imagined threats

**Wilhelmsen 2017** (Julie Wilhelmsen, Senior fellow at the Norwegian
Institute of International Affairs, "How does war become a legitimate
undertaking? Re-engaging the post-structuralist foundation of
securitization theory", <https://www.jstor.org/stable/48512937>)
//sethlee

The core insight of Copenhagen School ST is that [[**issues can become
'securitized**']{.mark} when 'securitizing actors'[, by means of
rhetorical strategies, elevate them to the status of an existential
threat]{.mark} to a referent object and when a significant audience
accepts this representation of the issue]{.underline} (Buzan, 1997:
5--28). [[This process generates endorsement for emergency measures
beyond rules]{.underline}]{.mark} that would otherwise bind (Wæver,
1995a). The general thrust of the argument underlying this description
of the securitization process is in many respects in line with
post-structuralist ideas of how [[**policies are coconstituted by
identities** and rely on **accounts** that]{.mark} make sense of them
**and [legitimize them as they are launched]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Campbell, 1992; Hansen, 2006). The post-structuralist stance is tha[t
[policies are]{.mark} not a given response to an external reality to
which the state]{.underline} (or other social actors) [relates
objectively, but **[are co-constituted by ideas or identities]{.mark}**.
References to identities are necessary to represent and legitimize
policies]{.underline}, but at the same time these identities are
constituted and reproduced through the formulation of policies. This is
why the term 'co-constituted' is used. When the production of politics
is understood in this way the task for the analyst is to 'embrace a
logic of interpretation that acknowledges the improbability of
cataloguing, calculating and specifying "real causes" and concerns
itself with considering the manifest political consequences of adopting
one mode of representation over another' (Campbell, 1992: 4).
[**[Studying politics]{.mark}** then **[involves studying how some
representations of reality become dominant
discourses]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and how problems, [subjects and
objects are constituted in these discourses]{.underline} that
simultaneously indicate relevant policies to pursue. The claim is not
that such [[dominant representations]{.mark}]{.underline} cause certain
policies or actions, but that they both [**[open up]{.mark}** and
constrain [the range of **policies and actions** that seem possible and
**legitimate**]{.mark} to undertake]{.underline} (Hansen, 2006). [This
link between identity and policies can be conceptualized more explicitly
as one of legitimation.]{.underline} [[Jackson]{.underline}]{.mark}
(2006: 16) [[sees legitimation as: the process of drawing and
(re)establishing boundaries]{.mark}, ruling some courses of action
acceptable and others unacceptable]{.underline}. Out of the general
morass of public political debate[, [legitimation]{.mark} contingently
[stabilizes the boundaries of acceptable action, **making it possible
for certain policies to be enacted.**]{.mark} 'The process of drawing
and (re)establishing boundaries']{.underline} is here taken to be the
continuous references to Self and Other that policy formulation implies
and which, in turn, legitimates policy implementation. [Based on [this
understanding]{.mark} of how policies are produced and legitimized, a
poststructuralist approach [would imply treating securitization as a
process through]{.mark} which a [representation]{.mark} of something as
an existential [threat becomes dominant at the expense of]{.mark} other
representations and [uncovering]{.mark}]{.underline}, in the course of
research, [the changing boundary between this [identity]{.mark} and that
given to the 'referent object']{.underline}. These changing
representations would not determine emergency action, but would
condition the range of emergency measures political actors could
undertake legitimately. In turn, the undertaking of such emergency
measures against the something that is said to be threatening and in
defence of the referent object would confirm and reinforce the new
identity boundaries that were drawn up and legitimize the undertaking of
emergency measures. [From a poststructuralist perspective the process of
securitization is a fundamentally co-constitutive process and one that
implies legitimizing concrete material security practices]{.underline}
(see below). [This reading suggests that
[securitization]{.mark}]{.underline} cannot be treated as a sequential,
linear process from securitizing actor through audience acceptance and
to emergency measures. Rather, it [i[s a]{.underline}]{.mark} [much more
[dynamic development; securitizing actors,]{.mark}]{.underline} referent
object, [[threat objects as well as]{.mark} exceptional [measures are
co-constituted within the securitizing process]{.mark}]{.underline}.4

### 2NC\-\--AT: Reality

This is what Jacques Derrida discussed as "deconstruction" ― the
reversal of established hierarchies, the introduction of new
oppositions, the attempt to expose repressed terms and to challenge the
natural and inevitable status of seemingly dichotomous pairs.5 Applying
the deconstructivist tools to the notion of the self we realize that
there is no one there. Deconstruction reveals "the metaphysics of
presence" ― the illusion that we are present to ourselves, as though,
beneath all the empirical jetsam and emotional flotsam, there really
were a person, ready and complete.6 There can be no "freedom" and no
"authenticity," as Judith Butler explains, since "the ascription of
interiority is itself a publicly regulated and sanctioned form of
essence fabrication."7 The notion of the ever-present subject is one of
the foundational myth of modern society ― as propounded by René
Descartes, Immanuel Kant, and others ― and it is the metaphysical basis
on which modern individuals make their often preposterous claims to
power, rights and attention.8 When applied to the study of international
politics, [this position turns into a critique of the state, or rather,
a critique of sovereignty]{.underline}. There is no state, say
post-structural international relations scholars such as Cynthia Weber
and David Campbell, at least if we take the state to constitute a
pre-existing subject to which sovereignty can be attached as an
attribute.9 Focusing on "institutions," the "people," or perhaps on the
state as a transcendental idea, mainstream accounts always presuppose
that which they intend to prove. Instead
[s[overeignty]{.underline}]{.mark} [must be understood as [the process
through which]{.mark} political [subjects]{.mark} come to [constitute
themselves]{.mark} as such.]{.underline} "I suggest," says Weber, "[that
sovereign nation-states are not pre-given subjects but in process and
that [all subjects]{.mark} in process (be they individual or collective)
[are the **ontological effects** of practices which are **performatively
enacted**]{.mark}]{.underline}."10 Weber\'s idea of "performatively
enacted practices" needs further elucidation.1 Even if we reject the
idea of a pre-given self, there is certainly the illusion of such a
being, and the question thus becomes how that illusion arose. According
to poststructural theory, [[the self is created through]{.mark}
**reiterative [linguistic practices]{.mark}**. La[nguage **precedes**
the]{.mark} human [subject]{.mark}, they explain; [we are **born into
language**]{.mark}, and [language is]{.mark} best understood as [a
semiotic structure]{.mark} where the meaning of each word is constituted
by its difference from other words]{.underline}. It is, as Ferdinand
Saussure once argued, the structure as a whole that ultimately
determines what things mean. According to performativity theorists, in
other words, structure is to practice as langue is to parole; as the
abstract rules that make possible the production of grammatical
sentences, that is, are to the production of an actual sentence.12 [A
structure, like langue, is a complex of rules with a virtual existence
whereas [practice, like speech, is an **enactment of**]{.mark} **these
[rules]{.mark}** in space and time]{.underline}. But a semiotic
structure is not yet a sovereign self. We move closer to the subject
once we realize that [[words]{.mark} do not only mean things but also
**[do things in the world]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[Words have]{.mark}
what John Austin\'s in How to Do Things with Words, 1962, called **[a
"perlocutionary force]{.mark}**."]{.underline}13 The proverbial example
is the "I do" of the wedding ceremony. By speaking the words, you are
not merely conveying meaning, you are also doing something, you are
constituting a marriage. The words are performed and thereby enacted.14
Adding to Austin\'s conclusions, Derrida emphasizes what he calls the
"citational" quality of even the most pragmatic forms of language use.
That is, [the texts we invoke always cite seemingly absent contexts from
which they ultimately derive their meaning.]{.underline} "Could a
performative utterance succeed," Derrida asks, if its formulation did
not repeat a "coded" or iterable utterance, or in other words, if the
formula I pronounce in order to open a meeting, launch a ship or a
marriage were not identifiable as conforming with an iterable model, if
it were not then identifiable in some way as a "citation"?15 This is how
the subject comes to constitute itself. "[[The subject is **inscribed**
in language]{.underline},]{.mark} is a \'function\' of language,
[[becomes a]{.mark} speaking [subject only by making its speech
conform]{.mark} ... [to]{.mark} the system of the [rules of
language]{.mark} as a system of differences]{.underline}."16 [[The human
subject is]{.mark} "a being [devoid]{.mark} of Being [until it is
organized]{.mark} by a system of codes]{.underline}."17 This is an
argument further developed by Judith Butler.18 Our identities take
shape, she says, through the perlocutionary force of the discourse we
apply to ourselves. Talking about the being that we take our selves to
be, we quote statements that connote normalcy and imply acceptance much
as a lawyer might cite supporting precedents in a court of law. [[By
making performative statements]{.mark}, and applying them to ourselves,
[a certain person **comes into being**]{.mark};]{.underline}
[performativity is "a compulsory reiteration of those norms through
which a subject is constituted"; "subjectivity is performatively
constituted by the ritualized production or codified social
behavior]{.underline}."19 These statements, says Butler, are not only
repetitive and ritualistic but also socially determined. If we misquote
the established discourse and fail to construct an appropriate self for
ourselves, we are punished through various, often surprisingly severe,
social sanctions.20

#### The 1AC is a [theatrical]{.underline} performance of international relations that [discursively]{.underline} brings the state into [existence]{.underline}.

Erik **Ringmar, 14**, a professor in the Department of Political Science

Yet [[performances]{.mark} do not only [take place in]{.mark} theaters,
but also **in [society at large]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Social
interaction is to a considerable extent a matter of presenting oneself
before others on any of the many small stages constituted by daily
interpersonal interaction.96 Here too we project an imaginary self, a
person we would like to be, and we ask the people observing us to
recognize us under this description. In the process we build sociality
and inauthenticity into our being. It is easy to be disgusted with this
spectacle, especially of course if the performance goes badly and we
fail to receive the kind of recognition we feel we deserve. For this
reason the playacting self, its antics and its fate, have often been a
source of mournful laments. "[Life\'s but a walking shadow, a poor
player,]{.underline}" as Shakespeare\'s Macbeth put it, "[That struts
and frets his hour upon the stage]{.underline}."97 And Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, scathing in his criticism of the superficiality and decadence
of Parisian high-society, was equally scathing of the theater which he
saw as a threat to a more natural, more rural and thereby more
authentic, way of life.98 Yet what Rousseau wished for is not available.
[[Away from the]{.mark} many [small stages]{.mark} of everyday life[,
the self]{.mark}, as we know it, **[does not exist]{.mark}**. But
performances are presented also on **a larger stage** as [social and
political events are made to]{.mark} happen, and to [appear, in a
certain manner]{.mark}]{.underline}.99 We can talk of "public
performances" as staged events through which imaginary blends of social
facts and visions are presented to vast audiences, perhaps to entire
societies, at the same time. [[Through]{.mark} the **public
[performance]{.mark}** [the world is cast in a]{.mark} **certain
[form]{.mark}** [and held up]{.mark} for our contemplation; something is
discovered, something is remembered or exposed]{.underline}.[100
Examples include [a terrorist attack]{.mark} on a building in a major
city; [an attempt to "shock]{.mark} and awe" [a]{.mark} civilian
[population]{.mark}; the signing of a peace treaty by two former
enemies; the funeral of a world leader]{.underline}; the diplomatic
rituals shared by members of the same international system.101 But make
no mistake, [[these are not]{.mark} the performative
[reiterations]{.mark} of discursive practices. Public
[performances]{.mark} are originals, not citations; they **[involve
all]{.mark} the [senses]{.mark}** [and engage **all neurological
systems**]{.mark}**,** not just the literal-minded mind]{.underline}.
The way we, as members of the audience, react to these public
performances may often surprise us. We scream at a rock concert; we
raise our fists at a political rally, or we speak in tongues at a
religious convocation. These are physical reactions, performed by us to
be sure, yet they are in a sense not ours. They may be referred to as
cases of "mass hysteria," or as examples of "conversion syndrome," but
we could also say that [they are the reactions of a shared, a public,
body.102 It is in this public performance and in this public body that
we come across ourselves as a society. It is also here that we find the
state. [The state]{.mark} ― pace Weber, Campbell, Derrida and Butler ―
[is not]{.mark} **declared into existence** through [the iteration of
texts]{.mark}, but [neither is it]{.mark} abolished through [military
interventions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, in next to all cases,
before independence could be declared it had to be fought for. People
had to present themselves to themselves and to others as willing to risk

#### Rhetorical framing is the key factor in solving debates on public policy

University, professor of Political Science and International Studies at
the University of Queensland in Australia, *"Wicked Problems in Public
Policy"* Chapter 1: Debates in Public Policy---Problem Framing,
Knowledge, and Interests, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-94580-0//ekc

Introduction to Problem Framing

This chapter provides a brief background about public policy in
democratic political systems, and especially [the central importance of
how policy problems are 'framed' by various actors in policy
debates]{.underline}. This background sets the scene for the main
discussion (in Chapter 2) of the 'wicked problems' framework. It also
provides a foundation for later analysis (in Chapter 3) of policy
instruments for achieving policy goals and the institutional capacities
required for successfully tackling complex problems.

[Disagreements arise among stakeholders about the nature of policy
problems and how to address them.]{.underline} These divergent
viewpoints are [shaped by different assumptions, values, and
interests]{.underline}. These [differences of perspective have major
impacts on policy decision-making and implementation, because the way a
problem is defined or interpreted]{.underline} tends to correlate with
particular remedial actions to address the identified problem.

The fundamental proposition in this chapter is that divergent 'framing'
of policy problems generates conflict about the nature of these problems
and about how to address them. [Competing policy perspectives and
viewpoints are inevitable. These differences are often entrenched or
resistant to change, owing to their complex anchoring in values,
interests, emotions and ideological assumptions. Such
perspectives]{.underline} about the nature of the issue, and about
actions to be taken, are not derived from the 'agreed facts' about an
issue -- they are more likely to be influenced by a combination of
ideological orientations, economic interests, political identities,
professional or managerial assumptions, and past institutional legacies
(Edelman, 1988; Majone, 1989; Head, 2010a; Cairney, 2016). T[he role of
'evidence-informed' analysis and expertise can be important, but is only
part of the policy process (]{.underline}Head, 2016).

In democratic systems, public policy debates are focused on the
'problems' that stakeholders claim require greater public attention.
Deborah Stone argues that an issue only becomes a public policy
'problem' when groups demand that action be taken; and when plausible
stories are advanced concerning the causes and remedies for the problem
(Stone, 1989, p. 299). The agenda-setting aspects of public policy
debates are essentially arguments about the nature and urgency of policy
problems and how to address them. Scoping the problems, proposing
feasible solutions, and mobilising support for priority actions, are
three important and closely related dimensions of the policy development
process (Crowley et al., 2020; Kingdon, 1995; Majone, 1989). In every
jurisdiction, diverse political actors, stakeholders and advocates are
continually striving to place their key issues on the policy agenda for
further debate and thus the consideration of decision-makers. The types
of problems that attract public attention shift over time, depending on
changes in leadership, changes in socio-economic conditions, changes in
communication technologies, and changes in the design of policy programs
and service systems.

The modern policy analysis literature---whether in health, education,
criminology or environment---emphasises the importance of problem
definitions or perceptions in influencing how policy debates unfold.
'[Framing' here refers to how an issue or problem is defined and
presented to wider audiences, as part of the process of setting policy
agendas and priorities. Problem framing is about how actors attempt to
persuade other citizens and decision-makers about the nature and
significance of issues under discussion]{.underline} (van Hulst & Yanow,
2016). It is clear that very [different stories tend to emerge about the
causes and severity of the problems]{.underline} (and therefore the
preferred actions to tackle the problems). 'Framing' is about how
actors' understandings of problems, contexts and responses are
articulated, represented through narratives, and [further shaped through
interaction]{.underline} (Fischer, 2003, p. 144). Schön and Rein
consider framing 'a way of selecting, organising, interpreting and
making sense of a complex reality to provide guideposts for knowing,
analysing, persuading and acting' (Schön & Rein, 1994, p. 146). [Framing
is also central for articulating the core values and identities that
underlie social movements seeking policy change---for example, those
advocating for substantive civil rights and non-discrimination on the
basis of gender, religion or ethnicity]{.underline} (Benford & Snow,
2000). Under modern conditions in a democratic society with diverse
media channels and technologies available to citizens, the fragmentation
of media framings may generate 'preference-based reinforcement' (or
group-think) among each of these media audiences (Cacciatore et al.,
2016) rather than generalised impacts across the mass population.

Rittel and Webber argued that [problem framing had become more difficult
under modern conditions of social pluralism and political
communication]{.underline}. By now we are all beginning to realize that
one of the most intractable problems is that of defining problems (of
knowing what distinguishes an observed condition from a desired
condition) and of locating problems (finding where in the complex causal
networks the trouble really lies). In turn, and equally intractable, is
the problem of identifying the actions that might effectively narrow the
gap between what-is and what-ought-to-be. (Rittel & Webber 1973, p. 159)

The dynamics of problem framing are important for many reasons,
including [the close connection generally found between how a problem is
defined]{.underline} (or 'structured') [by stakeholders and the
preferred solutions they propose]{.underline} (Dery, 1984; Gusfield,
1989). [Peters demonstrates that specific policy 'problems' (such as
environmental pollu]{.underline}tion) [emerge under specific political
conditions and institutional contexts (Peters, 2005]{.underline}). He
shows how the problems are interpreted by various actors in the light of
issue histories, the balance of key participants, and their dominant
ideologies and interests. [The way a problem is framed by stakeholders
and decisionmakers is strongly correlated with their preferences for
specific policy tools]{.underline} (e.g. market-based instruments vs
state regulation).

Thus[, the way problems are interpreted is closely tied to proposed
solutions recommended by various government agencies]{.underline},
business groups and community stakeholders. To take an everyday example,
poverty and economic inequality are widely seen as conditions of life in
most countries. [However, despite apparent agreement that poverty is a
'real' and ongoing problem, there are very different underlying
narratives about the causes of poverty, the degree of urgency, and the
proposed solutions.]{.underline} If poverty is seen as an
individual-centred problem (generated by deficits in personal skills and
motivation), the proposed solutions will be oriented towards encouraging
individuals to take more responsibility for their unfortunate situation
and challenging them to develop their work skills and their 'achievement
orientation'. However, if poverty is seen as an enduring structural
feature of society (generated by impersonal market forces which
primarily benefit wealthy elites), the solutions proposed might be
oriented towards political action to improve employment security and the
public funding of social services. In the same way, people enmeshed in
long-term unemployment can be seen either as unwilling to grasp
opportunities to develop new skills, or alternatively can be seen as the
unfortunate victims of structural and technological change.

[Debates about the nature and causes of problems provide the foundations
for considering policy solutions and governance arrangements. Bacchi
argues that the assumptions underlying policy arguments need to be
carefully scrutinised. Policy dynamics can best be understood by
'problematising' the assumptions,]{.underline} interests and values
underlying each viewpoint, and by identifying the likely impacts of
adopting one position rather than another (Bacchi, 2009). Her critical
analysis of social policy fields reveals some of the hidden interests
and value assumptions embedded in mainstream social policy programs,
including youth welfare, drugs policy, immigration, education and equal
opportunity.

According to the policy analysis literature, [policy debates always
include key moments when the nature and scope of problems are intensely
disputed and redefined]{.underline} (Dery, 1984). The contest over
problem definitions and priorities evolves over time, [constituting the
contemporary public policy agenda]{.underline}. This agenda-setting
process is crucial, [because it shapes the selection of issues deemed
worthy of attention, the manner in which they are
considered]{.underline}, the nature of solutions regarded as feasible
and supportable, and ultimately the pattern of winners and losers in
various policy fields (Kingdon, 1995; Stone, 2012). [Agenda-setting
involves the exercise of power and influence, conducted through a
contest of ideas and interests. For example, in responding to crises and
emergencies, political leaders seek to influence how the media portray
the nature of the challenges and how the proposed solutions are publicly
defined, in order to avoid blame and to mobilise coalitions of support
for particular policy outcomes]{.underline} (Boin et al., 2009).

In filtering out some proposed courses of action and favouring others,
framing contests have real impacts on the policy process. A classic
example of why problem-framing matters is to consider how the phrase
'sustainable development'---originally a policy framework critical of
the status quo---became a mainstream goal endorsed across a wide
spectrum. Nevertheless, goals and methods of 'sustainable development'
have become interpreted in radically different ways by corporate
interests (who promote business profitability and continuous economic
growth) and by ecological activists (who regard protection of natural
assets as paramount). Thus the policy debate over how to interpret
'sustainable development' has been bitterly polarised between pro-growth
advocates and those seeking to protect environmental values (Dovers &
Hussey, 2013; Schandl & Walker, 2017).

Framing of policy problems and solutions occurs in specific contexts,
necessarily linked to policy histories and the local array of political
and economic stakeholders. For example, the problem of 'gun violence'
has been handled in very different ways internationally. Policy
diversity regarding gun control has been evident, even within the OECD
group of liberal democracies. In a study of three federal
countries---the USA, Canada and Australia---Newman and Head (2017b)
showed how political and ideological factors led to very different
outcomes. In the USA, a coalition of economic and political stakeholders
have entrenched a permissive 'gun culture' that allows widespread civil
access to weapons. This permissive outcome has been facilitated by an
expansive reading of the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, and
buttressed through intensive political lobbying by the financially
powerful firearms industry. Canada and Australia have been different,
despite having had strong rural lobbies advocating for the rights of
hunters and sporting shooters. Regulatory controls have been more
acceptable in those two countries, and in the case of Australia those
controls were significantly tightened through a concerted political and
legislative response to mass shootings in 1998. The Australian
regulatory approach was recently influential in New Zealand, which
suffered a mass shooting in a mosque in 2019 (EveryPalmer et al., 2020).
Response to a tragedy can generate diverse policy pathways, dependent on
the interplay between actors in various political and institutional
contexts and their contest of ideas (Béland & Cox, 2011).

#### Discourse analysis is a prerequisite to understand the potential effectiveness of policy

Kate **Anderson** and Jessica **Holloway, 18,** PhD and Associate
Professor at Arizona State University; Senior research fellow at
Australian Catholic University, "Discourse analysis as a theory, method,
and epistemology in studies of education policy"
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329912399_Discourse_analysis_as_theory_method_and_epistemology_in_studies_of_education_policy/ekc

[Discourse analysis as a theory, method, and tool has
illuminated]{.underline} ways that education policy is messy and
dynamic. [Evaluative approaches to policy analysis might be appealing to
policymakers and other government officials due to their supposed
promise of efficiency and accuracy]{.underline}. However, discourse
analytic approaches offer analytic and practical complementarity via
their demonstration of the complexities of policy development and the
context-dependence of policy effects. As such, [discourse analysis
offers invaluable tools for understanding the 'how' and the 'why' of
education policy]{.underline} (rather than just the 'what' or
'whether'), especially as policy landscapes and networks are shifting to
more global terrains and relationalities (Ball 2012; Rizvi and Lingard
2009).

In this article, we have argued that [acknowledgement of conceptual
definitions and theoretical and epistemological stances are paramount
toward establishing methodological coherence that allows for the
continued creative and productive uses of discourse analysis to push the
field forward.]{.underline} Our argument follows Rabinow and Rose's
(2003) call to treat 'indeterminacies, contingencies and difference as
assets rather than as disconfirming evidence that feeds into already
established logics of "science" and established logics of "justice"'
(13, as cited in Webb and Gulson 2015, 46). Therefore, our effort is not
to 'tame the wild profusion of existing things' (Foucault 1970, xv,
cited in Lather 2006, 36), but rather [to illustrate the complexity of
the various ways discourse analysts structure and execute their projects
in order to study educational policy]{.underline}. It would seem that
there are as many ways of doing this as there are people who do it,
which is itself not problematic. However, our conclusions from the
analysis of these 37 articles is that complications in terms of
theoretical and analytical coherence might prevent the promise we expect
from our collective and individual work. The analysis of literature
presented here took years to complete and only brings us through
articles published in 2014. With the proliferation of discourse analytic
studies focusing on education policy in the ensuing years increasing
exponentially, the field is rife for further analysis of this dynamic
and evolving sub-field from 2015 onward. We hope that this initial
consideration can help identify the conceptual boundaries between
operationalizations of discourse and policy, epistemological assumptions
informing methods and findings, and ontological stances on the purpose
and promise of research. Yet, we remind readers that these categories
are never fixed, and that cracks and fissures within and between them
always provide potential 'site\[s\] of being and becoming' (Lather 2006,
52) to emerge.

#### Language is its own creator and creation---the absolutization of language creates an ontological negotiation, excluding existence beyond the world language has created

Federico **Campagna, 18,** PhD from Royal College of Art, London; MSc
and BSc in economics and Management of the Arts from Bocconi University,
Milan; MA in Cultural Studies from Goldsmiths University, London;
*Technic And Magic: The Reconstruction of Reality*, Technic's Cosmogony
"First Hypostasis: Absolute Language" pg. 65-67//ekc

Since we are investigating [the underlying principles that give rise to
a specific kind of world, we shall look at language through the lens of
what language does]{.underline}, that is, what it produces when it is
used. [Any time we put forward a linguistic statement, every time we
express a linguistic unit]{.underline}, we are suggesting to our
interlocutors that a certain figure (an object, property or relation)
[be admitted as legitimately present in the world]{.underline}. The
interlocutors\' acceptance of [our linguistic utterance as meaningful,
grants legitimate presence in the word to the suggested
figure]{.underline}- thus making it available to be employed in the
larger game of linguistic exchange and recombination. The same happens
in a soliloquy or at the level of one\'s conscious thinking - though the
rapidity with which we accept our own linguistic proposal as plausibly
present in the world, tends to obfuscate this questioning process. And
of course, the same also applies to cases in which the utterer or
interlocutor is not a human, but a machine.

In this sense, [language\'s production is fundamentally ontological,
consisting in a continuous negotiation on which figures could or should
be included in the catalogue of the world.]{.underline} Every linguistic
unit thus takes on the form of a candidature and of a proposition.
Equally, the world becomes the negotiating table onto which the figures
of our daily experience are alternatively granted or denied legitimate
ontological status as 'present'. [In this sense, language functions as a
way to manage what entities make it onto the catalogue of the
communicable and operable layer of reality.]{.underline}

However, [when language is taken absolutely, that is when it is unbound
(ab-solutus) from any external constraint or from any other principle
outside itself, the world that it creates suddenly becomes the only
possible ontological field]{.underline}. When language becomes absolute
language, its cosmogony [ceases to be just one possible way of looking
at the world]{.underline} (namely, in terms of which figures have a
legitimate presence in it, as communicable and operable items) becoming
instead an all-encompassing terrain. [Outside of it, nothing is
permitted; outside of negotiated linguistic 'presence', nothing is
allowed,]{.underline} not even existence as it stands ineffably in
itself. Existence is substituted by presence, and its stability is taken
over by the negotiating process of language. [Language creates the world
in its own image, and when it becomes absolute, suddenly there is no
longer outside the world]{.underline}.

The [process of ontological negotiation that normally takes place at the
level of language, now becomes fully internal to language
itse]{.underline}lf; it is no longer an extra-linguistic interlocutor
that [accepts or rejects candidates to presence in the
world,]{.underline} but [it is the very fabric of language that absorbs
or rejects possible figures as they emerge from language
itself]{.underline}. In the state in which it becomes absolute[,
language presents itself as supposedly uttered by no mouth; rather, it
is claims to be at once its own creator and creation]{.underline}. *"I
suo fattore non disegno di farsi sua fattura."* Equally absolute
[language presents itself as unrestrained]{.underline} by any specific
extra-linguistic localization; a linguistic figure c[an take place
anywhere within the field of language, and, what is more, can do so
simultaneously in multiple instances.]{.underline} Taken in its absolute
form, language thus condenses that principle of seriality which we
observed in its symptomatic manifestations in the first chapter, during
our discussion of measure as the geometric centre of Tehcnic's
historical force.

To better elucidate the quality of language as understood absolutely,
let us bring in our first example of an archetypal incarnation of a
hypostasis. The archetypal incarnation of the first hypostasis in
Tehcnic's chain of emanations, consists in a suggested equivalence
between truth and representation, according to which: *truth is
representation and representation is truth.* We can find this
equivalence at work in countless aspects of our contemporary experience
of the world, in all fields of human activity. Let us unpick it piece by
piece, starting with its first element: truth.

For the sake of brevity, and being aware of endorsing one possible
definition over others, [we can that predicating the truthfulness of
something, means claiming that something is 'the case'. If I say that it
is true that a brick's colour is red, for example. What I mean is that
'it is the case' that red is the brick's colour.]{.underline} If
[I]{.underline} say that is it true that something happened, I mean that
it 'is the case' that it happened, and so on. [This might appear at
first as merely a matter of plain description; yet, if we consider truth
as a mechanism within a cosmogonic force, the extent of its influence
will soon become apparent]{.underline}. [Considered ontologically,
truth's reference to something 'being the case', takes the place of
something simple 'being']{.underline}. By assuming the truth-mechanism
as a crucial element in the architecture of a cosmogonic force, we
witness a shift from a condition in which 'existence' was the most basic
attribute for something to be able to enter reality, to a condition in
which this attribute becomes its 'being the case'. In metaphysical
terms, we can say [that this is a passage from a world of 'things', to
one made up of 'states of affairs'.]{.underline} This passage is
pregnant with the consequences on several levels. [While something can
'be' or 'not be' just in itself, the fact of its 'being the case' or
'not being the case' relies entirely on an external
sanction]{.underline}. For something to 'be or not the case'[, we
require both a context within]{.underline} which their 'being or not the
case' takes place, and an enunciation of their truthfulness or falsehood
as states of affairs. [Whatever 'is or not the case', relies entirely on
the enunciation that sanctions its claim, and on the context within
which such claims to truthfulness or falsehood is
meaningful.]{.underline} Thus, while 'things' can exist fully and
autonomously, states of affairs are present only precariously and
subordinately. [Namely, they are subordinate to the sanction bestowed
upon them by the linguistic context within which they are suggested as
taking place]{.underline}. This aspect of truth, adopted as an
ontological principle, [refers to the way in which, within language
taken absolutely, things are reduced merely to the 'being the
ca]{.underline}se'(or, as we called it in Chapter 1, 'activation') of a
grammatical position. Within absolute language, things are reduced to
states of affairs that require the series in which they are inserted,
both to acquire signification and to be enunciated. In themselves,
[before the series 'speaks' them and makes them present within itself,
they are nothing at all, since they don't even reach the stage in which
they can be discussed in terms of existence and
nonexistence.]{.underline} We have seen in the previous chapter how this
abstract mechanism translated in the daily functioning of historical
series such as those of finance, big data, neuroscience, citizenship and
so on.

### 2NC\-\--AT: Threats Real

#### National security threats suggested by the state are amplified and [presented as facts]{.underline} by the media \-\-- Iraq war proves that the media fails to check the government or present anti-war viewpoints because of their [desire for profit]{.underline}

Applied Economics from the University of Michigan, an LL.M. in
International Law from Georgetown Law, and has taught American
government and constitutional law courses for Alma College, business law

Michigan, 2015, "HOW SECURITY THREAT DISCOURSE CAN PRECIPITATE A PRESS
CLAUSE DEATH SPIRAL", Drake Law Review, Vol. 63, No. 1, p. 1-108 /lg

From the media entity decision equation, U(v) = X (r, + nal) - \[(1 -
(c + f,)\], ri is a composite for viewer emotion and is comprised of
patriotism, security threat perceptions, and humanitarian justice; nal
is perceived utility in attacking a security threat first; c, is the
media\'s perceived current period loss for inaccurate reporting or for
not providing diversity; f, is the possible future loss for biased and
inaccurate reporting; and X is the likelihood that the Executive\'s
security threat advocacy is real.365 [The [equation]{.mark}]{.underline}
probes potential discord between constitutional aspirations for the news
media as a purveyor of political discourse and corporate media
profitability obligations to shareholders and [[suggests]{.mark} that a
[media]{.mark} entity could [view]{.mark} departing from the industry
status quo and [investigating and challenging]{.mark} the [government\'s
security threat]{.mark} [allegations as a move that risks losing
viewership-which it]{.mark} must **[avoid at all
costs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.3 66

[[Prior to]{.mark} the 2003 [Iraq War]{.mark}, top [Bush]{.mark}
Administration [officials proffered hundreds of unequivocal]{.mark}
[threat claims in]{.mark} the [media]{.mark}, and [the media broadcasted
allegations as fact while ignoring antiwar positions]{.mark} and
dissent.]{.underline}3 67 [[Media]{.mark} positions of advocacy and
repetition of official and quasiofficial sources\' arguments converged
and [**drowned out alternative views** to generate]{.mark} an extremely
pervasive [prowar bias]{.mark} in the news media]{.underline}.368
Rhetoric and polls intimated that nal and ri were positively related and
high and that the perceived cl was low due to median viewer perceptions.
369 [[Media]{.mark} entities may have individually [assume]{.mark}d that
[they]{.mark} would [earn]{.mark} a [higher]{.mark} utility [payoff by
**declining to challenge threat allegations** or provide]{.mark} more
[diverse viewpoints]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[After]{.mark} the invasion of [Iraq, it became clear]{.mark} that
there were no chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons and no
connections between al-Qaeda and Hussein\'s regime-and [that]{.mark} the
[Bush Administration\'s]{.mark} intelligence [estimates]{.mark} about
Iraq [were thoroughly wrong, unreasonably relied upon, and based on
details and sources hidden by White House]{.mark} classification
prerogatives]{.underline}. 37° Many news entities and journalists
acknowledged the American media\'s poor performance, particularly for
uncritically accepting the Executive\'s security threat proclamations
and the unverified accounts of Iraqi defectors.3 71 The nearly diurnal
government message was unequivocal and false (X was 0). If the news
media had been held accountable, the cost side of the equation, \[(1 -
X)(cl + fn)\], could have imposed enormous consequences for conforming
to the Bush Administration\'s expectations and uncritically reporting on
its unsubstantiated security threat allegations-but that was not the
case.

[The news [media refused to impose]{.mark} any reverberating [cost
on]{.mark} the [Bush Administration]{.mark}]{.underline} and largely
accepted the shift from justifying the invasion of Iraq on the basis of
security threats to Americans (Hl) to justifications based on liberating
Iraqis (u) and blind patriotism (a). 372 [Further, the news [media was
complicit]{.mark} in generating ambiguities through participation in the
embedded reporter program]{.underline}, where reporters endeavored to be
the first to announce that prohibited weapons had been discovered but
rarely followed up to dispel false positives 373 and [[through reliance
on military analysts **kept on a short leash** by]{.mark} the [Bush
Administration, who provided patriotic, prowar commentary disguised as
impartial sourcing]{.mark}]{.underline}.374 After the invasion, the
effect on the composite emotion variable (ri) was that 11 dropped
because there was no verified security threat, while patriotism (a) and
humanitarian justice (u) were elevated with the ex post facto liberation
rationale.

Perhaps confirming the logic behind the model interaction, the American
media coalesced again at uncritical reporting during the invasion and
occupation;375 for this, the future cost (fn)-after the security threat
perception (X) was finally disproved-was citizens\' profound irritation
aimed at the entire news media industry. Media entities experienced the
repercussion of a share in a temporary loss of trust in the entire
industry. 376 Consider this: [a poll conducted during the post-Watergate
1970s-a time of near-peak cynicism-indicated that about 25 percent of
the American public trusted the media.377 In 2005, after the media\'s
failure to investigate and defuse the Bush Administration\'s false
security threat allegations, only 12 percent of Americans had confidence
in their news media.]{.underline}378

Citizens would assuredly not favor false information saturation over
truthful and trustworthy information,3 79 but given the possibility that
[news [media entities\']{.mark} reporting could span a spectrum that
included the extremes of being **[lapdogs for the Executive]{.mark}** or
watchdogs as the Framers intended,]{.underline}3 0 could President Bush
have been able to anticipate the news media\'s obeisant performance when
choosing to initiate an agenda-setting blitz in September 2002, or even
prior to his State of the Union Address in January 2002?81 This analysis
suggests it is highly probable[. A [media]{.mark} system with dominant
corporate conglomerates [that amplify]{.mark} the same general
\"[facts]{.mark}\" in a comparable manner across national, regional, and
local media sources is apt to beget uniformity in perspective and may
[**utterly fail to check the government**. Profitability
interests]{.mark} may accordingly [restrict dissent]{.mark} and curtail,
chill, [or silence speech that should be promoted in]{.mark} the [public
interest.]{.mark} This [failure]{.mark} may be [even more likely in **a
national security threat scenario** due to]{.mark} [concerns about
appearing sufficiently patriotic]{.mark} and informational asymmetries
that result when the evidentiary bases of security threat allegations
are classified]{.underline}. It is not clear that there are currently
any viable catalysts that would goad the media to perform differently in
a security threat scenario; [if, [in a similar situation in]{.mark} [the
future]{.mark}, a scofflaw regime without firm factual justifications to
substantiate its policy agenda chooses overly aggressive security threat
agenda setting, the outcome-American [use of military force in costly,
debilitating, and illegal ways-might be **predictable or even
inevitable.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--AI

#### The framing of an AI arms race is dangerous\-\--turns the case\--it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy and wrecks any safety precautions

Stephen **Cave 18**, Stephen holds a PhD in philosophy from Cambridge
University, "An AI Race for Strategic Advantage: Rhetoric and Risks,"
January 2018, AI Ethics and Society 2018, Volume 1
[\\\\pairie](file:///\\pairie)

The Dangers of an AI Race for Technological Advantage: In Rhetoric and
in Reality [What is so bad about framing the development of AI in terms
of a race for technological advantage]{.underline}? After all, it is
widely agreed that AI brings enormous potential benefits across many
sectors. One recent report estimated that it could add £232 billion by
2030 to the UK economy alone, with healthcare one of the sectors most
enhanced, potentially bringing faster, better service to consumers (PwC
2017). There is a widespread belief that competition and other market
forces are central to such innovation. So in as much as a race to
develop AI technology means these kinds of benefit come sooner, we have
reason to view it positively.

But at the same time, the development of such a potentially powerful new
technology will need to be steered if it is to be as beneficial as
possible while minimising the risks it might pose (Crawford and Calo
2016). In the words of the Future of Life Institute's open letter on
'Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence',
signed by over 8,000 people including many leading figures in AI, work
should focus "not only on making AI more capable, but also on maximizing
the societal benefit of AI." (Future of Life Institute, 2017a). [The
**danger of an AI race** is that it makes exactly this thoughtful
steering towards broadly beneficial outcomes more
difficult.]{.underline}

Three Sets of Risks

We want to distinguish between three sets of risks:

[i) The dangers of an AI 'race for technological advantage' framing,
regardless of whether the race is seriously pursued;]{.underline}

[ii) The **dangers of an AI 'race for technological advantage' framing**
and an actual AI race for technological advantage, regardless of whether
the race is won;]{.underline}

iii\) The dangers of an AI race for technological advantage being won.

\(i\) Risks Posed by a Race Rhetoric Alone It is possible that the trend
towards 'race for technological advantage' terminology in AI, including
suggestions such as Vladimir Putin's that the winner of such a race
"will become the ruler of the world," could pose risks even if the race
is not pursued in earnest, let alone won. We perceive two main risks
here:

(i.a) The kind of thoughtful consideration of how to achieve broadly
beneficial AI, as mentioned above, will require subtle, inclusive,
multi-stakeholder deliberation over a prolonged period. The rhetoric of
the race for technological advantage, with its implicit or explicit
threat that dire consequences will follow if some other group wins that
race, is not likely to be conducive to such deliberation. Indeed,
rhetoric around technological superiority (such as the 'arms race'
rhetoric used in the Cold War in the US), played into what has been
called a politics of fear, or a politics of insecurity \-- that is, a
political climate that discourages debate in favour of unquestioning
support for a prescribed agenda (Griffith 1987). In The Politics of
Insecurity, Jef Huysmans argues that use of the language of security (by
which he means militarised language, which would include 'arms race' and
related rhetoric) "is a particular technique of framing policy questions
in logics of survival with a capacity to mobilize politics of fear in
which social relations are structured on the basis of distrust"
(Huysmans 2006).

(i.b) Second, if the rhetoric of a competitive, 'winner takes all' [AI
race is used in the absence of an actual race, it could **contribute to
sparking such a race.**]{.underline}

\(ii\) Risks Posed by a Race Emerging

If the rhetoric of a race for technological advantage became an actual
race to develop sophisticated AI, the risks increase further:

(ii.a) [First, there is the risk that racing to achieve powerful AI
would **not be conducive to taking the proper safety precautions** that
such technology will require]{.underline} (Armstrong, Bostrom, and
Shulman 2016). We mentioned above the need for broad consultation about
the role AI should play in the life of a community. This might help
address important considerations such as avoiding biased systems, or
maximising fairness. But in addition to these goals, serious attention
must also be given to ensuring humans do not lose control of systems.
Such considerations become particularly important if AI approaches
general intelligence or superintelligence (Bostrom 2014), but also long
before, particularly when AI systems are performing critical functions.
The risk is that as the perceived benefit to winning the race increases,
so [correspondingly does the incentive to **cut corners** on these
safety considerations.]{.underline}

(ii.b) [Second, a 'race for technological advantage' could increase the
risk of competition in AI causing real conflict]{.underline} (overt or
covert). Huysmans argues that militarised language such as this has "a
specific capacity for fabricating and sustaining antagonistic relations
between groups. In the case of the race for technological advantage, it
encourages us to see competitors as threats or even enemies. [The belief
that a country intends in earnest to win an AI race, and that this would
result in technological dominance, could, for example, prompt other
countries to use aggression to prevent this (akin to the cyberattacks
made against Iranian nuclear facilities attributed to the US and Israel)
(Nakashima 2012), or motivate the targeting of key
personnel]{.underline} (precedents \-- though specific to their
historical context \-- might include Operation Paperclip, during which
over 1,600 German scientists and engineers who had worked on military
technology were taken to the US (Jacobsen 2014), or the apparently
ongoing operations to encourage the defection of nuclear scientists
between nations) (Golden 2017). [Such scenarios would also increase the
risk that a general race for technological superiority became
**increasingly a military AI arms race.**]{.underline}

\(iii\) Risks Posed by Race Victory

The third category of risks of an AI race for technological superiority
are those that would arise if a race were won. We will not explore these
in detail here \-- and the forms they take will anyway depend on the
precise nature of the technology in question. But as an example, these
risks include the concentration of power in the hands of whatever group
possesses this transformative technology. [If we survey the current
international landscape, and consider the number of countries
demonstrably willing to use force against others, as well as the speed
with which political direction within a country can change, and the
persistence of non-state actors such as terrorist groups, we might
conclude that the number of groups we would not trust to responsibly
manage an overwhelming technological advantage]{.underline}

Alternatives to a Race Approach

If we are not to pursue (and talk about pursuing) AI development as a
race, then how should we pursue (and talk about pursuing) such
development? This is too big a topic to consider thoroughly here. [But
we note these promising directions for alternative narratives around
progress in, and benefits of, AI:]{.underline}

[AI Development as a Shared Priority for Global Good]{.underline}

As advances in AI find application to an ever-wider range of scientific
and societal challenges, there is a burgeoning discussion around
harnessing the benefits of AI for global benefit. This reflects a
widespread view among AI scientists and a growing number of policymakers
that AI presents tremendous opportunities for making progress on global
societal ills, and aiding in tackling some of the biggest challenges we
face in the coming century \-- among them climate change and clean
energy production, biodiversity loss, healthcare, global poverty and
education. Emphasising these benefits could counteract a race approach
in a number of ways: [First, if there is global scientific consensus
that some of the key aims of AI should be to benefit humanity in these
ways, then it becomes less important in which companies or countries key
breakthroughs occur]{.underline}. Second, it makes clear that
cooperation on the development of AI stands to result in faster progress
on these pressing challenges. Lastly, if the aims of the field are to
benefit humanity worldwide, then the global community represent
stakeholders in the process of AI development; this narrative therefore
promotes inclusive and collaborative development and deployment of AI.

Cooperation on AI as it is Applied to Increasingly Safety-Critical
Settings Globally

The next decade will see AI applied in an increasingly integral way to
safety-critical systems; healthcare, transport, infrastructure to name a
few. In order to realise these benefits as quickly and safely as
possible, sharing of research, datasets, and best practices will be
critical. For example, to ensure the safety of autonomous cars, pooling
expertise and datasets on vehicle performances across as wide as
possible a range of environments and conditions (including accidents and
near-accidents) would provide substantial benefits for all involved.
This is particularly so given that the research, data, and testing
needed to refine and ensure the safety of such systems before deployment
may be considerably more costly and time-consuming than the research
needed to develop the initial technological capability.

[Promoting recognition that deep cooperation of this nature is needed to
deliver the benefits of AI robustly may be a powerful tool **in
dispelling a 'technological race' narrative**; and a '**cooperation for
safe AI' framing** is likely to become increasingly important as more
powerful and broadly capable AI systems are developed and
deployed.]{.underline}

AI Competition and the Security Dilemma

[Even if military AI spending does not rise to the level of an "arms
race," many nations are nevertheless engaged in a security competition
in the adoption of military AI, a competition that does pose
risks.]{.underline} [The situation that states find themselves in with
regard to AI competition is much more accurately described as a security
dilemma,16 a more generalized competitive dynamic between states than
the more narrowly defined "arms race."]{.underline} In his 1978 article,
"Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma," Robert Jervis defined the
security dilemma as follows: "\[M\]any of the means by which a state
tries to increase its security decrease the security of others."17 As
Charles Glaser has pointed out, it is not obvious from this definition
why it would be intrinsically bad for an increase in one state's
security to come at the expense of another's security.18 In fact,
decreasing the security of other states could have beneficial effects in
enhancing deterrence and reducing the risks of aggression or achieving a
favorable balance of power in a region, which could lead to greater
political influence. The problem comes in the second- and third-order
effects that could develop when another state reacts to having its
security reduced. Responses could include counterbalancing with a net
effect of no change in security (or worsening security). Glaser argues
that there are some situations in which security competition is a
rational strategy for a state to pursue even if competitors will arm in
response. [In other situations, arming may be a suboptimal strategy for
a state, which would be better served by restraint or pursuing arms
control.19]{.underline}

Security competition could even leave both states worse off than before.
This can occur during a traditional arms race if nations expend vast
sums of money in an unsuccessful attempt to gain an advantage over one
another, with the result that both nations divert funds from non-defense
expenditures. If the outcome of a security competition is the same
relative military balance as before, the balance of power may not have
meaningfully changed, but both nations could face diminished economic
and social well-being at home relative to if they had avoided a security
competition. Even absent this "guns vs. butter" tradeoff, however, there
are other ways in which security competition can lead to a net negative
outcome for both states.

[One way this could occur is if military innovation and the development
of new capabilities alter the character of warfare in a manner that is
more harmful, more destructive, less stable, or otherwise less desirable
than before]{.underline}. In his 1997 article, "The Security Dilemma
Revisited," Glaser gave the example of military capabilities that
shifted warfare to a more offense-dominant regime.20 There are other
ways in which warfare could evolve in a net negative direction as well.
[For example, in World War I, Germany's interest in developing and
deploying chemical weapons was spurred in part due to fears about
France's developments in poison gas.21 The result was the introduction
of a weapon that increased combatant suffering on both sides, without
delivering a significant military advantage to either. The same could
occur with **AI: It could alter the character of warfare** in a way that
would be a **net negative** for all participants.]{.underline}

An Accelerating Tempo of Warfare

[One possibility for how AI could alter warfare in a manner that would
leave all states worse off would be if it **accelerated the tempo of
war** past the point of human control, **making warfare faster, more
violent**, and less controllable]{.underline}. There are advantages to
adding intelligence into machines, but given the limitations of AI
systems today, the optimal model for achieving the highest quality
decision-making would be a joint human-machine architecture that
combines human and machine decision-making. One way in which machines
outperform humans, however, is in speed. [It is possible to envision a
competitive dynamic in which countries feel compelled to automate
increasing amounts of their military operations in order to keep pace
with adversaries.]{.underline} Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert
O. Work summed up the dilemma when he asked, "If our competitors go to
Terminators and we are still operating where the machines are helping
the humans and it turns out the Terminators are able to make decisions
faster, even if they're bad, how would we respond?"22 [This is a classic
security dilemma. One state's pursuit of greater automation and faster
reaction times undermines other states' security and leads them to
similarly pursue more automation just to keep up.]{.underline}

[If states fall victim to this trap, it could lead to all states being
less secure, since the pursuit of greater automation would not merely be
an evolution in weapons and countermeasures that simply leads to the
creation of new weapons in the future. At some point, warfare could
shift to a qualitatively different regime in which humans have less
control over lethal force as decisions become more automated and the
accelerating tempo of operations **pushes humans "out of the loop**" of
decision-making.]{.underline} Some Chinese scholars have hypothesized
about a battlefield "singularity," in which the pace of combat eclipses
human decision-making.23 [U.S. scholars have used the term
"**hyperwar**" to refer to a similar scenario]{.underline}.24 While the
speed of engagement necessitates automation in some limited areas today,
such as immediate localized defense of ships, bases, and vehicles from
rocket and missile attack, expanding this zone of machine control into
broader areas of war would be a significant development. [Less human
control over warfare could lead to wars that are less controllable and
that **escalate more quickly or more widely** than humans
intend.]{.underline} Similarly, limiting escalation or terminating
conflicts could be more challenging if the pace of operations on the
battlefield exceeds human decision-making. Political leaders would have
a command-and-control problem in which their military forces are
operating "inside" (i.e., faster than) their own decision cycle. The net
effect of the quite rational desire for nations to gain an edge in speed
could lead to an outcome that is worse for all. Yet, competitive
dynamics could nevertheless drive such a result.

One state's pursuit of greater automation and faster reaction times
undermines other states' security and leads them to similarly pursue
more automation just to keep up.

Financial markets provide an example of this dynamic in a non-military
competitive environment. Automation introduced into financial markets,
especially high-frequency trading in which trades are executed at
super-human speeds in milliseconds, has contributed to unstable market
conditions that can lead to "flash crashes," in which prices rapidly and
dramatically shift.25 Financial regulators have responded by employing
"circuit breakers" that automatically halt trading for a pre-determined
period of time if the price moves too quickly.26 Financial markets have
the benefit of a regulator who can force cooperative measures on
competitors to address suboptimal outcomes. Under conditions of anarchy
in the international security environment, any such cooperation would
have to come from states themselves.

The dynamic of a competition in speed is like an arms race, if we expand
the definition of an arms race to be more in line with biological
examples of competitive co-evolution. Biologists often use the metaphor
of an arms race to explain "an unstable runaway escalation" of
adaptation and counter-adaption that can occur in animals.27 This can
occur between species, such as predator and prey, or within species,
such as males evolving in competition for females. Biological arms races
can manifest in a variety of ways, such as competitions between predator
and prey with regard to camouflage vs. detection and armor vs. claws, as
well as speed, cognitive abilities, poison, deception, or other
attributes that might increase chances of survival.28 This broader
biological definition of an arms race is more in line with the potential
for an escalating "arms race in speed" among nations that leads to
greater automation in warfare. While this concept does not meet the
traditional definition of an arms race in the security studies
literature, it is nevertheless a useful concept to describe the
potential for a co-evolution in speed that leads to no net relative
advantage and in fact may leave both sides worse off.

Race to the Bottom on Safety

A related risk of a "racing" dynamic among competitors could come from
an acceleration, not of the pace of operations on the battlefield, but
of the process of fielding new AI systems. [AI systems today have a host
of safety and security problems that can make them brittle, unreliable,
and insecure.29 Because machine learning in particular can create new
ways in which systems can fail, militaries face novel challenges in
adopting AI systems]{.underline}.30 Militaries will have to adopt new
methods to test, evaluate, verify, and validate AI systems (also known
as TEVV).31 Such concerns related to autonomy are well known in the U.S.
defense community,32 although at present they have not been solved to a
satisfactory degree. Machine learning introduces additional challenges
with regard to testing, evaluation, verification, and validation[. A
rush to field AI systems before they are fully tested could result in a
"**race to the bottom**" on safety, with militaries fielding
accident-prone AI systems.]{.underline}

There are strong bureaucratic and institutional imperatives for
militaries to field systems that are robust and secure. Indeed,
designing systems to military specification standards often means making
them more robust for a wider range of environmental conditions and
shocks than comparable commercial systems, even at the expense of other
aspects of performance, such as size, weight, or usability. AI presents
novel challenges, however, in achieving the robustness needed for
operating in the complex, hazardous, and adversarial environments that
often characterize military operations.

Certain AI methods today, such as deep learning, remain relatively
immature with significant reliability challenges. A 2017 Department of
Defense report by the JASON scientific advisory group explained that
deep neural networks

are immature as regards the "illities", including reliability,
maintainability, accountability, validation and verification,
debug-ability, evolvability, fragility, attackability, and so forth. ...
Further, it is not clear that the existing AI paradigm is immediately
amenable to any sort of software engineering validation and
verification. This is a serious issue, and is a potential roadblock to
DoD's \[Department of Defense's\] use of these modern AI systems,
especially when considering the liability and accountability of using AI
in lethal systems.33

The Defense Department's 2018 AI strategy calls for building AI systems
that are "resilient, robust, reliable, and secure."34 Yet, the current
state of technology makes achieving this goal particularly difficult for
AI systems that incorporate deep learning, a subfield of AI that has
seen significant growth and attention in recent years. While there is
active research underway to improve AI safety and security, militaries
will have to adapt to the technology as it currently is, at least for
the time being. An ideal process would be for militaries to engage in
experimentation, prototyping, and concept development, but also to
subject AI systems to rigorous TEVV under realistic operational
conditions before deployment. [Taking shortcuts on testing and
evaluation and fielding a system before it is fully tested could lead to
accidents, which, in some settings, could **undermine international
stability.**]{.underline}

[In evaluating new technologies, militaries may be relatively
**accepting of the risk of accidents**, which may lead them to tolerate
the deployment of systems that have reliability concerns.]{.underline}
In building and fielding new capabilities, militaries have to weigh the
possibility of an accident occurring against other concerns, such as
forgoing valuable military capabilities. The military operational
environment is fraught with risk, in both training and real-world
operations. Military institutions balance managing this risk with other
factors, such as the need for training, developing new capabilities, or
accomplishing the mission. [Military institutions view casualties from
training accidents or testing new capabilities as a tragic but
unavoidable part of the business of preparing for war.]{.underline}
Militaries expect high performance from their forces, often while they
are performing dangerous tasks, but militaries neither demand nor expect
accident-free operations in most settings.35 From 2006 to 2020, over
5,000 U.S. servicemembers were killed in non-war related accidents, the
majority of which occurred within the United States. Accidents overall
accounted for nearly 32 percent of U.S. servicemember deaths during this
period, and even accounted for a significant portion of servicemember
deaths in Iraq (19 percent) and Afghanistan (16 percent).36 These
accident rates are not unusual for the U.S. armed forces. This is
business as usual. Accidents draw the attention of senior military and
civilian officials when a spate of accidents occur in a short amount of
time --- such as a series of aircraft crashes,37 ship collisions,38 or
training accidents.39 Yet, as one report on naval accidents from 1945 to
1988 notes, "peacetime naval accidents are a fact of life."40 The same
is true of military air and ground operations. Other nations' militaries
may do an even poorer job of managing risk when it comes to accidents
than the U.S. military. For example, the Soviet/Russian submarine
community has a much higher accident rate than the U.S. submarine
community.41

[Current Military AI Competition Is Not an "Arms Race"]{.underline}

As Heather Roff has written, [the arms race framing "misrepresents the
competition going on among countries."5 To begin with, AI is not a
weapon. AI is a general-purpose enabling technology with myriad
applications.]{.underline} It is not like a missile or a tank. It is
more like electricity, the internal combustion engine, or computer
networks.6 General-purpose technologies like AI have applications across
a range of industries. Wired magazine co-founder Kevin Kelly has argued
that it "will enliven inert objects, much as electricity did more than a
century ago. Everything that we formerly electrified we will now
cognitize."7

Nations may very well be in a technology race to adopt AI across a range
of industries. AI will help to improve economic productivity and, by
extension, economic and military power. During the industrial
revolution, early adopters of industrial technology significantly
increased their national power. From 1830 to 1890, Britain and Germany,
which were both early industrializers, more than doubled their per
capita gross national product while Russia, which lagged in
industrialization, increased its per capita gross national product by a
mere 7 percent over that 60-year period.8 These technological advantages
led to increased economic and military power, most notably for Europe
relative to the rest of the world. In 1790, Europe (collectively),
China, and India (including what is now Pakistan and Bangladesh) held
roughly the same shares of global manufacturing output, with Europe and
India each holding about one-quarter of global manufacturing output and
China holding roughly one-third. They all had approximately equivalent
levels of per capita industrialization at that time. But the industrial
revolution skyrocketed European economic productivity. By 1900, Europe
collectively controlled 62 percent of global manufacturing output, while
China held only six percent and India less than two percent. These
economic advantages translated into military power. By 1914, Europeans
occupied or controlled over 80 percent of the world's land surface.9

Being ahead of the curve in adopting AI is likely to lead to significant
national advantages. Although AI can increase military capabilities, the
more consequential advantages over the long term may come from
non-military AI applications across society. Long-term benefits from AI
could include increased productivity, improved healthcare outcomes,
economic growth, and other indicators of national well-being. Increasing
productivity is especially significant because it has a compounding
effect on economic growth. Over the long term, technological progress is
the main driver of economic growth.10

[The scale of **military AI spending**, at least at present, is
**nowhere near large enough to warrant the title of "arms
race."**]{.underline}

Of course, AI can also be used for weapons. Militaries around the world
are actively working to adopt AI to improve their military capabilities.
Yet the militarization of AI does not, at present, meet the traditional
definition of an arms race, despite the rhetorical urgency of many
national leaders. Michael D. Wallace, in his 1979 article "Arms Races
and Escalation," defined an arms race as "involving simultaneous
abnormal rates of growth in the military outlays of two or more nations"
resulting from "the competitive pressure of the military itself, and not
from domestic forces exogenous to this rivalry." Wallace further stated
that the concept of an arms race only applied "between nations whose
foreign and defense policies are heavily interdependent" and who have
"roughly comparable" capabilities.11 AI is being adopted by many
countries around the globe.12 Arguably at least some of the dyads, such
as the United States and China, meet Wallace's definition in terms of
being nations with "roughly comparable" capabilities, locked in
competition, "whose foreign and defense policies are heavily
interdependent." However, AI fails the arms race test in the critical
area of spending.

Wallace distinguished arms races from the normal behavior of states to
improve their military forces. [A state that adopts a new technology and
modernizes its military forces is not automatically in an arms race,
under Wallace's definition, even if the modernization is aimed at
competition with another country. The decisive factor in qualifying as
an arms race, according to Wallace, is the **rate of growth in defense
spending**.]{.underline} Wallace characterized arms races as resulting
in abnormally large growth rates in defense spending, beyond the
historical average of 4 to 5 percent annual growth (in real dollars). In
an arms race, annual growth rates are above 10 percent or even as high
as 20 to 25 percent.13 Other scholars define arms races using different
quantitative thresholds --- and some definitions lack clear quantitative
thresholds at all --- but the existence of rapid increases in defense
spending or military forces above normal levels is a common criterion in
the scholarly literature on arms races.14

Arms races result in situations in which two or more countries are
locked in spiraling defense spending, grabbing ever-greater shares of
national treasure often with little to no net gain in relative advantage
over the other. Classic historical examples include the Anglo-German
naval arms race prior to World War I and the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms
race during the Cold War. Military AI spending today clearly does not
meet these criteria of abnormally large growth rates in defense
spending. AI defense spending is difficult to calculate due to the
general-purpose nature of AI technology. Unlike ships or ballistic
missiles, AI systems cannot be easily counted. [Nevertheless, even crude
estimates of defense spending show that military AI investments are
**nowhere near large enough to constitute an arms race.** An independent
estimate by Bloomberg Government of U.S. defense spending on AI
identified \$5 billion in AI-related research and development in fiscal
year 2020, or roughly 0.7 percent of the Department of Defense's over
\$700 billion budget.15 The scale of military AI spending, at least at
present, is nowhere near large enough to warrant the title of "arms
race." (Adding in private sector spending, which constitutes the bulk of
AI investment, would lead to larger figures but would further belie the
claim of an "arms" race since most private sector AI investment is not
in weapons.)]{.underline}

#### The K turns the Aff -- alarmist narratives in the 1ac is the CAUSE of the US-China confrontation -- by securitizing AI, the Aff produces the real threat.

Jinghan **Zeng,** 8-1-20**21**, \"Securitization of Artificial
Intelligence in China,\" OUP Academic,
https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/14/3/417/6352222#303568932//jc

First[, a highly securitized AI sector will affect the flow of foreign
AI labor]{.underline} and capital to China's AI industry. To make it
attractive to global talent and capital, [a booming AI industry requires
an outward-looking, open-minded, and international
socio-politico-economic environment]{.underline}. However, [the
securitization trend is pushing in the opposite direction by producing a
rising nationalistic, inward-looking, security AI
discourse]{.underline}. This is counterproductive to China's AI
ambitions, because it puts China at a disadvantage in the global market.
More specifically, there is a global shortage of AI talent and, as
previously mentioned, China is short of 5 million or more qualified AI
industry workers. This has led to fierce global competition in the AI
industry for qualified workers, to the extent where Chinese tech
companies offer extremely---or unreasonably---high salaries.126 Such
financial attraction, however, could be offset by an unfavorably
nationalistic domestic environment. Second, [the securitization trend
could hinder economic efficiency.]{.underline} As previously discussed,
[it contributes to the rise of a self-reliance discourse on technology
whose creation is often at the cost of economic efficiency]{.underline}.
Precisely because China is lagging behind in AI development, it needs to
make use of the global AI supply chain to catch up. However, the
self-reliance discourse considers the risk of relying on foreign
technology too high, and thus focuses on "Made in China." Such
self-reliance is difficult (if not impossible) to realize in the short
run, and hinders China's ability to benefit from the global AI market
and thus maximize industrial efficiency. Similarly, [the securitization
of AI in the United States also undermines the appeal that America holds
for Chinese national AI talent, capital, and technology]{.underline}.
Growing tension between China and the United States has, moreover,
undermined Chinese companies' willingness to invest in the United
States[. In the long run, therefore, securitization is detrimental to
the competitiveness of the American AI industry.]{.underline} Third, in
connection with the above paragraph, the domestic inward-looking
nationalistic trend that securitization has created hinders China's
realization of global leadership. To lead AI in the global arena, China
must provide public goods and win support from others through successful
partnerships. It must play a key role in promoting global governance
and, as a global leader, act according to common interests rather than
solely national interests. However[, a security-focused, inward-looking,
nationalistic AI discourse is helpful to neither global governance nor
common interests.]{.underline} For example, [it can foster the rise of
inward-looking national AI policies that prioritize national interests
over those of the globalized world.]{.underline} This is in direct
contrast to global governance goals, i.e., to build a shared future
through global solidarity. Indeed, many of the problems that AI has
created, such as those relating to ethics, represent collective
challenges to humankind that require a globally concerted response.
[Inward-looking national AI policies may contribute to a fragmented
global governance structure, and thus obstruct concerted global actions
to address AI problems. Fourth, **the securitization trend has
reinforced technological rivalry at the expense of the potential for
global AI cooperation, and will likely exacerbate the United
States--China confrontation**. This is not to deny the existence of
United States--China cooperation in the field of AI. However, **by
speaking of AI in the language of security and a global race, the
relevant security AI discourse emphasizes competition over cooperation
and destruction over creation. This may produce a real security
threat**, and perhaps an actual global AI race, thus undermining the
space for cooperation from which both the United States and China can
benefit. In other words, the rivalry discourse adopts a zero-sum
geopolitical angle for understanding AI innovation that is inevitably to
the latter's detriment in both countries.]{.underline}127 More
importantly, [securitization may push AI further into the hard security
area by virtue of its military applications. The securitizing actor
tends to exaggerate the security threat to achieve a successful
securitization, so enhancing the strategic risks of AI military
practices and increasing the likelihood of war, and of escalating
ongoing conflicts]{.underline}. In this regard, [a highly securitized AI
politics may set China and the United States on a dangerous path towards
a catastrophic confrontation that imperils everyone's interests and
security.]{.underline} In the worst case scenario, as in all arms races,
blithe assertions about the inevitability of AI-enabled war are a
self-fulfilling and self-defeating prophecy. In this regard, the
aforementioned Fu Ying's call to regulate AI's military application
merits more attention. Lastly, by strengthening state involvement in
China's AI industry, securitization may undermine the interests of
Chinese AI companies. The boundary between the state and the market is
always far less defined in China than in other countries, due to China's
political environment. Making AI a national security matter justifies
the necessity for heavier state involvement, if not control. Although a
blessing in the Chinese domestic market, close ties with the state are a
burden on the global stage. Take the aforementioned civil-military
integration as an example. Although helpful in gaining China's AI
companies and research institutes more state funding, it undermines
their global access. Close relations with the Chinese government have
caused certain Chinese AI companies, including members of the "national
AI team of China," to be subjected to punishment, in the form of the
aforementioned American sanctions. In this regard, securitization could
hinder the access of China's AI companies to the global market, and
hence their future development. It also remains to be seen whether
heavier state involvement in the AI industry hinders market efficiency.

#### Biotechnology is an ethnicization of security\--shapes the production of knowledge and truth

Managing the risks of techno-scientific progress is unique neither to
life sciences nor to contemporary politics. However, existing concerns
[over a potential misuse of scientific research were given a new meaning
and salience in the post-9/11 environment with the rising fears of
hostile non-state actors.]{.underline} In comparison with that of the
Cold War era, though, the current focus is less on [nuclear physics or
technologies related to conventional weapons and more on emerging
technologies that are more accessible and thus more attractive for
potential terrorists.]{.underline} This article has pointed out that, as
[part of this development, more and more attention is given to the
regulation of knowledge, and it has explored how knowledge politics
plays out in life sciences, where these concerns have gained great
prominence. It has found that the attempts to secure potentially
dangerous research and innovation are based on redefining the principles
and practices of scientific responsibility and transforming an
**ethics-based system of governance into a technology of security, and
has suggested understanding this phenomenon as an ethicalization of
securit**y]{.underline}. However, building a 'culture of responsibility'
as a [technology of security may raise tensions both within the
scientific field and between scientists and society and breed a 'culture
of insecurity']{.underline}. The prevailing all-embracing approach to
the security governance of science does not help in this regard either.
[Instead of providing better understanding of the 'threatening' issues
at stake, along with their contextualization and prioritization, it
shifts the attention to action -- that is, how to effectively 'secure'
science.]{.underline} This further reinforces the role of apparently
apolitical expert decisionmaking processes and downplays debates on how
relevant these issues are, who shall decide on them, on behalf of whom,
and how. Especially in undemocratic settings, the introduction of
similarly motivated policies may be prone to the misuse of power in
academia and have unforeseen consequences (see Schiermeier, 2015). The
implications of ethicalization for the ontology of science will be
explored in further research. [For science as a cognitive domain,
ethicalization may lead to changing the criteria for the validity of
knowledge -- that is, the norms and practices defining how scientists
observe the world, produce truth claims about its functioning and
reflect on the process of knowledge production. By shaping the meaning
of scientific progress and tying it more closely to the neoliberal
risk--benefit framework, ethicalization is also related to shifting the
attention to 'desired' objects and methods of research while downplaying
others]{.underline}. As such, it may contribute to constructing new
scientific taboos narrowly defined by material rather than social
factors. However, [the question is not only how ethicalization shapes
the 'production of knowledge and truth' in science, but also what status
this knowledge is to have under the new social contract for
science]{.underline}. This raises further questions: How does the turn
to state-imposed self-regulatory modes of governance affect the role of
science in society as well as the functioning of the academic field? How
does it affect the practices of security expertise and the prospects of
politicizing and potentially resisting security? And how does the
dynamic of ethicalization vary across different disciplinary fields and
(political) contexts? [To move beyond the simplistic understanding of
scientific knowledge as a double-edged sword, it is important not only
to better understand the functioning of science, but also to reflect on
the interplay among science, politics and security in which the current
concerns over dual-use research are situated.]{.underline} More critical
engagement with this topic can not only move the debate on dual-use
research, but also provide new inspiration for the social scientific
research on security.

#### US securitization of terror causes state follow-on AND excessive use of violence -- Bush administration proves

Ellen **Edman 19**, Evaluator in civil preparedness at MSB (Swedish
Civil Contingencies Agency), B.S. at Lund University, 2019, "Can
securitization be just? A case study of the U.S securitization of
bioterrorism post 9/11", Lund University,
<https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lup/publication/8977756>\\\\iris

[Critique has been directed towards the U.S after the consequences of
the global War on Terror have been unveiled. The security policy of the
Bush administration has been described as a **deeply illiberal means,
for achieving liberal ends**]{.underline} (Singh, 2014: 117). The
security measures described in the previous section will be discussed
with regards to how harmful they were to the referent object, bystanders
and the aggressor.

The consequences of the securitization will be compared to the imminent
risk of a bioterrorist attack. As mentioned before, 50 kg of anthrax
could kill 250.000 people in an urban city. [Human extinction is not
very likely as a consequence of bioterrorism]{.underline}, especially
not with anthrax since it is not contagious. However, it has been
estimated that it would not be difficult to smuggle five bags of
anthrax, containing 50 kg each, into the U.S. If five bags were to be
efficiently dispersed in five major cities, the casualties could amount
to over a million. Such a coordinated attack would completely overwhelm
the U.S medical system. This is the threat the U.S was dealing with and
acted to prevent (Millett & Snyder-Beattie, 2017: 380, Davis, 2004:
303).

[The War on Terror that took place primarily in Afghanistan, Iraq and
Pakistan entailed large numbers of casualties.]{.underline} [The wars
fought by the U.S and its allies, have caused somewhere between an
estimated **480.000 and 507.000 casualties**. This number includes the
deaths of not only civilians, but every death related to the violence of
the War on Terror]{.underline} in 2001-2018. Of course, other estimates
have been made of a lesser death toll, but the human suffering and the
political destabilization of the region has been extensive (Crawford,
2018: 1-6).

Another impact of the War on Terror is the extended function of U.S
intelligence and defense agencies. [Interrogation techniques of
suspected terrorists escalated in Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib during
the War on Terror. These methods **do not comply with human rights or
international humanitarian law**, and the U.S has received critique for
it. The PATRIOT Act gave intelligence services more extensive
possibilities of monitoring terrorists, which also **infringed on the
integrity of ordinary citizens**]{.underline} in the U.S (NE2, HRW
2004).

A third consequence is the security paradox of the U.S biodefense
program. Government spending has increased enormously, by some estimates
to 41 billion USD. Most efforts made by the new biodefense program has
been benign and reduced the risk of a catastrophe if a bioterrorist
attack would occur. [If other states saw the U.S activity as a breach of
the BWC, the biodefense industry could escalate in other parts of the
world. This could cause a security paradox and make the U.S
countermeasures counterproductive]{.underline} (Leitenberg et al., 2004:
3, Enemark, 2006: 40).

The U.S biodefense program has not only affected other states and their
perception of the U.S. As explained in the introduction, [the biodefense
program has been expanded to a 30-fold increase of personnel and
institutions.]{.underline} Most importantly, 15.000 people had access to
BW in 2007, compared to about 100 people at the time of the amerithrax
attack. This surely heightens the risk of bioterrorism with agents
obtained from U.S biolaboratories (Dudley Miller, 2008: 20).

The evidence presented in this section suggests that the U.S
securitization of bioterrorism was very harmful. [It has entailed great
risks for the U.S population, it has affected innocent bystanders at the
sites of the War on Terror, and al-Qaeda terrorists have been inhumanely
treated at Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib. **Human suffering, infringed
integrity and the breach of human rights** are consequences caused by
the U.S securitization.]{.underline}

#### The discourse of 'food insecurity' is one that allows for [liberal humanitarian interventions]{.underline} -- that alienates the global south as a place to expand the neoliberal system

Melanie **Sommerville et al 14**, Professor in the Department of
Geography, University of British Columbia, Jamey Essex, Professor in the
Department of Political Science, University of Windsor, & Philippe Le
Billon, Professor in the Department of Geography, University of British
Columbia, June 20^th^ 2014, "The 'Global Food Crisis' and the
Geopolitics of Food Security", Geopolitics, 19,

[The emergence of food security as a pressing geopolitical concern is
clearly **demonstrated in the popular press**]{.underline}, which has
carried a steady flow of stories about poor harvests, food shortages,
famine, and rising food prices over the last six years. More in-depth
studies asking "Could Food Shortages Bring Down Civilization?" and
explaining "How Hunger Could Topple Regimes" have appeared in Scientific
American and Time, respectively.3 A June 2009 story in National
Geographic asserted that the crisis represents a Malthusian moment in
humankind's struggle to feed an ever-growing population, [while former
head of the US Agency for International Development Andrew Natsios
warned of "The Coming Food Coups" in The Washington
Quarterly.]{.underline} 4 More recently, prominent environmental
commentator and Melanie Sommerville et al. [activist Lester Brown
identified a "new geopolitics of food," arguing that the failure to
resolve the underlying causes of the 2007--2008 food price increases and
volatility meant that "the food crisis of 2011 is for
real."]{.underline} He warns that "farmers and foreign ministers alike"
should get ready "for a new era in which world food scarcity
increasingly shapes global politics." [This new era of food-insecure
geopolitics is driven by familiar ills (for example, "population growth
and climate change") coupled with deepening global inequalities and an
international system unable or unwilling to coordinate across the range
of policy fronts required to resolve the underlying roots of
crisis]{.underline}.5

Yet [it is not just the media that is heralding a new era of
food-insecure geopolitics, but also **mainstream policy
narratives**]{.underline}. A report to the [World Food
Program]{.underline} suggested that "food insecurity -- especially when
caused by a rise in food prices -- is a threat and impact multiplier for
violent conflict", though noting it is rarely the direct (and singular)
cause of conflict.6 Participants to an [FAO Forum]{.underline} on
Addressing Food Insecurity in Protracted Crises "emphasized the circular
link between food insecurity and conflict".7 [The UN High Level Task
Force on Global Food Security]{.underline}, the philanthropocapitalist
Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), and many other
development, aid, and philanthropic organisations have suggested that
there is an urgent geopolitical need for rapidly increased food
production through a so-called "new" or "second Green Revolution", with
massive new investments targeted for agricultural production and
research in the developing world.8 At a 2012 symposium in Washington on
global food security, [US President Barack Obama]{.underline} [stated
that the danger of food riots and price volatility producing global
geopolitical instability "will only grow if a surging global population
isn't matched by surging food production]{.underline}." [Investment in
agricultural productivity that reduces the incidence of hunger and
vulnerability, argued Obama, "advances international peace and security
-- and that includes the national security of the United
States."]{.underline}9

Although it is unsurprising that concerns about overpopulation,
dwindling resources, (under)productivity, and political turmoil are
being aired amid the lingering impacts of food price shifts, we assert
that such concerns must be critically interrogated. Grounded in
neo-Malthusian discourses of eco-catastrophe and the return of
environmental determinism (or, as Robert Kaplan put it, the 'revenge of
geography'), [such narratives overlook the central role of politics in
organising abundance and scarcity.]{.underline}10 [They offer **a
securitised framing of food insecurity**, where hunger is seen not only
as a politically revolutionary force but also as a fount of secondary
problems such as disease, terrorism, illicit drugs and
refugees.]{.underline} In such framings, [the dangers posed by hunger
threaten to reach far beyond the low-income populations and countries in
which hunger resides. In doing so, they **open the way for liberal
humanitarian responses** rooted in the nexus of security and
development, and which rely on 'tecFhnologies of betterment' to resolve
the threats posed by hunger and thereby prevent their
circulation]{.underline}.11 [These efforts]{.underline} Downloaded by
\[The University of British Columbia\] at 09:38 13 January 2016 The
'Global Food Crisis' and Food Security 243 [and discourses]{.underline}
privilege technological solutions to complex conditions of food
insecurity, and [hinge on the expansion and intensification of
liberalised market relations and North-to-South technology
transfers]{.underline}, doing little to challenge existing inequalities
or limit exposure to economic shocks that threaten livelihoods and
contribute to vulnerability, poverty, and hunger. As such [they reflect
not only the 'rendering technical' and 'anti-politics' aspects of aid
projects, but also more broadly the 'post-political' character of
'common sense' neoliberal policy debates]{.underline}.12

In this sense, a critical political geography approach towards food
crisis narratives can not only help reveal the assumptions and
perspectives that frame them, but also how this framing contributes to
the reproduction of a conventional agro-food political paradigm. [This
paradigm]{.underline} is predicated on assumptions drawn from two main
realms. On the one hand, it [employs the tropes of political realism to
construct a world in which combative nationstates are competing in a
zero-sum contest for global influence and power, with food security
envisioned and strategised as an element of geopolitical risk and
calculation.]{.underline} On the other, [it re-substantiates the
battered but still dominant economic assumptions and practices of global
neoliberalism]{.underline}, in which market openness and economic
interdependence and connectivity are enthusiastically embraced as policy
platforms for advancing food security. [Both visions of world
geopolitical space envision geographic relationships between people and
places in which food insecurity and resultant sociopolitical unrest
threaten, respectively, geospatial order and the security of the state
and the unimpeded flow of investment and trade upon which capitalist
globalisation depends.]{.underline} The resulting 'neoliberal
geopolitics' frame those people and places that are disconnected from or
that lie outside of such flows and systems of accumulation and
calculation as gaps, risks, and threats. [Security oriented responses
reliant on traditional institutions of state power and geopolitical
control uneasily intertwine with coercive and unequal forms of
neoliberalised economic connection, extending and reproducing the power
of dominant institutions and conventional paradigms while excluding
other policy approaches and discourses as unfeasible, too expensive, too
radical, or simply illegitimate]{.underline}.13

[Predictions of rapidly unfolding chaos sparked by unequal access to
uncertain food supplies advance a powerful geopolitical view of a world
struggling with scarcity, as opposed to inequality and
domination]{.underline}, and on the brink of conflict, disaster, and
generalised turmoil. Such chaos threatens the vision of ever-increasing
stability and growth that has guided the governance of food and
agriculture since the end of World War II, a vision of continued
improvements in food security premised on the sustained expansion of
food supplies through Green Revolution technologies and methods designed
to intensify and industrialise agricultural production. The structural
adjustment programmes that began in the 1980s and the liberalisation of
agricultural trade at the World Trade Organization after 1995 was
supposed to stretch the benefits of this system even further through a
new supra-national governance and regulatory structure that would bring
the benefits of liberalised market dynamics to poor farmers and
consumers around the world. In the promised and hoped-for success of
these initiatives, food security had little geopolitical relevance.
[While significant food insecurity continued to exist, especially in
many parts of the Global South, this was seen primarily as an economic
rather than a geopolitical issue, to be addressed through injections of
commodities, technology, capital, or expertise.]{.underline}14 In short,
the increasingly hegemonic geopolitical practices of a globalising
agro-industrial model were rendered largely invisible by universalising
discourses of neoliberal development that depoliticised the model's
social and environmental consequences.

[Popular framings of and responses to the current 'global food crisis'
could challenge these developmentalist discourses by postulating a
future marked]{.underline} not by steady progression toward improved
food security, cohesive economic integration and international peace,
[but by deteriorating food security, economic unravelling and political
upheaval in the Global South and, potentially, the North as well. The
food crisis thus represents a disruption to the existing geopolitical
order of global agro-food systems]{.underline}, calling into question
established food production and consumption practices and neoliberal
framings of food security. At the same time, [however, it serves as an
opportunity to re-establish some dimensions of neoliberal hegemony, by
directing new funding and investment streams into the agro-industrial
model, thereby reproducing and expanding the dominant geopolitical order
to incorporate new spaces, populations, and agro-food
systems]{.underline} (especially but not uniquely in the Global South),
in effect turning 'zones of chaos' into 'zones of potential growth'.
What [the food crisis reveals is the degree to which shifting
geopolitical discourses and interventions into global agro-food systems
are not just intimately interlinked with the political economy of
agricultural production and food consumption, but rather integrally
constitutive of this political economy]{.underline} (and vice versa).15

In this context[, conceptualising recent shifts in food security as a
temporally discrete and global 'crisis' is not a neutral framing, but
one that risks neglecting longer term and structural drivers of food
insecurity, **lending legitimacy to securitised forms of intervention**
and creating new opportunities for capitalist accumulation]{.underline}
in the global agro-food system. This speaks to the need to bring a
critical eye to shifts in governance resulting from the food crisis, and
to situate these amid longer term trajectories of both agrarian change
and geopolitical projects and discursive formations. Within this, [it is
also imperative to examine the opportunities opened by gaps, silences,
and failures in the prevailing geopolitical order and to engage critical
and radical voices that emphasise alternative geopolitical arrangements,
including governance from below and forms of de-globalisation,
localisation, and translocal networking based on peasant and consumer
power]{.underline}.16

#### Biological weapons framed as a security issue- countries produce biological weapons to inherently protect themselves 

**Saunders-Hastings, 14** \-\-- (Patrick Saunders-Hastings- s an
epidemiologist risk scientist working with Accenture. With expertise in
pandemic preparedness and response, \" Securitization Theory and
Biological Weapons\", Jan 8 2014, E-International Relations,
<https://www.e-ir.info/pdf/45317)//mishelle>

Securitization theory is a constructivist approach informing how certain
issues become framed through a security lens6 [. It offers a useful
analytical framework for understanding how, why, and what issues come to
be viewed as security threats]{.underline}. Securitization is an active
process wherein a securitizing actor, in this case the American
government, presents and addresses an issue as an existential threat to
a particular group, or referent object7 . In these situations, emergency
response measures and extensive resource commitments are considered
justified7 . [Securitization theory generally promotes desecuritization
as preferable because it avoids the negative consequences of
securitization, including a heavy-handed state response, reduced
democratic accountability, and the narrowing of public
choice8]{.underline} . However, it also recognizes that securitization
is sometimes appropriate. Recent considerations of securitization theory
identify three criteria that, if fulfilled, justify securitization: an
objective, existential threat, a referent object whose protection
promotes human well-being, and a response appropriately measured to the
particular threat6 . [In the case of bioweapons securitization, the
second criterion is less controversial, given that the referent object
is human population; thus, any harm to the referent object would
directly reduce a human well-being]{.underline}. However, the question
of whether securitization of biological weapons meets the other two
criteria is more contentious. Skeptics may point to Colin Powell's 2003
address to the United Nations as a case where the [biological weapons
security threat may have been exaggerated and securitization was
promoted for political ends, thereby calling into question the
legitimacy of the securitizing actor, the U.S. governmen]{.underline}t.
In his speech, Powell made the case for an invasion of Iraq by claiming
[Iraq had capabilities to produce biological weapons of mass
destruction, including mobile bioweapons labs, a claim that later turned
out to be false9.]{.underline} Critics also target the [policies
resulting from securitization, arguing that the capacity of aggressors
to carry out large scale attacks causing mortality has been
overestimated, calling into question whether an existential threat truly
exists and whether the response has been appropriately
measured10]{.underline}. Government funding may be seen as unjustifiably
skewed in favour of biodefense, defined as the capacity to respond to a
biological weapons attack, to the neglect of other key areas, such as
endemic and pandemic diseases. For instance, Klotz calculated what is
referred as the "likelihood-adjusted mortality" for biological weapons,
pandemic diseases, and endemic diseases by multiplying the probability
of occurrence by an estimate of mortality were an event to occur11. By
comparing these values with government funding allocated to each
category, he demonstrated that biodefense receives more funding than its
likelihood-adjusted mortality estimate would suggest is warranted11 .
However, objections have been raised to this argument. [Supporters of
biodefense prioritization point to the fact that focusing solely on
potential fatalities ignores other issues, such as the negative social
and economic fallout from an attack12]{.underline}. Additionally, they
point to the possibility that it is more expensive to combat intentional
threats, where there will be an explicit effort to circumvent current
practices by exploiting weaknesses12. [It should also be considered that
the probability of one attack is not independent from another, and that
an increasing probability of success may elicit more
attempts12]{.underline}. To follow will be an examination of whether
government spending and policies constitute a justified response to the
threat of biological weapons. [Securitization is relevant in that it was
a way for decision-makers to implement the policies they want and is
justifiable to the extent that the programs themselves are necessary and
appropriate]{.underline}. Despite other consequences of securitization,
such as public fear, political manipulation, and a heavyhanded response,
which may give the impression of an overreaction, the reality is that
securitization was a means of enabling the implementation of certain
policies and programs necessary to respond to the threat of biological
weapons.

### 2NC\-\--China Rise \[Rogelja\]

#### Rhetoric of Chinese as [subversive authoritarians]{.underline} locks in [violent policymaking]{.underline} and [Sinophobia]{.underline}---security concerns [conflate]{.underline} business motives with [existential threats]{.underline}. 

Igor **Rogelja '20**, Max Weber Fellow at the European University
Institute and a Teaching Fellow at the Lau China Institute, King's
College Londo, 2-17-2020, \"Narrating the China Threat: Securitising
Chinese Economic Presence in Europe\", OUP Academic, Vol 13, Issue 1,
https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/13/1/103/5739302?login=true //AW

The third [discursive pillar in the [construction of Chinese]{.mark} FDI
as a [threat concentrates on]{.mark} the [authoritarian polity]{.mark}
of the PRC]{.underline}. Of course, the [CCP]{.underline}'s
authoritarian rule, its poor human rights and civil liberties record,
and the subordination of the judiciary and legislative branches to the
executive are the defining characteristics of the PRC's political system
that render it the precise opposite of 'Europeanness'. At the
international level, as Holslag has eloquently described, [the EU's
[liberal]{.mark} agenda and China's state-centred foreign
[policy-making]{.mark} have [led to]{.mark} a '[normative
incongruence']{.mark} between China and Europe which has
[affected]{.mark} their [strategic cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}.83
The '[[authoritarian other']{.mark} logic, however, [assumes]{.mark}
that [China]{.mark}'s behaviour on the international scene could
[never]{.mark} be [compatible with]{.mark} the interests of liberal,
[democratic]{.mark} European [states]{.mark}, or the EU as a
whole.]{.underline} We need to point out that the GPPi--MERICS report is
the most explicit effort so far to use identity as a basis for threat
construction, and serves as the main point of reference in this section.
This report stands out as an [illustrative example of the erroneous
assumptions and potentially [harmful implications]{.mark} [that
'othering' can have in]{.mark} the context of understanding Chinese
investment in Europe]{.underline}. We concentrate on this case because
[we would like to record the transition]{.underline} from a fact-based
approach to a [discourse of [securitising everything]{.mark}---**[and
everyone]{.mark}**---[Chinese]{.mark}.]{.underline} The most basic
function of 'othering' in the GPPi--MERICS report is to [establish China
as a threat not because of what it does but for what it is. This crucial
element of the [securitising discourse deflects attention from]{.mark}
an [evidence]{.mark}-based discussion [towards]{.mark} a vague
[interpretation of 'motives' based on]{.mark} the CCP[']{.mark}s
essential characteristics as]{.underline} an
[[auth]{.mark}oritarian]{.underline} entity. In turn, this
interpretation provides the prism whereby [various [incidents]{.mark}
can be [reconstructed as]{.mark} a
[threa]{.mark}]{.underline}[t]{.mark}. It is a tactful logic, which
gives an [**aura of credibility** to an essentially non-falsifiable
argument that can be summarised as follows: China is an authoritarian
state, so whatever it does is potentially harmful]{.underline}. Let's
consider the following passage: ... from the perspective of liberal
democracies, all areas of interaction with China are potentially
problematic and deserve scrutiny. After all, China's political model is
based on an authoritarian regime intent on strengthening a deeply
illiberal surveillance state at home while also exporting---or at least
trying to popularise---its political and economic development model
abroad.84 Ergo, all areas of [Europe's interaction with China have
strong political undertones]{.underline}. This 'othering' is distinct
from recognising what has been described as 'pluralisation and
diversification of the global ideoscape'85---China's normative impact at
a global level. For the authors of this report, China is a threat
because of its domestic politics, which the CCP is allegedly exporting.
Being deprived of agency, according to the first discursive pillar, and
with their economic activities presented as a threat to EU unity,
according to the second, [[Chinese actors]{.mark} are now [villainised
as]{.mark} possible **[tentacles of authoritarianism]{.mark}**. This is
a key [step in]{.mark} the process of re[framing Chinese investment
as]{.mark} an **[existential issue]{.mark}** which requires
extraordinary [action]{.mark}. But assigning ulterior, dark motives to
Chinese actors on the basis of the PRC's authoritarian system of
government is not confined to SOEs, as the report unfolds a logic of
limitless securitisation]{.underline}. Indeed, in their effort to
substantiate 'authoritarian advance', GPPi--MERICS [[target]{.mark} not
just the activities of Chinese intelligence services or companies, but
also that of [Chinese think tanks, scholars, students]{.mark}, and
associations, all of whom are treated as 'influencing'
tools]{.underline}.86 In doing so, the report makes the dubious leap of
assuming perfect success rates for any of the Chinese government's
campaigns aimed at its citizens abroad. Although the report warns in its
introduction against 'a campaign targeting Chinese citizens', its
[framing of the problem and suggested [policy solutions
achieve]{.mark}]{.underline} exactly that: the [creation of an
**[environment of suspicion]{.mark}**]{.underline} that can
[**[legitimise]{.mark} future [extraordinary action]{.mark}** against
individuals]{.underline}. Constructing Chinese activities as a threat is
pursued through the instrumentalisation of institutional initiatives and
individuals. The activities of Chinese think tanks are discussed under
the label 'Tool 1: China sets up research exchange mechanisms and think
tanks in Central and Eastern Europe to influence perceptions and
agendas'.87 The first example is the creation of SiLKS (Silk Road Think
Tank Network) by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a network
engaging European think tanks that includes, among others, Chatham
House, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit
(GIZ), the France China Committee, the Fundación Alternativas, the
Institute of Development Studies, and the Development Centre of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The
report does not explain how the creation of a loose network will
influence the research impartiality and integrity of these reputable
institutions, nor why engagement of this type is a source of concern.
After all, interactions between think tanks from democratic and
authoritarian states are neither new nor a China-specific phenomenon.
What is more, the institutional affiliations of Chinese think tanks are
well-known and taken into consideration by European counterparts when
developing joint projects. The example of SiLKS is followed by a
consideration of the China--Central and Eastern European (China--CEE)
Institute, a think tank known for openly promoting China's BRI in the
17 + 1 framework. The authors of the GPPi--MERICS report claim that the
China--CEE pursues 'track 1.5 exercises', involving 'exchanges
tak\[ing\] place behind closed doors'. The [lack of [evidence]{.mark} to
substantiate the effectiveness of these activities]{.underline} and the
[[present]{.mark}ation of **routine [public diplomacy]{.mark}** [as
harmful to]{.mark} EU [interests]{.mark} demonstrate that these [reports
offer]{.mark} a **[discourse for policy consumption]{.mark}**, rather
than fact-based analysis]{.underline}. Similarly, the section on
knowledge production and lobbying ('Tool 2') [uses [random
examples]{.mark} that [fail to amount to more than]{.mark} a set of
[standard practices]{.mark}, such as employing lobbyists and local
'experts' to promote Chinese interests]{.underline} in the EU's
multifarious policy-making process. In an effort to provide some
evidence to support their discourse, the authors refer to events
organised by the Chinese Mission to the EU, the annual Europe--China
forum, and the involvement of China Daily in broadcasting them.88
However, once again the [reader needs to try hard to discern how these
activities, involving official actors openly affiliated to the Chinese
government, constitute anything more than standard public diplomacy
efforts similar to those undertaken by many third countries]{.underline}
within the EU. The third institutional tool, titled 'China shapes
academic programs', discusses the CCP's alleged determination to
'control how China is taught and studied in Western academic
institutions. The authors refer to controversies surrounding Confucius
Institutes (CIs hereafter) in the US and Europe, particularly their
clumsy censorship attempts. The problematic nature of the CIs is a
well-discussed topic that has indeed drawn considerable criticism. Many
studies have shown significant variances of experience as regards the
operation of CIs, and that attempts to use them as anything other than
their stated role have met with recipient universities' determination to
protect academic freedom,89 particularly when CIs have been egregiously
ham-fisted, as was the case at the European Association for Chinese
Studies (EACS) conference in Portugal in 2014.90 As Hartig91 has argued
in his examination of CIs in Europe, Oceania, and Africa, by attempting
to project a state-sponsored image of China, CIs are compromising their
effectiveness in increasing China's soft power. Hubbert,92 in an
ethnographic study of CIs as soft power tools, reaches the same
conclusion; when teachers side-lined official teaching guidelines and
material, putting aside propaganda content, they were more effective in
communicating an appealing image of China. Put differently, the more
political CIs are, the less effectively they operate as soft power
mechanisms. Yet, the GPPi--MERICS report makes no mention of these
important findings in relation to CIs, as this would weaken the sense of
urgency it aims to create. '[[Othering]{.mark}' is ultimately
**[extended to Chinese nationals]{.mark}**]{.underline} (the fourth
'tool'), [particularly [university students]{.mark}, who are [identified
as]{.mark} potential [agents of]{.mark} the [CCP]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The [report concentrates on the activities of the Chinese Students and
Scholars Associations]{.underline} (CSSAs), a network [developed under
the auspices of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office that has gained
visibility in the US and Australia with high-profile (counter-) protests
during visits of the Dalai Lama]{.underline}, the 2008 Olympic torch
relay, and demonstrations by dissidents on minority rights.93 The
authors employ the same tactic of lumping together non-EU related
examples with certain minor incidents within EU member states to create
an exaggerated sense of imminent threat. Characteristically, they
confound probability with intent: While there have not been as many
cases of CSS-related retaliation in Europe as in the US, it is possible
that this trend might feature more prominently at European institutions
in the future. These incidents represent an escalation of Chinese
government tactics ... 94 These [[descriptions]{.mark} are accompanied
by a map titled 'The CCP Could Mobilise a Critical Mass of Europe-Based
Nationals Organised in Chinese Students and Scholars Associations' that
shows the number of CSSAs in European countries, **essentially
[instrumentalising]{.mark}** [members]{.mark} of these associations [as
**CCP tools**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We are not oblivious to the fact
that the CSSA has been involved in controversial activities. However,
[such [examples]{.mark} are scarce]{.underline} (very few have taken
place within the EU95) and [[cannot justify]{.mark} the **[exaggerated
threat perception]{.mark}** advocated by the
[authors]{.mark}]{.underline} of this report. What is more, research on
the role of Chinese students' associations as 'soft power' mechanisms96
demonstrates that they face significant limitations, similar to those of
CIs. [However, GPPi--MERICS [operates under]{.mark} the [assumption that
Chinese]{.mark} nationals [have]{.mark} a significantly **[enhanced
potential for political action]{.mark}** compared to
others]{.underline}. This is [evident in the polemic language used, with
[references to China]{.mark}'s assumed 'retaliation' and
'[escalation]{.mark}',]{.underline} especially since 2012. The authors
do not take into consideration that many student societies are formed on
the basis of nationality, and engage in political activities on European
campuses, even in coordination with their respective embassies.
[GPPi--MERICS imposes the authoritarian other lens that renders even
inconsequential acts]{.underline}---for instance, Chinese students
formally complaining about an invitation to a Falun Gong practitioner
and Human rights activist to give a talk at Durham97---[as evidence of
China's authoritarian advance]{.underline}. Under such an interpretative
context, [providing evidence of the actual influence]{.underline} and
effectiveness of these 'tools' [becomes unimportant]{.underline}.
Lastly, '[[othering]{.mark}' is also [applied]{.mark} in relation
[to]{.mark} European actors]{.underline}: [governments, businesses, news
agencies, academic and research institutions, and
individuals]{.underline}. As early as 2009, the first version of the
'[China Audit' ECFR reports categorised]{.underline} EU governments
according to their China-policy preferences,98 while the recent
GPPi--MERICS study identified 'willing enablers' within European elites
and opinion setters.99 These references include justified criticism
against populist politicians who use China to legitimise their illiberal
views, but they also target [European [newspapers]{.mark} and agencies
[as **vehicles of Chinese propaganda**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [accusing
them of carrying content that is 'prepared and controlled by China's
party-state media']{.underline}, thus 'spread\[ing\] China's concept of
journalism'.100 The [**[evidence provided is]{.mark}**, once again,
**[incoherent]{.mark}**, including lists of European media carrying the
supplement ChinaWatch]{.underline}, and various media forums organised
on a national basis. The [[authors represent every instance of
engagement as]{.mark} evidence of China's [instrumentalisation
of]{.mark} European [media]{.mark}]{.underline}, disregarding their
critical reporting on China's domestic affairs. Going a step further,
the Association for International Affairs (AMO) study, funded by the
National Endowment for Democracy, presents a ranking of domestic
'opinion setters' in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary,
including journalists, political scientists, economists, businessmen,
business analysts, artists, publicists, translators, and sinologists,
according to their positive or negative attitudes towards China.101 But
whereas elected politicians and businessmen need to be scrutinised, the
[[targeting of]{.mark} [non-political]{.mark} and [non-business actors
as pro-China]{.mark} opinion setters [raises concerns about]{.mark} the
perceptions created, including potential [damage to]{.mark} one's
professional [reputation]{.mark}]{.underline}. This labelling, the
ultimate [practice of '[othering']{.mark} is a **worrying development**
that we expect to see in a [more intensified]{.mark} form as [Chinese
FDI]{.mark} in Europe is **[increasingly discussed in security
terms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Lastly, the GPPi--MERICS's continuous
distinction between 'independent' and 'dependent' China expertise in
Europe creates the [impression that sectors of the academic and research
community on the continent perform propaganda functions]{.underline}.102
Having neglected to provide any further justification for this claim
this repeated statement casts an unacceptable shadow of suspicion over
the entire scholarly community of Chinese Studies in Europe. Taken as a
whole, the [othering discourse on China's institutional initiatives
glues together incidents of limited importance, disregarding both their
actual (in)effectiveness and the resilience of European
democracy]{.underline}. Ultimately, there is [[no justification
for]{.mark} such an [alarmist tone]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the
contrary, we are concerned that if [[othering practices]{.mark} are
adopted widely, they may [fuel Sinophobic policies and social
attitudes]{.mark} that will challenge the already repeatedly questioned
liberal foundations]{.underline} of the EU and [limit the debate on
EU--China relations to a speculation regarding the motives of the
involved parts]{.underline}. For the time being, the vast majority of
think tanks examined are careful in this regard. However, the
GPPi--MERICS and AMO cases demonstrate that the [[transition from fact
to]{.mark} **extreme [discourse-based policy discussion]{.mark}** is
simple once the securitising prisms are applied]{.underline}. Indeed,
considering the hardening political discourse of (mainly north-)
European leaders in the past few years, it is not difficult to imagine
that '[[othering' will]{.mark} be used more extensively]{.underline} in
efforts [to **[securitise Chinese investment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Securitizing Chinese economic dominance [dooms]{.underline} policymakers to [failure]{.underline} and [displaces]{.underline} a focus on legitimate risks---[single minded focus]{.underline} and [discursive feedback loops]{.underline} locks in [false threats.]{.underline}

The first [step is to identify the role and space of think tanks in a
securitisation move]{.underline}. In this regard, Sjöstedt11 proposes an
empirically observable conceptualisation of the [securitising move as
'the public [framing of]{.mark} an [issue as]{.mark} a national
[threat]{.mark}, accompanied by a strategy for action']{.underline}. She
further draws our attention to the initial stages of this [framing
process12---what Kingdon calls the elusive 'pre-decision processes' that
**[led to policy-makers' adoption]{.mark}** of proposal]{.underline}s.13
Sjöstedt and Kingdon thus offer a more nuanced view of the
securitisation process which permits us to pin down the think tanks\'
role and importance. [Think tanks are [not decision makers, yet
**participate as securitising actors**]{.mark} in the process of idea
formation and bidding]{.underline}, ultimately helping to [articulate a
[securitising frame]{.mark} of reference that **[resonates with decision
makers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In our case, think tanks operate as
securitising actors to an audience of EU and national-level
decision-makers, whose involvement is necessary for the securitising
move to be carried forward. The success or failure of such a
securitising move depends, according to Sjöstedt, on decision makers
'internalising' idea-frames that constitute something as a threat.14
Here, she gainfully redeploys the concept of 'idea entrepreneurs' who
use their authority to give credence to the idea frame and insert it in
the discursive space around an issue initiating the internalisation
process by decision makers.15 Sjöstedt's understanding of the
securitisation move, however, is somewhat linear and can, therefore,
miss the complexity of agency involved. In Balzacq's analysis, the
success of securitisation depends on the audience's predisposition to a
securitising narrative on one hand, and the securitising actors'
competency on the other.16 For both these processes to work, therefore,
[the '[idea entrepreneurs']{.mark} must not just 'say' security, but
also [possess]{.mark} a recognised level of [expertise]{.mark} and have
access to an [audience]{.mark} that is **positively
[predisposed]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} their
[messag]{.mark}e]{.underline}---in our case the institutional cachet
accorded to top think tanks and their inclusion in internal briefing
papers for MEPs. What is more, the '[idea entrepreneurs' of the '[China
threat']{.mark} argument [do not operate in]{.mark} a [vacuum]{.mark},
nor are their audiences passive recipients of their
message]{.underline}. Instead, we identify a process of
[[securitisation]{.mark} that [is **bidirectional and
discursive**]{.mark}, [involving agency by]{.mark} both [decision makers
and securitising actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. This allows us to
conceptualise the securitisation move not only as a final outcome of a
linear process, but as a dialectical construction of a common frame of
reference. In this frame, policy entrepreneurs and decision makers
sharing a certain predisposition to an issue start to discuss it in the
same language, what Balzacq conceptualises as 'congruence'.17
Essentially, [think tanks offer specialist narratives that enable
decision makers to crystallise their policy preferences]{.underline}, so
explaining the [[credence given to]{.mark} the]{.underline} European
'[[China Threat']{.mark} variant]{.underline}. That several European
leaders, including Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Sigmar Gabriel, and
Jean-Claude Juncker, have made pronouncements congruent to the output of
the think tanks does not mean they were 'convinced' by a unidirectional
process, but that a common interpretive platform is emerging that
understands Chinese economic presence as a threat requiring
extraordinary responses. As a result of this congruence, the European
'[[China threat']{.mark} discourse **is already [legitimising policy
initiatives]{.mark}** targeted against China]{.underline}. It also
[[continues to **fuel policy debate**]{.mark}**s** in Brussels and other
European capitals that call for further action]{.underline}, in the form
of economic protectionism, or more direct interventions by security
apparatuses to Chinese companies, in effect producing what Hanneman and
Huotari call 'downward convergence'18 with China. But the most
disquieting element in this [[discursive congruence]{.mark} is that it
is becoming **increasingly [axiomatic]{.mark}**, and thus
'\[[deprives]{.mark}\]' the parties involved to [alternative
explanations that]{.mark} empirical [evidence]{.mark} may
[suggest]{.mark}]{.underline}. The screening mechanism's [single-minded
[focus on security]{.mark} and public order19 also [**ignores legitimate
areas** of concern]{.mark} such as [environmental protection]{.mark} and
[sustainabilit]{.mark}y]{.underline}. We believe that the emergence of
such a [unidimensional [discursive space around Chinese
investment]{.mark} is ultimately [harmful to]{.mark} the EU's [ability
to respond to]{.mark} the challenges arising from [China's expanding
econ]{.mark}omic presence]{.underline}, and [may [have negative
implications]{.mark} for its traumatised cohesion]{.underline}.

#### Conflating the [rationality of Chinese economic actors]{.underline} with the CCP's [political aims]{.underline} lead to [serial policy failure]{.underline}---obfuscates the [real motives]{.underline} that drive [effective policymaking]{.underline}.

Pillar 1: Centralising Agency The rapid rise in Chinese outward FDI into
Europe has reached a historic point and surpassed the reverse annual
flows of capital since 2010, yet in cumulative terms, EU-held
investments in China exceed those of Chinese entities by a factor of
2.6, while US-held FDI stock in the EU dwarfs China's by a ratio of
35:1.30 Rather than size, what the '[[China threat' discourse
problematises]{.mark} is the nature of [Chinese investment]{.mark},
which is said to be centrally controlled and subject to the Chinese
state's geostrategic considerations.]{.underline}31 Moreover, as Tingley
et al., have shown, opposition to incoming Chinese FDI on grounds of
national security is often a vehicle for other grievances,32 while Nyman
explains that the [securitisation of US energy policy relies on similar,
simplistic accounts of strategic competition]{.underline}.33 In this
manner, [[Chinese investment]{.mark} as a whole is [transformed
into]{.mark} a [security threat]{.mark} even when the [evidence]{.mark}
to support security concerns in individual cases is
[scant]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Establishing]{.mark} privatisations and
foreign acquisitions as a [threat to economic security]{.mark} in a
liberal economic context that promotes the role of businesses vis-à-vis
the state in economic activity can be '**[intellectually
incoherent']{.mark}**]{.underline}, as BWW note.34 Therefore,
[[securitisation]{.mark} depends on identifying or
**[construct]{.mark}ing [spill-over effects]{.mark}** on politics,
military security, society, and environment by ascribing the agency of
various actors involved in these deals up the command chain to
Beijing.]{.underline} This is not to say China, especially under Xi
Jinping, has not promoted narratives of Chinese exceptionalism and
reassertion of the party's control, but such propaganda should not be
taken at face value, as it obscures the complex decision-making
processes in China proper. 'Centralising agency' involves two
[[discursive tactics:]{.underline} (i[) subsum]{.underline}]{.mark}[ing
all **commercial [rationality]{.mark}** [of Chinese firms into]{.mark} a
[political frame]{.mark}, and (ii) negating **informed rationality** on
part of the host states or host business partners]{.underline}. In the
first instance, [centralising agency allows [securitising actors]{.mark}
to [attribute]{.mark} all Chinese [economic activity to]{.mark} the
[machinations of]{.mark} the [CCP]{.mark}]{.underline}, so
[[obviating]{.mark} the need **to [establish factually]{.mark}** such a
[link]{.mark}]{.underline} on a case-by-case basis, and without
considering the full set of relevant contingencies, interests, and
dynamics. [Chinese firms]{.underline}, regardless of ownership status,
are [[cast as agents of]{.mark} the [Chinese state]{.mark}, unable to
make their own financial decisions and beholden to **their political
masters**]{.underline} in Zhongnanhai. This view of China as a singular
entity [does not take into account a **[growing body of
lit]{.mark}erature** that understands the [B]{.mark}elt and
[R]{.mark}oad [I]{.mark}nitiative as an inherently [decentralised
endeavour]{.mark}]{.underline} wherein state-owned enterprises (SOEs),
local governments, different bureaucracies, and private companies pursue
their own interests, often [competing with each other for the centre's
attention]{.underline}.35 The [assumption]{.underline} that initiatives
such as the Belt and Road constitute a centrally executed conspiracy has
a [[**major impact** on]{.mark} the way we analyse [Chinese economic
presence]{.mark} abroad]{.underline}. Because the
[[securitisation]{.mark} of investment **[relies on]{.mark} establishing
'[spill-overs']{.mark}**, so-called **[crit]{.mark}ical
[infra]{.mark}structure** is especially prone to such a biased
interpretation]{.underline}. Thus, in the field of maritime logistics,
[companies like COSCO are presented as CCP agents]{.underline} taking
over Europe's port infrastructure,36 while [emphatically ignoring
alternative business explanations]{.underline}. The focus on security
achieved through centralising agency, no matter how tenuous,
[differentiates Chinese from other (state-led) port investment
companies]{.underline}, such as Dubai's DP World, without proposing
comparative insights between the effect of investment from different
authoritarian states such as the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia.
Furthermore, one should consider that during a time of falling profits
for shipping operators, port operations remain a highly profitable
aspect of the logistics business. In addition, significant overcapacity
is predicted for terminal operations globally in the coming years,37
signifying fierce competition among European ports for market shares.
Therefore, as the top eight big carrier groups largely determine global
cargo flows, a tie-in with a large carrier/port operator like COSCO,
particularly for less established ports, presents a viable strategy.
Italy's IAI (Istituto Affari Internazionali) accurately notes that
Piraeus's takeover will increase competition for ports in 'Northern
range' countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, but nevertheless
frames it as a 'political and commercial threat'.38 Seen from Piraeus,
however, both the 2008 (concession of container Piers II&III) and 2016
(Piraeus Port Authority privatisation) deals had a clear commercial
logic.39 COSCO got involved in Piraeus because it was looking for a
faster transportation channel for Chinese products, and gradually
solidified its commitment to the Greek port, especially since its
investment in Naples became unsustainable. An even [stronger attempt at
securitisation is seen in comparisons of Piraeus to Chinese-run
ports]{.underline} outside Europe where the People's Liberation Army
Navy (PLAN) has occasionally been granted access---with the host
country's permission.40 Absolutely [no indications that Piraeus will
become a 'double use' port hosting the PLAN exist, but [framing]{.mark}
a [Chinese takeover]{.mark} of a port authority [as]{.mark} **an
[existential threat]{.mark}** to Europeanness is less
plausible]{.underline} without linking it to a military ('a base for
Chinese warships') or political ('control over host government') issue.
What these reports disregard is that [Piraeus often **hosts foreign
navies**, both from NATO and third countries]{.underline}, including
Russia, and that the latter have no access to facilities or services
that could sustain military action of any kind. The PLAN visits in
Piraeus have taken place either under the UN anti-piracy mandate or as
part of the evacuation of Chinese civilians from Libya. In addition, the
European [Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR)'s 2017 report41 makes the
unsubstantiated claim that Japanese ships have experienced difficulties
when docking in Piraeus]{.underline}, arguing that there is no clear
distinction between taking over the management of the Port and sovereign
control over it.42 [The logic of [centralising agency]{.mark} paints any
Chinese investment at worst as a [security risk and]{.mark} at best as a
[political]{.mark}]{.underline} one. The creation of such
[intersubjective meanings in the [representation of Chinese
companies]{.mark} as agents]{.underline} of a malevolent state
[[blurs]{.mark} the [boundaries between]{.mark} 'technical',
'[economic', 'environmental', and 'political']{.mark}]{.underline}
matters, as well as between sectors and regions, in effect [politicising
any and all incoming investment]{.underline}. This is especially
[important when there are clear and valid concerns about the entry of
Chinese investors]{.underline} who might fail to comply with EU laws on
competition, labour standards, or environmental protection, for example.
Yet the [[securitising logic]{.mark} which lumps disparate Chinese
investments]{.underline} and projects together **[[obfuscates rather
than illuminates]{.underline}]{.mark}** their contingent and [complex
nature.]{.underline} For example, [when Croatia awarded the €270 m
Pelješac Bridge contract to China Road and Bridge
Corporation]{.underline} (CRBC) in early 2018, it did so not due to
direct political pressure or by circumventing public tender rules. Quite
the reverse, this moment m[arked the first successful bid by a Chinese
company for an EU-funded project and the culmination of the CRBC's
decade-long effort to progress to public bids in developed
countrie]{.underline}s. The Croatian authorities rejected the losing
parties' allegations of price dumping because even the [Chinese offer
was **significantly higher** than the expected tender value set by the
Croatian road authority]{.underline}.43 More than the issue of price
dumping---a longstanding concern of European industry---what is curious
about the case is that the [Austrian complainant **specifically cited**
as a key argument in its complaint the **interest of the Chinese state**
in entering the EU market]{.underline}. Accordingly, the [bridge
regularly features in articles discussing China's attempts to 'divide'
the EU44 or spread its influence to Western Balkan states.45 CRBC's
choices]{.underline}, however, seem [**consistent with the literature**
on [Chinese]{.mark} outgoing i[nvestment]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
emphasises the efforts of companies to leverage their firm-specific
assets to gain market share in advanced economies46---a [relatively
[typical pattern of behaviour]{.mark} with **few discernible security
aspects.**]{.underline} Similarly, COSCO obtained gradual control of
Piraeus following two international tenders (in 2008 and 2016), both
scrutinised by EU institutions. In fact, COSCO was the sole contender
for the 2016 privatisation of the Piraeus Port Authority, one of
Greece's commitments under its 2015 bailout agreement with the EU.
[China's construction and infrastructure acquisition spree in SE Europe
was thus more about Chinese actors pursuing their business interests
within the legal framework of the EU]{.underline} than changing the
rules of the game. This is not to say that the entanglement of politics
and economics in China is irrelevant, yet d[enying Chinese firms'
economic rationale provides a singular account of what is a complex form
of decision-making.]{.underline} The second thread of centralising
agency concerns the role of [European states]{.underline}, companies or
other actors and treating them as naïve or selfish, [dismissing their
**rational calculations** as insufficiently considering China's 'true'
intentions]{.underline}. In this vein, the 2016 acquisition of German
robotics firm Kuka by the Chinese Midea caused a stir in the German
political class, and is [heavily used in think tank narratives as an
example of technology-stripping by Chinese actors, with the ECFR report
even calling it a 'raid']{.underline}.47 However, Midea and Kuka
executives emphasised the business rationale for the deal giving Kuka
access to a huge market ripe for automation in manufacturing.48 Still,
in a meeting with German industrialists, [Chancellor Merkel reportedly
told them that they were 'naïve' about Chinese
intentions]{.underline}.49 Essentially, by negating the business
rationale of the deal the German state politicised competition. In the
race towards 'Industrie 4.0', both corporate and state actors pursue
strategies to ensure their continued competitiveness; these strategies
may come into conflict but they are decided by autonomous and rational
European actors. The Belgrade--Budapest 'high-speed' railway is another
case of allegedly naïve governments being 'duped' into paying for
China's grand schemes. In this narrative, the railway, built using
preferential loans from Chinese banks to Serbia, serves the purpose of
creating a logistical corridor from Piraeus to the markets of central
Europe at Serbian and Hungarian taxpayers' expense.50 However, Serbian
authorities had scheduled an upgrading of the rail line in question
before the idea of a Chinese corridor from Piraeus even existed.51 The
importance of the line to Serbia is traceable to decisions made not in
Beijing but in Brussels. The TEN-T corridor from Athens to Hamburg
bypassed the direct route via Serbia and Macedonia to favour member
states Bulgaria and Romania. Imminent isolation from EU-funded
infrastructural connectivities explains why Belgrade had been advocating
a rail upgrading since the mid-2000s. China wasn't even the preferred
lender, given that plans originally envisaged World Bank participation,
while the current upgrading is partly financed by a Russian loan. Rather
than being naïve, Balkan countries are using what leverage they can
muster in suboptimal surroundings, namely, the flexibility to
accommodate bilateral deals by balancing Western and other funders.
Unable to rely on EU support, Serbia is a prime case since it should be
particularly susceptible to Chinese pressure and could so become a
'Trojan Horse' in Europe.52 Yet Chinese influence has so far resulted in
just one symbolic gesture53 which illustrates the limitations of Chinese
'sharp power'54 rather than its reach. Elsewhere, the 'selfishness' of
European entities is emphasised, as with Italy's premier shipbuilder
Fincantieri. Using suggestive language, a report by the ECFR attempts to
construct a conspiratorial web out of Fincantieri's takeover of French
shipyard STX, its joint venture in Shanghai, and a Chinese SOE's
acquisition of a minor Italian yacht maker (Ferretti) without putting
forward a shred of evidence. It correctly points out that Fincantieri
agreed to share cruise ship production technology, but does not make
clear why the business decisions of one Italian firm should subsequently
be linked to the takeover of another (Fincantieri was not a shareholder
in Ferretti), nor why Fincantieri's takeover of a French shipyard should
be considered a 'still apparently unrelated development'55 rather than a
genuinely unrelated one. The report then goes as far as to characterise
Fincantieri's takeover bid for STX as being done '... in a very Chinese
way'.56 While we deal with the rhetorical tool of 'othering' in a
subsequent section, the ECFR report questions the economic rationality
of this major (and, incidentally, state-owned) Italian shipbuilder by
suggesting that it is selling out cruise ship technology in pursuit of
corporate profits. But as this charge is not sufficiently alarmist, the
issue of Ferretti's military speedboat arm is loosely associated with
Fincantieri, and the [[securitising loop]{.mark} is thus complete:
European [corporate profit-seeking leads to]{.mark} the leaking of
[military tech]{.mark}nology [to China]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Kuka, Serbia, and Fincantieri were following their own agenda---as were
the Greek ship-owning elite and the Greek government. Greek ship-owners
promoted the idea of COSCO's presence in Piraeus to both sides, lobbying
the Greek government in favour of the 2008 Concession, and playing a
crucial role in its successful conclusion.57 The appeal of Piraeus for
COSCO increased due to the active support of this key constituency, who
were clients of Chinese shipyards and banks,58 and trusted providers of
services for COSCO and other Chinese companies.59 The financial benefits
for Greek ship-owners, the Piraeus Port Authority, and the Greek economy
have since been considerable.60 Similarly, for all Greek governments
since 2008, companies like COSCO constitute an important source of
investment, especially at a time of financial crisis when privatisation
tenders run the risk of low offers. A Chinese company's bid in such
international tenders creates additional competition, which raises the
value of the deal for the Greek state. What is more, COSCO's diversion
of container traffic from other European ports to Piraeus could lead to
technological upgrading of the Port's facilities, job growth, and
spill-over effects in other economic sectors.61 Issues of reciprocal
market access are a longstanding and valid concern of European
businesses operating in China. Indeed, the future of [EU--China
relations will be largely defined by the ability of the two sides to
resolve these issues]{.underline}, either through bilateral negotiations
or dispute resolution instruments. Yet the [discourse presented in the
analysed reports does not stop there, rather advocating the upgrading of
such concerns to **full-blown panic**]{.underline} about Europe's
strategic [industries and assets being bought]{.underline}, stolen, or
neutralised by actors associated with the Chinese Communist Party. This
level of analysis conveniently ignores the agency of firms, interest
groups, and host states by instead concentrating agency in the hands of
the Chinese state. Yet [Chinese companies have adapted to dealing with
the many practices, voices, legal and business environments, and
individual agents]{.underline} across Europe. In a similar vein,
European states, companies, and elites have shown a remarkable
propensity to think about their own bottom line or national interest.
Paradoxically, the centralising agency [[narrative portrays Chinese
actors as subsuming]{.mark} their economic [rationality to]{.mark} the
state's [political concerns]{.mark}, while European actors are faulted
for following particularistic economic concerns instead of collective
political interests]{.underline}. As the next section will clarify, the
identification of 'collective' interests vis-à-vis China is a contested
field, and [we \[[cannot afford\] to]{.mark} assign the spectres
haunting the politics and economy of Europe to Chinese agency or
[present them as]{.mark} a [threat to European
security]{.mark}]{.underline} through a one-size-fits-all
contextualisation of Chinese investment.

American hawks, especially those of the 'deep state' intelligence and
[defence community, advocate a [new Cold War script where China
constitutes]{.mark} a progressively [serious]{.mark} political
[threat]{.mark}. This [rhetoric]{.mark} has been [on the rise]{.mark}
over the last couple of years]{.underline}. In the first place, an
[existential threat is the ideologically and politically antithetical
Other. To American hawks, [China]{.mark}]{.underline} is an
authoritarian regime under Communist one-party rule, which in [itself
[constitutes an existential threat]{.mark} to the free democracy of the
United States]{.underline}. For example, the 2017 US National Security
Strategy states that China 'spreads features of its authoritarian
system'.115 This [mindset is even [more apparent in]{.mark} an open
[letter from]{.mark} former [military officials]{.mark},
scholars]{.underline}, and other conservative China watchers to
President Trump in 2019, in which they [emphasise that China and its
Communist party are an existential threat to US values and the US-led
world order]{.underline}.116 Meanwhile, it should be noted that although
there is a rising rhetoric on ideological differences, it is more about
China's political system itself than the expansive nature of communism
so often promoted in the Soviet threat story. In the second place, there
is the China Model. In this frame, [[China represents]{.mark} an
authoritarian capitalism, and its great economic success offers other
countries an [alternative model]{.mark}. This [constitutes a **challenge
to the U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates'** free democratic market
economy model]{.underline} in the global order. The [Worldwide Threat
Assessment of the US Intelligence Community released by the Director of
National Intelligence Daniel Coats in 2019 bluntly points out that China
will more actively 'seek to assert China's model of authoritarian
capitalism as an alternative']{.underline} for other countries to the
Washington Consensus, which may 'threaten international support for
democracy, human rights, and the rule of law'; also that China's Belt
and Road Initiative is a platform to expand China's 'global economic,
political, and military reach' and 'diminish US influence'.117 In the
third [place is the whole-of-society threat. In this hawkish portrayal,
China is taking advantage of the United States' open environment and
political loopholes to gain economic, political, and military
benefits]{.underline}, thus [threatening US security from the inside.
Although this mode of thought has long existed in the [China threat
discourse]{.mark}, the '**[whole-of-society threat']{.mark} concept**
was coined by FBI Director Christopher Wray]{.underline} during a Senate
hearing in February 2018. He said that, in order to replace the United
States' global leadership, China employs not only state institutions but
also non-traditional collectors like students and professors to amass
intelligence and steal intellectual property rights, so this is 'not
just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat'.118
This narrative template was reinforced in Vice President Pence's China
policy speech in October 2018, in which he said China was attempting to
'shift American public opinion and public policy', influence US
elections, and fragment domestic interest groups by 'rewarding or
coercing' agents of influence, such as students, scholars, journalists,
and think tanks in the United States.119 One month after the Pence
speech, a [[report from]{.mark} the [Hoover Institution echoed this
frame]{.mark} by detailing how China has employed agents of influence to
influence American domestic politics and policies towards China.120 This
[narrative]{.mark} was **rapidly [transposed into government
policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Over the last two years, the [visas of
certain Chinese scholars have been withdrawn, a number of Chinese
Confucius Institutes closed, and the enrolment of Chinese students in
certain key areas has also clearly been affected]{.underline}. Military
Threat While both [China and the Soviet Union are narrated as a military
threat]{.underline}, China is largely framed as a regional one rather
than a global one. Admiral Philip. S. Davidson, the Commander of US
Indo-Pacific Command said in his statement before the Senate Armed
Services Committee on US Command Posture on 12 February, 2019: 'The [PLA
is the principal threat to US interests, US citizens, and our allies
inside the First Island Chain'.121 It should be noted that
[China]{.mark}'s so-called military [threat]{.mark} does not signify
that China's forces have surpassed or actively challenged US military
power but rather that China's military threat **[arises as long as
China]{.mark} can [potentially pose a challenge]{.mark}** to US military
predominance]{.underline}. In this narrative logic, [China's increased
military spending, upgrading and expanding of weapons systems and
technologies, and overseas deployments to protect its commercial
interests, or even the limited access to information on China's military
planning are taken as evidence of **China's rising military
threat**]{.underline}. This kind of hawkish rhetoric is widespread in
annual Department of Defense reports to Congress on China's military
power and in US Defense Intelligence Agency reports on China's Military
Power. One [notable feature of the evolving discourse is the **growing
attention** the United States is paying to the PLA's cyber and nuclear
warfare capabilities]{.underline}. Conclusion Rather than the
rationalist approach to national security, we adopt a narrative approach
to unravelling the narrative process whereby national threats are
constructed. Having encountered three successive national rivals since
WWII, the [United States has constructed three distinctive threat
stories to safeguard its hegemonic identity]{.underline}. The Soviet
threat consists in the story of two ideologically opposed rivals
competing for world domination; the Japan-bashing narrative tells a
victimhood story stemming from Japan's unfair competition. China threat
stories, however, are now more complex,conflating a [[story of US
victimhood]{.mark} at the hands of China's unfair competition, advocated
by President Trump,with a widely embedded but malleable [epic tale of
power competition]{.mark} between a rising power and the ruling power,
and a new, 'deep state' defence community-propagated Cold War script.
All these threat stories have framed what is perceived and what should
be done, but they are merely those from among other alternative
narratives that eventually gained a dominant position at critical
junctures]{.underline}. These socalled [[national threats are]{.mark}
hence **[no more than narrative constructs]{.mark}** in a self-other
manner of articulation [rather than one of objective
existence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Upon examining the narrative templates
of US threat stories, we find striking differences among them. The
Soviet threat spectrum ranges from the ideological to the political and
military domains, and economic challenge is the focus of the Japan
threat. But China represents the full spectrum of threats that
previously featured in both the Soviet threat story and the
Japan-bashing narrative. Upon zooming in, we further find that an
ideological conflict constitutes the main thread of the Soviet threat
storyline, but that the economic challenge of the China threat outweighs
the ideological and political ones. On the political front, the Soviet
Union's totalitarian dictatorship is the polar opposite of liberal
democracy, while China is often styled as an authoritarian state---a far
less antagonistic wording. As to military threats, the Soviet threat is
urgent and global, but the China threat is only a rising and regional
one. To counter the economic challenge emanating first from Japan and
then from China, the United States adopted different strategies to
construct its victimhood story, namely, coining new concepts for Japan,
and cashing in on stereotypes for China. In spite of the above-marked
differences, however, we can also clearly discern continuity in the
United States' national threat stories. This is reflected not only in
the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' consistently resorting to the
victimhood narrative to counter economic challenges from both Japan and
China, and unremittingly [cashing in on]{.mark} its [widely-shared
mythologies and images regarding the Self]{.mark} and Others to achieve
resonance, but also, more revealingly, [in]{.mark} the underlying
**[logic of US national threat-making]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates will invariably adopt a [zero-sum
mindset]{.mark} in making a diametrical self-other story for any
country---be it a formidable power with an antagonistic ideology like
the Soviet Union, an ally like Japan, or a rising peer competitor like
China---that might threaten its hegemonic identity. According to this
logic, the [American Self is **always superior to
Others**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[articulating]{.mark} the [threat
confirms its superiority]{.mark}. Not surprisingly, when Others, like
Japan or China, challenge its economic primacy, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, rather than examining its own problems, will [always
blame]{.mark} such [others]{.mark} for playing an 'unfair
game']{.underline}. This paper also provides us with a vantage point to
appreciate the current debate on Sino--US relations. Clearly, we are in
the second half of the critical juncture wherein the question is not
whether the United States and China will compete with each other but in
which way the competition will unfold, for the bankruptcy of the liberal
international order discourse makes it unlikely to revert to
yesteryear's policy of engagement. As the three narrative threads of the
[[China threat stories]{.mark} all [point to competition]{.mark} and
conflict, and can be **[self-fulfilling]{.mark}**, we may [witness
increasing tensions]{.mark} between them. Specifically, the
Japan-bashing victimhood story can shed considerable light on our
understanding of Trump's China policy. We find that the story President
Trump advocates to a large extent matches the victimhood story that the
revisionists concocted to deal with Japan in the 1980s. Trump's rhetoric
regarding unfair trade and industry targeting, slapping of trade tariffs
amounting to blackmail on both China and US allies, resultsoriented
approach to trade negotiation, and the US high-tech stranglehold that
curbs or bars investment in the industry by US competitors can all be
found in the Japan threat story toolbox.]{.underline} Having pivoted
China policy towards conflict, however, there are few indications that
Trump wants to act out a Cold War script. In accordance with the
storytelling logic, should Trump retain his presidency in the coming
election, the trade war will probably not end in a 'fair' trade
agreement until such time as the US economy far outperforms China's,
because US superiority entails outperformance, failing which the blame
must go on unfair play. That is what happened to Japan, that is to say,
successive rounds of sanctions and negotiations until Japan drifted into
the Lost Decade. China may, moreover, face even greater US hostility to
its high-tech industry and investment, as happened in 1980s. These are
issues that China's political nature and growing military may further
complicate. But it should be noted that China is not Japan and will
neither give in easily as Japan did nor pose a solely economic challenge
to the United States. The Soviet threat story also offers insight.
Indeed, a new Cold War rhetoric is rising in Sino--US relations
narratives in the United States. [[Hawks in the US defence
community]{.mark}, among them congressman like Senators Rick Scott and
Marco Rubio, former officials like John Bolton, and to some extent even
Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have all
co[ntributed to the rise of a Cold War mentalit]{.mark}y. The effect of
this **[Cold War rhetoric]{.mark}** is **[apparent in government]{.mark}
policy**, such as the [barring of visits from]{.mark} certain [Chinese
scholars and treating Chinese news media as 'foreign
missions']{.mark}]{.underline}. Although this new Cold War script may
sensationalise and aggravate the already deteriorated Sino--US
relations, unless major events or crises occur, it seems unlikely to
become a grand dominant narrative in the near future. This is partly due
to the fact that China, unlike the Soviet Union, does not export
Communism, so what Americans are agonising most about now is China's
catching up and the United States' relatively underperforming economy.
Moreover, quite apart from China's refusal to accept and act on such a
script, China has become deeply embedded in the world economy, and its
trading partners have little incentive to contain China. The future
dominant threat story is hence likely to be a hybrid one that allows
cooperation while being open to confrontation.

#### Securitizing against the China threat is [reductive]{.underline} and [self-defeating]{.underline}---'China threat' paradigm risks [overreaction]{.underline}.

[The [N]{.mark}ational [D]{.mark}efence [S]{.mark}trategy]{.underline}
(2018, p. 2) [[cautioned]{.mark} that [China]{.mark}]{.underline} (along
with Russia) is "now [[undermining]{.mark} the [international
order]{.mark} from within the system [by]{.mark} exploiting its
benefits]{.underline} while simultaneously [[undercutting its
principles]{.mark} and "rules of the road]{.underline}"". According to
this line of argument, [Beijing's policies---including its Belt and Road
project---are antithetical and harmful to American vision, values and
interests at global level]{.underline} (White House 2019; US Department
of State 2019b). Simultaneously, the Trump [[admin]{.mark}istration
[insisted that China seeks global predominance]{.mark} by displacing the
US as a sole super power]{.underline} (National Defence Strategy of the
US 2018; Lynch 2019). Beijing does so by promoting its "repressive
vision of world order" (White House 2017, p. 45) and model of
"authoritarian capitalism" (Director of National Intelligence 2019, p.
25) as "a "new type" of global governance" even if "the existing system
has served the world---China included---very well in the seven decades
since World War II" (US Embassy & Consulate in South Korea 2019). In
retrospective sense, the US' portrayal of China's ambitions under the
[Trump administration is a [revisit to]{.mark} decades-old **'[China
threat' paradigm]{.mark}** thriving in the US from time to time. An
analysis of the narratives of Trump administration vis-a-vis BRI reveals
that the [US' approach]{.mark} actually [reflected the 'China
threat']{.mark} mindset]{.underline} (Interviews with diplomats from
Central Asia and South Asia, June--July 2019, researchers working for
Pakistan government, July--December 2019, Douglas Paal, July 2019, Eyck
Freymann, August 2019, Li Xing, August 2019, Yiwei Wang, November 2019).
Chengxin Pan (2012, p. 23) aptly explains the paradigm. The '[China
threat' is a [fundamental image that casts China's rise]{.mark} and its
international implications primarily [in]{.mark} a [**negative,
alarming, and threatening** light]{.mark}. It is [more than]{.mark} a
particular argument, or a [singular 'China threat
theory']{.mark}]{.underline}, as many of its Chinese critics often call
it. Rather, it [represents a paradigm that, as a [lasting normative
concern]{.mark} and [cognitive habit,]{.mark} both informs and lends
coherence to otherwise divergent ways of looking at China]{.underline}
in scholarly analysis, government documents, popular culture and mass
media. Eminent analysts, researchers, and academics (i.e. Kishore
Mahbubani, Fareed Zakaria, Suzan L. Shirk, Danial Drezner, Taylor Fravel
et. al., Stapleton Roy, Michael D. Swaine, Susan A. Thornton and Ezra
Vogel etc.) believed that under Donald Trump administration, [[American
perceptions]{.mark} of [and actions towards]{.mark} the challenge posed
by [China]{.mark} were increasingly **[guided by]{.mark} the '[China
threat']{.mark}** or 'China scare' or 'Red scare' thinking]{.underline}
(Economist 2020; Swanson 2019; Fravel et al. 2019; Waldman 2019; Wong
2019a; Zakaria 2020). There was a [palpable understanding running across
both the parties]{.underline} (Republicans and Democrats) in Congress
and all the departments of government (the State Department, Department
of Defence, Department of Justice, Pentagon, FBI and other spy agencies
etc.) in Washington concurring that [China poses a threat to US on
multiple fronts]{.underline} (Reuters 2019b; Economist 2019a, b, c). The
[[Trump admin]{.mark}istration was at the forefront of **[stimulating
and building]{.mark}** on this thinking both [at **discursive and policy
levels.**]{.mark}]{.underline} The [[threat personification]{.mark} at
this level [was]{.mark} rather sweeping and oscillating and [any pattern
of]{.mark} China's [foreign policy behaviour]{.mark} could be
[interpreted as]{.mark} an [ultimate threat]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Accordingly, a diverse range of China's policies and initiatives were
identified as part of the broader China problem: unfair trade practices;
subsidising Chinese businesses and state owned enterprises; 5G
technology and risk of espionage; theft of intellectual property and
trade and corporate secrets; ['Made in China 2025'; and off course the
BRI reify the threat posed by China to US' interests.]{.underline}
Policy Responses to Counter the Threat BRI The [[discourse
of]{.mark}]{.underline} BRI [[securitisation]{.mark} was [complemented
by]{.mark} a set of [policy actions adopted by]{.mark} the US
government]{.underline} aimed clearly at the containment of expanding
Chinese footprints and influence. First, the Trump administration
employed the [policy of diplomatic and **rhetorical dissuasion** to
cajole and pressurise other countries not to join]{.underline} the BRI
(Wong 2019b). Washington's warnings against the negative consequences of
BRI's infrastructure-based investments aimed to deter the states like
Ukraine, Italy, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Kazakhstan from opting for
Chinese money. Besides this direct pressure, [[discursive
characterisation]{.mark} of the project itself has [profound
repercussions]{.mark} on the potential appea]{.underline}l of BRI
investments to other countries. As a consequence, [China's soft power
image]{.underline}, which is an important component of BRI (Li 2019, p.
42), is time and again [put to the test to convince international
community that Beijing does not harbour any malign designs]{.underline}
with regard to BRI. At second level, the US tried to tackle this
challenge through acts of institutional balancing. Washington came up
with its own aid programs to outcompete the reach of BRI. In 2018, the
US government increased the portfolio of its development finance
institution Overseas Private Investment Corporation from \$30 billion to
\$60 billion and passed the Better Utilisation of Investments Leading to
Development (BUILD) Act as counter response to China's Belt and Road
project. A new US aid agency International Development Finance
Corporation with \$60 billion funding was launched to counter BRI in
Asia (Lo 2020). Similarly, the US reached out to like-minded countries
in the Asia--Pacific to balance China's increasing influence across the
region. Hence, US, India, Australia and Japan revived the "Quad" with
this particular policy objective. Finally, Trump officials incessantly
tried to undermine China's BRI diplomacy at the international fora such
as the United Nations (Lynch 2019), Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(Guardian 2018) and as recently as Munich Security Conference in
February 2020. How Far is the Securitisation of BRI Warranted? During
the last six years of its implementation, BRI has exhibited ample
reasons to question different aspects of this initiative and its methods
of functioning. From ballooning debts to unviable projects etc., a
familiar pattern of undesirable outcomes has trailed the BRI projects
across many of the countries. The US' viewpoint does identify these
issues with BRI rightly but only partially. A critical cross-examination
of securitisation approach towards the BRI and ultimately China's
international role as adopted stridently by the Trump administration
shows that American approach is far-fetched on many counts across
conceptual, empirical and policy spectrums. In addition to general
observations, discussions and communications with diplomats, academics,
researchers and analysts from a range of countries with links to Belt
and Road project help develop the following critique of the US'
approach. Unlike the American Perspective of Zero-Sum Game, BRI is
Generally Viewed as an Opportunity by Many, Though Not Without Concerns
for Some Strategic, Political and Economic Implications Most of the
countries view BRI investments as opportunity to develop critical
infrastructure so direly needed across the Asian countries (Interviews
with diplomats from Central Asia and South Asia, June--July 2019,
researchers working for Pakistan government, July--December 2019, Ngeow
Chow Bing, August 2019, Harris Zainul December 2019). In response to
American assertions that BRI holds grave risks to the sovereign
integrity and economic development of recipient countries and should
therefore be shunned, a Central Asian diplomat (2019) observed.
Geography is an unalterable force for states. We cannot change our
neighbours and the geopolitics of surrounding states even if the US
wants us to do so. So we have to work with this OBOR model...The
potential significance of OBOR for regions like Central Asia and South
Asia is undeniable for us. This thinking stands diametrically opposite
to American narratives proclaiming the BRI as 'predatory economics' and
'debt-trap' diplomacy. There is a genuine reason for that: Most of the
BRI members suffer from acute deficit of development infrastructure.
According to a much-cited report by the Asian Development Bank (2017),
Asia needs whopping annual \$1.7 trillion investments in infrastructure
through 2030 or \$26 trillion from 2016 to 2030 in order to maintain its
growth momentum, tackle poverty and respond to climate change. American
observers also agree that BRI investments have the potential to bring
'win--win' outcomes for both the parties (Interviews with Douglas Paal,
July 2019, Joshua Kurlantzick, July 2019, Eyck Freymann, August 2019,
James Schwemlein, September, 2019). However, there is an understanding
that BRI with all its promising prospects might also hold some economic
and strategic implications. Member countries are conscious of the fact
that China has likely pinned strategic interests and goals with certain
BRI investments in South Asia (Interviews with South Asian diplomat,
August 2019, researcher working for Pakistan government, August 2019) or
the BRI might further tip the trade balance in favour of China
(Interviews with a Central Asian diplomat, June 2019). Still these
countries perceive the project primarily as an economic opportunity. The
'agency' of Member Countries and Their Domestic Politics has Played Key
Role in Evolution and Dynamics of the BRI. The US' Perspective Ignores
that The [[US' perspective]{.mark} stands on the assumption [that China
holds]{.mark} **predominant [position]{.mark}** [of
"dictating]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Hindustan Times 2017) [and
"leveraging" (US Senate 2019) its model "in a more muscular manner,
demanding other nations become tribute states kowtowing to
Beijing]{.underline}" (U.S. Department of Defense 2018b). This [notion
[is flawed]{.mark} both [on conceptual and empirical
bases]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} First, the argument that China
unilaterally dictates the BRI [[reduces]{.mark} the '[agency' of member
countries]{.mark} and their domestic politics to that of a 'black box'
playing to the sweet wills of Beijing]{.underline}. The argument
therefore is [reductive at best]{.underline}. In fact, in many cases the
incumbent governments of the member countries approach China for
investments and assistance. The cases of Pakistan' Gwadar port and Sri
Lanka's Hambantota port are notable in this respect. In addition, these
governments are quite egoistic in assessing the costs and benefits of
Chinese money though their interests are more likely parochial in the
sense they prioritise their own political capital or survival
(Interviews with Eyck Freymann, August 2019, researchers working for
Pakistan government, July--December 2019 and Harris Zainul, December
2019; Brautigam 2019). Therefore, it also depends a lot more on the
ruling government's priorities while discussing the terms and conditions
of BRI projects with Chinese. (Interviews with a Central Asian diplomat,
June 2019, Hong Zhang, December 2019). In similar vein, these [countries
have adroitly manoeuvred relations with both China and its rival powers,
seeking to get aid form both groups while they compete against each
other]{.underline} (Markey 2020). Sri Lanka opened its arms to Indian
and Japanese offers in the aftermath of Hambantota port deal. Similarly,
Pakistan has been warming lately to US and even reportedly tried to
assure the latter that Islamabad attaches great significance to ties
with Washington and will not allow Beijing to use Gwadar port for
strategic purposes (Siddiqa 2019a, b). On the empirical side, BRI does
not function as a linear model steered or imposed all the way from
Beijing. Member countries enjoy great deal of leeway in implementing,
delaying and even leveraging the Belt and Road projects. Domestic
politics are a complex of changing regimes, different interest and
pressure groups vying for their respective political agendas and
interests. The evidence shows that BRI is not immune to vagaries of
domestic politics. One of the top officials of China--Pakistan Economic
Corridor (CPEC) confided that after daily Dawn divulged the details of
CPEC 'master plan' (Husain 2017), the erstwhile government had to
downsize considerably parts of the actual plan due to harsh outcry from
media and the public (Interview, December 2019). Changes of governments
after elections in Malaysia, Pakistan and Maldives had a great deal of
impact on the implementation of BRI projects across these countries.
Malaysia even halted the BRI projects and then renegotiated the deals
with China. In Pakistan, the government of Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf
(PTI) explicitly questioned the terms of CPEC deals signed by the
previous government of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (Anderlini 2018).
The Chinese side developed many apprehensions and grievances with regard
to PTI's approach towards the CPEC (Interviews with researchers working
for Pakistan government, July--December 2019). Unlike the [American
assertion that China beguiles other countries into trap, member
[countries are mindful of ceding too much control]{.mark} to China as a
result of BRI projects]{.underline}. For example, Pakistan's invitation
to Saudi Arabia to become the third partner in the CPEC (that some
thought was done without taking China into confidence) and its
withdrawal of Diamer-Bhasha dam from CPEC in November 2017 were
motivated by strategic considerations (Interview with a government
researcher).Footnote2 Similarly, the newly elected President of Sri
Lanka Gotabaya Rajapaksa said (Xinhua 2019) that his government is "not
worried about the commercial aspect" of the Hambantota port deal but is
"concerned about the security aspect as to whether there are any
security lapses. That is what I am discussing with China." Many of the
intricate details of the Belt and Road falls beyond the tight control of
China even if the latter would desire to be on the top of everything. In
this way the progression and ultimate success of BRI hinges in many ways
on the agency of member countries and their domestic politics.
[[Securitising BRI]{.mark} Outrightly is **[Erroneous and
Self-Contradictory]{.mark}**]{.underline} for Many Reasons China's BRI
approach has many limitations but the way Trump [administration
securitised the subject is questionable for some reasons.]{.underline}
To begin with, the [[US **hyped and overstated** the challenge
of]{.underline}]{.mark} BRI and [[China]{.mark}'s role]{.underline}
(Interviews with a South Asian diplomat, August 2019 and researchers and
government officials of Pakistan, July--December 2019). The argument
that BRI is "predatory" or "debt trap" is not persuasive as it draws its
reasoning from a singular case of Hambantota port deal which is more of
an exception than a pattern (Interviews with Douglas Paul, July 2019,
Eyck Freymann, August 2019, Ngeow Chow Bing, August 2019 and Harris
Zainul, December 2019; Freeman Jr. 2019; Swaine 2019). The [facts
related to that debt-to-equity swap deal are far more complex than the
US or other conventional sources have asserted so far]{.underline}
(Moramudali 2020). According to Yiwei Wang (Interview, November 2019),
"it is a problem but this is the case of a debt not necessarily a trap."
For others, rather than being a debt-trap diplomacy, BRI is "just
globalisation with Chinese characteristics" (Brautigam 2019). The notion
that China gains influence over other countries by miring them in
massive debts stands on self-contradictory footing. [Each [failing
project brings China]{.mark} profound economic and [diplomatic
liabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all the China's BRI mantra is
based on 'win--win' narratives. Hence, this kind of [approach would be
self-[defeating and unsustainable]{.mark} in the long run]{.underline}.
The fallouts of Hambantota port deal---in the form of international
backlash---for China's soft image are too enormous to be ignored. As
massive debts and unsustainable projects can make China "a victim of its
own lending practice and hubris", the reasoning of the 'debt-trap
diplomacy' would be a "misreading" of a complex phenomenon (Ferchen
2018). [Patronising behaviour of the US' approach is another issue. The
[Trump]{.mark} administration [presented countries with]{.mark} a binary
[proposition that China is]{.mark} an [**imminent threat** and]{.mark}
the [US is]{.mark} the [saviour]{.mark} hence they should forsake China
for the US.]{.underline} Even though many of the countries have resisted
and countered American assertion with argument that BRI is not a debt
trap, the US insists otherwise. For instance, Pakistan and Sri
LankaFootnote3 have repeatedly tried to dispel the notion that BRI
investments are a trap yet the [US is parroting the same line with a
missionary zeal]{.underline}. Instead of successfully convincing others
to eschew the BRI or Chinese assistance, the [[US]{.mark} risks
[overreacting to]{.mark} the [issue at hand.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Finally, the Trump administration's [[policy to]{.mark} identify and
[counter China threat is **regressive and
counter-productive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The US approach, according to
Chas Freeman Jr. (2019), seems to be [[influenced by Cold War
thinking]{.mark} wherein two superpowers could force other countries to
take side with either the US or its]{.underline} rival. A [[broad range
of]{.mark} prominent scholars, analysts, and [experts agree that]{.mark}
the [approach to characterise China as]{.mark} an outright
[threat]{.mark} and consequently counter it is far-fetched and [based on

Securitizing the China Threat as Scientific Theory [Within the China
threat genre there is a broader range of [discursive examples
following]{.mark} the **[scientific mode of
securitization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These are mostly scholarly works
enacted by academics. Here is a classic "theory as practice" text: Can
China rise peacefully? My answer is no. If China continues its
impressive economic growth over the next few decades, the United States
and China are likely to engage in an intense security competition with
considerable potential for war. Most of China's neighbours---including
India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Russia and Vietnam---will join
with the United States to contain China's power.40 At the very beginning
of this essay, boldly titled "[China's Unpeaceful Rise," John
[Mearsheimer]{.mark}, a world-renowned IR scholar, [pessimistically
predicts]{.mark} the [consequences of China's rise]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Mearsheimer's claim that China's rise will be "unpeaceful" is clearly in
antithesis to the Chinese government's promise of a "peaceful rise." In
a typical example of the latter, Zheng, a former Chinese official and
policy advisor, assures the outside world that "[[China does not seek
heg]{.mark}emony or predominance in world affairs," and that "[China's
development depends on world peace]{.mark}--- a peace that its
development will in turn reinforce.]{.underline}" 41 People are thus
faced with two opposing scenarios for IR in East Asia. Which should one
believe? A poststructuralist reading of the above extract suggests that
[Mearsheimer articulates the China threat theory through the
**scientific mode of representation**.]{.underline} First, there is a
process of structural incorporation, whereby the [subject of China
serves the broader interests of academic enquiry. In short, although
this is a serious issue of "hard" security, it is presented as a
research topic. The author does not mention the China threat directly in
the essay, and his argument develops in a fairly objective
tone]{.underline}. Indeed, Mearsheimer emphasizes at the outset the need
for a "theory of international politics" that explains the behavior of
rising great powers when one tries to "predict" the future of world
politics.42 Therefore, the issue of [[China's rise]{.mark} and its
consequences is [**fashioned as an academic subject** rather
than]{.mark} an internationally current [topic of]{.mark} passionate
[debate]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the scientific mode, the [China threat
is securitized via "scientific" reasoning.]{.underline} In this regard,
the ref[erent object is the national security of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, the world's single remaining superpower and its
allies. The [subject or [audience comprises]{.mark}]{.underline} the
intellectual elites and, more important, [**[policy makers of]{.mark}
the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates** and its allies.]{.underline} The
[[securitizers are]{.mark} IR [academics and policy
analysts]{.mark}]{.underline}, represented in the above extract by
Mearsheimer. From the poststructuralist perspective, these
[[agents]{.mark} perform securitization acts by formulating theories,
[predict]{.mark}ing [inev]{.mark}itable [outcomes]{.mark}, and
[advocat]{.mark}ing [policy]{.mark} options. As a result, the
**[distinction between theory and practice disappears]{.mark}** at this
point]{.underline}. To ensure that the issue of the [[China
threat]{.mark} is situated [in]{.mark} the relevant [epistemic
terrain]{.mark}, the proper language must be adopted for academic debate
on the existence and nature of the threat posed by China. Mearsheimer
thus claims that his argument is based on a "theory" of rising great
powers and the effects of their rise on international
politics.]{.underline} As students of international politics will
immediately recognize, this "theory" is the "offensive" variant of the
realist IR tradition, well documented [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
Mearsheimer's 2001 book The Tragedy of Great Power Politics.43 In this
influential study, Mearsheimer presents his argument on the China threat
issue with consummate professionalism. He first enumerates the five
"bedrock" assumptions of offensive realism: an anarchic international
system; the inherently offensive military capabilities of great powers;
uncertainty about other states' intentions; survival as the primary
goal; and the rationality of state actors. The combined effects of these
assumptions are that great powers tend to be fearful of each other, to
rely upon themselves for their survival, and to try by any means to
maximize their own power.[44 Mearsheimer concludes that this
"[scientific" logic]{.mark} is generally applicable as an explanation of
the behavior of great powers that "seek to gain as much power as
possible over their rivals]{.underline}." 45 The issues of power and
knowledge are crucial to the scientific mode. [**[Only certain
individuals]{.mark} can [lay claim to]{.mark} the "[knowledge]{.mark}**"
that is widely accepted as legitimate. The [dominant "knowledge]{.mark}"
of global affairs is both "[arbitrary"]{.mark} (in the sense that it is
only one of many interpretations) and "non-arbitrary" (in the sense that
certain interpretative practices predominate worldwide).46 For an
interpretation of global affairs to become dominant, it **requires power
and authority** in its field]{.underline}. The [[epistemological and
ontological foundations]{.mark} of interpretations of IR thus **[matter
less than]{.mark} their [authority]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Due to his
well-established reputation worldwide as a scholar of IR, [Mearsheimer's
acts of securitization have considerable power and authority. One survey
ranks him among the scholars with the greatest influence and most
interesting output in the field over the past few
decades]{.underline}.47 According to Google Scholar, The Tragedy of
Great Power Politics has been cited as many as 3,371 times (as of April
2014). With regard to substantial modality, the main social spheres
addressed by the scientific mode of securitization are military and
strategic. Unlike China, which defends itself against China threat
allegations primarily with reassurances of goodwill, a [securitizer,
like Mearsheimer, seeks to argue from a "scientific" basis. He reasons
that "to predict the future in Asia, one needs a **theory of
international politics**"]{.underline} that is "logically sound."48
[Mearsheimer builds a specific communicative "sign system" in the use of
scientific language to make claims to knowledge]{.underline}.49 He
speaks from the perspective of a scientifically trained expert in world
politics, thus privileging technical language over everyday language.
The [threat posed by a rising China to international security is
reasoned "scientifically" to be inevitable.]{.underline} This raises the
question of what practice or activity this use of language is designed
to elicit. By persuading readers of the inevitability of a Chinese
threat, for example, [Mearsheimer may aim to [prompt]{.mark} the [action
perceived as necessary]{.mark} to prevent this threat]{.underline}.
According to a survey titled "The Ivory Tower," published in Foreign
Policy, the majority of both academics and practitioners in the United
States consider China's rise to be the most important U.S.
foreign-policy challenge.50 Similarly, both IR scholars and
practitioners regularly pinpoint East Asia as the region of greatest
strategic importance to the United States today and over the next 20
years. Although most IR scholars agree that China's political influence
has not yet exceeded that of the United States, they predict that the
chance of war between the two countries will increase from 13 percent in
the next 10 years to 23 percent in the next 30 years.51 In the
scientific mode, [[securitizers reason]{.mark} [deductively from
scientific theory]{.mark} to the existence of a "China
threat."]{.underline} This deductive process entails many instances of
"intertextuality,"52 moments at which one spoken or written text alludes
to, quotes, or otherwise relates to another. [[Discussion of]{.mark} the
[China threat]{.mark} is [no longer limited to]{.mark} the world of
[academia]{.mark}; for instance, the issue has been **widely referenced
and examined by U.S. journalists** in books that have subsequently
become bestsellers.53 It is difficult to trace the ways in which
academics and policy makers influence each other. However, it is clear
that renowned IR scholars like Mearsheimer are influential not only in
their own fields but far beyond. Here, [knowledge and power **mutually
reinforce**]{.mark} **each other**]{.underline}. With the increasing
popularity of offensive realism and powertransition theory, people in
many different professions are alluding to or talking at length about
the so-called China threat. [In scholarly discussion, policy analysis,
and strategic planning, the [issue is]{.mark} often [taken as]{.mark} a
[given]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The Aff's framing of "China threat" is part of a broader violent attempt to protect the "American identity"

[The framing of the 'China threat' draws attention to securitization
theory as this construction is a distinctive example of
securitization]{.underline}. Many are divided on if China actually poses
an existential threat. Amongst scholars, the threat China poses is
overinflated, while US elites frame China as a genuine threat that
should be taken seriously and policies should reflect it. The US-Sino
tensions are based in relevance to competition regarding hegemonic
status based on the perceived 'China threat' from the US. [This power
shift of China as a rising power can lead to the US and China falling to
the Thucydides Trap]{.underline} (Lee, 2019; Mastro, 2018), [and there
will be a major war during the shift of power]{.underline}. This concept
is closely related to the power transition theory which can be
operationalized to predict the probability of a war between the two
states. While power transition theory is important in understanding the
potential for conflict, it does not illustrate why and how tensions
arose, much less the effect securitization had on the tensions. [It
can]{.underline} also [lead to a security dilemma in which the US
perceives the modernization of China's military as a threat and
challenging its regional hegemonic status]{.underline} (Ambrosio et al,
2020; Jie, 2020). The modernization and advances in military
capabilities are not the only way in which the US perceives China as a
threat. [The 'China threat' has been used by the US to protect its
interests in national security, the international economic sector, and
energy security]{.underline} (Campion, 2020; Nyman, 2014). Campion
(2020) and Nyman (2014) use a critical discourse analysis of the energy
and cybersecurity sectors to see how they have become intertwined in the
construction of China as a threat. Since perceptions of security and
insecurity are discursive constructions, it is useful to use speech-acts
to uncover how the issues are advanced from everyday politics to high
politics (Buzan and Wæver, 2009) and how it constitutes an existential
threat. Despite both countries being economically intertwined and
cooperative through international organizations and bilateral
agreements, China perceives the US as untrustworthy and imposing, while
the US views China as a threat in many sectors and a potential
challenger to its position as a unipole and regional hegemon. (Nyman,
2014). [China is perceived as a threat to the status quo, therefore it
poses a threat to the American identity.]{.underline} Chengqiu's (2020)
article does not analyze the US-Sino rivalry in relevance to
securitization, but ideational differences and perceptions have been
factors that affect the relationship between the two countries. The
theoretical framework used is a combination of the cognitive psychology
of perceptions and misperceptions by Jervis and social constructivism by
Wendt. The data of the American strategy toward China was surmised on
four aspects, 7 integrating China into the Western-dominated
international economic system, transforming China into a liberal
democracy, engaging with China to solve regional and international
issues, and preventing China from challenging American hegemony
(Chengqiu, 2020: 35[). By analyzing the policies towards China from the
1990s to 2020 the results showed how much of a threat China was
constructed to be according to each president and if they were
competitive or collaborative. The results showed the policies towards
China varied according to the perceptions of each president but have
progressively become more combative while China's policies towards the
US have been relatively stable]{.underline}. Contrastingly, Almén et al
(2021) specifically analyze the perceptional differences between the US
and China in three sectors: political, economic, and security. Diverging
from Chengqiu, [their findings show that the US perceives China as
trying to spread authoritarian and communist ideologies and overturn the
international order, which China perceives the US as an 'increasingly
antagonistic hegemon that strives for regime change in
China']{.underline} (Almén et al, 2021: 79). Their position and findings
are better suited to this thesis, as the assumption is the US perceiving
China as an existential threat that needs immediate attention.

#### The language that we use matters\-\--it contributes to the way we construct the Chinese threat

\[analysis of Dr. Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at the Jackson
Institute of Global Affairs and senior lecturer at Yale University\]

[In Roach's quote, the language used is quite interesting. It is not
brazen to say Roach is being rather presumptuous by speaking on behalf
of 'the world' and the perspectives it has on China.]{.underline} The
international system and particularly the economic system is dominated
by American and Western norms, so while this statement may be true for
states in the Global North, the same cannot be assumed of states in the
Global South. Therefore, [by assuming and stating that 'the world' is in
an uncomfortable position with China's growing presence, Roach
constitutes a securitizing actor and is attempting to securitize China
by framing its rise as leaving the world in an uncomfortable place that
may further devolve in the future.]{.underline} This relates to the
aspects of American strategy by Chengqiu (2020) by preventing China from
challenging its hegemony.

5.1.2 Discursive Practice and Substantial Modality In terms of
substantial modality, the threat of the BRI and China is largely
concerned with the political and societal sectors. These sectors define
existential threats as sovereignty, ideology, and large-scale collective
identities (Buzan et al, 1998: 22). Melton speculates that if China
assists in the economic development of 68 countries it will lead to
stability and positive feelings. This can change the collective identity
of a state as the political ideology will be influenced by China's
presence. Buzan et al (1998) note that [identities will react and change
in response to internal and external developments]{.underline},
therefore the BRI and the presence of China in developing countries in
Latin America and Africa might shift the political ideology and identity
to reflect more authoritarian and communist ideals. These countries may
also become allies with China, thus reducing the amount of global
influence the US holds. This can present the opportunity for China to
challenge American hegemony not only in Asia but now in Africa and Latin
America as well. The potential change in identity and ideology may not
be amicable and free of discord; Almén et al (2021) hold that China
desired a tributary system and may be using the BRI to produce an
ulterior debt-trap policy. Relating back to the epistemic terrain and
[Roach's speaking on behalf of 'the world' concerning the identity of
the international system, post-WWII and Cold War the US was in the
position to reshape the international system to represent its needs and
strategic interests. China's BRI is perceived to be a threat to the
international identity it had shaped and enjoyed]{.underline} 22 [for
decades]{.underline}. One of Chengqiu's (2020) aspects include
'integrating China into a Western dominated international economic
system' so as not to disrupt the current system. It is perceived that if
China reshapes the identity of the system, it will perhaps sway norms
that are not conforming to US interests. This does not only concern the
restructuring of the economic system, but also is expanded to include
the political identity of states in which the BRI operates. [The US
perceives China as an authoritarian and Communist state having
expansionist motives concerning the spread of ideology and ideals, which
also concurs with Melton's statement of states developing positive
feelings toward China and their domestic ideologies being influenced by
authoritarian principles.]{.underline}

The concept of the "China threat" is not new; its history in the West is
more than a century long. Initially, the [[implications of]{.mark} the
term [China threat were]{.mark} primarily cultural and [socia]{.mark}l:
the [Chinese people]{.mark} and their traditions were [portrayed
b]{.mark}y popular [Western writers as malevolent, alien, and
threatening]{.mark} to Western culture]{.underline}.1 This depiction
remained in the Western imagination and later [[expanded to
include]{.mark} the [political]{.mark} realm, in which [China]{.mark}
was [represented as **brutal and belligerent**]{.mark}]{.underline},
especially during the heyday of McCarthyism or the "Second Red Scare"
following China's regime change in 1949.2 In recent decades, and
particularly since the end of the Cold War, the so-called [China threat
has become a topical issue within contemporary international relations
(IR).3 The concept has taken on a more [prominent role in Western
political discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}---especially, but not
exclusively, in the United States---over the past two decades. It not
only has been introduced into the public sphere by journalists and other
opinion leaders, but has entered the domain of policy through the work
of policy analysts and politicians.4 Those concerned by the China threat
argue in essence that a rising China poses an increasing, imminent, and
real threat both to its neighbors and to far-distant countries.
Moreover, this threat is perceived to be comprehensive, with
security-related, military, economic, and environmental implications.
Naturally, this [hotly debated topic has also received scholarly
attention. Most researchers have taken either a positivist or a
normative approach to the issue of the "China threat."]{.underline}
Positivist studies emphasize causal factors, whereas the aim of
normative research is to refute or support a given thesis from a
historical and ideological perspective. Both positivist and normative
researchers provide theoretical and practical insights into the study of
the alleged "China threat," together with recommendations for dealing
with it. Roy, one of the first scholars to address the issue of the
China threat from an IR perspective,5 [provides a survey of the major
arguments on both sides of the debate, including a literature review of
neorealist and neoclassical--realist theories of the threat posed by
China and policy recommendations for Western governments]{.underline}.
Notable [original [research]{.mark}]{.underline} on the China threat
topic has continued to emerge over the years. Taking a more liberal
approach, [Li [argues that]{.mark} the challenge posed by a fastgrowing
China to stability in and beyond the Asia-Pacific region depends on the
expectations of [Chinese policy makers]{.mark}, who operate in a highly
economically interdependent environment.6 They are **[more likely to use
peaceful means]{.mark}** to settle disputes with neighbors and others
[if they perceive economic benefits]{.mark} to arise from such a
strategy]{.underline}. Other scholars use realist-IR theory
(particularly power-transition theory) to contend that the so-called
China threat has emerged in the political discourse of the United States
and other Western countries in response to the rise of China.7 In
another review article, Jeffery argues thought-provokingly for the
[[danger]{.mark} of [creating a real China threat through "historical
analogies]{.mark}" with previous challenger states]{.underline}.8 For
instance, [[power-transition theorists]{.mark} in the realist-IR school
[compare China's threat with]{.mark} that of [19th-century
Germany]{.mark}, and adherents of the successor state image theory [draw
analogies with]{.mark} the [S]{.mark}oviet [U]{.mark}nion.]{.underline}
Most of the Chinese scholars involved in this debate take a normative
approach to the issue. They focus on two major questions: why the issue
of the China threat exists and how to cope with it. Chen argues that
from a legal and historical perspective, the [[China threat
allegations]{.mark} made by U.S. politicians, defense officials, and
academics are [nothing but]{.mark} a **[reincarnation of]{.mark} the
"[yellow peril]{.mark}**" conspiracy theory]{.underline} promulgated by
Tsarist Russia and Wilhelmine Germany in the late 19th century.9 This
view is echoed by Shi, who takes a postcolonial approach to interpreting
the position of the China threat within Western discourse.10 More
directly, Luo challenges the China threat thesis on the grounds that the
[nature of the international threat posed by China depends on its
foreignpolicy strategy rather than on its growing power]{.underline}; as
[[Chinese policy makers]{.mark} have **exhibited [little
inclination]{.mark}** [to challenge international]{.mark} peace and
[stability]{.mark}]{.underline}, the China threat argument is
unfounded.11 In terms of policy recommendations, Chinese scholars such
as Chen, Feng, and Jiang suggest that the Chinese government should win
trust from other states by making its peace-loving foreign strategy
clear and participating more actively in the international community.12
A few researchers diverge from the mainstream response to this issue.
Oliver Turner, for example, [highlights the [ideational rather]{.mark}
than [material factors in]{.mark} the processes of [representing the
China threat]{.mark} complicit in the U.S.--China policy]{.underline}.13
He argues that the main purpose of these [[processes is to
create]{.mark} a **[threatening Chinese identity]{.mark}**, foreign to
that of the United States, to [trigger actions that reinforce the
binary]{.mark} opposition between the two countries]{.underline}. Before
Turner and in the same vein, [Pan takes a poststructuralist discursive
approach]{.underline} to interpreting the role of the China threat
within the U.S. political discourse. He focuses on the ["discursive
construction of otherness" by which [China]{.mark} is [fashioned
as]{.mark} a "**[threatening, absolute other]{.mark}**" to the "US-led
evolutionary scheme]{.underline}."14 Much of Pan's discussion of this
issue is devoted to [**[real policy implications]{.mark}**, namely the
risk that considering "[theory as practice]{.mark}"]{.underline} in U.S.
policy will [[give rise to]{.mark} a [real "China threat."]{.mark}15 He
further expands his scope of enquiry by deconstructing the Western
representation of China's rise]{.underline}. To him, dominant Western
perceptions of China's rise tell us less about China and [more about
Western self-imagination and its desire for certainty.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Climate

#### The alarmist climate security narrative presented of the 1ac generates massive skepticism -- causes emerging countries to reject the plan which crushes solvency

Jeroen **Warner**, Ingrid Boaswageningen University,
Netherlandscorresponding Author, 3-13-20**19**, \"Securitization of

[By strengthening the climate security coalition, more pressure was put
on those states still needing to make ambitious mitigation
commitments]{.underline} during the UNFCCC negotiations on the
post-Kyoto Framework. The primary countries the FCO targeted at that
time were the US and the emerging developing countries (FCO, 2007: 71).
But these [**emerging countries were precisely those overtly rejecting
the security narrative on climate change,** criticizing the move to
discuss climate change in the Security Council during the UN Security
Council debates on climate change]{.underline} in 2007 and 2011, and
[expressing great scepticism regarding alarmist security framings on
climate change]{.underline}. To counter the security discourse on
climate change[, the Brazilian delegation for instance argued:
'...utmost caution must be exercised in establishing links between
conflict and the utilization of natural resources or the evolution of
climate on our planet']{.underline} (UNSC, 2007: 20). [Similar comments
were made by other emerging countries, such as China and India, and
received support from other developing countries]{.underline} who see
climate change as a matter of sustainable development (Boas, 2015;
Sindico, 2007[). In particular, emerging giants with no special voting
powers in the UN]{.underline} Security Council, such as India and
Brazil, [have been highly sceptical of these moves and preferred climate
change to be discussed in fora where they do have decision-making
power]{.underline}. In the 2011 debate, [Brazil, Russia, India and
China, generally expressing scepticism with respect to a security
framing of climate chan]{.underline}ge, showed consideration with the
precarious situation of developing small island states (SIDS). The four
[BRICS]{.underline} countries however [accused the West of intending to
change the terms of the debate by lifting climate change to the level of
the UN Security Counci]{.underline}l (Boas, 2015) -- a clear case of
'venue shopping' (Pralle, 2009). [In India, for instance, it triggered
distrust and a defensive position towards the UK's intentions, adding to
a tense negotiation climate**. In the words of the former Indian Prime
Minister's Special Envoy on Climate Change, 'the security argument put
forward by the West is an attempt to deflect attention away from what
they need to do themselves'**]{.underline}.10 In 2013, the UK together
with Pakistan tried to convene another formal UN Security Council debate
on the subject, which was however blocked by Russia and China (King,
2013). The debate still happened but in an informal setting under the
so-called 'Arriaformula'. In 2015, another 'Arriaformula' debate was
held, then initiated by Spain and Malaysia (Werrell and Femia, 2015).
Thus while some emerging developing countries continue to oppose the
idea, others, such as Malaysia and Pakistan, shifted to the side of the
securitizers, suggesting an increasing disagreement on the subject
amongst the leading countries of the G-77 group. Whilst the Small Island
States actively raise the security argument in the UN Security Council,
there is dissent at home as to whether this is the appropriate frame[.
For instance, small-island state populations resist the associated
helpless image of drowning islands producing so-called 'climate
refugees']{.underline} (Farbotko and Lazrus, 2012). [In addition, the
alarmist climate security narrative was also unable to maintain a
support base within the UK itself in recent years]{.underline}. The tide
turned when the Conservatives came to power in 2010 and gave the
promotion of climate action in the UNFCCC a lower level of priority. The
focus turned more to other crises, which were experienced more directly
at home, such as the economic crisis and Brexit. In the 2010 National
Security Strategy and the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review,
the striving for a multilateral deal on climate change mitigation was
only mentioned once (Cabinet Office, 2010: 18), without employing a
security narrative to promote efforts towards such action. The policy
constituency within the UK had eroded, making space for alternative and
related framings (see Boas and Rothe, 2016, for details).

#### 1ac security rhetoric creates a bunker mentality in which people feel too helpless to create change -- fundamentally ignores the crisis depicted by the Aff and crushes solvency

Jeroen **Warner**, Ingrid Boaswageningen University,

backfire,\" SAGE Journals,
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419834018//jc>

[Davoudi (2014) shows how the social understanding of nature moved from
nature-as-clockwork (Enlightenment) through nature-as-finite (Club of
Rome, 1970s), through nature as risk (1990s) to discourses of global
danger and insecurity caused by nature]{.underline}. The author traces
the rise of 'climate securitization' back to a conference, 'The Changing
Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security' in Toronto in 1988, which
portrayed the consequences of climate change as only second to nuclear
war. Since the 1990s [climate change has often been presented as a
global crisis]{.underline}, an existential threat to human civilization,
a planetary catastrophe (Paglia, 2018). [Yet, unlike an aggressive force
out to conquer foreign territory, climate change is a special domain of
emergency, that of 'threats without enemies']{.underline} (Prins, 1993).
As argued by Methmann and Rothe (2012: 328), [climate is depicted as an
external threat, with impacts coming suddenly, 'from the outside'.
Issues of risk and security 'can provoke strong emotions, legitimise
extraordinary practices, and lead to practices that are otherwise
indefensible']{.underline} (Davoudi, 2014: 371--372). Environmental
securitization however is an uncertain domain for securitization (Buzan
et al., 1998; Trombetta, 2008). In climate change, the burden of proof
to legitimize securitization is especially tricky. While a clear
majority of the academic community considers anthropogenic climate
change sufficiently proven, its invisibility as a source of anticipated
catastrophes that have yet to happen, cannot easily compete with visible
weather events in the 'attention economy\' (Hamblyn, 2009). Other
publics, then, are not convinced, as has become clear for instance under
the Trump administration. Moreover, there is no ready consensus within
the academic community on a clear and present nexus between climate
change, violent conflict and/or migration (Adams et al., 2018), and if
there is, that it can be successfully averted through a particular
course of action. The lack of 'full closure\' has not stopped some from
trying to securitise climate change. But [overstressing the security
dimension risks reducing democratic accountability]{.underline} (Coaffee
et al., 2008[). Some scholars have indeed warned for a security
discourse to induce aversive policies, such as a larger role for the
military to cope with feared effects of global warming like climate
migration]{.underline} (Hartmann, 2010). [Indeed, issues that can harm
military capability, are more likely to become securitized than those
that cannot]{.underline} (Fidler, 2007). Not only is climate a 'threat
without an enemy' (Prins, 1993) but also lacks a 'hero' to save the day.
Armed forces can defeat an invading enemy, a SWAT team can neutralise a
terrorist, ICT experts can intercept a hacker, civil engineers and water
managers can stop the flood, but [no single actor can stop climate
change. A pitfall of climate securitization therefore is that of
instilling a sense of ontological insecurity in the intended audience
rather than rallying support. Presenting an apocalyptic picture without
a 'way out' upsets people's basic sense of security and trust in the
world around them. 'Insecuritizing' them]{.underline} (Bigo, 2002)
**[instils a feeling of helplessness in the recipients of the message, a
perceived lack of agency, leading people to ignore the issue and hide
behind a false sense of security in their home and
community]{.underline}** (Harries, 2008[). The way out becomes the
domain of more mundane technocratic practices. '\[A\]pocalyptic climate
change is articulated as overstraining the capacity of political actors,
and thus as ruling out exceptional measures and passing responsibility
to the "political machine]{.underline}" (...)' (Methmann and Rothe,
2012: 324). [The security discourse on climate change has not resulted
in successful securitization in the sense of having led to exceptional
measures being accepted and implemented]{.underline} (Corry, 2012;
Methmann and Rothe, 2012; Oels, 2012). Instead**[, it 'is so exaggerated
that it prompts the opposite: routine and micro-practices of risk
management: mitigation as precautionary risk management, adaptation as
investing in preparedness, and security not as pre-empting but as a
combination of the former two']{.underline}** (Methman and Rothe, 2012:
337). In adding to these scholarly analyses, our study interrogates the
question of failed climate securitization through an in-depth empirical
account. It [hereby further contextualizes and situates arguments
provided by others]{.underline}, such as Methmann and Rothe (2012), [and
points to further explanatory factors that thus far have received less
attention.]{.underline} Indeed, both cases point to the rather
instrumental character of the securitizing moves by political actors to
'sell\' climate policy and explain why this has not benefited their
success amongst the core target audiences. The next section will examine
such discursive strategies on climate change and security through the
case of the UK's climate diplomacy in the international policy arena in
the late 2000s. Thereafter, our second case traces the genesis,
'marketing\' and resonance of a national plan to make the Dutch delta
climate-proof. A comparison between the two (see Table 1) looks at the
key elements of securitization -- an existential threat and the 'only
way out', the degree to which this resonated and was responded to by key
audiences.

#### Hybrid warfare/misinformation discourses are empty signifiers and is just the Western means to delegitimize opposition and shift attention away from failing institutions

Since then, strategic communicative actions that are intended to
influence, mislead and confuse foreign populations have assumed a
central position in global debates about politics and foreign policy.
Given the impact of such actions on elections, polarization and crisis
management, it was natural for the rhetoric about these actions to
assume such a central position(Bradshaw, Howard, 2018). [However, over
time, popular buzzwords like 'disinformation/misinformation', 'fake
news', and 'information operations' have proliferated in global
political mainstream discourse and assumed an accusatory nature
worldwide as more leaders, diplomats, and politicians have begun using
them to **discredit and delegitimize their political
opponents**.]{.underline} This dynamic was later conceptualized as
'discursive deflection' (Ross, Rivers, 2018; Smith, 2019) and became
acutely visible in the foreign policy domain, as more countries have
begun securitizing the concepts 'fake news', 'disinformation', and
'information warfare' to similarly discredit, and delegitimize rival
countries(Baum, Potter, 2019). Broadly speaking, 'discursive-deflection'
is the strategy of discrediting competitors and rivals by portraying
oneself as the sole source of truth. While the domestic political use of
these terms is well-studied, we are still somewhat in the dark with
regard to why countries choose to securitize these terms and what
happens in their interactions with other countries when they do so.

The foreign policy use of such terms predates the 2016 US elections and
proliferated after the Russian military involvement in Crimea and Donbas
(Khaldarova, Pantti, 2016). The primary reason for this contextual
proliferation was the Russian decision to deny the initial stages of its
involvement in Ukraine and its broader strategy of distracting and
dividing Western attention over Russian military operations (Mejias,
Vokuev, 2017). There is still a debate over whether it was really
Russian information operations that had derailed NATO response in
Ukraine, or if disinformation discourses are employed in order to shift
the blame over to Russia at a time when NATO was already divided over
its commitment to Ukraine (Lysenko, Brooks, 2018). While there is robust
evidence of Russian information operations in Ukraine and its role in
spreading disinformation in NATO countries, sustained NATO apathy
towards rising Russian military influence in the Black Sea after 2014
and Syria after 2015 support the latter claim.

[Critics of Western disinformation discourses for example, argue that
such discourses have turned into '**floating (or empty) signifiers',
that have no specific or agreed-upon meaning** (Farkas, Schou, 2018). In
that vein, blaming others for engaging in disinformation often
**distracts attention away from a mistake or failed policy** enacted by
the blamer (Monsees, 2020).]{.underline} In this case, critics argue
that Western discourses on disinformation are intended to distract
attention away from NATO or EU divisions, or more domesticlevel
polarization dynamics, by creating a unique empty signifier
(disinformation) that is employed as a rallying rhetoric that bolsters
the significance of external threats (Mas-Manchón et al., 2021). [This
way, disinformation and its associated terms like misinformation, fake
news and information war get securitized, receiving disproportionate
levels of attention in the policy domain. In this context,
disinformation and its associated terms are used to **exaggerate** an
existing threat and create a rallying discourse that would **channel the
attention of the divided Western nations away from their internal
disagreements**, **and towards an inflated external
threat**]{.underline}. Some scholars go even further, arguing that
disinformation is being securitized in the West (especially in NATO) to
the extent the 'war on terror' was securitized through the 2000s
(Lanoszka, 2019). [In this line, disinformation is alleged to have
become a new strategic glue that would help Western nations pool in
their increasingly diverging interests and resources into a common cause
(Baumann, 2020).]{.underline}

[Securitization of disinformation in domestic politics is relatively
well-studied (Freelon, Wells, 2020; Neo, 2021). Although these terms
have entered into mainstream debate after the 2016 US elections, former
President Donald Trump too, had securitized fake news to delegitimize
his opponents by constructing rival disinformation as a national
security problem, indirectly attributable to China]{.underline}
(Polletta, Callahan, 2019). Following the tornado of accusations in the
US, political actors in Britain, France, Italy, South Africa, Kenya and
others have begun blaming each other for engaging in organized
disinformation (Maweu, 2019; Saurwein, Spencer-Smith, 2020). Even in
Sweden, there is empirical evidence that suggests accusing journalists
of spreading fake news results in self-censorship of such outlets
(Bennett, Livingston, 2018). There are further cases of evidence
supporting the claim that elite-level discourses on disinformation have
a direct effect on how the wider society perceives information and facts
in general, creating a measurable effect on public trust towards such
facts and information (Van Duyn, Collier, 2019). In Singapore for
example, delegitimizing rival parties and news outlets through
disinformation discourse is considered 'acceptable', as part of the
state's duty to discipline the opposition and its political actors (Tan,
2020). Similar trends emerging in democracies and authoritarian
countries alike, such as in Austria, Australia, Poland, Russia, and
South Africa, demonstrate the universality of instrumentalizing
disinformation discourse as a political delegitimization tactic
(Kurowska, Reshetnikov, 2018; Tandoc et al., 2018).

While a robust scholarship is emerging on the domestic political uses of
disinformation discourse, there has so far been no longitudinal, large-N
study that explored how such constructions emerge in international
politics. Furthermore, there has so far been no exploration of how such
discourses evolve over time and under what contexts in foreign affairs.
We know that disinformation and fake news are important issues in world
politics and that they are frequently used to bring an issue to public
attention, but we are more in the dark over the contextual and temporal
nuances that drive how these concepts are discursively constructed in
foreign policy discourse.

This study aims to provide an early addition to the emerging literature
on foreign policy uses of disinformation discourses by focusing on how
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has used them in its
documents and social media posts. It does so by studying 238,452 tweets
from official NATO and affiliated accounts, and more than 2,000 NATO
texts, news, statements, and publications using computational methods
since January 2014 and presents an unsupervised structural topic model
(stm) analysis to explore the main thematic and discursive contexts of
these texts. Ultimately, we hope to trigger a wider debate on the
securitization of disinformation and fake news in foreign policy, and
the greater explanatory value of computational methods in studying
large-N text data in studying such securitization strategies.

2 Securitizing Disinformation

Over the last few years, defining what misleading content is and how to
measure the legitimacy of its dissemination has been at the forefront of
journalistic, political and scientific debate (Tandoc et al., 2018).
Even before its proliferation in 2016, disinformation was a widely-used
term in the mainstream discourse, co-existing with other terms such as
infoglut, or information overload (Andrejevic, 2013). Although at first
disinformation and misinformation were terms used interchangeably,
today, disinformation refers to the deliberate dissemination of false
information with the intention to mislead and confuse its audiences.
Misinformation, on the other hand, strictly defines unintended diffusion
of false information by mistake, without malintent. There are also
bridge terms such as 'malinformation' that is factually accurate but is
deployed to harm and damage an individual or an entity, or the concept
of 'problematic information' as defined by Caroline Jack (Jack, 2017;
Morgan, 2018). Although it is not directly mentioned, all of these
concepts refer to the digital space, where information manipulation is
disseminated faster and wider on social media and digital communication
technologies compared to more media forms of media.

[As terms 'disinformation/misinformation', 'fake news', 'information
operation', and 'hybrid war' are often used interchangeably in political
discourse, there are no clear-cut differences in the strategic topic of
each word choice (Guess, Lyons, 2020).]{.underline} Politicians and
leaders can often use these terms as a bag of buzzwords, without a clear
operational definition of what each of them precisely means. [Each of
these buzzwords generate roughly the same effect on the consumers of
such messages, which is the **delegitimization of their target** (Tucker
et al., 2018).]{.underline} Especially problematic is the fact that once
the discourse on disinformation is weaponized to delegitimize rivals,
there is very little such rivals can do to defend themselves. [Given the
significant political charge of these terms, individuals or institutions
that are alleged to be engaging in disinformation-related activities
often have to enter into a fruitless spar of words to challenge such
allegations, which usually leads to further controversy. This renders
the accuser - or the side that securitizes disinformation - more
advantageous compared to the accused, generating a dynamic similar to
the 'attacker's advantage' in cyber security where the defender is
continuously blindsided (Tong et al., 2020).]{.underline}

[However cyber warfare is defined---and, just as with the term
'terrorism'**, there is unlikely to be a uniform definition** or
understanding accepted across all polities---explanations for its
emergence as an empirical phenomenon are fairly limited.]{.underline} At
the systemic level on which structural realist accounts of international
relations tend to focus, cyber capabilities emerge to fulfil political
needs within an anarchic system (and a global network of computers),
which is ungoverned and ungovernable by nation-states. In this sense,
cyberwar capabilities are developed as a natural extension of (and new
medium for) existing geopolitical tensions and disputes. [The
development and use of cyber warfare capabilities by one power drives
fear and uncertainty in other states, which invest in similar
capabilities themselves. According to this logic, cyber warfare is a
strategic chain reaction caused by security dilemmas.]{.underline} That
these systemic dynamics are only now receiving sustained and rigorous
academic attention,11 and that the second-order effects of cyber
deployment (such as arms races) are only beginning to be fully
recognized,12 is surprising and disconcerting. A further explanation
relates to the nature of the domain of cyberspace itself. Because cyber
capabilities can be used covertly, and cyber attacks are difficult to
attribute (at least legally and politically, if not technically), they
are attractive to revisionist actors, who use them as part of hybrid
operations (in combination with special forces operations,
disinformation and propaganda, and economic or political coercion) to
advance their interests.13

Most of these structural and systemic explanations of the emergence of
cyber warfare fail to appreciate the historical, cultural and ideational
drivers of cyber conflict, and indeed the cultural, historical and
political contexts in which cyberwar capabilities have emerged. [Cyber
warfare entered the popular imagination during a period of immense
historical change and uncertainty. In the 1990s, the fear of hackers,
often depicted as cloaked and masked figures, began to displace the fear
of the 'communist under the bed']{.underline}.14 The instability caused
by the disintegration of states in the post-Cold War era and the
emergence of complex identity-based conflict was also influential. In
Kosovo in 1999, networks of Serbian and Chinese hackers retaliated
through cyberspace for the bombing of, respectively, Serbian forces and
the Chinese Embassy. This fed into concerns within national security
establishments that the modern battlefield was no longer a place in
which nations had a monopoly on the use of force, and that a form of
warfare was emerging unlike what soldiers had faced before.15 These
dynamics were compounded by anticipation of the Millennium (Y2K) Bug, an
event which many feared would lead to a global internet meltdown, and
which set a precedent for military involvement in cyber-security
affairs.16 [The 'war on terror' perhaps did more than anything to
**heighten fears** around the internet, with fears about cyberterrorism
and 'cyber doom scenarios' (digital 9/11s) emerging out of acts of real
violence by jihadists.17]{.underline} This period of fear and
uncertainty corresponded with an exponential growth in internet users,
the formation of social networks, and the use of securitizing discourse
to present the internet as something that needed to be managed,
controlled and fought over. As Richard Ashley has argued, the conditions
of the post-Cold War era---particularly the uncertainty that was
inherent in both policymaking and academic communities during this
period---created the conditions (a vacuum) for new security narratives
(cyberwar in this case) to emerge.18 The cyberwar narrative thus gave
meaning and order to a seemingly anarchic international environment.
Cyberwar was not, of course, the only narrative that arose to fill the
gap created by the demise of the Soviet Union. Fears over environmental
and social disintegration, and the threats of civilizational conflict
and jihadism, were also prominent; and the destabilizing impact of
technology on national and global security became a dominant discourse
that was often integrated with other security concerns---the overwrought
fear of cyberterrorism, for example.

Importantly, the emergence of cyber warfare has come to constitute an
overarching narrative which has been disseminated by and proved
beneficial to a variety of actors. [In this sense, cyberwar was **not
just an apolitical tool** driven by uncertainty in the security
environment, but a concept deliberately constructed and connected to
discourses, ideas and behaviours that have permeated, and served the
interests of, a host of different security communities]{.underline}.
These include the popular and social media, where cyberwar is often
depicted in apocalyptic terms---often for commercial reasons (click
bait, as it is euphemistically known)--- and in military establishments,
which have tended to lean on conventional military strategic thought in
their attempts to grasp the implications of new technologies. [As Alves
has argued, the use of 'battlefield' analogies to frame cyberspace has
contributed to the securitization and militarization of the internet,
and helped to **dismiss the negative impacts of increasing state control
and surveillance**, while at the same time eroding trust, freedom and
creativity.19]{.underline} Lawson takes a similar view, arguing that the
cyberwar discourse is indicative of 'an ongoing crisis of effectively
identifying and understanding what is old and new, the same and
different about cyber conflict'.20 These cultural and discourse-based
interpretations of cyberwar exist not solely owing to intellectual lag
(the time it takes to rethink strategy when confronted by new security
challenges), but because of deliberately constructed narratives about
the nature of cyber conflict across a variety of communities that are
interested in (and have interests in) cyber security being framed in
this way. [Cyberwar narratives are thus strategic
narratives---rhetorical devices used to package and frame a security
issue for strategic benefit. International Relations scholars have also
benefited from these framings: creating fear can be used to justify the
need for funded research on cyber security, and cyber hyperbole seeks
out and draws attention to analyses in popular media and other
outlets.]{.underline}

The harms and shortcomings of the cyberwar narrative have crystallized
during the last decade. At the geopolitical level, the adoption,
development and diffusion of cyber-warfare capabilities, and the
diffusion of certain ideas about and characterizations of cyberwar that
justify their development and use, have led to destabilizing practices
among many of the world's leading cyber powers. The widespread global
damage caused by the WannaCry virus, the continued reverse engineering
and widespread diffusion of the Stuxnet malware, the use of cyber
attacks to destabilize political systems (as in the case of the 2016 US
election) and large-scale cyber espionage on the part of some states all
serve as examples. [The emergence of 'cyberwar' has heightened tensions
between world powers, and contributed to the ongoing erosion of the
rules-based international order.]{.underline} The latest offensive
doctrines of the world's Great Powers, for example, suggest that it is
acceptable to 'defend forward' in cyberspace, and continually and
persistently to engage your adversaries, regardless of conceptions of
sovereignty.21 Russia and China have used cyber attacks against power
and energy grids, nuclear infrastructure and other civilian
infrastructure.22 Some cyber operations have been responded to with
military force, as in the Israeli air strike against a Hamas hacker
facility, and the cyber doctrine of many of the world's leading powers
is based on keeping force on the table as an option to respond to
network-based attacks. While deterrence and restraint may be important
factors in preventing the most damaging forms of attacks,23 significant
evidence has emerged that the world's leading powers are seeking to
pre-emptively install malware into foreign critical infrastructure in
the expectation of future conflicts.24 Few scholars would argue that the
current state of cyber security is anything but risky, dangerous, and
harmful to international peace and stability, and increasing attention
is being given to the range of other harms caused by offensive cyber
operations, including psychological, social/societal, economic, physical
and digital damage.25 The recent increase in attacks on health
infrastructure and the exploitation of the COVID-19 crisis by hackers to
commit cybercrime is illustrative of the connections between wider
social instability and cyber operations, and of the need for remedies
that don't exacerbate the problems.

The shortcomings of cyberwar narrative and practice are evident in other
areas of policy and intellectual debate too. [Cyber warfare is often
used to justify **protecting the nation-state**, even when the
protection of people or groups, including vulnerable communities, within
the state is not fully considered.]{.underline} [Cyber warfare has led
to **overly militarized approaches** to cyber security and the
involvement of the military (and intelligence agencies) in traditionally
civilian areas of society, even when police, justice or crime-based
approaches may be more suitable to countering cyber threats (in the same
way that the 'war on terror' was an overly militarized approach to a
transnational security threat).]{.underline} [Often, military
involvement is justified by reference to the notions of the permanency
and constancy of cyberwar;]{.underline} as the British Chief of the
Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter described it, we are 'at war every
day['.26 And yet, cyberspace is not a controllable or conquerable
territory, and is fundamentally ill-suited to the logic of national,
defendable boundaries.27 As Lawson argues, the proliferation of these
types of narratives leads to **'the adoption of counterproductive, even
dangerous policies'.28**]{.underline}

#### It's not just a single instance\-\--their securitization of Chinese 5G or Huawei or cybersecurity is part of a bigger violent attempt at macrosecuritizing China

AT: No Link\-\--AFF will say something like our specific instance in
securitization\-\--this card is just like it's part of broader violent
framing

This changed dramatically as Western states begun preparing for the
fifth generation (5G) networks. [The United States embarked upon a
global campaign to prevent Chinese suppliers --- and in particular the
company Huawei --- from delivering 5G infrastructure. The American claim
was that Chinese equipment would represent a national security hazard
for those depending upon it --- not because of its technical
functionality and stability, but because it allegedly could be a gateway
for Chinese espionage and sabotage of Western critical infrastructure.
In other words, 5G and Chinese suppliers were
**securitized**]{.underline}. The topic was elevated from the realm of
ordinary politics and treated as an emergency, thus legitimizing
extraordinary countermeasures (Buzan et al., 1998).

How did this happen? [In this article we will explore this question and
ask if the securitization of Chinese 5G suppliers was simply a subset of
the US\'s broader securitization of China,]{.underline} or if there was
something particular about 5G that distinguished it from previous
generations of cellular networks. Further, we will ask if the ban on
Chinese companies such as Huawei was an appropriate remedy. Could the
securitization of 5G have been isolated from the broader securitization
of China and Chinese suppliers? Finally, we will ask how the US\'s
European allies and partners responded to this securitizing move. Did
European states follow the American approach, and if not, how did they
differ?

The article is an interdisciplinary attempt to address both political
and technical aspects of the securitization of 5G. We use securitization
theory to help frame the empirical analysis, but also engage with the
interplay between the material and social dimensions in securitization
theory. We argue that the material nature of 5G technology made
securitization more likely, but we also demonstrate that Europe, to a
large extent, chose a somewhat different approach to the US. By limiting
securitization to the 5G technology ('niche securitization'), rather
than applying it to China as a whole ('macrosecuritization'), European
states achieved enhanced 5G security without confronting China more
broadly.

SECURITIZATION

[Securitization theory is about the social construction of a threat and
the response to it.]{.underline} The theory emerged in the 1990s as a
reaction to and rejection of rationalist notions in the then dominant
theories in International Relations of dangers and risks as objective
givens (Buzan et al., 1998). Instead, securitization theory emphasizes
the political processes that make something a security issue. The theory
has since evolved in many directions, but the key idea is that 'an issue
is given sufficient saliency to win the assent of the audience, which
enables those who are authorized to handle the issue to use whatever
means they deem most appropriate. In other words, securitization
combines the politics of threat design with that of threat management'
(Balzacq et al., 2016: 495).

The theory comprises a securitizing actor (e.g. an individual or a
state), securitizing moves (e.g. speeches and practices), an audience
(e.g. a society or a parliament), and a referent object (that which is
being securitized, e.g. terrorism or migration). [In this article, we
use a simple model to enhance an empirical study of the row over 5G in
the West. We define the United States as the securitizing actor that
securitized 5G through speeches and diplomatic practices in an attempt
to convince Europe (the audience) to follow suit.]{.underline}

Applying the theory to processes taking place between states rather than
inside them has been labelled macrosecuritization by Buzan and Wæver
(2009). This aspect of securitization theory has not been explored as
broadly as many other facets of the theory. Buzan and Wæver\'s model is
complex and multidimensional, including level of analysis (local to
global), degree of comprehensiveness (from niche to inclusive), and
degree of success in convincing the audience. Macrosecuritizations, they
write, 'are necessarily launched as candidates for top-rank threats',
such as 'geo-economics, terrorism, \[and\] nuclear proliferation'
(ibid.: 258--59). Niche securitizations, on the other hand, 'get onto
the agenda as accepted threats, but do not rise to top priority';
examples include 'environmental threats, epidemic diseases, organised
crime, \[and\] drugs' (ibid.). Buzan and Wæver also point out that
macrosecuritizations are more vulnerable to breakdown than mid- or
micro-level securitizations, as the mid-level units (states) may pull
out or reject the securitizing move. A reason for this could be that
there are usually weaker relations between the securitizing actor and
the audience on the macro/global level than in mid- or micro-level
cases.

Inspired by Buzan and Wæver\'s model, we borrow some of its concepts for
our empirical study, but do not apply it in its full complexity. In our
case, the US government was not dependent upon European consent to
implement restrictions on Chinese 5G suppliers on American soil. This
was a domestic securitization process. The securitizing move we study,
however, happened after the initial US securitization and was about
convincing other states to undertake their own national securitizations
of the 5G rollout. This was an American attempt at comprehensive
macrosecuritization of China, with a niche securitization of 5G.

Another dimension of the theory that we engage with here is the material
or technological dimension. As Buzan and Wæver (2009: 255) point out:
'In principle, securitizing actors can attempt to construct anything as
a referent object. In practice, however, the constraints of facilitating
conditions mean that they are much more likely to be successful with
some types of referent object than with others'. In our case we argue
that the features of 5G technology --- its weaknesses and
vulnerabilities as well as its expected role as a critical
infrastructure in our societies --- are important to understanding
securitization processes. [In other words, these processes were
constrained and impacted by the material 'realities' of 5G technology.
Understanding, for instance, if the dangers pointed to by the
securitizing actor (such as espionage) can be addressed or resolved
through technological solutions, is crucial.]{.underline} Such
understanding can help us navigate the political terrain and enhance our
understanding of securitization processes. This does not mean that the
technological specificities of 5G telecoms in any way determine
political outcomes --- but they do affect them. In short, if a simple
technical solution could mitigate all the concerns raised by the
securitizing actor, securitization would fail.

AMERICAN SECURITIZATION OF CHINESE TELECOMS

Voices calling for the securitization of Chinese telecommunications
companies in the US can be traced back to at least 2010. At that time,
the FBI, politicians and US experts repeatedly pointed out that Chinese
companies could pose a security threat to the United States (Barboza,
2010). In 2012 Congress warned that the 'United States should view with
suspicion the continued penetration of the US telecommunications market
by Chinese telecommunications companies' (US House of Representatives,
2012: vi).

At the time, these warnings did not gain too much traction. The overall
political mood when it came to Chine was one of inclusion. Since the
1990s, the US and the West had had a clear strategy to bring China (and
others, such as Russia) into the existing world order. In practice, this
meant that they were invited into existing regimes, such as the World
Trade Organization, and that trade and dialogue were promoted with the
hope that authoritarian regimes would open up and gradually democratize.
This policy had been questioned and criticized for a while, but as the
Trump administration took office in 2016, a distinct shift in both
rhetoric and practices could be noted. Trump embarked upon a
confrontational approach towards China in many areas, not least in
trade, tariffs and industrial production, but also in security. The
argument was that the strategy of inclusion and change had failed, and
that China had abused American openness to subsidize its industry,
manipulate currency, steal technology and position itself in global
markets. Increasingly authoritarian political developments in China and
growing pressure on neighbouring countries were also referred to by US
government officials. The securitization of Chinese 5G must therefore be
seen in this broader context of American securitization of China in
general.

It was the Chinese telecoms company Huawei that became a particular
target (referent object) of securitization in the US. As a world leader
in 5G technology, and a provider of the 4G networks in many Western
countries, Huawei was a strong candidate to secure many 5G contracts.
However, the Trump administration took a robust stance against the
company, citing the risks of espionage from China. They claimed that
Huawei and other Chinese technology companies represented a serious
threat to national security, as their 5G systems could be misused for
the purpose of espionage or even sabotage by China (Cartwright, 2020).

Questions were asked about its ownership structure and the influence the
Chinese Communist Party had over Huawei (Hawes and Li, 2017; Rühlig,
2020). In particular, critics of Huawei referred to the 2017 Chinese
Intelligence Law, which requires Chinese companies to turn over
information to, and comply with, China\'s intelligence and security
services (Rühlig and Björk, 2020: 9). As a result, in 2018 the US
decided to ban the use of Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese
telecommunications company, in the Armed Forces (US Congress, 2018).
Furthermore, in May 2019 the US put Huawei on its 'Entities List', a
list of companies not allowed to buy American products (Federal
Register, 2019). This meant that Huawei could no longer use US-made
chips and other components in its products.

In April 2020, the then Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, announced that
the United States would introduce a '5G Clean Path' system that would
ensure that no correspondence from US embassies would go through Chinese
networks or systems. This was later extended to the 'Clean Network',
whose purpose was to 'secure national resources, including citizens'
computer security and the company\'s most sensitive information from
aggressive intrusions by malicious actors, such as the Chinese Communist
Party' (US Department of State, 2020a). The Clean Network included
'Clean Apps', 'Clean Carrier', 'Clean Store', 'Clean Cable', 'Clean
Cloud' and 'Clean Path'. The purpose was to exclude Chinese companies
from app stores, remove American apps from Chinese app stores, and
refrain from using Chinese networks, cloud services and cables.

At the same time that Huawei was securitized domestically, the Trump
administration embarked upon a global campaign to make other countries
follow suit. [The language used by US officials was forthright, with no
diplomatic filters.]{.underline} For instance, in 2020 the then
Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, stated that: 'If countries choose to
go the Huawei route, it could well jeopardize all the information
sharing and intelligence sharing we have been talking about, and that
could undermine the alliance, or at least our relationship with that
country' (quoted in Sanger and McCabe, 2020). In short, the
securitization of Huawei consisted of rhetoric focused on risks and
dangers, restrictive legislation and a global campaign, which we will
return to below.

However, the campaign against Huawei was not restricted to telecoms
security. The company was accused by US authorities of racketeering and
theft of trade secrets. The conflict peaked in 2019 when Huawei and its
chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, were indicted for fraud and
sanctions evasion. The arrest of Meng Wanzhou in Canada and subsequent
--- seemingly retaliatory --- arrests of Canadian citizens in China
contributed to a strained political climate between China, the US and
Canada (Blanchfield, 2020). However, none of this had anything to do
with 5G security. According to Sanger and McCabe (2020), 'The Huawei
fight is just one part of a bigger US--China battle, as Washington tries
to contain Beijing\'s influence and power and ensure that the world\'s
second-largest economy does not come to dominate advanced industries
that could give it an economic and military edge'. Furthermore, they
hold, 'The United States is also trying to limit China\'s access to
American technology more broadly and is considering restricting sales of
microchips, artificial intelligence, robotics and some types of advanced
software, along with preventing tech companies from teaming up --- or
even sharing research --- with Chinese firms' (ibid.). Hence, the
securitization of Huawei was about more than just 5G security;
geopolitics and economic rivalry were also important factors (Inkster,
2019; Mascitelli and Chung, 2019). [The securitization of 5G and Huawei
was therefore part of a broader US policy of confronting and
securitizing China across a spectrum of issues. It was part of a
comprehensive and global macrosecuritization of China.]{.underline}

Cyber Pearl Harbor in the securitization of cyberspace

[Scholars working within the critical constructivist tradition of
security studies have explored the role of language and rhetoric in U.S.
cyber security discourse]{.underline} (Bendrath, 2003, 2001; Bendrath,
et al., 2007; Betz and Stevens, 2013; Dunn Cavelty, 2007; Eriksson,
2002; Hansen and Nissenbaum, 2009; Lawson, 2012). Much of this work has
been informed by securitization theory, which posits that it is not
predetermined which security threats will make it onto the political
agenda. Instead, security threats are "constructed" because the process
of identifying, understanding, and responding to them is the result of
political discourse. That process involves a "securitizing actor"
(usually a political leader or decision-maker) identifying "threat
subjects" (the source of the threat), "referent objects" (that which is
threatened), and the prospective impacts of a threat (Buzan, et al.,
1998; Campbell, 1998). [Additionally, Dunn Cavelty (2007) notes that in
the case of cyber securitization, specific and sometimes dramatic events
or conditions that she calls "focusing events" can serve to focus
attention on cyber security threats.]{.underline}

[Critical security scholars have been particularly interested in the
construction of cyber threats because they exemplify the emergence of
various "new threats" in the post-Cold War period \[1\]. These have
included a host of **seemingly ambiguous, uncertain**, but dangerous
threats]{.underline} related to environmental degradation, poverty,
health, immigration, and technology \[2\]. [Cyber threat perceptions
have mirrored the ambiguity and uncertainty found in perceptions of
other "new threats," making it difficult to identify and then
communicate clearly and precisely what it is that is threatened, by
whom, and with what potential impacts, in and through
cyberspace]{.underline}. As threat perceptions have shifted, so have
claims about the primary subjects (e.g., foreign spies, criminals,
terrorists, insiders), objects (e.g., corporate data, state secrets,
critical infrastructure), and impacts (e.g., monetary loss, diminished
economic competitiveness, physical disruption or destruction) of those
threats (Dunn Cavelty, 2007; Bendrath, 2003, 2001; Bendrath, et al.,
2007).

From the "wild west" to "space," metaphors and analogies have been
central to attempts to understand the Internet and its meaning for
society and culture broadly (Johnston, 2009). It is unsurprising,
therefore, that the framing of cyber threats in public policy discourse
has also relied (perhaps overly so) on metaphors and analogies of
various kinds, including to war, military, weapons, and natural disaster
(Betz and Stevens, 2013; Lawson, 2012; Lapointe, 2011; Dunn Cavelty,
2013; Libicki, 1997). [Among these, "cyber Pearl Harbor" is one of the
most prominent in the U.S. cybersecurity debate \[3\] and is exemplary
of the widespread use of "cyber-doom," "shut down the power grid," and
"worst-case" scenarios by the full range of participants in these
debates \[4\]. In particular, "cyber Pearl Harbor" is exemplary of the
tendency to deploy hypothetical scenarios, but also to appropriate the
**fear and anxiety** elicited by non-cyber events such as natural
disasters, conventional military attacks, or terrorist attacks to
promote fear of cyber-doom \[5\].]{.underline}

Existing research has yielded a number of important insights and raised
a number of serious concerns about the U.S. cybersecurity debate.
Scholars have noted that the ambiguity and uncertainty surrounding
subjects, objects, means, and impacts of new threats like those
to/through cyberspace can lead to a tendency toward possibilistic
thinking and a logic of preventative or precautionary action (Füredi,
2009; Sunstein, 2002). [In turn, these characteristics have resulted in
increased concern over the possibility of "threat inflation," defined as
"the attempt by elites to create concern for a threat that goes beyond
the scope and urgency that a disinterested analysis would justify"
\[6\]. Having been identified as "emblematic of new threats," \[7\] a
number of scholars, journalists, and even some security professionals
have argued that U.S. public policy discourse about cybersecurity has
been particularly prone to threat inflation (Brito and Watkins, 2011;
Blunden, 2015; Blunden and Cheung, 2014; Dunn Cavelty and Van Der Vlugt,
2015; Gartzke, 2013; Schneier, 2010). Still others have raised the
concern that use of cyber-doom rhetoric in this debate may backfire,
leading to **fear-induced complacency**]{.underline} instead of the
motivation to act that users of such rhetoric presumably wish to elicit
from audiences (Lawson, et al., 2016; Hamre, 2015).

[To date, whether cyber terror, crime, or warfare, we have not seen any
cyber attack approximate the level of destruction contemplated in cyber
Pearl Harbor-like scenarios]{.underline}. For well over a decade,
scholars have called attention to the inflated fears of cyber terror
(Debrix, 2001; Weimann, 2008, 2005; Stohl, 2006; Conway, 2008). Other
studies have pointed to inflated estimates of the impacts of cyber crime
(Wall, 2008; Jardine, 2017, 2015; Anderson, et al., 2013; Florêncio and
Herley, 2013; Romanosky, 2016; Jardine, 2018). Finally, even though the
recent conflict in Ukraine has included the first documented cases of
cyber attacks used to take down electrical grids, the immediate effects
of these attacks were limited, as have been the effects of cyber attacks
on the shape of the military conflict more generally (Kostyuk and
Zhukov, 2019; Jensen, et al., 2019).

It is perhaps unsurprising; therefore, that such scenarios have come
under increased scrutiny over the last several years. Even before the
Russian cyber-interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, some
current and former intelligence officials had rejected the use of "cyber
Armageddon" or "cyber Pearl Harbor" descriptions of cyber threats facing
the United States (Bussey, 2016; Clapper, 2015; Hamre, 2015). After the
election, many more have argued that Russian cyber-interference shows
that the U.S. had been looking in the wrong direction with respect to
cyber attacks (Lewis, 2018, 2017; Lipton, et al., 2016; Nye, 2016;
Orcutt, 2017; Pollard and Devost, 2016; Pollard, et al., 2018; Pollock,
2017; Von Drehle, 2017; Rid and Buchanan, 2018; Weinstein, 2018; Wolff,
2018). Nonetheless, some have called Russian election hacking the
fulfillment of decades of cyber Pearl Harbor predictions (Carr, 2017;
Chang and Osborne, 2017; Graham, 2017; Spring, 2017). In these cases,
emphasis is placed on the element of surprise in the 2016 Russian cyber
operations, not necessarily the physical destruction, of which there was
none.

Existing scholarship, recent developments, and the debate that they have
sparked, raise a number of important questions. Where does the "cyber
Pearl Harbor" analogy come from? What is such a scenario supposed to
entail? How has the analogy evolved during its 25 years of use by cyber
security stakeholders? And, is it possible that use of this analogy can
have negative implications for cyber security policy-making? In the next
section, we detail the sources and methods that we have used to help
answer these questions.

The discursive construction of cyber Pearl Harbor: Sources and methods

For over 25 years, Americans have been warned that the United States
faces an imminent cyber Pearl Harbor, involving cyber attacks against
critical infrastructure leading to mass destruction and disruption,
followed by social and economic chaos. In a 1999 article, New York Times
reporter John Markoff provided perhaps the most concise definition,
noting that the "specter of simultaneous computer network attacks
against banking, transportation, commerce and utility targets --- as
well as against the military --- conjures up the fear of an electronic
Pearl Harbor in which the nation is paralyzed without a single bullet
ever being fired" (Markoff, 1999). Markoff's definition echoed the
doomsday scenario envisioned by computer security entrepreneur Winn
Schwartau who, in a 1991 op-ed for Computerworld, first used the analogy
(which was repeated in his testimony before the U.S. Congress that same
year). Schwartau described the impacts of such an event as "truly
crippling," "devastating," and "inflicting massive damage" on a scale
that would undermine "the continuation of well-ordered society \...
\[to\] function as we know it" (Schwartau, 1991).

Twenty years later, the metaphor was still strongly in circulation when
former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Congress, "I've often
said that there's a strong likelihood that the next Pearl Harbor that we
confront could \... be a cyber attack that cripples our power systems,
our grid, our security systems, our financial systems, our governmental
systems. This is a real possibility" (U.S. Senate Armed Services
Committee, 2011). The following year, Panetta doubled down, declaring
that a cyber Pearl Harbor "could be as destructive as the terrorist
attack of 9/11," "cause panic, destruction, and even the loss of life,"
"paralyze and shock the nation, and create a profound new sense of
vulnerability" (Panetta, 2012).

To unpack both the staying power and implications of the cyber Pearl
Harbor analogy over 25 years of cybersecurity discourse, this study
combines a rhetorical analysis of key texts that utilize the cyber Pearl
Harbor metaphor with a quantitative content analysis of U.S. newspaper
articles from 1991 (when the concept first emerged) until 2016 (when
Russian election tampering refocused national attention on
cybersecurity). Both forms of analysis rely on theoretical insights from
the critical constructivist tradition of scholarship in security studies
(Peoples and Vaughan-Williams, 2010; see also Bendrath, 2003, 2001;
Bendrath, et al., 2007; Dunn Cavelty, 2007; Eriksson, 2002; Hansen and
Nissenbaum, 2009; Lawson, 2012; Betz and Stevens, 2013).

First, we identified ten key texts that we examined through close
reading and rhetorical analysis (see Appendix C). These texts were
chosen because they were exemplary of the use of the cyber Pearl Harbor
analogy by critical stakeholders, including industry experts, government
officials, large media outlets, or others with the ability to shape and
influence U.S. cyber security discourse. The kinds of texts chosen
included op-eds, Congressional testimony, speeches, a documentary film,
and a declassified government document. Rhetorical analysis provides a
tool for explaining "the relationship of persons and ideas within a
situation" \[8\]. To arrive at these explanations, rhetoricians cast
their net broadly, asking how "written as well as spoken discourse,
nonverbal \[e.g., images\] as well as verbal symbols, movements as well
as individual events, and functions other than those implied by a narrow
conception of persuasion" and overtly persuasive texts provide a lens
through which to understand how ideas and their relationship to both
their producers and audiences are shaped and defined (Brockriede, 1974).
Rhetorical analysis' focus on textual features (metaphor, analogy, etc.)
and argumentative strategies provides a means to deconstruct these
texts, identifying how cyber Pearl Harbor comes to be defined and
operationalized in political debates over its importance. In this
regard, rhetorical analysis provides a technique for identifying an
"unfolding sequence of arguments, ideas, and figures which interact
through the text and gradually build a structure of meaning" \[9\]. For
example, rhetorical analysis helps identify how threat subjects,
referent objects, and focusing events that constitute cyber Pearl Harbor
are discursively constructed through these key texts. However, beyond
helping illuminate how these texts function to define cyber Pearl Harbor
as a real and viable threat, a rhetorically-driven close reading also
helps inform our analysis of 25 years of media discourse about cyber
Pearl Harbor because "the close reading of specific texts often provides
both data and methods for comprehending larger discursive formations"
\[10\].

Second, for our quantitative content analysis, we collected examples of
the cyber Pearl Harbor analogy in U.S. news media by searching the "U.S.
Newspapers" category in LexisNexis Academic Universe using the search
string "electronic pearl harbor" OR "digital pearl harbor" OR "cyber
pearl harbor." \[11\] This produced 214 results. After removal of
duplicates and irrelevant results (e.g., letters to the editor), the
final coded set included 203 articles. Content analysis complements a
rhetorical analysis focused on key texts that participated in and
constructed the cyber Pearl Harbor analogy in two ways. First, whereas
rhetorical analysis focuses on a small number of key texts to identify
the specific rhetorical strategies, content analysis provides a means to
identify and draw inferences about how those texts circulate in media
discourse and to broader audiences. Second, content analysis complements
the interpretive and qualitative conclusions of rhetorical analysis with
systematic and more objective accounts of how the cyber Pearl Harbor
analogy has evolved. While content analysis operates as a method across
a variety of disciplines and includes many variations, its essential
characteristic is that it offers a methodology for "a summarizing,
quantitative analysis of messages that relies on the scientific method,
including attention to objectivity, a priori design, reliability,
validity, generalizability, and replicability" \[12\].

When practicing content analysis, the dimensions of texts that are
quantified can be identified and defined inductively or deductively
\[13\]. In the case of the former, researchers derive variables to be
quantified by developing familiarity with a body of texts to the extent
that a set of exhaustive, mutually exclusive categories emerge.
Deductive variables, on the other hand, are derived from a theoretical
framework that informs the content analysis and which are relevant to
the texts under examination based on related scholarship \[14\]. For
example, in the present study, coding categories were informed by the
main concepts of securitization theory, including securitizing actor and
referent object, as well as the sentiment of the article and the
focusing events or conditions identified as reason for taking such a
threat seriously (see Appendix A). For each category, we collaboratively
coded random samples from our overall pool of articles until intercoder
reliability was established (see Appendix B). Once we achieved an
acceptable level of reliability, we divided and independently coded the
remainder of the articles. While this practice of quantification of the
content of texts can offer a variety of measurement possibilities, most
content analysis, like the present study, relies on frequency data to
support its inferences about texts, the circumstances of their
emergence, and the contexts and consequence of their circulation \[15\].

By combining these two methodological approaches, we are able to make
complementary claims about the development of the cyber Pearl Harbor
analogy within cyber security discourses. On the one hand, rhetorical
analysis offers a "close-up" view of specific exemplars, or key texts,
crafted by primary stakeholders in the evolution of cyber security
policy and political discourse. On the other hand, the "satellite view"
offered by content analysis of a broad swath of texts across a period of
time enables us to identify variations in the intensity of discussion of
cyber security via the cyber Pearl Harbor analogy, as well as who is
participating in that discourse, based on what concerns, and with what
aims (Hart, 1990; Hoffman and Waisanen, 2015). By working between these
two levels of abstraction and critical insight, our approach to the use
of the cyber Pearl Harbor analogy allows us to make inferences about how
these two sources of discourse on the subject influence one another, how
they are impacted by contextual factors, e.g., terror attacks, cyber
security breaches, etc., and how certain dimensions of the cyber Pearl
Harbor analogy are strategically given greater presence (or
marginalized) to shape cybersecurity outcomes.

The emergence and evolution of cyber Pearl Harbor

There has been confusion over the origins of the Pearl Harbor analogy in
U.S. cyber security discourse. In December 2015, former defense
official, John Hamre, claimed to have been the first person to use the
term publicly in his November 1997 testimony before the U.S. Congress.
He further claimed that General Tom Marsh had been "the author of that
phrase" as a result of having led the President's Commission on Critical
Infrastructure Protection, the final report from which was published in
1997 (Hamre, 2015). Others have claimed that president of the RSA
computer security company, D. James Bidzos, was the first to use the
term in 1991. However, as Tim Stevens notes, the weight of the available
evidence supports the contention that it was the computer security
entrepreneur, and novelist, Winn Schwartau, who first used the term
"electronic Pearl Harbor" in 1991 in an op-ed, Congressional testimony,
and a self-published novel \[16\].

[Regardless of its likely emergence in the early 1990s from computer
security industry experts, the Pearl Harbor analogy did not become
widespread until the mid to late 1990s when it was mentioned in a string
of Congressional testimonies by government officials, most notably
Director of the C.I.A. John Deutch in 1996 and Deputy Secretary of
Defense John Hamre in 1997 and 1998. A close reading of these early
sources of cyber Pearl Harbor from the 1990s demonstrates that the seeds
of the currently dominant use of that analogy and related themes emerged
very early in the discourse]{.underline}. However, it also reveals the
existence of subtle differences in early meanings of cyber Pearl Harbor,
which were in turn associated in some cases with differing views of how
one should respond to such a threat.

In June 1996, Senator Sam Nunn (D-GA) opened a hearing of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee on cyber threats by informing listeners
and participants that the proceeding would

"focus on the possibility that cyber-attacks on our national
infrastructure could be used as a part of a coordinated strategic attack
on the United States. How likely is such a scenario? Who has the
capacity to launch such an attack? How do we defend against such an
attack? Perhaps most important, would we even recognize the fact that
such an attack was being carried and be able to determine who was behind
the attack in a very timely manner?" (Deutch, 1996)

That is, the hearing would focus on the primary issues of concern for
the construction of any threat narrative, including the identification
of potential threat subjects and referent objects: Who might attack?
What might they target? The answer to the referent object question was
already assumed: "national infrastructure." But, just which
infrastructure would be targeted was less certain. What is more, Sen.
Nunn raised questions related to evidence and uncertainty, as well as
possible responses. How do we know, in the realm of cyber threats, where
the real concerns exist and, in the end, what do we do? Beyond the
hearing that day, all of the key texts that address the possibility of
cyber Pearl Harbor provide answers to most of these questions.

Where threat subjects are concerned, the key texts that we analyzed from
the 1990s and early 2000s were focused almost exclusively on non-state
actors. Of course, Schwartau's piece was titled "Fighting terminal
terrorism" and contemplated that "a motivated individual or
organization" could carry out "an electronic Pearl Harbor" (Schwartau,
1991). In his 1996 testimony, DCI Deutch and his questioner, Sen. Sam
Nunn, both worried about the possibility that not just states, but also
"sub-national groups" and "terrorist groups" could obtain the capability
to carry out cyber attacks against the United States' vulnerable
networks. DCI Deutch also mentioned the potential, but uncertain threat
from "individual criminal elements or individual hacker activities"
(Deutch, 1996). Finally, the 2003 PBS Frontline documentary, Cyber War!,
which included interviews with prominent cyber security experts, focused
entirely on non-state cyber threats, particularly the threat of from
terrorists (Kirk, 2003).

Though they continue to mention possible non-state attackers, we see an
increased concern with state actors over time in the later texts that we
analyzed. Gen. Alexander's 2012 memo about preventing a cyber Pearl
Harbor mentions non-state actors, but is primarily focused on "nation
states" (Alexander, 2012). Similarly, Secretary Panetta's 2012 speech
noted the threats from cyber criminals, but said "the even greater
danger facing us in cyberspace goes beyond crime and harassment. A cyber
attack perpetrated by nation states or violent extremist groups could be
as destructive as the terrorist attack of 9/11" (Panetta, 2012).
Finally, Hamre's December 2015 op-ed warned, "Hostile intelligence and
military establishments are prepared to wage war now, using cyber tools"
(Hamre, 2015).

[In both cases, however, specific actors are rarely
mentioned,]{.underline} with a few exceptions. In the non-state
category, al-Qa'ida is sometimes identified as a potential attacker in
the wake of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks (Kirk, 2003). Later,
when officials like Secretary Panetta begin to focus more on the threat
from state actors, we see occasional mentions of China, Russia, and Iran
as potential perpetrators of a cyber Pearl Harbor attack (Alexander,
2012; Panetta, 2012). [However, the texts we analyzed far more often
identified generic, unspecified state or non-state actors (or both) as
the would-be authors of a cyber Pearl Harbor (Schwartau, 1991; Deutch,
1996; Hamre, 1998, 1997; Panetta, 2011). In short, those officials and
experts raising the alarm about the threat of a cyber Pearl Harbor were
often unclear about exactly who might carry out such an
attack.]{.underline}

[Far from being a rhetorical weakness, this inability or unwillingness
to identify specific threat subjects may serve **to heighten fear** of a
possible cyber Pearl Harbor.]{.underline} One might expect that
inability or unwillingness to specify who is willing and able to carry
out such an attack would weaken the case that such a threat is indeed
real. [Instead, the so-called "attribution problem" (Lindsay, 2015; Rid
and Buchanan, 2014; Schulzke, 2018) --- the idea that one could be cyber
attacked without knowing who had carried out the attack --- emerged as a
consistent theme in the cyber Pearl Harbor discourse that only seemed to
heighten the fear. This possibility was first raised by Schwartau, who
cautioned that "such an attack can also be launched \... with little or
no ability to identify \... the perpetrators" and that "the source of
the attack is completely disguised" (Schwartau, 1991)]{.underline}. In
1996, the difficulty in determining the source of cyber attack was a
concern raised multiple times in Sen. Nunn's questioning of DCI Deutch
(Deutch, 1996). In his 1997 testimony, John Hamre noted, "Our knowledge
of the origin of such attacks, and their sponsorship, is likely to be
imprecise" (Hamre, 1997). The 2003 PBS documentary used the examples of
the Slammer, Code Red, and Nimda malware attacks as evidence of the
danger of the attribution problem (Kirk, 2003). By 2012, however,
Secretary Panetta was warning would-be cyber attackers that the U.S. had
"made significant investments in forensics to address this problem of
attribution, and we are seeing returns on those investments" (Panetta,
2012).

China as thief: cyber battles

[The construction of China as potential enemy Other takes on an
additional hue when we look at the depictions of China's cyber
activities---China moves from cheat to a more malicious cousin, the
thief.]{.underline} [The United States first focused on issues of "cyber
warfare]{.underline}" in the mid-2000s to late 2000s, but at the time,
the trope associated with China was not necessarily that of thief. In
the mass news media, a militaristic lens framed [much of the discussion,
depicting China as a rule breaker flouting international norms and thus
posing a security threat]{.underline}. For example, a Los Angeles Times
article highlighted that "China in the last year has developed ways to
infiltrate and manipulate computer networks around the world in what
U.S. defense officials conclude is a new and potentially dangerous
military capability, according to a Pentagon report" (Barnes, 2008).
China is even placed in relation to al-Qaeda: "Cyber-attacks and
cyber-espionage pose a greater potential danger to U.S. national
security than Al Qaeda and other militants that have dominated America's
global focus since Sept. 11, 2001, the nation's top intelligence
officials said Tuesday" (Dilanian, 2013). This juxtaposition with
al-Qaeda only served to heighten the military valence of China's cyber
activities, and a push to prepare for such a threat. Indeed, in the
words of Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL): "The threat, to be sure, is
real---and, we cannot allow ourselves to grow complacent ..." (Nelson
2008).

Snowden's revelations of US spying on China in June of 2013 drastically
changed the shape of the discussion however. Snowden demonstrated that
the NSA (1) had two data centers in China from which it had been
inserting spy software into vulnerable computers; (2) targeted the
Chinese University of Hong Kong, public officials, businesses, and
students; (3) hacked mobile phones; and (4) in 2009, hacked the Pacnet
headquarters in Hong Kong, which runs one of the biggest regional
fibre-optic networks. In response to Snowden's revelations, a spate of
articles compared the United States' and China's hacking, displaying a
range of attitudes from journalists---some espoused that both countries
demonstrate equivalent transgressive behavior, while others argued that
China has crossed the line into more aggressive hacking that goes beyond
the United States' more benign "preemptive" hacking.

[The latter attitude indicates the resilience of tropes of the Yellow
and Red Perils, a China whose inherent ideological and cultural
differences with the West makes it a threat. The different lenses
through which journalists and pundits viewed China's spying in
comparison with that of the United States further invoke this
**Orientalist demarcation.**]{.underline} An article in The Washington
Post thus contrasts China's behavior against that of the United States,
which merely seeks "to examine huge amounts of communication metadata
around the world to look for trends" and "to preempt some threat against
the U.S." China's spying is described, however, as "infiltrating almost
every powerful institution in Washington, D.C.," "breaking into major
news organizations," "stealing sensitive military technology," and
"stealing so much intellectual property that China's hacking has been
called the 'greatest transfer of wealth in history'" (Fisher, 2013).
[Drawing in particular on **incendiary words like "stealing" and
"infiltrating,"** this article **distinguishes China as a sneaky
thief.**]{.underline}

[US journalists and pundits, in charging China with stealing economic
resources, have further solidified the demarcation of China as an
inferior and **dangerous Other.**]{.underline} A well-circulated quote
by national security pundit Adam Segal stated, "The problem is we're not
talking about the same things ... We're trying to make a distinction
between cyber economic espionage and normal political-military
espionage. The Chinese don't make that same distinction" (Bengali &
Dilanian, 2015). By [portraying China as unable to grasp the fundamental
distinction between economics and national security, Segal suggests
China's thievery is connected to a more fundamental character
flaw---China is unable to grasp proper civilized norms.]{.underline}
Similarly, US official response has been that China's view of data
collection as a sovereign right has rendered them essentially different
from the United States and by implication, the civilized world. That
Chinese governmental espionage involves the collection of economic
intelligence that is shared with Chinese companies further departs from
civilized norms. Michael Rogers, Director of the National Security
Agency thus explained that "they clearly don't have the same lines in
the sand, if you will, with that regard" (Bennett, 2015).

Historically, US depictions of China as uncivilized have occurred
whenever China has gained power or threatened US interests. The
narrative of China as a sort of child following in the United States'
footsteps on the path to modernity has proven exceedingly popular since
World War II and frames the US approach to China as a potential ally and
resource who at the same time may never be civilizable (Kim, 2010;
Vukovich, 2012). In this Orientalist narrative, China's journey to
modernity is always understood as precarious and, moreover, subject to
US vigilance as to whether it meets the appropriate benchmarks. The
title of an editorial in The Washington Post epitomizes current
iterations of this sentiment and the ease with which Orientalist imagery
can be invoked to portray China's path to modernity as needing US
guidance when China falls out of line: "The US Needs to Tame the
Cyber-Dragon: Stronger Measures are Need\[ed\] to Block China's Economic
Espionage \[emphasis mine\]" ("The U.S. Needs to Tame," 2013). In
reality, US vigilance can be attributed to the concern since the end of
the Cold War, that a "sleeping giant" able to challenge US global
hegemony is awakening (Kim, 2010).

Thus, the cultural work done by portrayals of China as unable to adhere
to civilized norms serve to bolster the image of China as perpetually
unprepared to be a responsible member of the international community.
[In fact, this narrative of China's thievery serves to persuade the
American public that China is a threat to the international
community.]{.underline} One Wall Street Journal journalist perfectly
echoes this sentiment:

#### "Cybersecurity" is impossible to achieve\-\--market capitalist logic relentlessly infiltrates problem solving to justify continuous biased, Westernized policies

[Cybersecurity the way we like to think of it is actually impossible to
achieve.]{.underline} That's not to say we shouldn't try hard to achieve
it. Nor is it the same thing as saying that our costly efforts to date
have been wasted. Instead, if our aim is to make our interactions in
cyberspace more secure, we need to recognize two things.

[First, part of our troubles has to do with a culture that defines
things like success, victory, and security as dichotomous rather than
continuous variables. Think of a switch that's either on or off. Second,
speed is hurting us, and calls to replace humans with much faster and
"objective" machines will continue to gain momentum, putting us at
extreme risk without increasing either our security or
prosperity]{.underline}. Let me explain.

\[Cyber\]security is Not a Switch

In my time in Norway a few years ago, I had the great fortune to be
hosted by the Norwegian Institute for Defense. As I toiled to recover
the history of Norway's experience under occupation by the Third Reich,
I was able most days to join my Norwegian colleagues for a communal
lunch. My colleagues did me the great courtesy of carrying on most
conversations in flawless English. As an American academic accustomed to
research abroad, I anticipated that sooner or later I'd encounter a
classic opening sentence of the form, "You know, the trouble with you
Americans is..." And after a month or so my unfailingly polite and
generous colleagues obliged. But what ended that sentence has stuck with
me since then; and underlines a core value of study abroad at the same
time: "You know, the trouble with you Americans is, you think every
policy problem has a solution; whereas we Europeans understand that some
problems you just have to learn to live with."

The idea that part of our mission was research intended to support
policies that solved problems was never something I'd thought of as
varying by culture. But as I reflected more and more on the idea, I
realized that [insecurity---and by extension cyber-insecurity---would be
something we Americans would have to learn to live with.]{.underline}

[This "switch" problem is mainly due to the **relentless infiltration of
market capitalist logic into problem framing and solving**]{.underline}.
For example, [corporations hire cybersecurity consultants to ensure that
corporate profit-making operations are secure]{.underline} from hacking,
theft, disruption, and so on. [When corporations pay money to someone to
solve a problem, they expect a "deliverable": some empirical evidence
that corporate operations are now "secure." It should go without saying
that this same corporate logic infiltration---the largely North American
idea that governance would be more "effective" if **run via corporate
profit-making logic**---has seriously **degraded effective governance**
as well.]{.underline}

Cybersecurity is not a switch. It isn't something that's either "on" or
"off," but something that we can approach if we have a sound strategy.
And progress toward our shared ideal itself is what we should be
counting as success.

Even if we could agree to moderate our cultural insistence on measuring
success or failure in terms of decisively "solving" policy problems,
we'd be left with another set of problems caused mainly by the assertion
that humans are too slow and emotional as compared to computers, which
are imagined as fast (absolutely) and objective (absolutely not). We
need to challenge these ideas, because together they make up a kind of
binary weapon which leads us into very dangerous territory while at the
same time doing little to advance us toward our ideal of "cybersecurity
in our time."

So, a first critical question is, under what conditions is speed a
necessary advantage? That's where computers come in. Few Americans will
be aware, for example, that the first-ever presidential directive on
cybersecurity---NSDD-145 (1984)---was issued by President Ronald Reagan
in reaction to his viewing of John Badham's WarGames (1983). After
viewing the film, which imagines a nascent artificial intelligence
called the WOPR hijacking U.S. nuclear missile defense and threatening
to start a global thermonuclear war, Reagan asked his national security
team whether the events in the film could happen in real life. When his
question was later answered in the affirmative, the Reagan
administration issued the NSDD. Here's a key bit of dialogue from
Badham's film, which starts after a simulated nuclear attack resulted in
22 percent of Air Force officers refusing to launch their missiles when
commanded to do so:

Mr. McKittrick: I think we ought to take the men out of the loop.

GEN Berringer: Mr. McKittrick, you're out of line sir!

McKittrick: Why am I out of line?

Cabot: Wait. Excuse me. What are you talking about? I\'m sorry. What do
you mean, take them 'out of the loop'?

GEN Berringer: Gentlemen, we\'ve had men in these silos since before any
of you were watching Howdy Doody. For myself, I sleep pretty well at
night knowing those boys are down there.

McKittrick: General, we all know they\'re fine men. But in a nuclear
war, we can\'t afford to have our missiles lying dormant in those silos
because those men refuse to turn the keys when the computers tell 'em
to!

Watson: You mean, when the president orders them to.

McKittrick: The president will probably follow the computer war plan.
Now that's a fact!

Watson: Well, I imagine the joint chiefs will have some input?

GEN Berringer: You're damned tootin'!

Cabot: Well hell, if the Soviets launch a surprise attack there\'s no
time...

Healy: Twenty-three minutes from warning to impact. Six minutes, if it's
sub-launched.

McKittrick: Six minutes! Six minutes. That\'s barely enough time for the
president to make a decision. Now once he makes that decision, the
computers should take over.

This discussion brackets two critical components of any discussion of
contemporary cybersecurity. The first is the "humans are too slow"
theme, and by slow, we mean slow as compared to computers. Second,
humans have consciousness and morals and computers don't. Computers have
some version of whatever their programmers give them. Recent advances in
deep learning and artificial neural networks---in particular foundation
models---have created the impression that machine consciousness and
independent creativity are here or very near, but they are not; and
moreover---and this is key---whatever these machines come up with will
always be tethered to their programmers which, to be blunt, remain
mostly young, upper-middle-class males from the northern hemisphere.

This impossibility of algorithmic objectivity is the second half of the
"binary weapon" I referenced earlier: along with speed, algorithms,
code, and the like promise to be objective---but they cannot be. So as
mathematician Cathy McNeill or computer scientist (and activist) Joy
Buolamwini remind us, when you get turned down for a loan or a job and
an algorithm is involved, it remains almost certain that far from being
"objective" in the sense we usually mean, some unintended but profitable
bias has very likely been introduced. Ask an AI to show you a photo of
an "attractive person," for example, and what the "objective" algorithm
is likely to supply is the image of a thin blond woman with large
breasts. Imagine deploying biased algorithms in military or
cybersecurity applications, but then also imagine that your reservations
about bias cause you to hesitate. You'd be terrified that an economic or
security rival less principled or cautious than you would deploy and
gain a terminal advantage over you. It's straight out of philosopher
Carl von Clausewitz's discussion of the limitations of restraint in war:

As the use of physical power to the utmost extent by no means excludes
the cooperation of the intelligence, it follows that he who uses force
unsparingly, without reference to the bloodshed involved, must obtain a
superiority if his adversary uses less vigor in its application. The
former then dictates the law to the latter, and both proceed to
extremities to which the only limitations are those imposed by the
amount of counteracting force on each side.

[Having weaponized cyberspace, and corporate strategy having
appropriated military metaphors, the message is clear: restraint makes
you a sucker. In terms of policy, this leaves us with a **classic
dilemma**: we get gored either way. If we don't deploy AI and our
competitors do, we may lose everything. But if we do deploy AI, not
fully understanding how it arrives at its conclusions but having
unreasonable faith that "it must be right, because it's math; it's
objective," we may lose everything as well.]{.underline}

So, the WarGames scene should also remind us that the particular domain
in which speed is being claimed as a necessary virtue is armed conflict.
Note that Watson's objection to the idea that "computers are in charge"
implies there should be checks and balances between decision and action;
an anagram of democracy itself, with its emphasis on deliberation and
consensus. But Cabot counters by asserting, reasonably, that in war,
checks and balances are a liability: "there's no time" (contemporary
hypersonic missile technology compresses time still further).

[In the United States, the idea that **we're always at war**---and its
destructive impact on democracy worldwide---emerged from the impact of a
shattering moment in U.S. history: 9/11.]{.underline} Since then, we've
never had the feeling we can "go back" to making washing machines and
babies as we did after World War II. [**We are permanently mobilized,
always on alert, always at war.** And in war, speed above all else seems
to make sense (think Blitzkrieg). Being "always at war" also biases
politics in favor of the world's political Right, with its claim that
checks and balances, deliberation, and popular sovereignty put citizens
of democracies at too much risk. What's needed, then, is an unfettered
executive who can act fast.]{.underline}

Of course, we are not at war and, as a result, speed at any cost is just
as likely to lead to disaster as it did in the summer of 1914, when all
the major combatants believed whoever struck first was assured of
victory, while waiting to be attacked made you a sucker.

Cybersecurity suffers from all the same associations. [Once we insist
that cyberspace is an arena of conflict, speed at any cost seems a
necessity]{.underline}. Automating computer network defense is no longer
thought of as a policy choice but is reduced to a question of how and
when. I should add that if computer network defense can be automated, so
can computer network offense, including espionage, crime, and systems
compromise.

In sum, [the cybersecurity we aspire to is impossible]{.underline}.
[Cybersecurity is not a switch, and automating our defenses---computer
network defense, national defense---is as **likely to destroy us as save
us**.]{.underline} We live in a world now, by choice, in which "sticks
and stones can break our bones, but words can also hurt us." As the mass
shooting at Uvalde Texas and so many others have highlighted, in this
new world there is no armor, no fortress walls, no police or army that
can protect us. Along with increasingly extreme weather events, we will
have to learn to live with cyber intrusions ranging from election
interference, disinformation, cybercrime, and threats to our critical
infrastructure. We will have to learn to be more self-sufficient and
resilient.

Reinterpreting cyberconflict -- path dependency, securitisation and the
national cybersecurity state

If the societal security approach is an effective theoretical tool to
understand recent cyber events, and a potentially more salient policy
framework, then how is it that national and military security-based
approaches to cybersecurity have become so dominant in the previous two
decades? In answering that question, this section analyses several
events that led to the emergence and subsequent consolidation of
national cybersecurity states and undermined the emergence of a more
decentralised, societal approach based on identity conflicts and
socio-psychological factors. This is not an extensive history of
post-Cold War cyberconflict. Nevertheless, these cases provide snapshots
of the process by which [cybersecurity was 'securitised' by many
governments in the West and national security agencies obtained
considerable power in this emergent domain]{.underline}. [Cyberattacks
were framed in the discourse of political leaders during this period as
an existential threat to nations that would cause major disruptions to
national economies and be catalysts for conflict between the great
powers. Growing concerns over internet failure and instability and
attacks against critical infrastructure were instrumental in creating
fear and paranoia, but also served the political and commercial purposes
of securitising actors and hindered the emergence of societal
approaches.]{.underline} Later in the period, owing partly to the
growing influence of social media platforms, the societal effects of
disinformation were layered into anxiety-saturated cyber policy.
Importantly, these cases also created path-dependencies in which the
relationship between government and the societal sector worsened and
through which military agencies and structures have taken actions that
have intensified societal and cybersecurity dilemmas.

'Millennium madness' -- Kosovo and the Y2K bug

The conflict in Kosovo in 1999 was one of the first major conflicts in
which cyberattacks were used by warring parties for strategic advantage.
In March that year, NATO, while conducting strategic air strikes on the
forces of Milosevic, sustained cyberattacks from Serbian hackers
targeted at its headquarters and digital infrastructure. In response to
the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Chinese hackers also
conducted cyberattacks against the White House website, the US
departments of energy and the interior and the national parks service,
including replacing website content with images and text expressing fury
over the bombing. The US military's response exhibited elements of
restraint, but Pentagon commanders considered a variety of electronic
measures to respond to Serbian hackers and enhance their own operational
and political effectiveness through electronic means. This included
hacking into Serbian banks to cause economic problems for the regime,
trying to isolate Slobodan Milosevic electronically to harm the
continuity and centrality of command, and targeting his own personal
wealth to bring him to the negotiating table (Borger 1999). The
Pentagon's restraint at this time was largely due to legal concerns over
whether the use of cyberweapons would constitute war crimes, whether
they would be strategically successful, whether they would accelerate
the development of offensive cyber tools by foreign power (the security
dilemma), and whether the tools used could be reverse engineered or at
least reveal US military cyber capabilities and methods (Borger 1999).

[The hacks created strong incentives to nationalise and militarise
cybersecurity and demonstrated to the US and NATO militaries the
seriousness of the cyberthreat they faced. However, the social and
psychological elements of the conflict are
underappreciated]{.underline}. Kosovo was a typical identity-based
conflict, where warring parties were from ethnically aligned, culturally
adversarial societal groups. The activities were conducted by non-state
hackers, including Serbian and Chinese nationalists, and targeted not
only military organisations but the societal sector (parks and energy,
for example), illustrating the need for (and lack of) attention to
societal cyber vulnerabilities, the spillover effects of military
conflicts into the societal sector, and the inability of the US military
to respond to hacks and provide assistance to organisations that became
entangled in the conflict's electronic dynamics. The hackers involved in
hacktivism during the conflict, moreover, were part of global social
networks that included traditional anti-war sentiment and groups. It is
illustrative of our argument that when NATO intervened in Libya in 2011,
12 years after the war in Kosovo, Serbian hackers conducted similar
anti-NATO hacks. In this case, online communities opposed to and
influenced by NATO interventions transcended spatial and temporal
boundaries. This was not, however, a lesson prominent in those derived
from this and subsequent conflicts. The Kosovo cyberattacks also
demonstrated the importance of the informational elements of
contemporary conflict and the war of narratives that influences public
opinion during conflict situations. The aim of the hackers and the
effect of the hacks were to deny and prevent the NATO public affairs
website from communicating its narrative around the conflict (the public
affairs website was inoperable for several days). In this respect, the
tactical and operation effects of the hacking operation, including
increasing NATO manpower requirements, slowing operating tempo and
enlarging the potential for human error in the air strike operations
(Department of Defense 2000) were combined with social and psychological
effects targeting perceptions of the conflict among identity groups.
Ultimately, none of them caused major damage to the alliance or the US
and the impact of these hacks should not be overestimated. [In this
respect, the acceleration of military capabilities and doctrine that
occurred after and because of the conflict may have been
**disproportionate to the actual threat**, which is a common feature of
the process of securitisation.]{.underline}

Similar societal and psychosocial dynamics were in evidence as the
global community, and particularly the financial sector, faced the
prospect of an 'electronic meltdown' caused by the Millennium (Y2K) Bug
at the turn of the century. The bug caused widespread fear about the
integrity of the global internet and hundreds of billions of dollars
were spent by governments around the world to prepare for, and mitigate,
potential effects (Jowitt 2017). The bug was a relatively simple glitch
in electronic systems caused by the transition from the four-digit date
1999--2000, but nevertheless, caused widespread alarm. In October 1998,
President Bill Clinton signed the Year 2000 Information and Readiness
Disclosure Act, which was an attempt to encourage private sector (and
societal sector) actors to share information about Y2K-related
vulnerabilities by offering them limited indemnity against losses or
lawsuits resulting from the potential disruption. These attempts to
involve the societal sector were not helped, however, by a wider context
of securitisation. An issue of Time Magazine was indicative of both the
global hysteria and the securitising discourse, raising the prospect of
Y2K causing 'The end of the world!?!', citing 'Y2K insanity!',
'Apocalypse Now!', asking 'Will computers melt down? Will society?',
providing what it called 'A Guide to Millennium Madness' and citing
fears of airlines and banking systems going haywire (Ghishal 2017).

[These concerns spilled over into the defence sector, with John Hamre,
the US Deputy Secretary of Defense from 1997 to March 2000, contributing
to the securitising discourse by arguing that 'the Y2K problem is the
electronic equivalent of the El Niño and there will be nasty surprises
around the globe' (Jowitt 2017). References by cyber policymakers to
extreme weather events, Armageddon, apocalypse, natural disasters,
pandemics, biological agents and previous wartime scenarios were
commonplace in the early 2000s and such analogies served to structure
thinking and as rhetorical tools to add urgency to the securitising
process]{.underline} (Betz and Stevens 2013). This rhetoric was
accompanied by several more practical measures which set a precedent for
military responses to cyber-related incidents. In the UK, for example,
armed forces were put on standby to assist in maintaining vital public
services in the event of an internet meltdown, including providing
disaster relief in the event of hospitals, water supplies and roads and
traffic systems being affected (Waugh 1998). In the US, officials noted
the possibility of military responses to Y2 K problems and addressed
concerns about effects of the bug on nuclear missile operations
(Gershwin 1999). This contributed to a broader process where militaries
were searching for new roles in the absence of the Soviet threat and
were increasingly planning for involvement in civil crises and
emergencies across security sectors. In this way, trends in
cybersecurity advanced in parallel with broader securitisation patterns,
including in areas such as pandemic response, terrorism and migration.

While the Y2K bug eventually turned out to be a 'damp squib', [the fear
and uncertainty it generated fed into a new era of **collective
paranoia** which further **accelerated the securitisation** of the
internet and its functions]{.underline}. This included the construction
of a perception that the internet lacked resilience and underpinned
society in a way that was inherently vulnerable and prone to
disintegration (Best 2003). This ran counter to the idea of the internet
as a democratising technology, facilitating harmonious relations and
technological and societal progress, and exposed 'the fundamental
unknowability both of computer technology and of the ultimate value of
that technology, its networking capacity, and its generation of
information' (Best 2003). As Kasvio (2000) argues, 'Even if the
transition to the new Millennium did not cause any major collapses of
the existing computer systems, the whole process of preparatory measures
showed clearly how strongly the vital functions of modern societies
depend on the orderly functioning of extremely complicated systems which
nobody fully understands'. The Y2K problem also demonstrated a tendency,
which was to become a central feature of cybersecurity debates in the
2000s, to overestimate the risks posed by new technologies, and create
disproportionate, centralised and bureaucratic responses. In the words
of Quiggin (2005), the Y2K bug created a moral panic in which there was
a 'systematic tendency, arising from the nature of the mass media and
political processes, to overstate some kinds of threats, particularly
those involving new and unfamiliar dangers.' This was compounded by a
media that tended to exaggerate the risk, sensationalise stories and not
cover government efforts to mitigate risks involved, burdensome as those
efforts were (Quigley 2004, 823).

In line with the argument in this article, the Y2K bug also had broader
socio-psychological effects and demonstrated the need for governments to
manage these (although little was done in the aftermath of any of these
events to reconcile these dynamics). These effects are addressed by
Kevin Quigley (2004, 825), who argues:

[IT ranks high in the 'dread factor' in psychometric terms; it has the
power to unleash considerable anxiety]{.underline}. The more government
depends on IT to deliver its service, the more vulnerable it is to a
public that oscillates from hyper-reaction to hyper-reaction. Indeed,
while IT commentators, both professional and amateur, offer IT as the
universal solution to social and organizational problems, Y2 K
demonstrates that the 'panacea' can quickly deteriorate to a paradoxical
'organized pandemonium', as in the case of Y2 K. Hence, the government
must be sensitive to this potential and must adopt effective
communications with key partners, be they suppliers, private industry,
the media or civil society at large, to reassure these partners that
they are managing IT effectively.

The effectiveness of communication between the government and private
sector was not helped during this period by governments' own
securitisation of the incident.

9/11 And weapons of mass disruption

The fears generated by the Y2K problem did not subside after the
millennium passed but were compounded and intensified in processes that
resulted from the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, DC.
[The attacks presented a seminal moment in the development of fears
around cyberterrorism, especially as enhanced border and aviation
security created incentives for non-state actors to try to strike the US
remotely through digital networks and digital
infrastructure.]{.underline} In the aftermath of the attacks, various
measures were taken by the US government to protect the US 'homeland',
and these extended into cyberspace. Concrete examples of enhanced
digital security measures included the Patriot Act, which allowed the US
government unprecedented powers to access electronic communications, and
the now widely-covered activities of the US National Security Agency,
including the Prism programme, which enabled the agency to identify and
target illegal and extremist activity online through 'mass
surveillance'. The war on terror served to further nationalise security
in the US, created powerful new bureaucracies, including the Department
for Homeland Security, which was given strong statutory authority to
respond to cyberthreats. The empowerment of the intelligence community
was also a feature of the post 9/11 environment and a variety of
agencies took on a role in online operations against terrorists and
rogue states. [This powerful national cybersecurity state was not best
aligned to match the challenge of globally connected systems of
computers and the debates that emerged within the national security
community over deterrence and pre-emption returned to Cold War concepts.
There was a tendency,]{.underline} for example[, to equate weapons of
mass disruption (cyberweapons) with weapons of mass destruction and a
close association emerged between digital threats and physical -- and
even nuclear -- threats to American and its allies in the aftermath of
9/11. Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's warning of a '**cyber
pearl harbour'** (Bumiller and Shanker 2012) is]{.underline} perhaps
[the most famous]{.underline} and widely cited [example]{.underline},
but there were many others[. These warnings appear to have been
unrealistic and fears around terrorism and the capability of non-state
actors to mount large scale and sophisticated cyberattacks have largely
proved **unfounded.**]{.underline}

[The most fundamental problem here was a failure to identify that
'cyberterrorism' -- cyberattacks causing equivalent effects to
conventional terrorist attacks -- was not such a serious threat as
feared and constructed by national security agencies. In this sense,
cyberterrorism was based on fears that were **not accurately assessed**
and which fuelled securitisation processes.]{.underline} A secondary
problem was the widespread conflation between cyberterrorism (a very
limited problem by any measure) and terrorist use of the internet (a
more serious and pervasive issue). The 'cyber 9/11' scenario failed to
materialise for various reasons, including the fact that cyberattacks do
not create the powerful visual effects that more conventional acts of
terrorism do; that the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks does not
allow terrorist groups to derive the propaganda benefit of being held
clearly responsible for such attacks; and the lack of scientific and
technical expertise to pull off more than just nuisance type acts of
cybervandalism. [Despite these now seemingly obvious dynamics, the term
cyberterrorism entered the national security discourse and often went
unchallenged. As Sean Lawson (2013, 86) has argued, '**cyber-doom
scenarios are the latest manifestation of fears about
'technology-out-of-control' in Western societies**,' and are
'**unrealistic' and 'encourage the adoption of counterproductive, even
dangerous policies.**' In this context it is worth noting that, in some
cases, states have taken military actions against hackers associated
with terrorist groups, including the targeted killing by US forces of an
ISIS hacker in 2016 and the more recent Israeli military attack against
a Hamas cyber facility. These kinetic responses do not appear to have
been based on the likelihood of physical damage being caused by cyber
operations, but in response to hack and leak operations in the US case
(the ISIS hacker has released hacked details of US military personnel),
and a Hamas cyber operation which had already been fended off by Israeli
cyber defences (Newman 2019). In this respect, and in line with the
arguments of this article, terrorism presents an arguably greater
societal threat than it does to the military, stems from identity
divides that terrorist groups prey on and exploit and has led to
**over-militarised responses which have fed existing identity-based
conflicts.**]{.underline}

the current 900.\" The Post describes this expansion as \"part of an
effort to turn an organization that has focused largely on defensive
measures into the equivalent of an Internet-era fighting force.\" This
Cyber Command Unit operates under the command of Gen. Keith Alexander,
who also happens to be the head of the National Security Agency, the
highly secretive government network that spies on the communications of
foreign nationals - and American citizens.

[[The Pentagon\'s rhetorical justification]{.mark} for this expansion
[is]{.mark} **deeply [misleading]{.mark}**. Beyond that, [these
activities pose]{.mark} a wide array of **serious [threats]{.mark}** [to
internet **freedom**]{.mark}**, privacy[, and international
law]{.mark}** that, as usual, will be conducted with full-scale secrecy
and with little to **no oversight and accountability**]{.underline}.
And, as always, there is a small army of private-sector corporations who
will benefit most from this expansion.

Disguising aggression as \"defense\"

Let\'s begin with the way [[this]{.mark} so-called \"[cyber-security\"
expansion]{.mark} has been marketed]{.underline}. [It is part of a
sustained campaign which, quite typically, [relies on **blatant
fear-mongering**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

In March, 2010, the Washington Post published an amazing Op-Ed by Adm.
Michael McConnell, Bush\'s former Director of National Intelligence and
a past and current executive with Booz Allen, a firm representing
numerous corporate contractors which profit enormously each time the
government expands its \"cyber-security\" activities. McConnell\'s
career over the last two decades - both at Booz, Allen and inside the
government - has been devoted to accelerating the merger between the
government and private sector in all intelligence, surveillance and
national security matters (it was he who led the successful campaign to
retroactively immunize the telecom giants for their participation in the
illegal NSA domestic spying program). Privatizing government
cyber-spying and cyber-warfare is his primary focus now.

[[McConnell\'s Op-Ed was as **alarmist**]{.mark} **and hysterical** [as
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Claiming that \"the United States is
fighting a cyber-war today, and we are losing\", it [warned that \"chaos
would result]{.mark}\" from an enemy cyber-attack on US financial
systems and that \"our power grids, air and ground transportation,
telecommunications, and water-filtration systems are in jeopardy as
well.\"]{.underline} Based on these threats, [McConnell advocated that
\"[we\" - meaning \"the **government** and the **private
sector**]{.mark}]{.underline}\" - \"need to develop an early-warning
system to monitor cyberspace\" and that \"we need to reengineer the
Internet to make attribution, geolocation, intelligence analysis and
impact assessment - who did it, from where, why and what was the
result - more manageable.\" As Wired\'s Ryan Singel wrote: \"He\'s
talking about changing the internet to make everything anyone does on
the net traceable and geo-located so the National Security Agency can
pinpoint users and their computers for retaliation.\"

The same week the Post published McConnell\'s extraordinary Op-Ed, [[the
Obama]{.underline} [White House issued its]{.underline}]{.mark} [own
[**fear-mongering decree** on cyber-threats]{.mark}]{.underline},
[depicting the US as a vulnerable victim to
cyber-aggression.]{.underline} It began with this sentence: \"President
Obama has identified cybersecurity as one of the most serious economic
and national security challenges we face as a nation, but one that we as
a government or as a country are not adequately prepared to counter.\"
It announced that \"the Executive Branch was directed to work closely
with all key players in US cybersecurity, including state and local
governments and the private sector\" and to \"strengthen public/private
partnerships\", and specifically announced Obama\'s intent to \"to
implement the recommendations of the Cyberspace Policy Review built on
the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) launched by
President George W. Bush.\"

Since then, [the fear-mongering [rhetoric]{.mark} from government
officials [has]{.mark} **relentlessly [intensified]{.mark}**, [all
devoted to scaring citizens]{.mark} [into]{.mark} believing that [the US
is at]{.mark} serious [risk **of cataclysmic cyber-attacks**]{.mark}
from \"aggressors\". This all culminated when Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta, last October, warned of what he called a \"cyber-Pearl
Harbor\"]{.underline}. This \"would cause physical destruction and the
loss of life, an attack that would paralyze and shock the nation and
create a profound new sense of vulnerability.\" Identifying China, Iran,
and terrorist groups, he outlined a parade of horribles scarier than
anything since Condoleezza Rice\'s 2002 Iraqi \"mushroom cloud\":

\"An aggressor nation or extremist group could use these kinds of cyber
tools to gain control of critical switches. They could derail passenger
trains, or even more dangerous, derail passenger trains loaded with
lethal chemicals. They could contaminate the water supply in major
cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.\"

As usual, though, [[reality is **exactly the
opposite**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This massive new expenditure of money
is not primarily devoted to defending against
cyber-aggressors]{.underline}. [[The US itself is the world\'s **leading
cyber-aggressor**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A major purpose of this
expansion is to strengthen the US\'s ability to destroy other nations
with cyber-attacks. Indeed, even the Post report notes that a major
component of this new expansion is to \"conduct offensive computer
operations against foreign adversaries\".

[**[It is the US]{.mark}** - not Iran, Russia or \"terror\" groups -
which already is [the first nation]{.mark} (in partnership with Israel)
[to **aggressively deploy** a]{.mark} highly sophisticated and extremely
dangerous [cyber-attack]{.mark}.]{.underline} Last June, the New York
Times\' David Sanger reported what most of the world had already
suspected: \"From his first months in office, [President [Obama secretly
ordered]{.mark} [increasingly sophisticated attacks]{.mark} on the
computer systems that run Iran\'s main nuclear enrichment facilities,
**significantly [expanding]{.mark}** America\'s first [sustained use of
cyberweapons]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" In fact, Obama \"decided to
accelerate the attacks . . . even after an element of the program
accidentally became public in the summer of 2010 because of a
programming error that allowed it to escape Iran\'s Natanz plant and
sent it around the world on the Internet.\" According to the Sanger\'s
report, Obama himself understood the significance of the US decision to
be the first to use serious and aggressive cyber-warfare:

\"Mr. Obama, according to participants in the many Situation Room
meetings on Olympic Games, was acutely aware that with every attack he
was pushing the United States into new territory, much as his
predecessors had with the first use of atomic weapons in the 1940s, of
intercontinental missiles in the 1950s and of drones in the past decade.
He repeatedly expressed concerns that any American acknowledgment that
it was using cyberweapons - even under the most careful and limited
circumstances - could enable other countries, terrorists or hackers to
justify their own attacks.\"

[[The US isn\'t the]{.mark} vulnerable [victim]{.mark} of cyber-attacks.
[It\'s the **leading perpetrator**]{.mark} of those
attacks]{.underline}. As Columbia Professor and cyber expert Misha
Glenny wrote in the NYT last June: [[Obama\'s cyber-attack]{.mark} on
Iran \"[marked a significant]{.mark} and dangerous [turning point
in]{.mark} the **[gradual militarization]{.mark} of the
Internet**]{.underline}.\"

Indeed, exactly as Obama knew would happen, revelations that it was the
US which became the first country to use cyber-warfare against a
sovereign country - just as it was the first to use the atomic bomb and
then drones - would make it impossible for it to claim with any
credibility (except among its own media and foreign policy community)
that it was in a defensive posture when it came to cyber-warfare. As
Professor Glenny wrote: \"by introducing such pernicious viruses as
Stuxnet and Flame, America has severely undermined its moral and
political credibility.\" That\'s why, as the Post reported yesterday,
[the DOJ is engaged in such a frantic and **invasive effort** to root
out Sanger\'s source: because **it reveals the obvious** truth that the
US is the leading aggressor in the world when it comes to
cyber-weapons.]{.underline}

This significant expansion under the [Orwellian rubric of
\"cyber-security\" is thus a perfect microcosm of US military spending
generally.]{.underline} [[It\'s all justified]{.mark} under [by the
claim that the US]{.mark} [must defend itself from threats]{.mark} from
Bad, Aggressive Actors, [when the reality is the exact opposite:]{.mark}
the new program is devoted to ensuring that the US remains **the primary
offensive threat** to the rest of the world]{.underline}. It\'s the same
way the US develops offensive biological weapons under the guise of
developing defenses against such weapons (such as the 2001 anthrax that
the US government itself says came from a US Army lab). It\'s how the US
government generally convinces its citizens that it is a peaceful victim
of aggression by others when the reality is that the US builds more
weapons, sells more arms and bombs more countries than virtually the
rest of the world combined.

Threats to privacy and internet freedom

Beyond the aggressive threat to other nations posed by the Pentagon\'s
\"cyber-security\" programs, [[there is]{.mark} the [profound threat to
**privacy**]{.mark}**, internet freedom**, [and the ability to
communicate freely]{.mark} [for]{.mark} US citizens and [foreign
nationals]{.mark} alike]{.underline}. [[The US government has]{.mark}
long [viewed these]{.mark} \"cyber-security\" [programs as]{.mark} a
[means of **monitoring and controlling the internet**]{.mark} and
disseminating propaganda.]{.underline} The fact that this is all being
done under the auspices of the NSA and the Pentagon means, by
definition, that there will be no transparency and no meaningful
oversight.

Back in 2003, [[the Rumsfeld Pentagon prepared a]{.mark} secret
[report]{.mark} entitled \"Information Operations (IO)
Roadmap]{.underline}\", which laid the foundation for this new
cyber-warfare expansion. The Pentagon\'s self-described objective was
\"transforming IO into a core military competency on par with air,
ground, maritime and special operations\". [In other words, [its key
objective was to ensure **military control** over internet]{.mark}-based
communications:]{.underline}

[**Weapons technologies and methods**]{.mark} for using them [drive
tactics]{.mark} more than any other factor, and the constant roiling of
technology means tactics never stand still]{.underline}. [Also relevant
to this discussion is [the]{.mark} so-called **[spectrum of
conflict]{.mark}**. This is a commonly used term that [seeks to
**classify the interaction** among nations]{.mark} (at war or not),
often (but not always) by the scale and type of means being
used]{.underline}. 11 Soldier-scholar Harry Summers pointed out that
this notion entered the U.S. military lexicon as the "spectrum of war"
via the U.S. Army's 1962 Field Service Regulations. Then the spectrum
stretched from cold war to limited war. [Summers correctly identified [a
"serious flaw": the spectrum **fails to delineate** between war and
peace]{.mark}.]{.underline} 12 [[This]{.mark} type of **defective
[thinking]{.mark}** [continues to feed]{.mark} current **American
[misconceptions]{.mark}** [as we]{.mark} continue to [confuse war and
peace]{.mark}, something [manifest in the discussions of]{.mark} hybrid
war, gray-zone war, and **[so-called cyber war]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
In a 2016 article, Lieutenant General James Dubik, USA (Ret.), made an
argument similar to that of Summers, [observing that **U.S. [leaders are
fuzzy]{.mark}** [about just what war is]{.mark}, a problem fed by the
1994 adoption (really, readoption) of a spectrum-of-conflict approach to
strategic analysis]{.underline}. 13 Objecting to using this inaccurate
analytical tool does not, as some argue, merely "perpetuate the binary
peace/war distinction." 14 It is in reality an insistence on clear
analysis and an embrace of the notion that peace and war are not the
same. Their relationship is not binary; it is dialectical. War and peace
are best defined in opposition to one another, as one is the antithesis
of the other. [[If a state is engaged in armed conflict, it is at
war]{.mark}. The armed conflict can be with another state or
not.]{.underline} [[Clausewitz]{.mark} famously [defines]{.mark} [war as
"**an act of force**]{.mark}," one intended to achieve a political
object.]{.underline} [Lukas Milevski cogently observes that
[Clausewitz's definition]{.mark} "elegantly [encapsulates]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} three most [important elements of war: **violence,
instrumentality," and its adversarial nature**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If
[the state is not in an armed conflict, it is **at peace**]{.underline}.
Thomas Hobbes tells us that peace is the absence of war. 15 War should
not be confused with warfare, which usually is defined as the
undertaking of the military actions themselves. Understanding this is
critical because we begin our analysis with the question whether the
nation is at war. [One must remember, though, that [nations can **be in
competition**]{.mark} with one another [and **not be at war** and
involved in killing t]{.mark}he soldiers (and usually civilians) of the
other state. [Competition]{.mark} among all states, friendly or not**,
[is a norm]{.mark}**---and to be preferred]{.underline}. But allowing
our analysis of wars or competition among states to rest on intellectual
constructs that fail to honor the critical distinction between war and
peace means we have lost the logical foundation for critical analysis.

### 2NC\-\--Democracy

#### NATO poses as the defender of democracy to push narratives and justify unrestrained violence

NATO's strategic discourse and the self-authorisation of 'the West'
While the first research area dealt with representations of
'authoritarian regimes' that are by definition categorised as being
outside of the boundaries of 'the West', this research area focuses on
[the transformation of NATO, that is, the military alliance that is
considered to be the institutional core of what we usually call 'the
West']{.underline} (e.g., Gress 2004; Brzezinski 2009). Obviously,
transatlantic security cooperation has been a classical theme in IR,
either from a realist vantage point, [where NATO is primarily described
as a defence alliance subordinated to national purposes]{.underline}
(Waltz 2000: 18), or from a liberal perspective, [where NATO is
understood as an alliance of democracies]{.underline} (RisseKappen 1995:
4). In both perspectives, however, [the dynamics of security cooperation
between North America and Europe seem unproblematic as long as the
allies are convinced of their common interest or their shared
values]{.underline}.

[NATO's (lasting) ability to voice in-/securities --- for example a
'Soviet threat', 'terrorism', or 'new challenges' --- directs our
attention to highly institutionalised dynamics of securitisation that,
as the subsequent analysis will show, manifest themselves as a
self-authorisation of 'the West' in order to defend its normative
foundation.]{.underline} Such a tendency towards self-authorisation [has
become visible in different forms since the North Atlantic alliance was
founded in 1949.]{.underline} During the Cold War, it primarily [enabled
a rather deep institutionalisation of military cooperation with an
integrated command structure including US nuclear weapons,]{.underline}
as well as common strategic planning and defence exercises. After the
Cold War, this project was continued but it has certainly changed in
form. [Out-of-area operations and the development of a globally active
alliance is one of the most visible expressions of such self authorising
practices.]{.underline} These dynamics were central [to re-constitute
NATO during critical junctures]{.underline} and have been productive of
a highly self-confident Western alliance today (Jackson 2003; Bially
Mattern 2005; Behnke 2013).

The North Atlantic Treaty, signed in April 1949 by representatives of
nine Western European states, Iceland, Canada, and the US, provided the
Western alliance with a legal basis and outlined the key principles of
cooperation, that is, consultation (Article 4) and collective defence
(Article 5[). Although the formulation of Article 5 was highly contested
between the US and its European allies, it was perceived as the
cornerstone of transatlantic security cooperation]{.underline} (Kaplan
2004: 4). In contrast to such a legal framing of Western security
cooperation, the preamble of the Treaty [invoked an inherently normative
rhetoric when it stated that the parties 'are determined to safeguard
the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their people, founded
on the principle of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of
law']{.underline} (The North Atlantic Treaty 1949). The construction of
unity based on a common culture and even 'civilisation' (rather than
merely a shared threat perception) transferred military cooperation and
integration far beyond an interestdriven alliance (e.g., Klein 1990;
Jackson 2003, 2006a). During these formative years of NATO, one central
aim of formulating 'strategic concepts' was to construct a common
security interest of the US and Western European states that was
metaphorically framed in terms of an 'indivisibility of allied
security'.

Bearing these normative foundations in mind, [NATO gradually evolved as
a cultural project that was directed against communism --- which made
the inclusion of an autocratic state such as Portugal possible ---
rather than as a community of democratic states]{.underline} (Klein
1990; Jackson 2003; Sjursen 2004). The invoked [narrative of shared
norms, values, and a common heritage provided a sufficiently strong
rationale for defending the North Atlantic Area against any potential
threat.]{.underline} Moreover, it also legitimised taking whatever
measures were deemed 'necessary' to defend its members[. 'Forward
defence' and 'massive retaliation' turned out to be such legitimate
means]{.underline}. Nevertheless, in many ways the strength of Western
rhetoric was also intended to polish over and counterbalance many of the
underlying political conflicts that persisted throughout NATO's post-war
history. As a matter of fact, over the years it had [become a standard
formula in political discourse to refer to an alliance in 'crisis' as
proof of its uniquely transatlantic vitality]{.underline}. In this
[sense the invocation of a normative foundation of shared 'Western'
values, heritage and civilisation even against the background of
internal political dissent was as much a securitising move as it was an
expression of a particular 'Western' structure of conflict]{.underline}.
One could conclude that [transatlantic security cooperation was only
manageable by invoking such a normative foundation of shared values,
heritage, and civilisation.]{.underline}

The subsequent strategic concepts DC 6/1 (December 1952), MC 14/2 (May
1957) and the amended strategic guidelines were written with the
intention to both 'convince the USSR that war does not pay' (NATO 1950)
and to reassure the allies that continued and even intensified that
security cooperation was necessary. Changing strategic concepts, most
prominently from 'massive retaliation' to 'flexible response', restored
the reliability of mutual defence because of altered security
circumstances (e.g., Haftendorn 1996; Tuschhoff 1999; Kaplan 2004: 100).
Although the concept of 'flexible response' eventually satisfied all
allies and remained valid until the end of the Cold War, different
interpretations of deterrence and its operational implications persisted
(Daalder 1991: 41; Risse-Kappen 1995: 184--7). Once again a particular
structure of conflict among NATO allies was observable in the sense that
although a 'crisis' occurred, references to the common heritage, shared
norms and values of the 'free world' restored sufficient coherence among
them. In this sense, the decision over West Germany's membership in
1955, the Suez Crisis in 1956, the withdrawal of France from the
integrated military command structure in 1966, or NATO's double track
decision in 1979 were all incidents of alliance disruption that
nevertheless did not lead to a break-up of the Atlantic alliance. In
these situations strategic concepts turned out to be crucial in
re-establishing coherence and unity by reaffirming the authority of the
alliance and its ability to (re-)act. The strengthening of consultation
mechanisms in the 1950s, the formation of 'Allied Mobile Forces' (AMF)
in the 1960s, or the deployment of additional Pershing II missiles in
the 1980s embodied the institutional consequences of these strategic
re-orientations.

With the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, many commentators expected that
the Atlantic alliance would sooner or later vanish as well. Thus, NATO's
post-Cold War strategies of 1991 and 1999 were primarily aimed at
justifying the institutional continuity of the Western alliance against
the new setting of a decreasing Eastern threat (e.g., Ringsmose and
Rynning 2009: 5). At the beginning of the 1990s, 'Europe, whole and
free' (The Alliance's New Strategic Concept 1991) became the obvious new
rhetorical commonplace to legitimise a different future for NATO
compared with the fate of the Warsaw Pact. It opened up the possibility
of Eastern enlargement and paved the way for the institutionalisation of
a new relationship with Russia (Wallander 2000; Williams and Neumann
2000; Schimmelfennig 2003; Adler 2008; Pouliot 2008) as well as
initiatives for cooperation in the Mediterranean (Masala 2003).

In the same vein of institutional and geographical expansion, the
'out-of-area' debate in the mid-1990s rearticulated the necessity for a
political and military engagement far beyond alliance territory and
territorial defence.7 While the bipolar confrontation of the Cold War
had largely constrained the alliance's global military engagement,
'safeguarding the freedom, common heritage and civilisation' now
ascribed a global mission to NATO's members[. Instead of supporting a
culture of self-restraint and legal formalism, the allies even
intensified a tendency towards self-authorisation in the name of
defending human rights and the achievements of 'Western civilisation'.
Disregarding United Nations' formal legal provisions in the case of
Kosovo, NATO itself became a producer of a common law where the
protection of human rights was deemed more important than respecting
state sovereignty and non-intervention. The specific formation of NATO's
strategic discourse made such 'humanitarian interventions' intelligible
as the new raison d'eˆtre.]{.underline} [Public justifications for
military interventions in Serbia or Afghanistan, for example, cited the
attack on 'Western' values as a determining reason for taking military
action. Ultimately, in its statement on terrorism, the North Atlantic
Council said that 'the lives of our citizens, and their human rights and
civil liberties' were threatened by terrorism and reaffirmed that the
allies 'condemn terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations.]{.underline} We, the 19 NATO Allies, are determined to
combat this scourge. Our security requires no less' (NATO 2001).8

During the Cold War, such a project of self-authorisation was primarily
realised by institutionalising an integrated command structure,
coordinated defence planning and common exercises. Today, the rhetoric
of unpredictable risks and the global war on terrorism assigns an almost
universal authority to NATO, in particular when 'the challenge is not
just to make our populations secure, but feel secure' (de Hoop Scheffer
2009, emphasis added). 'Europe' and the 'transatlantic area' is the
endangered subject of NATO's strategic discourse justifying a durable
and institutionally dense military cooperation of its member states and
a nuclearisation of its defence strategy. Whenever allies pursued
(national) security policies without consultation, conflicts and crisis
within the alliance ensued. It was only through NATO that 'the West'
could materialise its power position through a specific form of
self-authorisation. NATO, respectively Western states, presented
'democracy', 'human rights', the 'rule of law', and 'market economy' as
normatively unquestioned principles they had already realised. Others
had only one choice: to comply or to resist. [The normative
attractiveness of 'the West', thus, also directs our attention to the
temptations of securitising practices where a formalisation of IR
through law is marginalised by unilateral acts of
self-authorisation.]{.underline}

Technologies of health security

As with its military counterpart[, the [medical industrial complex in
its]{.mark} current ([perpetual]{.mark}) [war on disease]{.mark} [is
developing an array of weapons]{.mark} for pre-emptive strikes against
the enemy]{.underline}. Its apparently most effective (and lucrative)
technology in preventative medicine is the vaccine. So significant has
this technology become, that vaccination programmes are at the forefront
of global health programmes. [Support for the worldwide deployment of
vaccine defence initiatives was evident in a statement by the WHO
i]{.underline}n 2005 which enthused 'Immunization is one of the most
successful and cost-effective health interventions ever. ... We are
entering a new era in which it is expected that the number of available
vaccines will double. Immunization services are increasingly used to
deliver other important health interventions, making them a strong
pillar of health systems'
(WHO/Unicef [2005](https://www-routledgehandbooks-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.4324/9781315743981-13#ch12-bib-66):
3). As an integral component of the UN's 2000--2015 Millennium
Development Goals (MDG) and no doubt its successor, the post-2015
Sustainable Development Agenda, [vaccination sits at the heart of
aspirational strategies for improving the lives of those in the
developed world as well as the global south]{.underline}. According to
the Vaccine Alliance network GAVI, a crucial partner in the MDG health
programme, as well as preventing certain diseases, vaccination also
'raises children's IQ, improves their cognitive development, physical
strength and educational achievements' (Millennium Development Goals).
Despite this expanding suite of advantageous outcomes and the overtly
benign impetus behind the goals, [a shadow has been cast regarding the
ethics of the more covert incentives behind the programme. Some events
have exposed the [unhealthy relationship between national governments,
intergovernmental agencies and the]{.mark} [pharmaceutical
industry,]{.mark} alliances [based]{.mark} in part [on 'unwarranted
influence']{.mark} and ['misplaced power']{.mark} by the latter party
[and]{.mark} the [pursuit of self-interest]{.mark} by each]{.underline}.
In the case of the Indian clinical trials referred to above, one of the
observations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee's investigation
into the HPV vaccine trials was that PATH, supported by funds from the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (which also contributes substantial
sums to GAVI) had 'under the pretext of observation/demonstration
project \[*sic*\] ... violated all laws and regulations laid down for
clinical trials by the Government', a situation made possible by the lax
attitude to regulations by the Indian Council of Medical Research. The
report continued by concluding:

While doing so, its \[PATH's\] sole aim has been to promote the
commercial interest of HPV vaccine manufacturers who would have reaped
windfall profits had PATH been successful in getting the HPV vaccine
included in the UIP (Universal Immunization Programme) of the Country.

[requires]{.mark} the [consumer]{.mark} (here the public, the state and
the medical profession) [to buy]{.mark} (literally) [into]{.mark} a
[belief that]{.mark} the [security products]{.mark} offered [are
effective in obviating]{.mark} or at least weakening the risk of
[disease]{.mark} or illness.]{.underline} This further involves ensuring
that any risk involved in consuming the product, in this case the
vaccine, is overridden by the threat posed by the disease against which
it is affording protection. [[Creating a vigorous market]{.mark} for
business in a competitive environment, [as studies of corporate crime
have consistently shown]{.mark}, can [involve]{.mark} a range of deviant
and criminal strategies and activities, including [fraud, corruption,
intimidation and bribery, activities that are]{.mark} ubiquitous and, in

Healy observes that unlike other health-risk businesses such as tobacco
and the chemicals industry, in which 'the best studies systematically
point to hazards where they exist' and where company studies tend to be
a small component of evidence-production, often viewed with suspicion as
being partial, the same does not pertain to the pharmaceutical industry:

with pharmaceuticals often the only studies are those of the drug
companies themselves, and these studies, as one might expect, all seem
to point to the benefits of an ongoing use of the very chemicals that
may in fact be causing the problem.

Despite a long history of insalubrious behaviour in the pharmaindustry[,
[governments and intergovernmental organizations]{.mark} such as the WHO
continue to [focus on pharmaceuticalized solutions to what are]{.mark}
arguably [pharmaceutically constructed health
risks]{.mark}]{.underline}. While obfuscating or down-playing the safety
issues around the escalating administration of medical interventions,
the [[pharmaindustry's intensified participation in research and
policy-making enables it to **construct narratives of high risk**
around]{.mark} both the [nature of diseases and their
prevalence]{.mark}, and exaggerate the efficacy of its products, thereby
creating an ever-expanding market]{.underline}
(Healy [2012](https://www-routledgehandbooks-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.4324/9781315743981-13#ch12-bib-30);

This is especially the case in a product that is administered to a
population. The vaccine industry is highly profitable not only because
of its numerical reach but because, in an increasing range of
jurisdictions, vaccines carry a mandatory status.

[These [policies, which]{.mark} for critics of mandatory medical
intervention, [are]{.mark} regarded as a [**blatant violation of human
rights,** have been legitimized through]{.mark} the discursive
modalities of [securitization]{.mark}]{.underline}, in much the same way
that torture and extraordinary rendition were reconstructed as necessary
for the protection of the very phenomena they were consistently eroding
(Chossudovsky [2005](https://www-routledgehandbooks-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/10.4324/9781315743981-13#ch12-bib-14)).
In both cases, where the market operates as a crucial driver, in which
defensive mechanisms are for sale, whether vaccines or arms, there must
be no limitation to demand. [[Creating demand through the security
narrative]{.mark} and ensuring supply through mandate [enables]{.mark}
the [constant proliferation of]{.mark} an [industry]{.mark} which
simultaneously protects and destroys. Excessive **[protection can only
lead to destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline} (consider the proliferation
of nuclear arms during the Cold War in what was termed MAD -- mutually
assured destruction). Esposito captures this in his consideration of the
process of over-immunization as a political, juridical as well as
bio-political phenomenon, whereby 'the warring potential of the immune
system is so great that at a certain point it turns against itself as a
real and symbolic catastrophe leading to the implosion of the whole
organism' (2011: 17). Yet, as has been made clear in the aftermath of
the global financial crisis, [the voracious appetite of the
[market]{.mark} in its neoliberal manifestation [continues]{.mark} apace
ignoring the social and economic cannibalism of [excessive
profit-seeking]{.mark}. For the pharmaindustry that involves the
presence, real or imaginary, of a constant threat of disease and
infection.]{.underline}

State of infection 

In its 2006 action plan to 'increase vaccine supply' the WHO informs us
that 'Influenza vaccine development and employment are critical elements
of pandemic influenza preparedness'. In explaining how serious this risk
of a pandemic actually is, and the consequent justification for spending
billions of dollars on flu vaccines globally, the [[WHO]{.mark} slips
into 'Rumsfeldian [discourse' describing]{.mark} the 'the global burden
of [seasonal influenza' as an 'unknown']{.mark}]{.underline} (WHO 2006).
We are now familiar with unknowns in their both knowable and unknowable
states as being crucial to the extension of state power with its
affiliate abuses. [[The 'unknown burden']{.mark} of seasonal flu has
[occasioned]{.mark} not only the [mass manufacture of a vaccine
that]{.mark}, in its current stage of development [has proven]{.mark} to
be [less than effective]{.mark} (Gallagher 2015), [but also]{.mark} the
introduction of [mandatory policies around]{.mark} the influenza
[vaccine]{.mark} for health workers and other professionals]{.underline}
(Babcock et al. 2010). Indeed, mandating a range of vaccines has now
become established practice in a number of countries including the US,
Australia, France and Canada, with the UK being a notable exception. 

[[Mandatory creep has been occurring]{.mark} over the past few decades,
[overriding]{.mark} the hitherto [right to abstain from
vaccination]{.mark}]{.underline} programmes on the basis of religious or
'conscientious objection' (a term originally used for nineteenth-century
vaccine objectors and subsequently adopted by the military for those who
refused compulsory conscription on similar grounds) in many cases
leaving medical exemption the only acceptable criterion for refusal.
Vaccine programmes involve mass immunization or herd immunity in which a
large percentage of the population is required to be vaccinated against
a disease to ensure its control and hopefully gradual eradication,
thereby protecting those who cannot be vaccinated against possible
infection. Unlike other medical interventions, [the [focus]{.mark} here
[lies on]{.mark} the [protection of]{.mark} the [population rather
than]{.mark} an [individual]{.mark}]{.underline}. For Foucault,
immunization represents a distinctive break from other medical
relationships which seek to heal the individual, but operates as 'a way
of individualizing the collective phenomenon of the disease, or of
collectivizing the phenomena, integrating individual phenomena within a
collective field, but in the form of the rational and identifiable'
(2004: 60). [This brings another dimension to the philosophy of
[reponsibilization]{.mark} that [dominates]{.mark} the [neoliberal
concept of health, a paradoxical position that transforms individual
accountability into sacrifice]{.mark}]{.underline} (for even the
strongest advocates of mandatory vaccination admit there is no such
thing as one hundred per cent safety). [It is a subtly crafted moral
[sleight of hand]{.mark} that [turns adherence to]{.mark} the
[market]{.mark} of [and]{.mark} for [pharmatechnologies]{.mark} [into an
abnegation of self]{.mark}, [where the self operates not]{.mark} simply
[as part of]{.mark} the [collective but as subservient to it: capitalism
functioning through a 'communist' guise. Human rights can]{.mark} thus
[be]{.mark} [dismissed as 'nonsense]{.mark} upon stilts' [or]{.mark}
perhaps worse still, [as the **greatest threat to human rights
itself**.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

Given that the 1948 Declaration of Human Rights emerged from inter alia
some of the most horrific medical abuses ever recorded it is even more
ironic that the policy of mandatory vaccination is proliferating. It
contravenes human rights contained within a number of conventions which
establish individual autonomy regarding medical intervention. This
includes Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights on the
respect for one's private life, that is 'the right not to be physically
interfered with' (Liberty 2015) and more specifically, the International
Covenant on Political and Civil Rights protection against 'torture or to
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no
one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific
experimentation' (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
1966). 

[The combined [rhetoric of security and science]{.mark}, fundamental to
the justification and waging of war, [not only assuages]{.mark} the
[retraction of human rights]{.mark} obligations [by the state but can
**render these rights themselves as presenting a
threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As the war on disease, together
with that on terror, has no defined end, no clear moment of victory,
being non-territorial insofar as it has no physical jurisdiction, [the
suspension or [**weakening of human rights will** continue and **further
entrench**]{.mark} the '[**paradigm of security** as the normal
technique of government']{.mark}]{.underline} (Agamben 2005: 14). In
this environment [[vaccine objection]{.mark} easily [slips]{.mark} [into
criminalized activity and]{.mark} criticism [appears]{.mark} as
[unpatriotic. Concerns over conflict of interest,]{.mark} [data
manipulation, bribery and intimidation are turned into politicized
opposition and those who voice]{.mark} these [concerns become enemies of
the people, a security threat, health terrorists]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In this context, punitive measures against those who refuse, both for
themselves or on behalf of those under their guardianship, are also
becoming more draconian and can range from financial penalties, the
exclusion of children from day care centres, loss of jobs (within the
medical profession) or even prison (Willsher 2014). 

[[Informed consent]{.mark} lies [at the heart of]{.mark} the numerous
instruments for the [protection of]{.mark} the human
[body]{.mark}]{.underline}; the notion of bodily integrity underpins a
series of rights that have been allocated to citizens in democratic
states, including the right to abortion. [When the information aspect of
informed is either denied or contains negative data concerning safety it
is rational to assume that consent might not be always forthcoming.
[Collusion between industry and politics is a major
concern]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Eisenhower warned. Mary Holland's
critique of mandatory vaccination lays out the extent of these collusive
relationships in the US, which were even admitted by politicians
themselves:

In 2000, a Congressional report on Conflicts of Interest in Vaccine
Policy Making identified notable conflicts of interests in the FDA
\[Federal\] and CDC \[Center for Disease Control\] advisory bodies that
make national vaccine policy. These include 'advisers' financial ties to
vaccine manufacturers' as well as 'advisers' permitted stock ownership
in companies affected by their decisions'. (Holland 2012:77)

Declaring these activities in Congress has not deterred their
occurrence. In 2007, an attempt was made by the erstwhile Governor of
Texas, Rick Perry, to mandate the HPV vaccine in his state's schools, a
decision he was subsequently forced to overturn when it was revealed
that Merck, the company that produced the Gardasil vaccine, had given
donations towards his nomination (Eggen 2011). Nor will this be the last
cosy relationship between politics and industry as mandatory vaccination
policy continues to be applied to an increasing number of vaccines. 

Conclusion

[Pharmatechnologies manifesting as medical research, drug production and
distribution, [epistemological paradigms determining how health, disease
and risk are to be conceptualized]{.mark} and negotiated, [have]{.mark}
now [become a mode of governance in an increasingly authoritarian
environment.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is not to detract from the
benefits accrued from medical progress through pharmaceuticals and the
important role played by vaccines in alleviating potential suffering.
Yet, the benign discourses within which they operate can often obscure
harmful outcomes, harms imposed as structural violence: opaque,
unidentifiable and normalized (Žižek 2009). [[Victimization remains
unseen or as]{.mark} a [necessary]{.mark} price to pay for the greater
good. In medical terms aspects of [these harms are referred to
as]{.mark} iatrogenesis, the unintended, often injurious, consequences
of medical intervention.]{.underline} In this latter context [it is akin
to what military circles euphemistically term '[collateral
damage']{.mark}]{.underline}, generally applied to the killing and
maiming of noncombatants. However, some scholars who study state and
corporate harms are less inclined to semantic generosity, not least when
the majority of damage and injury inflicted falls on the same targets,
the socio-economically vulnerable, gendered, racial, ethnic or other
minorities whose lot it is to comprise the flotsam and jetsam of
ruthless markets and the politics of indifference. Intention, or lack
of, as they argue, cannot disguise the power relations at play as the
usual suspects emerge as perpetrators and beneficiaries of systemic
abuses.

If we are to accept the argument put forward by Tombs and Whyte that
'The problems caused by corporations -- which seriously threaten the
stability of our lives -- ... are enduring and necessary functions of
the corporation' (2015: 4), a position supported by a plethora of cases,
then [[all industry operating within]{.mark} a [capitalist framework is
intrinsically pathological]{.mark}. It is essentially a diseased entity,
irrespective of the nature of goods and services produced or the
rhetoric that designates it as benign]{.underline}. Ironically, this
diseased entity in combination with an increasingly diseased political
system, proclaims and even persists that it has both the authority and
ability to produce and sell health. Yet, [so strong is the belief in
pharmaceuticalized health that so [many literally buy into]{.mark} the
'[truths' of pharmatechnologies failing miserably to discern how]{.mark}
the [contagion-riddled **commodification of health is actually the
greatest danger** to health.]{.mark}]{.underline}

No business thrives on the elimination of demand for its goods. The
technologies of war were justified through the eventual establishment of
peace; so too the pharmaindustry legitimizes its existence through
claims to health and healing. The existence of both is dependent on the
perpetuation of the very phenomena they claim to defend us from, and in
this they must continue to be producers of war and sickness. [No longer
does the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exist, as
Eisenhower warned, it has become fundamental to the industries of war
and disease, to war on disease.]{.underline}

3.2 Securitizing health

[[Ebola's appearance on]{.mark} the agenda of the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[N]{.mark}**ations [Security Council]{.mark} marks an unusual event,
as it [indicates]{.mark} the [securitization of]{.mark} an issue
predominantly understood as belonging to the field of [public
health]{.mark}. However, [this is not]{.mark} a [unique or
unprecedented]{.mark} case of securitization in a public health
context.]{.underline} A growing body of literature is exploring
non-military dimensions of security, as mentioned above (see e.g.
Ullman, 1983; Buzan, 1997; Buzan 2007; King&Murray 2001-02) and the
increasing securitization of public health issues has given rise to a
number of relevant studies and a rich academic debate.

This debate is for the most part grounded in the theory of
securitization, which derives principally from the work of Barry Buzan,
Ole Weaver and Jaap de Wilde (Buzan et al., 1998), which will be
extensively discussed in chapter four. The basic principle of this
theory is that [[**any kind of issue** can be]{.mark} distinguished from
the merely political by being [presented as]{.mark} existential threats
to a referent object by a [securitizing]{.mark} actor]{.underline}. This
actor thereby "generates endorsement of emergency measures" (p.5) which
may even extend beyond legal constraints and democratic principles.
Thus, undergoing a discursive process of securitization, an issue
becomes securitized which "grants the actor a right to violate rules
that would otherwise bind" (Wæver, 2000:251).

Maclean (2008) argues that the [[securitization of health]{.mark} as a
phenomenon [predates]{.mark} the construction of the [Westphalian
state-form]{.mark}]{.underline}, and identifies the [[growing
connections between health and security]{.mark} like McInnes (2008) as
[features of]{.mark} an increasingly [interconnected, globalized
world]{.mark}]{.underline} (p.475). She claims that [[bioterrorism
and]{.mark} emerging [infectious diseases]{.mark} are the primary
[health-related security concerns]{.mark} of today, having generated
responses on both national and international levels]{.underline}.
Maclean mentions Ebola along with other haemorrhagic fever viruses as
fatal diseases that have been raising alarm outside their locations of
infection, due to the implied risk of fast spread as a result of
increased and facilitated international travel[. [With]{.mark} the
[emergence of]{.mark} [HIV/AIDS]{.mark} and its rapid spread worldwide,
this [risk perception was reinforced]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
international spread of fatal diseases far beyond the location of their
index cases (e.g. as was the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) in 2002-03), has amplified anxiety and [[given way to]{.mark} an
[increasingly **transnational understanding of health**]{.mark} [related
risks]{.mark} resulting [from]{.mark} the insight that such
[diseases]{.mark} can have a major impact on international relations and
national competitiveness]{.underline} (Maclean, 2008:482).

Similar to Maclean, Kelle (2007) argues that the [[driving force behind
the securitization of disease]{.mark} since the 1990s [was]{.mark} an
increased [concern for bioterrorism]{.mark} or "deliberate
disease]{.underline}" (p. 219) that had the whole population as a
referent object -- unlike biological warfare which was threatening only
for the military. He claims that [there [was]{.mark} a [need to
integrate]{.mark} (international) public [health governance in]{.mark}
the [security concerns]{.mark} of biological weapons in order to
effectively deal with these new, large-scale threats.]{.underline} Kelle
points to a notion of potential collaboration between the WHO -- the key
actor for disease prevention and mitigation on the international scale
-- and UNSC, as featured in the 2004 report of the UN Secretary-General
High-level Panels on Threats, Challenges and Change (p. 228; UN 2004).
Kelle's research pinpoints the WHO even as a securitizing actor,
although restricted to the promotion of the notion of health security in
human security terms, instead of a more traditional, state-centred
understanding of the security concept. He reasons that, with respect to
public health, the [securitizing moves have [reinforced]{.mark} the
[state as an actor in]{.mark} the provision of [international public
health]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hanrieder and Kreuder-Sonnen (2014) on the
other hand argue that the [securitization of international problems has
lead to the internationalization of emergency governance, and point to
the emergency authorities which WHO has gained with respect to global
health crises]{.underline}, especially since the SARS crisis in 2002.

3.2.1 Infectious diseases and securitization

HIV/AIDS constitutes the public health issue that received the most
scholarly attention with respect to securitization. According to Maclean
(2008), the [security discourse around HIV/AIDS is]{.underline} --
although not undisputed -- by now "[well established in both national
and international security sectors"]{.underline} (p.483). Investigating
the "legitimacy of 'securitizing' HIV/AIDS" (Selgelid & Enemark
2008:457), Selgelid and Enemark argue that an infectious disease may be
considered a security threat when it "threatens the existence or
stability of society and/or when emergency measures are required to
address it" (ibid.). Referring to the UNSC Resolution 1308 (2000) as the
first health issue officially framed a "threat to international peace
and security" the authors discuss the effects of such a discourse. On
the one hand, regarding HIV/AIDS as a threat to security has led several
states to greater resource allocation towards containing the virus (e.g.
the US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003). On
the other hand, a number of [scholars are concerned with the
implications of a security framework for the people suffering from
HIV/AIDS, since the [securitization of infectious diseases]{.mark} may
[involve **suspending human rights and liberties**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
For example Elbe (2006) asserts that [[people living]{.mark} [with
HIV/AIDS have been "**ostracized and even persecuted**]{.mark} by some
states for their illness]{.underline}" (p.128). He regards it therefore
necessary to limit the occasions upon which extraordinary (draconian)
disease measures can be implemented in the name of security.

[Another reason for limiting the securitization of public health regards
the nature of the security concept]{.underline}, which is expected to
lose its meaning and usefulness in political discourse if applied too
loosely (Selgelid & Enemark, 2008:458). Raising the bar for the
securitization of diseases, i.e. reducing it to contexts of
quick-spreading pathogens, would however rule out HIV/AIDS and other
slow-spreading, endemic diseases. Such diseases do not generate as much
dread as outbreak events, although they typically result in greater
levels of illness and death, as well as long-term economic and social
erosion (ibid.; Price-Smith 2002:15-16). The authors point out that
[**[dread aggravates]{.mark} the [effects of a disease]{.mark}** [by
generating]{.mark} major [societal disruption]{.mark}, which is why
dreaded diseases are "likely to touch the security nerve of people and
politicians in ways that set them apart from other health
issues]{.underline}" (p.460). On a similar note Smith et al. (2004)
remark on infectious diseases' powerful ability to engender fear which
"often leads to rapid, emotionally driven decision-making about public
health policies needed to protect the community" (p.1).

**Responses to disease from Western states and [transnational
organizations]{.underline} leads to securitization \-\-- people are
forced to govern their own bodies and associate disease with [violence
and terror]{.underline}**

reproduction of terror" (book chapter in *Beyond Biopolitics: Theory,
violence, and horror in world politics*) /lg

[A telling example of this self-mobilization and self-immunization
against one 's body and ﬂesh can be found in the way **[Western
states]{.mark}** (or, rather, some of their governmental agents and
agencies) **[along with]{.mark}** some **[transnational
organizations]{.mark}** (the World Health Organization, the United
Nations) [asked populations]{.mark} the world over [to preemptively take
charge of their health]{.mark}, hygiene, and everyday routines
[in]{.mark} the [context of the]{.mark} recent A/H1N1 (or " [swine
ﬂu]{.mark} " ) pandemic]{.underline}. In this popular health scare, as
with many other instances of spreading epidemics over the past decade
(SARS, the H5N1 " bird ﬂu, " but also AIDS before), [[individual
beings]{.mark} were [asked to be the primary layer of securitization and
defense against terror by turning their bodies]{.mark} (and those of
family members, neighbors, co-workers, and so on) [into]{.mark}
primordial [sites of]{.mark} scrutiny, [intervention, and]{.mark} indeed
[governance]{.mark}. With the " swine ﬂu " fear, [a constant questioning
of one 's body]{.mark} movements and symptomatic features, along with
one ' s daily habits, [became]{.mark} an [automatic]{.mark}]{.underline}
(and auto-immune) and mostly unquestioned safeguard against the
epidemic. Humanity 's bodies, the physiology of the human species, but
also the meaning of what it means to be human (and whether humanity
should be reduced to a management of the ﬂ esh) became the main targets
of the pandemic terror but, just as crucially, of the containment terror
that followed the revelation of the pandemic. [This [governance
of]{.mark} the " [swine ﬂu]{.mark} " and its scare (the **[disease and
its terror were]{.mark}** indeed **[inseparable]{.mark}** from the
moment a pandemic discourse was launched) was then based on a series of
menial operations at the level of the human body and ﬂesh]{.underline}
(do I have a fever? Is my cough a sign that I have been infected? Did I
remember to wash my hands after riding the bus or the subway?). [Of
course, it also relied on several self-cancellation]{.underline}
[measures]{.underline} (I must stay home for days if I feel sick; I must
wear a protective mask if I venture outside and have a runny nose; we
must close entire schools for as long as necessary if we suspect that
children in the community have the ﬂu).

In the end, the swine ﬂu terror also raised vital questions about what
humanity today is by proliferating a succession of moral quandaries that
actually sought to recon ﬁgure humanity as that which is always already
primed for sacriﬁce. Among such so-called fundamental social dilemmas
were questions like: Must I sacriﬁce my body and my self if my children
are not yet sick but I am (and thus, I could infect them)? Will I have
to allow myself to go without treatment (and possibly not make it) if it
turns out that, as was reported, there are not enough vaccines for
everybody? Must I segregate myself, and remove my body from the
community of the living, so as not to let the remaining healthy bodies
be even more at risk? The sacriﬁcial logic involved in the swine ﬂ u
scare may evoke some of René Girard ' s theorizations, particularly to
the extent that this form of sacriﬁce appears to be aimed at the
safeguarding of the community. But today's self-sacriﬁcial or self
eﬀacing logic goes far beyond the claim advanced by Girard that " the
sacriﬁce serves to protect the entire community from its own violence. "
71 Or, for that matter, that [the ritual of the sacriﬁce " prompts the
entire community to choose victims outside itself]{.underline}. " 72 [To
the contrary, the [encouraged sacriﬁcial ritual of the swine ﬂu pandemic
terror is,]{.mark} to repeat, [an auto-immune]{.mark} response or
[attitude that, far from casting violence away,]{.mark} actually [seeks
to keep it within and]{.mark} **[strives to spread it]{.mark}**,
sometimes [in a horriﬁc fashion, to as many living members of]{.mark}
the [community as possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, by placing

[Cancer is a mysterious disease difficult to treat, and one that is
often equated with death. Of all diseases, [cancer]{.mark} has provided
probably the [most potent metaphor of illness]{.mark}]{.underline} since
tuberculosis became treatable in the midtwentieth century.60 While
tuberculosis is understood as a disease of one organ, cancer is
understood as a disease that can turn up in any organ and one whose
outreach is the whole body. It is a disease of growth -- sometimes
visible, more characteristically insidious -- which may be arrested for
periods of time, but is prone to recur. As defined by Mel Greaves,
[[cancer]{.mark} is a collection of many disorders of cell and tissue
function that [have]{.mark} one special biological property in common:
the [territorial expansion of a mutant clone]{.mark}]{.underline}.61
Susan Sontag argued that [when used as a metaphor, [**cancer appears as
a pathology** of space; its principal metaphors refer to topography --
it may 'spread, 'proliferate',]{.mark} or be
['diffuse]{.mark}d]{.underline}'.62 [[This is]{.mark} also the **[most
striking single image]{.mark}** that can be found [in]{.mark} almost all
[representations of malevolent nationalism in]{.mark} European [security
discourse]{.mark}: the threat of geographical escalation or spill-over
from one part of Europe to another]{.underline} -- most typically from
east to west. Furthermore, the [[language used to describe cancer
evokes]{.mark} a [systemic catastrophe]{.mark}: 'cells without
inhibitions, cancer cells will continue to grow and extend over each
other in a "chaotic" fashion]{.underline}, destroying the body's normal
cells, architecture, and functions'.63 [[Reliance on similar
dichotomies]{.underline},]{.mark} such as order/chaos and
normal/abnormal, [[in]{.mark} the discursive [economy of
nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline} is striking and more than coincidental.
What is also interesting is that [[in]{.mark} the [discourse of cancer
the **language of military strategy** is]{.mark} often [applied]{.mark}:
cancer [cells]{.mark} do not simply multiply, but [are 'invasive';
they]{.mark} '[colonise']{.mark} from the original tumour to far sites
in the body by metastasising; and only rarely are the body's own
'defences' strong enough to fight a tumour made of millions of
destructive cells.]{.underline}

This section examines how [LAWS are presented as a threat or security
issue]{.underline} in the material. Furthermore, to which extend LAWS
are not securitized or portrayed as threatening, in which a discourse of
progress and growth play a role. The threats or vulnerabilities that
[lethal autonomous weapon systems create are linked to different
thematic clusters and discourses. They can be summarised under key
themes of technological discourse and threat of other
actors]{.underline}, a military threat. Firstly, an important aspect in
the construction of a threat in [LAWS identified in the material is a
cluster which will be referred to here as a **new technology
discourse.** In this discourse, rapid technological advances are
perceived as a security issue]{.underline}. The term new technology
appears repeatedly in the material, though not always associated with
linguistic means of threat production, but it is [characterised as a
discourse concerned with technological development. Where new technology
is variously clustered with terms as: "cyber attacks" (E1) a "new
technological age" (E2), "Hackers" (E1; E8)) and consequential terms
such as "miscalculation"(E2), "manipulation"(E1),
"misuse"]{.underline}(E1). To demonstrate this discourse element, I will
use various examples from the material: New technologies are far more
susceptible to proliferation, manipulation and misuse that conventional
weapons. Hackers don´t need much more that a computer in order to carry
out cyber attacks. (E1) 28 The second big driver of change and new
technologies the topic of our conference today autonomous weapons
systems have created the fear of killer robots that attack targets
without human control. Cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure could
paralyse entire countries. And while attribution remains difficult,
retaliation could easily provoke unintended conflicts. (E2, cursive by
me) These quotes exe[mplify the **threatening or concerning discourse**
around new technology. In the first quote the threat is enacted in
temporal and special terms of proximity, an 'attack' could occur at any
moment]{.underline} inflicting some sort of personal harm as nothing
more than a computer is needed. In the second quote, the modality marker
'could' contributes to the creation of an ominous threat. The source is
not known or a 'killer robot without human control'. All these [construe
images of speed, devastating effects, and imminence toward the recipient
of the message. killer robots that Lord over life and death on the basis
of autonomous datasets and entirely beyond human control are already a
frightening real prospect today]{.underline} (...) fully autonomous
weapons are susceptible to manipulation and also to miscalculation.
Automatic escalations - 'flash wars' - and arms races are virtually
inevitable. This is therefore a red line that we must not cross we are
committed to this in Geneva \[and\] We need your support for this. (E1)
Here, the metaphor of a [red line is invoked concerning autonomous
weapons systems]{.underline}, which is commonly used to symbolize a
point of no return. Additionally, in the speech, [analogies are used to
induce fear. Analogies are often used to **illustrate a threat**,
creating a link between a current crisis and a past situation in which
neglect led to the fulfilment of the threat scenario]{.underline} (Cap,
2017). For example, in the 2019 speech, a link between the current
crisis of technological developments and their possible impact on
warfare to the discoveries of the German chemist Fritz Haber is made.
Besides paving the way for "mass production of artificial fertilizers"
(E1) which saved countless lives, Haber is known as the "father of gas
warfare" (E1). Therefore, the [example exemplifies the potential as well
as threat emanating from new technologies. The linguistic creation of a
threat emanating from LAWS and new technologies is more pronounced in
the speeches of Foreign Minister Maas than in the small inquiries and
the material of the CCW]{.underline}. An observation that coincides with
the fact the speech genre functions in a broad category in which the
speech is argumentative and supposed to entertain and persuade
(Fairclough, 1995). While the statements from the CCW and the small
inquiries fall more strongly in a category that is more argumentative,
in which the text serves to inform and persuade. The [statements for the
CCW are published in an environment in which what is said is very
controlled and the content is intertextually linked to prior statements
which as Fairclough argues, signals continuity of discourse
practices]{.underline} (Jorgensen & Phillips, 2002). The threat
discourse of new technologies closely links the threat of LAWS with a
discourse of cyber threat. The [perception of cyber space as a threat
environment has developed]{.underline} in Germany in recent decades.
[Cyber security became part of the public debate]{.underline} in Germany
in the early 1990s. Yet, it was [not strongly perceived as a threat
until the early 2000s with the fear of the Millennium]{.underline}, bug.
Then the terror attacks of 9/11 led to increased attention to various
security risks. These included cyber security. In Germany, the [cyber
threat is particularly perceived in connection to the protection of
personal data]{.underline}. Besides the event of 9/11, especially Edward
Snowden led to increased public attention. Snowden\'s disclosure of the
US National Security Agency (NSA) documents led to the increased
relevance of cyber security. It raised the threat perception in the
general public in 2013 (Schallbruch & Skierk, 2018). Sandywell (2006)
suggests that [post 9/11 new technology and especially the cyber space
caused new insecurities through a **blurring of the boundary between the
physical and virtual**, the global/regional. Where "states of emergency
settle into a condition of permanent societal instability]{.underline}"
(p.48). That these insecurities create a field in which the extreme
manifestations of the cyber threat are linked to the threat discourse of
global terrorism. Sandywell (2006) suggests that [both discourses are
marked with **boundary dissolving characteristics**, which have
**intrusive attributes**]{.underline}. Further,that the blurring of
common and familiar binaries [suggests a more general state of
emergency.]{.underline} On the textual level, the temporal and spatial
boundaries are dissolved, and the [threat is emanating from an unknown
intrusive other (Sandywell, 2006). It is this sociocultural context that
the threat of new technologies and risk perception of LAWS is
linked]{.underline} with within Germany. A [second theme or cluster of
threats in which LAWS is embedded is the threat of 'other
actors']{.underline} and the changing of capabilities that could come
with LAWS. Particularly, [other states and illegitimate actors. As
previously mentioned **delegitimization** can be used as a counterpart
to underpin own legitimization, which can be enacted through ideas of
difference, negative representations and geographical or cultural
boundaries]{.underline} (Cap, 2017). In the speeches a [starker image of
the 'other' is created in representations]{.underline}: 'we are urging
President Putin (...) to ensure that Russia returns to compliance with
the INF treaty. Its termination would have grave consequences for
Europeans\` security. (...) as a result of infringements, trust,
transparency, and stability which we have built up labouredly over
decades \[is\] at risk of being forfeited'(E1) 'Players such a China
must also take responsibility for strategic stability'(E1) 'I (...)
therefore welcome the willingness shown by the US to conduct talks with
North Korea on the North Korean nuclear programme'(E1) These quotes
while taken out of direct context serve to [demonstrate the **creation
of images** of other states. Russia is represented as non-compliant
'other' and while the substantives serve as negative attributions toward
Russia,]{.underline} they simultaneously positively represent the
in-groups Europe and Germany. Thus, it [reinforces the
mental-geographical boundary of Europe as a whole and its common
identity. Undergirding the call on China is implicit a lack of taking
responsibility for strategic stability.]{.underline} Contrary, the US is
portrayed as positive, willing to conduct talks, while North Korea
becomes a passive other. Therefore, a representation of the [world is
reinforced with positive attributes to allies such as the US and
representations of 'other' to Russia, North Korea, and
China.]{.underline} The 'other' in terms of states in the CCW material
is only visible in reference to 'potential adversaries'(E8), however,
there is a [reference concerning illegitimate actors as "terrorists"
(E1; E8), "criminals" (E1) "**illegitimate actors" (E1), and
"illegitimate groups**" (E9) who are "expanding their capacity to
indiscriminately inflict harm and inflict terror on
civilians]{.underline}" (E8). There are also consequential threats
present in the material which are in causal relation with the
aforementioned threat of 'other actors', the threat of arms race and
arms proliferation. The [threat of arms race is mentioned in different
ways. That with the development of LAWS "threat perceptions are likely
to change under the impression that potential adversaries have or are in
the process of acquiring such weapon systems]{.underline}" (E8, omitting
underline) and that "Arms races are under way around the world" (E1).
However, an increase of possible arms race is articulated as not being
limited to the development of LAWS: \[In\] the German government\'s
assessment, the development of autonomous functions for use in weapon
systems can further strengthen the already existing armament trends.
(E18) Noticeable is that while in the material of the CCW conference the
[threat of an arms race is discussed in future terms, it is declared as
already ongoing in the small inquiries and speeches. An image of a
growing threat is generated through increased capacities of other
states, which are, however not named and thus contribute to an ominous
external threat.]{.underline} Further, a consequential threat of
proliferation is articulated. It [relates to illegitimate actors and how
"transfer of software" (E8) is "difficult to prevent and even harder to
detect" (E18) and that "the risk of \[LAWS or predecessor technologies\]
uncontrolled proliferation \[is\] significantly greater than the
corresponding risks of uncontrolled proliferation of finished weapon
systems]{.underline}" (E18). Acknowledgement of the problem is followed
by arguments that: 32 these concerns are being addressed and regulated
by national administrative laws, in particular weapon laws and transport
and traffic law. This [enables governments to effectively stop or limit
the spread of dangerous dual use technologies, if
necessary]{.underline}. (E18)

#### Securitizing through drone usage [locks in]{.underline} failure and [sanitizes]{.underline} mass violence---the use of drones [dehumanizes]{.underline} war and [embraces]{.underline} the logic underpinning the [War on Terror]{.underline}.

The [utility of the WoT securitization]{.underline}, even in spite of
its many critics who rebuke its leaders and supporters, has as a [result
of its **attachment with such a universal issue** that stands in sharp
contrast and opposition to such beloved values, peoples, and ways of
life]{.underline} (in principles all that America embodies and stands
for) as referent objects [led to the establishment of a powerful
narrative]{.underline} (McCrisken 2011, 786). At the heart of this
narrative lie the dramatis personæ: the [US and the liberal democracies
of the world, and AQ and the "evil tyrants and murderers that support
it]{.underline}" (McCrisken 2012, 786). Such a narrative, [linked
inextricably to the events of 9/11 has assumed such rich symbolism,
emotional value, and representation of a zero-sum game]{.underline},
that the [WoT securitization]{.underline} has become "institutionalized
and normalized" or [engrained as part of American foreign
policy]{.underline} (Jackson 2011). "It has," in Jackon's (2011, 391)
words, "in the years since 9/11 become a powerful social structure (a
hegemonic discourse) that both expresses and simultaneously
co-constructs US interests and identity." The WoT and US opposition to
the threat of international terrorism has become overly manifest within
the US' national security structure and deep into American culture
(McCrisken 2011, 786). If we are to accept the WoT to have become
institutionalized by the majority of American society as just plain good
sense, then we might reasonably assume that [elites have no little or
choice but to move stridently forward in addressing AQ and international
terrorism as exceptional threats vis-à-vis extraordinary measures only
even if an actor would prefer to find a solution through the (normal)
political system.]{.underline} Having [intertwined the existential
threat with American society]{.underline} to such an extend and with
such extensive institutionalization having taken place over the previous
decade, "it is then," states McCrisken (2011), "extremely difficult for
any policy-maker or opinionshaper in the US, even a new president
dedicated to 'change', to seriously challenge the underlying assumptions
of the 'war on terror' and move policy significantly in a new direction"
(786). Drone Warfare as an Extraordinary Measure The previous section
touched upon the idea of the [WoT exerts a degree of influence on the
new security environment of the post-Cold War era than that of the
post-9/11 environment by acting as a **powerful narrative** of that
dichotomizes the international community according to the understanding
of the "West and the rest]{.underline}," or in the words of Bush, "Us
vs. Them" and "Good vs. Evil" (Greenwald 2008; Soblic 2009). The [WoT
also functions as a normative organization that allows the leadership of
the US (both the Bush and Obama administrations) to construct
understandings of and sensitivities about security and threats to that
security]{.underline}. Within this normative organization we can observe
public perceptions of the existential threat and the policy designed and
implemented by elites as mutually reinforcing. While many policies that
were adopted by the US and other states allied in the [fight against
terrorism]{.underline} existed before 9/11, its main events and the WoT
directly made them easier to introduce to the public and even helped
legitimize "their application across a wider set of issues and areas
than would otherwise have been the case (Buzan and Hansen 2009, 226).
Taking into consideration that this [section brings our attention
directly to the marketability (to the public) and employment of
extraordinary means to confront the existential threat posed by
international terrorism]{.underline}, Buzan and Hansen (2009, 226) note:
\[a\]s Realists, Liberals, and critical widening perspectives all point
out: in times of (discursively constituted) war, the money and manpower
allocated to the military increase, and encroachment on civil, liberal
and human rights are more likely to meet with public acceptance.
Concerns about terrorism were not entirely new by 2001 (although it was
seen more as a peripheral problem in both public spheres and within IR
by scholars), 9/11 elevated the prominence of terrorism to a new level.
This might be said to have combined with the view that the events of
9/11 drilled the enduring truth into the hearts and minds those at all
levels of American society that, "the absence of international conflict
was not indication of an irreversible change \[about the existence of
violent and deadly threats in the world\], but \[merely\] a temporary
lapse in the ebb and flow of tensions within an anarchical system (Buzan
& Hansen, 2009, 229). The [extraordinary measures that have been
implemented since 9/11 have served as some of the most explicit
characteristics and definers of the WoT securitization
program]{.underline}. Neither the Bush or Obama administrations have
been enormously open about the use of any of them but when they have, a
great deal of support, claims McCrisken (2011), was evident and often
referred to the legitimacy of these measures as part of the US'
responsibility to protect its citizens, to defend itself, and act if
there exists the imminence of threat. Both administrations have
maintained the elevation of international terrorism as an
extra-politicized and thus securitized state, subjecting it to measures
deemed well beyond the parameters of normal politics. In the last
decade, the [WoT has provided the **institutional framework** for
putting these extraordinary measures into practice]{.underline}: (a)
[Abrogation of civil, liberal, and human rights]{.underline} and
freedoms of individuals a. Irregular rendition b. [Systematic
torture]{.underline} c. Military commissions d. Indefinite detention e.
[Political surveillance]{.underline} (b) US affording itself the right
to attack based upon suspicion of further or imminent threat (c) State
intervention and military campaigns such as those in Iraq and
Afghanistan (d) Long-term military occupations and military presence in
Iraq and Afghanistan (e) Acceptability of increasing military losses and
collateral damage (f) [**Use of drones** and unmanned military systems
as part of an ever-growing TK campaign.]{.underline} The extraordinary
measures represent a toolkit of [security actions that the US has put to
use in its response against the existential threat of international
terrorism as part of the WoT's core]{.underline}. One of the most direct
means of defining these as extraordinary measure is simply by noting the
extent of publicity as well as criticism and opposition they have
received over the past decade, while viewing these actions as
extraordinary measures can be achieved further still by signaling the
level of discretion with which the US has treated to them. [Policymakers
and scholars alike have clearly accepted these as security actions in
the WoT, many of which would unlikely claim that they do not stick out
in the **realm of normal politics**]{.underline}. The considerable
overlapping then seen amongst these various approaches as measures
within the [WoT can be taken as evidence that the use of drones falls
within the field of extraordinary measures]{.underline}, particularly
given that it [constitutes an action that has both emerged and evolved
within the purview of the WoT]{.underline}. We might also link the use
of [drones and TK more closely to those measures inescapably regarded as
extraordinary in measur]{.underline}e. With the closing of detention
centers and an avowal to indefinitely abandon Guantanamo as a method of
tackling (suspected) terrorists, the US invariably took a step back from
one of its methods in the WoT. Here, two competing, but [equally useful
logics are at play and serve to frame the use of drones and TK as
extraordinary means.]{.underline} First, viewing the use of detention
and rehabilitation centers, not to mention the use of interrogation
(whether in extreme forms or not) as an expression of normal politics,
we can rightfully claim that this measure (undertaking predominantly by
the US) was considerably ineffective in dealing with international
terrorism for a number of clear reasons that center, at least in part,
on: (a) The difficulty of capturing known and suspected terrorist abroad
(b) Mitigating the efforts of those within prisons to radicalize anyone
not fully dedicated to the cause of terrorism in the name of AQ or other
groups or networks (c) The impossibility of guaranteeing that those
released will not endow the existential threat by committing or
re-committing themselves to terrorism's violent cause. Stepping from the
first logic considered we might consider this proposition in different
light. If the practice of irregular rendition and detainment in such
detention and interrogation centers as Guantanamo is taken as one of
many extraordinary measures enacted in the fight against terrorism but
that has come under increasing fire from domestic and international
public spheres, there existed a need to step back from practice that can
no longer be officially condoned and to fill the void with another
measure capable of engaging with the threat. The rationale presented
here is that while the acceptance of a certain degree of encroachment on
civil, liberal, and human rights might occur, the continuity of any
single measure that does so cannot necessarily be guaranteed or
continued ad infinitum. [Using drones as a part of the US' evolving and
expanding TK program (Obama's "Kill-Not-Capture" program]{.underline})
(McCrisken 2011) was [ideal for taking the place of irregular rendition
and exchanging one set of legal challenges with another]{.underline} --
one that might be easier to deal with. [Retracting from]{.underline} a
program of [irregular rendition and the use of extreme forms of
interrogation]{.underline} that have become the focus of intense legal
debate might even serve to shrink the political, military, and social
gap that lies between states and the WoT. The [prospect of achieving
this and subsequently renders the identity of the WoT far more likely to
be **deeply internalized** and become more stable as a
result]{.underline} (Lasmar 2010). The effectiveness of the US' TK
program remains a topic of immense debate. Previously, it was noted that
the use of [drones has been dragged into the security domain and
reasonably tagged as an extraordinary measure given the level of public
outcry and criticism attached to it]{.underline}. In hindsight it seems
that it might have only been a matter of time before those who actually
employ the tactic begin to question its viability for future
counterterrorism efforts. It is suggested here that [drone warfare
has]{.underline} not [only become a **concrete part** of the Bush
administration's 2001 **securitization of terrorism** and an iconic
feature of the WoT, but TK as an extraordinary measure has by its direct
effects and impact cultivated an understanding that it has come to
represent a threat to toward the very objectives that it seeks to
achieve. The drone program has undoubtedly given the US political and
military leadership the mindset of having the strategic
initiative]{.underline} -- the [ability to choose where and when to
attack **without constraint**]{.underline}. Director of the Center for
Peace and Security Studies at Georgetown University's School of Foreign
Service Daniel Byman has noted on multiple occasions that the use of
[drone technology]{.underline} has [enabled the US]{.underline} to more
[accurately strike at terrorists]{.underline} as opposed to conventional
weaponry at the US' disposal (Lafontant, 2013). The marked different
between AQ and like-terrorist groups' offensive capabilities prior to
9/11 and after the establishment of the WoT can be attributed, suggests
Byman, to the employment of drone warfare. They are relegated to a
defensive position rather than being poised to strike wherever and
whenever they like (Lafontant, 2013). Former-Director of the [Central
Intelligence Agency]{.underline} (CIA) Leon Panetta, during the first
year of Obama's presidency stated bluntly that, it's \[[drone
warfare]{.underline}\] the [only game in town in terms of confronting or
trying to disrupt the al-Qaeda leadership]{.underline}," and noted that
AQ leaders no longer regard the tribal regions of Pakistan as "neither
safe nor a haven" (Cable News Network \[CNN\] Politics, 2009). David
Kilcullen reported to a congressional hearing in 2009: \[s\]ince 2006,
we've killed 14 senior al-Qaeda leaders using drone strikes; in the same
time period, we've killed 700 Pakistani civilians in the same area. The
drone strikes are highly unpopular. They are deeply aggravating to the
population. And they've given rise to a feeling of anger that coalesces
the population around the extremists and leads to spikes of extremism
(McManus 2009). Although the claim is often made that [the drone
strikes]{.underline} are having a significant impact on the
operationality of AQ and present a clear practical effectiveness, their
use [compromises the ability of the US and its allies in the WoT to gain
valuable intelligence information from the eliminated
target]{.underline}. Despite his support for the use of drones in the
fight against terrorism, Byman (2009) reported a darker reality related
to drone warfare that has raised concern regarding the idea that [drones
now pose a threat the US achieving its own objectives in the
WoT]{.underline}, noting that, "\[e\]ven when they are effective, [TK
can create strategic complications. They create martyrs that help a
group sell itself to its own community]{.underline}" (Byman 2009, 100).
To build on the previous point: \[a\]fter an arrest, security forces can
interrogate the suspect and learn about future plots and additional
operatives, who can then be arrested too. Killing suspects prevents them
from striking, but dead men also tell no tales (Byman 2009, 98-9).
[Collateral damage in these drone strikes also cultivates an environment
where the indigenous civilian community will enlist or engage favourably
with the targeted insurgents.]{.underline} An [insurgency requires the
indigenous populace's "sympathy, acquiescence, silence, reaction to
provocation, or fully active support" (Kilcullen 2010, 8). The
collateral damage incurred by the drone strikes in Pakistan has become a
relentlessly reoccurring issue]{.underline} between the American and
Pakistani governments and has damaged bi-lateral relations. After
numerous drone strikes, there have been protests with hundreds of
protesters burning American flags and holding signs displaying
anti-American slogans (Williams 2010, 872). Although the debate on
whether anti- American sentiment is heavily instigated by the
(collateral) damage incurred by the strikes continues, but there is a
correlation to numerous temporary spikes in anti- Americanism.
Anti-American sentiment in Yemen has been fuelled by the US drone strike
program (Al-Haj & Batrawy 2012). The [debate regarding the efficacy of
the use of drones given the negative impact it might have within the WoT
even in spite of its positive impact raises a certain set of assumption
regarding, not that it can reasonably be considered an extraordinary
measure but rather to what extent has it become too extraordinary a
measure in the securitization of international terrorism]{.underline} by
the Bush administration. Rather than being considered purely a response
or a security action set-up in the defense of the reference object in
the face of an existential threat, it [might well be taken as a sort of
threat in and of itself. The view, while shown to exist within the US
among political elites, has become overtly evident given **widespread
opposition**]{.underline} that has formed in multiple societies beyond
the US, including those Western liberal democracies that they are used
to defend. The [secrecy of the drone program also creates a situation
where it is **difficult for the WoT to be desecuritized** by the
majority of the American population]{.underline}. States are permitted
to securitize an issue through the consent of the population, even
though the [securitization message is controlled by in large by the
government through the media]{.underline}. Five years after the 9/11
attacks with American forces deployed both in Afghanistan and Iraq, only
three percent of Americans believed that that terrorists were a great
threat to the US (Bobbitt 2008, 7). There is hubris in American
mentality when it comes to the drone strike program (Gardner 2013,
212-34). There are a [couple of factors that are instrumental in
maintaining this hubris. With the drone program, no American lives are
directly at stake by being in a hostile theater of operations as the
drone pilots are hundreds (even thousands) of miles away]{.underline}.
Therefore, there is a [**lack of domestic protests** to bring the troops
back home as they are at home or at safe operational bases]{.underline}.
A second factor is that there is a general lack of widely distributed
reports and images of the collateral damage incurred by the drone
strikes in the Western media. This is in stark contrast of the
desecuritization, (i.e., protest and opposition) movements in the
Vietnam and Second Gulf Wars. The drone strike program not only allows
for the strategic initiative to strike whenever and wherever deemed
necessary, but also severely reduces the conversation within American
discourse.

proposed a plan to counter Iran\'s drone program, on Tuesday. Democrat
Gregory Meeks, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
Republican Michael McCaul, Democrat Ted Deutch, and Republican Joe
Wilson have introduced a bill called the Stop Iranian Drones Act (SIDA)
in coordination with existing US sanctions against Iran\'s weapons
program, also including the supply, sale or transfer of UAVs. The
[[drafters of the anti-Iranian plan said]{.mark} [the]{.mark} purpose of
the Stop Iranian Drones Act ([SIDA]{.mark}) was to [prevent]{.mark} [the
Islamic Republic]{.mark} and its resistance forces [from accessing
drones]{.mark} that could be used to attack the United States or its
allies]{.underline}. Gregory [[Meeks also claimed; Iranian deadly drones
endanger]{.mark} US security and [regional peace]{.mark}]{.underline}!
He also said that the recent attacks by Iranian drones on US forces,
merchant ships and against regional partners, along with the export of
drone technology to areas where there is conflict, is a serious threat.
Noting that the \"Stop Iranian Drones Act (SIDA)\" is in line with
current US sanctions law, Gregory Meeks said the plan sends a strong
message to the international community that the United States will not
tolerate government support for Iran\'s drone program. In this regard, a
few months ago, in early April of this year, General \"Kenneth F.
McKenzie\", the commander of American terrorists based in West Asia
known as CENTCOM, said in a written testimony to the Armed Forces
Committee of the US House of Representatives: \"Iranian-backed Houthis
in Yemen have targeted military, infrastructure and civilian targets in
Saudi Arabia since January with more than 150 missiles and drone
strikes[.\" [McKenzie warned]{.mark} that I[ran\'s]{.mark} widespread
[use of]{.mark} small and medium-sized [drones]{.mark} for
reconnaissance and attack operations [meant]{.mark} that for the first
time since the Korean War, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates had [lost
its air superiority]{.mark} for operations in the region. \"Unless we
can find a network to detect and defeat this superiority of drone use,
Iran will remain aggressive in the region,\"]{.underline} the CENTCOM
terrorist commander said. Simultaneously with these hostile atmospheres,
the military and [political figures of the Zionist regime also talked
about the drone capability of Iran, together with the American
officials, in order to provide security]{.underline}. Israeli War
Minister Benny Gantz recently spoke of the dangers of Iranian drones for
the security of the West Asian region and the world, and called on
Westerners to take joint action to impose restrictions on Iran\'s drone
industry. [[The US]{.mark} Treasury Department also [sanctioned four
Iranian citizens]{.mark}, including the commander of IRGC\'s aerospace
unit, along with two other Iranian companies, f[or collaborating with
the Iranian drone project]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [It seems
that,]{.underline} contrary to the apparent statements of US officials
that they are trying to reduce tensions between Tehran and Washington,
[[they are working]{.mark} with some European countries, especially
Britain, to try [to reopen new security cases against Iran to justify
the extension]{.mark} of a series [of]{.mark} current [unjust]{.mark}
[sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} or even its escalation, is in
contradiction with Washington\'s claims. [The [Americans have
shown]{.mark} that [they have no real interest in ending their
issues]{.mark} and conflicts [with Iran]{.mark}. [The US\'s main
strategy is to engage Iran in an endless cycle of]{.mark} security
cases, [extensive sanctions]{.mark} [and endless negotiations]{.mark} in
order to contain Iran at the lowest cost in the region, on its
consideration]{.underline}. General Mckenzie\'s remarks about the
imbalance in the region and the inability of the US military to take
full control of the entire West Asian sky due to the breadth and
complexity of Iran\'s drone capability are clear signs of a shift in
equations in the region. Saudi Arabia\'s widespread failure in the
Yemeni war and the defeat of the naval war project against Iran, which
included US-British piracy and Israeli attacks on Iranian-owned and
private-sector oil tankers and merchant ships, are all signs of Iran\'s
widespread retaliation. In this regard, the United States and its allies
are announcing a shift in the security balance in the West Asian region.
But can the Americans succeed on the Iranian drone issue? [In the
current situation, as a first step, as in previous projects aimed at
securitization of Iran\'s environment, the language of panic and the
media and speech apparatus of American, European and Zionist politicians
are working, to gradually raise the issue of Iran\'s drone capability in
a legal process as a threat]{.underline}, introducing it as an acute for
regional and world stability. It should be noted that, unlike the
nuclear issue, we do not face a global disarmament regimes with a global
consensus or, like the missile issue, a control regime agreed upon by
some major powers in the form of the MTCR. The issue of UAVs as a
military tool in the context of arms control is a completely new case,
about which there is still little legal literature, and Westerners are
trying to establish a legal procedure by intimidating the world against
Iran\'s UAV capability[. In the last two decades, drones have been used
more as a military tool in the West Asian region]{.underline}, and in
recent years Turkey, Pakistan and the Zionist regime have begun to
expand their drone industry, in addition to Iran. Given this, although
the Americans can not provoke a global consensus against Tehran on
Iran\'s drone capability, such as the nuclear issue, or bring some
Western countries with them, such as the missile issue, they are trying
to maintain the status quo on Iran\'s security case as an option to take
advantage of it. The US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the inability of
its Arab partners to successfully end the Yemeni war, and the failure of
the naval war project with Iran are all signs of a shift in the security
equation in the West Asian region. [The Islamic Republic of [Iran has
repeatedly stated that its military equipment is manufactured entirely
for deterrence and]{.mark} for purely [defensive purposes]{.mark}, and
that foreign military intervention in the last two decades on the
borders of Iran with Afghanistan and Iraq is a sign of Tehran\'s right
defense strategy that is neither negotiable nor will it involve
disarmament]{.underline}.

### 2NC\-\--Economy

#### Attempting to save the economy is a justification for securitization and retaliation which results in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

**Bulman 2021** (David Bulman, Assistant professor of China Studies and
International affairs at the John Hopkins School of China Studies and
International Affairs," The Economic Security Dilemma in US-China
Relations" <https://muse.jhu.edu/article/787893/pdf>) //sethlee

[China and the **[United States are caught in an economic security
dilemma]{.mark}**. In response to perceived economic aggression, both
[countries now feel impelled to bolster domestic economic security
through]{.mark} protectionist and [retaliatory
measures]{.mark}]{.underline} that the other side perceives as
threatening. In game theoretic terms, a mutually beneficial "Stag Hunt"
coordination game devolved into an uncooperative "Prisoner's Dilemma"
after the global financial crisis. [[**In the economic security
dilemma** that emerged under Trump]{.mark} and Xi, [both sides
unsuccessfully attempted to coerce]{.mark} opponent behavior, further
**[harming both economies]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Using a game
framework---as opposed to a structural or leadership-based
account---[helps demonstrate that [China's]{.mark} recent reform
reversal and **[revisionist approaches]{.mark}** to the international
economic order [were not unavoidable]{.mark} parts of a long-term
strategy[, but rather developed]{.mark} partially **[as a response to
perceived US aggressions.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Two contrasting
narratives now define the economic relationship between the United
States and China. [[US policymakers perceive China as]{.mark} a
revisionist economic power [using "]{.mark}state-driven protectionist
[policies]{.mark} and practices" [to threaten US economic
vitality]{.mark}]{.underline} (White House 2020). [[Chinese policymakers
in turn argue that the United States will]{.mark} "do everything in its
power to use [bully]{.mark}ing measures" to prevent [China]{.mark}'s
rise]{.underline} and keep China from accessing key technologies, thus
requiring a strong state sector to support technological self-reliance
(Wang 2019; Wang and Xin 2018). [The evolution of these contrasting
[narratives reflects an economic security dilemma]{.mark}: In response
to perceived economic aggression, both countries now feel impelled to
bolster domestic economic security through protectionist and retaliatory
measures that are in turn perceived as threatening by the other
side.]{.underline} The resulting downward ited degree, financial
fronts[, significantly harming both economies.]{.underline} In game
theoretic terms, a mutually beneficial "Stag Hunt" coordination game
prior to the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) devolved into an
uncooperative "Prisoner's Dilemma" over 2009--2016, in part due to
growing misperceptions and faulty assumptions regarding domestic
economic security. By the time of Donald Trump's election, both sides
thought the game had switched to "Chicken" and sought to force the other
side to swerve. The actual payoff matrices still reflected a Prisoner's
Dilemma, however. [[Misidentification]{.mark} of the game [led to
coercive threats rather than attempts at reassurance,]{.mark} ensuring a
further downward spiral]{.underline}. This game-theoretic framework
helps interpret changes in US-China economic relations over the past
three decades, enabling an understanding of the emergence of current
economic tensions more nuanced than structural or leadership-based
approaches. [According to structural arguments, economic conflict is
part of an unavoidable zero-sum great power conflict]{.underline}
(Allison 2017; Walt 2018; Jin 2015; Li J. 2019)[. In contrast,
leadership approaches blame economic tensions on Xi Jinping's economic
reform reversals, external aggression, and domestic repression, which
necessitated a US response]{.underline} (e.g., Economy 2018), [or Donald
Trump's]{.underline} (avoidable) [decision to instigate a trade war in
2018]{.underline} (e.g., Yang 2016). These frameworks explain part of
the story: great power competition has become more prominent, with
direct consequences for the economic relationship, and Xi and Trump
indeed made choices that Li Keqiang and Hillary Clinton may not ha[ve.
But structural arguments imply an inevitably that seems misjudged, and
[leadership]{.mark} accounts often [underestimate or ignore the
structural dimensions]{.mark} that constrain and inform leader
decisions. [A dynamic]{.mark} game [framework is a more fruitful way of
understanding developments,]{.mark} combining aspects of both of these
frameworks]{.underline}: Structure and structural shifts help set payoff
matrices, and leaders choose how to play the game given their own
perceptions and the existing payoff distributions.

### 2NC\-\--Environment

**Securitization of the environment has become a central aspect of [US
foreign and defense policy]{.underline} \-\-- NATO's statements prove it
considers the environment a security risk that can lead to violence**

Peter **Hough 22**, Associate Professor in International Politics at
Middlesex University with a PhD in International Relations from City
University in London, 06/09/2022, "Ecological Security" (book chapter in
*Rethinking Security in the Twenty-First Century: A Reader*), Middlesex
University Research Repository, p. 183-194 /lg

Many [states have come to take a widened approach to security since the
1990s]{.underline} and the resource wars literature was particularly
influential on the Clinton Administration in the U.S. HomerDixon is
known to have been invited to brief Vice President Al Gore and the State
Department on several occasions in the early 1990s.13 In 1993, [a new
government [position in]{.mark} the [Defense Department was created
with]{.mark} the [Deputy Under Secretary for Environmental Security, and
the Environmental Task Force set up as part of]{.mark} Washington's
[intelligence network]{.mark}. The [impact]{.mark} of all of this [was
made explicit in]{.mark} the 1994's "National Security Strategy," the
[US]{.mark}'s annual [foreign policy manifesto]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

[[Not all security risks are military]{.mark} in nature. Transnational
phenomena such as]{.underline} terrorism, narcotics trafficking,
[[environmental degradation]{.underline}]{.mark}, rapid population
growth and refugee flows also [[have security implications]{.mark} for
both present and long term American policy]{.underline}.14

[Other instances of governments making the environment the stuff of high
politics have since emerged in North America and North
Europe]{.underline}, most notably in several defense and foreign policy
statements from Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, and the UK.15 In 2007,
Foreign Minister Margaret Beckett used the UK's presidency of the UN
Security Council to push through, with some resistance from other
members, the first discussion in that arena of on an overtly
environmental topic. A major influence on this stance was the Stern
Report of the previous year compiled by a British economist on behalf of
the UK government, which provided an economic security rationale for
prioritizing action on climate change. Stern calculated the cost of
non-action on climate change as amounting to at the very least 5 percent
of global GDP for evermore. Set against this, the costs of effective
action to curb climate change would cost around 1 percent of global GDP
per year.16 Perhaps, though[, the **[clearest illustration]{.mark}** of
the [environment becoming the stuff of widened security]{.mark} [comes
from]{.mark} its embrace by the cold warriors of
[NATO]{.mark}:]{.underline}

Based on a broad definition of security that recognizes the importance
of political, economic, social and environmental factors, [[**NATO is
addressing security challenges emanating from the environment**. This
includes extreme weather conditions, depletion of natural resources,
pollution and]{.mark} so on---[factors that can ultimately lead to
disasters**, regional tensions and violence**]{.mark}.]{.underline}17

[[As]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} statement [indicates, securitizing
environmental issues]{.mark} in practice [has tended to be]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the [traditional national security manner of factoring such
concerns into]{.mark} calculations of [defense
needs]{.mark}.]{.underline} Many governments have politicized issues of
environmental change when there is no obvious military dimension, even
trumping anthropocentric interests for eco-centric reasons (such as in
the restriction of polluting organochlorine pesticides like DDT) but few
have "securitized" them and treated them as matters of urgent political
priority. An exception is the low-lying states threatened with literal
extinction under the waves of the rising oceans. Following the Security
Council discussion of climate change two years earlier, the UN General
Assembly in 2009 took up this theme with a resolution drafted by the
government of low-lying Nauru called Climate Change and its Possible
Security Implications (A64/350), calling on all UN agencies to
prioritize climate change. While the resolution was unanimously adopted,
Nauru---and other similarly threatened island states like Tuvalu, the
Maldives---are amongst the smallest of small fry in the international
political system and few of the "big fish" have prioritized climate
change to the point of seriously compromising their short-term economic
interests.

**Descriptions of the environment as posing existential threats stem
from [state-centered imaginaries]{.underline} \-\-- even academic
research fuels the narrative**

Geographical Journal, Vol. 179, No. 4, p. 294-297 /lg

[[Threats to and from 'the environment' inform geographical depictions
of danger with **wide- spread reach in** ]{.mark}political and
**[policy]{.mark}** circles]{.underline}. While these fears are partly
replaying past neo- Malthusian concerns about limits to growth[, they
are also [associated with]{.mark} a distinct [millennialist]{.mark}
[anxiety about]{.mark} the [lethality made possible by collapsing
conditions of life]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [\'Dangerous climate change\'
is at the forefront]{.underline}]{.mark} of these apocalyptic
imaginaries, [[but existential threats are seen]{.mark} to issue also
[from biodiversity]{.mark} extinction, [fossil fuel depletion
and]{.mark} endemic [water shortages]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dalby 2009;
Swyngedouw 2010). The [[\'securitisation\' of environmental
processes]{.mark} is]{.underline} at once both a consequence and
[**[driver of]{.mark}** such **[apocalyptic
concerns]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and this discursive framing is
intuitively straightforward for those who argue that it justifies
urgent, even emergency, measures to prevent or miti- gate serious
dangers. Security here denotes that which is evoked or invoked when
acting to protect core institutions or freedoms in the face of serious
ecologi- cal threats. This is the dominant notion of environ- mental
security questioned by contributors to this themed section.

From a geographical perspective, environmental security straddles
uneasily across a territorial/post- territorial axis, where tensions are
immediately appar- ent between competing spatial performances of
security. This expresses contrasting claims over the political
subjectivity being secured. It is not surprising that [[state actors
have invoked environmental security]{.mark} practices and [discourses
according to territorial doctrines of national security, whereby]{.mark}
[environmental risks supplement traditional threats to the
state]{.mark}. Thus, [\'climate security\', \'biosecurity\' and \'energy
security\' are employed to refer to the protection of state
interests]{.mark}]{.underline} with regard to the projected and
perceived con- sequences of environmental change, biotechnologies and
fossil fuels scarcity. [[Numerous **think-tank and academic
publications** have]{.mark} [fed these state-centred imaginaries of
environmental danger]{.mark} on the basis of disputed natural and social
scientific scenarios]{.underline} (e.g. Klare 2008; Brown and Crawford
2009; Chellaney 2011). In apparent opposition to statist
representa-tions of security are non-territorial notions of \'human
security\', which profess a universal concern for the protection of
individuals or groups from serious threats to wellbeing[. [Constructions
of human security have identified environmental dangers as potential
threats to human welfare]{.mark}]{.underline}; for example, \'water
secu- rity\' and \'food security\' mark out areas of practical
application for international development and humanitarian organisations
(Matthew et al. 2010; Cook and Bakker 2012).

### 2NC\-\--Failed States

#### Discourse of failed states is merely a pretext to legitimize imperialism\-\--it conflates being a failure with anything different from the classic European states

\-\--Somalia is a good example for failed states debates

Aleksandar **Pašagić 20**, Aleksandar Pašagić holds an MA in
International Security & works as a Chief Security Officer in the
private sector, "Failed States and Terrorism: Justifiability of
Transnational Interventions from a Counterterrorism Perspective,"
Perspective on Terrorism, Volume 14, Issue 3, p23-25 \\\\pairie

Failed States, Counterterrorism and Interventionism

[As securitization of states labeled as failed takes place in politics
and the media, an increasing number of authors question not only the
underlying assumptions, many of which have already been demonstrated as
problematic, but also the political motives of those doing the labeling.
A major critique aimed at using the failed state label is that it
**conflates being a failure and merely being different from** what is
envisaged as an ideal---"**the classic European
state**]{.underline}."\[64\] This view of what states should look and
function like is supported by what Verhoeven calls "the Orthodox Failed
States Narrative"---the idea that failed states present an unwanted
by-product of globalization and an obstacle in the path of the liberal
democratic order working towards global peace. State failure diagnosis
is generally based on a Realist framework: the state is about power, and
failure is the lack of power to exert control, be it over territory,
population or instruments of coercion.\[65\] Non-standard states make
the international system uncomfortable, as it does not know how to deal
with such entities.\[66\] [The failed state label, and the sometimes
occurring term "collapsed state" even more so, seem to suggest that the
phenomenon in question is of local origin; it implicitly assumes that
there is no blame to be assigned to external actors]{.underline}.\[67\]
It also isolates the failed state and removes its decision-making
autonomy, rendering it dependent on "functioning" states,\[68\] thereby
providing a level of credibility to an outside intervention as a
potential remedy.

Examples of Afghanistan and Somalia are sometimes used to illustrate the
flexibility with which the failed state label is applied, as well as
potential implications. Ever since the 2001 attacks on the United
States, Afghanistan has played a central role in the War on
Terrorism---failed state discourse.\[69\] Some authors consider
Afghanistan under the Taliban both a failed state and a threat to the
US, though admitting that it was a rarity as such.\[70\] However, others
question exactly to what extent that held true in practice, given that
the US government conducted business-related discussions with the
Taliban almost until the 2001 attacks.\[71\] This highlights the issue
of "failed" versus "different" states, and brings to the fore the idea
that the use of the failed state label may in fact be primarily based on
whether the state in question is perceived as a threat to Western
security and interests.\[72\] In [Somalia, the failed state rhetoric
"became actionable" with the emergence of a unifying Islamic force, the
Union of Islamic Courts, an actor that in fact made some progress
towards establishing order. Yet it has been suggested that, because the
emerging order in Somalia resembled Afghanistan under the Taliban in the
eyes of the US, its status was elevated to that of a threat to
international security]{.underline}.\[73\]

When presented as an international security threat, failed states are
usually mentioned as potential breeding grounds or sanctuaries for
transnational terrorist organizations. If [such reasoning is accepted by
the public, a specific failed state (or failed states in general) can be
**securitized to the point where an intervention**, including a
preventative one, is perceived as a **legitimate act of
self-defense**.\[]{.underline}74\] This is made easier by the fact that
the War on Terror is already securitized by the media.\[75\] The threat
of terrorism can be used to securitize the concept of state failure,
which can then be applied to states deviating from the expected
standard, effectively providing the tool for instant securitization, as
the securitizing agent is spared from having to make the "failure as a
security threat" move for every particular instance of state failure.
This is additionally facilitated by the broadness of the failure concept
that allows for a very arbitrary application. As the failed
states---terrorism connection becomes more intuitively accepted by the
broader public, it becomes possible to expand the range of potential
candidates for intervention to entire regions, even continents;
[Abrahamsen argues that the entire continent of Africa is becoming
increasingly securitized in Western political speech.\[76\] Many
post-colonial states]{.underline} have always fit the broad definition
of failure: their governments were never fully in control of their
territory, had no monopoly on violence, they have failed to provide
economic security for their citizens and sometimes threatened the
security of neighboring countries, but [were not labelled as failed
until it suited the international community]{.underline}.\[77\] Such
examples make it difficult not to raise the question whether the
application of a [failed state label is sometimes **merely a pretext to
generate support for foreign interventions**]{.underline}.\[78\]

The majority of fatalities and injuries from acts of terrorism are not a
result of transnational terrorist operations carried out by actors
arriving from failed states\[79\]---it is states of origin that suffer
most. In 2013 Iraq accounted for 35.4% of all deaths by terrorism in
that year, followed by Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria, for a
cumulative total of 82% or 14,722 lives in that year.\[80\] For
comparison, over the same time period the total number of fatalities due
to acts of terrorism in the European Union was seven.\[81\] Much of the
terrorism in weak states remains confined to their territory and is
perpetrated by organizations motivated by grievances of local origin,
such as FARC in Colombia.\[82\] Additionally, international terrorists
do not come predominantly or even significantly from failed
states,\[83\] and it should be noted that recent developments have
turned the threat of transnational terrorism around---Western countries
exported more terrorists to Syria and Iraq than vice versa.\[84\] This
also can be framed as a threat with roots in the failed states
themselves: it is the failed state that is the source of radicalization
aimed at citizens of more stable countries, providing them with skills
and experience that could at a later time be used against their country
of origin. Therefore, it could be argued that, once successfully
securitized, failed states can be shown as threatening instead of being
threatened even in situations when the direction of terrorism flow is
clearly reversed.

Conclusion

Due caution should be exercised when presenting either counterterrorism
as an additional benefit of statebuilding or the inverse in an attempt
to garner additional support for an intervention into a state labeled as
failed. As discussed, counterterrorism and state-building do not
necessarily go hand in hand, and the optimal effort to achieve one
objective might quite possibly be to the detriment of the other. Placing
countries in the context of experiencing failure as a terrorism risk
does little to contribute to the solving of their development problems,
and may make their situation worse for a number of reasons, not least of
which is providing external and internal actors with access to means
normally considered unacceptable.\[85\] The securitized status of failed
states leaves them vulnerable not only to presumably well-intentioned
international interventions gone wrong but, [as was the case with
Somalia, to exploitation of that status by their immediate neighbors:
Ethiopia used the situation in Somalia to gain support for military
intervention and accompanying actions that did little to make Somalia a
more secure or stable state]{.underline}.\[86\]

"The American Empire is Playing a Dangerous Game with its Nuclear
Weapons Arsenal"
<https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-american-empire-is-playing-a-dangerous-game-with-its-nuclear-weapons-arsenal/5539076/ekc>

[The American Empire is playing a dangerous game]{.underline} with its
nuclear weapons arsenal. [The US-NATO and Israel alliance has declared
directly and indirectly that Russia, China, North Korea and Iran are a
threat to world peace and security.]{.underline}

Let's be clear on who is [the real threat to world peace]{.underline}
and it is not the countries I just mentioned, [it is Washington's
geopolitical ambitions]{.underline} to bring its enemies under their
sphere of control. Washington's geopolitical moves are [antagonizing its
enemies which can ignite a catastrophic world war]{.underline} that can
go to nuclear at a moment's notice. The threat of a nuclear war is at
almost the same level of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, but if you
listen to the main-stream media (MSM) you may never know what is really
going on concerning world events.

The first woman and U.S. Democratic presidential nominee [Hillary
Clinton has threatened Iran with nuclear strikes]{.underline} while
Israel maintains its own nuclear weapons arsenal which is also a threat
to its neighbors in the Middle East, especially Iran.

[Washington is placing NATO troops and Missile Defense Systems close to
Russia's borders]{.underline} and giving the [U.S. Navy the green light
to a possible confrontation with China's naval fleet]{.underline} in the
South China Sea[. Washington's bellicose actions are indeed
provocativ]{.underline}e. As I mentioned in a 2013 article 'Hawaii: 120
Years of US Occupation: Militarism and "America's Pacific Century'
Hillary Clinton who was Secretary of State at the time wrote an article
in 2011 titled 'America's Pacific Century' for Foreign Policy Magazine
where she defined what the U.S. role would be in the Pacific region:

Strategically, maintaining peace and security across the Asia-Pacific is
increasingly crucial to global progress, whether through defending
freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, countering the
proliferation efforts of North Korea, or ensuring transparency in the
military activities of the region's key players

[America's strategy in the South China Sea is to isolate China at all
costs while empowering their vassal states in the region with political,
economic and military support]{.underline}. According to a July 12th
article by The Guardian, China has rejected a ruling by an international
tribunal in The Hague which claims that the Philippines has legal rights
in the South China Sea "over strategic reefs and atolls that Beijing
claims would give it control over disputed waters of the South China
Sea."

[The ruling is a moral justification for the U.S. Navy to patrol the
South China Sea while advancing Washington's strategic
goals]{.underline}. First it allows Washington to block any trade or
cooperation agreements between China and its neighboring countries which
can leave Western business interests out of the loop which is why the
Obama regime continues to push the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement
(TPP) [which gives US corporations unlimited power in the
region]{.underline}. The TPP is one of the agreements under Obama's
"Asian Pivot" that puts corporate power over government's who sign on to
the TPP. Under the TPP, laws that protected the working-class people and
labor unions before their governments sign on to the TPP would be
diminished.

The agreement will also end regulations that effect health, safety and
environmental standards and the list goes on. Corporations like Monsanto
would become a major benefactor in agriculture sector throughout the
entire region. Second[, it gives Washington an excuse to remain in the
South China Sea to protect its corporate interests and its allies from
the "China Threat"]{.underline} following the objective of
"Full-Spectrum Dominance" in the Asia-Pacific region.

Washington's [propaganda campaign against China reinstates the
willingness and insanity of provoking a war against a nation who has a
relatively strong military force]{.underline} of over 2.3 million troops
on land, sea and air including its own nuclear arsenal. Not to mention
China is America's creditor which means in short "don't bite the hands
that feeds you!" Washington's [aggressive foreign policy stance has
accelerated]{.underline} since Obama got into the White House.

The Obama administration (and a possible Hillary Clinton presidency to
follow) is also risking a possible conflict with Russia. In the
Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton said that "I'm proud to
stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from
Russia" following the same path as her "Neocon" supporters. Clinton's
speech shows what she will most likely do in Washington and that is to
risk countless lives to further advance U.S. strategic goals.

[The elites or the "Armchair Warriors]{.underline}" (because they
instigate war from the comfort of their mansions where they throw
costume parties wearing animal heads or from their offices in the White
House, Downing Street, Tel Aviv and the Pentagon) do not in any way
fight wars themselves, but [support and even lobby for war that benefits
the Military-Industrial Complex.]{.underline} We can also call them
"Chicken Hawks" which are those who support and advocate for war as many
do in Washington, but avoid any form of military service or draft (Bill

the [Washington-backed NATO troops are pawns of unwinnable]{.underline}
wars that can escalate into a thermo-nuclear war between the U.S. and
Russia.

From Banking to GMO's: The Armchair Warriors want Humanity under their
Control

[The armchair warriors advocate for economic policies that essentially
enslave humanity with their banking institutions]{.underline} such as
Goldman Sachs, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the International Bank for
International Settlements (BIS), JP Morgan Chase, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Goldman Sachs is one of the
financial institutions that managed to steer the world into debt
peonage. [Jose Manuel Barroso was an EU bureaucrat and President of the
European Commission was just hired by Goldman Sachs is a prime example
of the revolving doors between government and corporations.]{.underline}

Why are we as human beings subjected to this madness and despair so that
the top 1% can control our natural resources and our lives? [Western
politicians, top-level military men]{.underline} (General Breedlove),
think tanks such as the Council of Foreign Relations (CFR) or the
Heritage Foundation, the Main-Stream Media (MSM) and [multinational
corporations are leading the world to destruction and
chao]{.underline}s. They [advocate the need to control humanity's
healthcare]{.underline} with their prescription drugs and vaccines that
hurt and [kill thousands of people annually]{.underline}. They advocate
for Genetically Modified foods (GMO's) and support corporations such as
Monsanto who are producing the unhealthiest foods for public
consumption. GMO foods do lead to future health problems which do
guarantee permanent patients so that Pharmaceutical corporations can
continue to earn profits from their "legal" drugs. A monopoly made in
Washington.

The West will Suffer Major Consequences of a Nuclear War

Russia and China are prepared for any confrontation with the United
States if any peace agreement were to fail (obviously, Washington does
not want peace). Russia will not hesitate to retaliate if Washington and
its NATO patsies were foolish enough to launch a pre-emptive strike on
Russian soil committing the world to a nuclear war. China recently
announced that preparations are underway for any possible confrontation
with the U.S. and any of its allies in The Global Times; a
Chinese-government source clearly states what is at stake concerning
U.S. maneuvers in the South China Sea:

China should speed up building its military capabilities of strategic
deterrence. Even though China cannot keep up with the US militarily in
the short-term, it should be able to let the US pay a cost it cannot
stand if it intervenes in the South China Sea dispute by force. [China
is a peace-loving country and deals with foreign relations with
discretion, but it won't flinch if the US and its small clique keep
encroaching on its interests on its doorstep.]{.underline} [China hopes
disputes can be resolved by talks, but it must be prepared for any
military confrontation. This is common sense in international
relations.]{.underline}

[Washington is also placing NATO Missile Defense Systems in Europe that
threatens Russia.]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir Putin faced
off with Journalists in the Saint Petersburg International Economic
Forum on June 17th and said the following in regards to a possible war
with the West:

[The "Iranian Threat" does not exist but the NATO Missile Defense System
is being positioned in Europe]{.underline}. That means we were right
when we said that t[heir reasons are not genuine, they were not being
open with us. Always referring to the "Iranian Threat" in order to
justify this system]{.underline}, once again they lied to us, [now the
system is functioning and being loaded with missiles]{.underline}. As
you (Journalists) should know these missiles are put into capsules,
which are used in the Tomahawk long range missile system.

So, these are being loaded with missiles that can penetrate territories
within a 500km range, but we know that technologies advance, and we even
know in which year the U.S. will accomplish the next missile...this
missile will be able to penetrate distances of up to 1000km, and then
even further... And from that moment on, they will start to directly
threaten Russia's nuclear potential.

We know year by year what's going to happen, and they know that we know.
It's only you that they tell tall tales to, and you buy it, and spread
it to the citizens of your countries. You people in turn do not feel a
sense of the impending danger --- this is what worries me.

"How do you not understand that the world is being pulled in an
irreversible direction? While they pretend that nothing is going on. I
don't know how to get through to you anymore"

[Washington's insanity will for sure destroy Western civilization with
Europe taking the first nuclear strikes when Russia retaliates after a
U.S. led NATO str]{.underline}ike. Are the armchair warriors going to
the front lines to fight alongside US-NATO soldiers? Of course not
because they have their pawns in place that will be killed or seriously
maimed if a war or a nuclear war was to take place, but no worries
because they have the pharmaceutical drugs that will heal your life
crippling wounds. Not only is the Obama administration threatening
Russia's borders, Hillary Clinton has threatened Iran in the past with a
nuclear strike against any action they may take against Israel or
"violate" any terms within the nuclear deal between the P5 +1 (Russia,
China, France, the UK and the U.S. plus Germany) and Iran in 2015. Is a
nuclear war inevitable?

#### The desire to perpetuate the hegemonic identity seeks to construct false threats for the justification of retalitatory and pre-emptive action

[Rather than the rationalist approach to national security]{.underline},
we adopt a narrative approach to [unravelling the narrative process
whereby national threats are constructed]{.underline}. Having
encountered three successive national rivals since WWII, [the United
States has constructed three distinctive threat stories to safeguard its
hegemonic identity]{.underline}. The Soviet threat consists in the story
of two ideologically opposed rivals competing for world domination; the
Japan-bashing narrative tells a victimhood story stemming from Japan's
unfair competition. China threat stories, however, are now more complex,
conflating a story of US victimhood at the hands of China's unfair
competition, advocated by President Trump, [with a widely embedded but
malleable epic tale of power competition between a rising power and the
ruling power, and a new, 'deep state' defence community-propagated Cold
War script]{.underline}. All these threat stories [have framed what is
perceived and what should be done, but they are merely those from among
other alternative narratives that eventually gained a dominant position
at critical juncture]{.underline}s. These [so called national threats
are hence no more than narrative constructs]{.underline} in a self-other
manner of articulation rather than one of objective existence. Upon
examining the narrative templates of US threat stories, we find striking
differences among them. The Soviet threat spectrum ranges from the
ideological to the political and military domains, and economic
challenge is the focus of the Japan threat. But China represents the
full spectrum of threats that previously featured in both the Soviet
threat story and the Japan-bashing narrative. Upon zooming in, we
further find that an ideological conflict constitutes the main thread of
the Soviet threat storyline, but that the economic challenge of the
China threat outweighs the ideological and political ones. On the
political front, the Soviet Union's totalitarian dictatorship is the
polar opposite of liberal democracy, while China is often styled as an
authoritarian state---a far less antagonistic wording. As to military
threats, the Soviet threat is urgent and global, but the China threat is
only a rising and regional one. [To counter the economic challenge
emanating first from Japan and then from China, the United States
adopted different strategies to construct its victimhood
story]{.underline}, namely, coining new concepts for Japan, and cashing
in on stereotypes for China. In spite of the above-marked differences,
however, we can also clearly discern continuity in the United States'
national threat stories. This is reflected not only in [the United
States' consistently resorting to the victimhood narrative to counter
economic challenges]{.underline} from both Japan and China, and
unremittingly cashing in on its widely-shared mythologies and images
regarding the Self and Others to achieve resonance, but also, more
revealingly, in the underlying logic of US national threat-making. [The
United States will invariably adopt a zero-sum mindset in making a
diametrical self-other story for any country---be it a formidable power
with an antagonistic ideology like the Soviet Union, an ally like Japan,
or a rising peer competitor like China---that might threaten its
hegemonic identity]{.underline}. According to this logic, [the American
Self is always superior to Others, and articulating the threat
confirms]{.underline} its superiority. Not surprisingly, when Others,
like Japan or China, challenge its economic primacy, the United States,
rather than examining its own problems, will always blame such others
for playing an 'unfair game'. This paper also provides us with a vantage
point to appreciate the current debate on Sino--US relations. Clearly,
we are in the second half of the critical juncture wherein the question
is not whether the United States and China will compete with each other
but in which way the competition will unfold, for the bankruptcy of the
liberal international order discourse makes it unlikely to revert to
yesteryear's policy of engagement. As the three narrative threads of the
China threat stories all point to competition and conflict, and can be
self-fulfilling, we may witness increasing tensions between them.
Specifically, the Japan-bashing victimhood story can shed considerable
light on our understanding of Trump's China policy. We find that the
story [President Trump advocates to a large extent matches the
victimhood story that the revisionists concocted to deal with Japan in
the 1980s.]{.underline} Trump's [rhetoric regarding unfair trade and
industry targeting, slapping of trade tariffs amounting to blackmail on
both China and US allie]{.underline}s, results oriented approach to
trade negotiation, and the US high-tech stranglehold that curbs or bars
investment in the industry by US competitors can all be found in the
Japan threat story toolbox. Having pivoted China policy towards
conflict, however, there are few indications that Trump wants to act out
a Cold War script. In accordance with the storytelling logic, should
Trump retain his presidency in the coming election, the trade war will
probably not end in a 'fair' trade agreement until such time as the US
economy far outperforms China's, because US superiority entails
outperformance, failing which the blame must go on unfair play. That is
what happened to Japan, that is to say, successive rounds of sanctions
and negotiations until Japan drifted into the Lost Decade. China may,
moreover, face even greater US hostility to its high-tech industry and
investment, as happened in 1980s. These are issues that China's
political nature and growing military may further complicate. But it
should be noted that China is not Japan and will neither give in easily
as Japan did nor pose a solely economic challenge to the United States.

#### The attempt to return to the liberal order is harmful---the rhetoric functions as a continued driver for American primacy

Patrick **Porter,** **18**, is Chair in International Security and
Strategy at the University of Birmingham. He is a Fellow at the Royal
United Services Institute, "A World Imagined: Nostalgia and Liberal
Order," Cato Institute, Policy Analysis No. 843, June 5^th^

/ekc

According to a view popular in [Washington, D.C.,]{.underline} and other
capitals around the world, the United [States used its power and
idealism for more than 70 years to create a security and economic order
that transformed the world. This world order was liberal because the
United States was liberal]{.underline}. "Liberal" in this context means
the pursuit of security both through the spread of liberty, in the form
of free markets and democratic constitutions, and the rule of law, in
the form of rule‐​based international institutions. Today, defenders of
that order fear that President Trump and a set of regressive forces are
laying waste to it. They claim the consequences are grave: we are
witnessing the "end of the West as we know it,"1 the abandonment of
"global leadership" by its "long‐​time champion,"2 and a "coming Dark
Age."3 Foreign Affairs, the house organ of the foreign policy
establishment, recently asked 32 experts whether the "liberal order is
in peril." Most agreed it is, with 26 respondents registering a
confidence level of 7 out of 10.4 Alarmed by the political tumult of our
time, nostalgists recall the post‐​1945 moment of institution building
and benign internationalism and call for its reclamation.

They are, however, in the grip of a fiction. Liberalism and liberal
projects abounded in the past 70 years. [But the dream of a unitary,
integrated global system organized around liberalism is ahistorical. In
truth, the pre‐​Trump world was a more brutal and messy place than the
nostalgia allows]{.underline}. To be sure, there was liberalism, and it
did help define postwar international relations. Broadly speaking, the
post‐​1945 period was, on many measures, more prosperous, less violent,
and more collaborative than what came before. One defect of "liberal
order" nostalgia is that it exaggerates these qualities and simply
leaves out too many contrary historical realities. Other critics have
already noted the gap between nostalgia and history and that the postwar
world was never "whole." At times the liberal order was neither very
liberal nor very orderly. There may be "islands of liberal order, but
they are floating in a sea of something quite different."5

[Not only do nostalgists get the history wrong, they fail to confront
what "world ordering" actually entails. The main critique in this paper
is that the fetish for "liberal order" has obscured what is involved in
the process of "ordering" --- or attempting to order --- the
globe]{.underline}. [The United States, as the leading actor in the
orthodox narrative]{.underline}, emerges as a power that created order
through a benign internationalist vision, consensus building, and
institution creating. But the successes and failures of that order also
flowed from coercion, compromise, and rougher power politics. As the
ordering superpower, the United States did not bind itself with the
rules of the system. [It upended, stretched, or broke liberal rules to
shape a putatively liberal order.]{.underline} Appeals to the myth of a
liberal Camelot flow from a deeper myth, of power politics without
coercion and empire without imperialism.

This fuller narrative is also a story of tragic limits. The world was
not so easily subjugated. Efforts to spread liberalism often contained
the seeds of illiberalism. Multiple orders collided and met the limits
of their reach and power. Efforts to create a liberal order ended up
accommodating illiberalism. Liberalism itself proved to be a conflicted
thing. At times, projects to advance it had unexpected results. As it
happens, the pursuit of "liberal order" is not just an antidote to the
current difficulties suffered by the international system but a source
of them.

[Ideas about "order" matter and have weighty policy implications. Just
as material power enables or forecloses certain choices, ideas condition
and constrain a country's grand strategic decisions]{.underline}. Those
who lament the fall of the "liberal order" are saying, in effect, that
some ideas are illegitimate and should be off the table. [They worry
that "populism" and "isolationism" endanger traditional ideas that were
once dominant, leading America to abandon its manifold commitments
overseas, in turn driving the world into disorder. When they call for
the reclamation of the old order, they also call for the perpetuation of
American primacy.]{.underline} By contrast, this paper argues that the
exaggerated notion of the "liberal order" and its imminent collapse is a
myth of the foreign policy establishment and leads America to
overstretch.

This analysis is divided into three parts. First, I examine the
lamentations for a lost world, unpacking what such lamentations claim
about how the world "was" before its dissolution allegedly began[.
Liberal order nostalgia performs two functions: by denying the violent
coercion, resistance, and unintended consequences of "world ordering,"
it sanitizes history into a morality tale and delegitimizes arguments
for revision and retrenchment]{.underline}. The lamentations also [give
an alibi to American primacy]{.underline}, attributing its demise to
forces external to it. By reducing the issue to one of inadequate
political will, and by blaming either elites or the public at large for
failing to keep the faith, "[liberal order" lamentations dodge the
painful question of how such an excellent order could produce
unsustainable burdens, alienate its own citizenry, and provoke
resistance]{.underline}.

In the second section, I demonstrate that ["liberal order" rhetoric is
ahistorical and therefore largely mythica]{.underline}l. The claim that
a single, internally consistent, and consensual order predominated for
more than 70 years, with liberal projects producing liberal results,
fares poorly when [compared with the major patterns of international
relations from 1945, in the spheres of both security and
commerce]{.underline}. Conversely, the claim that American statecraft is
now being turned upside down is hyperbolic, and blind to the quiet
victories that orthodox U.S. grand strategy is winning under the Trump
presidency.

Lastly, I argue that ["world order" nostalgia is harmful. There is a
prudent case for retrenchment, and a diplomacy of deterrence, power
sharing, and accommodation, through which the United States could pursue
security in a multipolar worl]{.underline}d. For an overstretched
superpower to address the imbalance of power and commitments, it will
have to look beyond ritual incantations.

#### Discourse articulates the scope of hegemonic interests---securitization legitimizes interests to construct new political structures

Language and articulation, discourse and practice. For positivism,
[language works as a transparent medium for the indexing of data giving
us a clear view on reality]{.underline} while the interpretation of
reality can rely on correlations and facts. In contrast,
[poststructuralism conceives of language as ontologically significant
and productive]{.underline}. Such an understanding situates the study
within theories that comply with the 'linguistic turn' in the social
sciences: they refuse to conceptualize language as a means of
representation, as a transparent medium or key for the researcher to
investigate an objective perception of reality. '[Reality' cannot be
objectively perceived; hence, there is no objective or 'true' meaning
behind or beyond linguistic representations]{.underline}. The discourse
functions as the theoretical horizon on which objects are constituted[:
all objects are objects of discourse, as their meaning depends on a
socially constructed system of rules and significant
differences]{.underline} (Howarth and Stavrakakis 2000: 3). This is the
tragedy of the old man: the productivity of language allowed him to turn
the table in a rug and the bed into a painting; it allowed him to
construct a world of his own full of things and objects with new
meanings. But language is also a socially constructed and collectively
shared system of rules, codes and conventions to which individuals have
to comply in order to be understood and to participate in societal life,
language can never be a private property -- there is no private language
exclusively for the old man (Wittgenstein 2001: 75/243).

To further understand language as political not only makes it a site of
social interaction but also a space for producing and denouncing
specific subjectivities within the political realm -- language is a site
of exclusion and inclusion. For instance, the understanding of drug use
in the nineteenth century was radically different from today: drug use
was a tolerated behaviour, people in various societal strata consumed
drugs for pleasure, recreation or for medical reasons, and states even
promoted the drug trade by claiming the monopoly on, for example, the
trade with opium. Such a stance is inconceivable today, since the
political nature of these formerly accepted practices became subject of
contestations and, eventually, exclusions: states would not act as
trader of drugs anymore and consuming drugs is considered as deviant,
sick and illegal behaviour. Thus, drug prohibition (and equally
terrorism) are not a mere liguistic reflection of processes or patterns
of behaviour one can discover in the world 'out there' and described 'as
they are'. They are as much in need of interpretation as they open up
space for interpretation. [How they are interpreted and why some
interpretations dominate and others do not is -- as this book argues --
a question of hegemonic orders]{.underline}.

By claiming that it is [only through language that things acquire
meaning, the imagination of an extra-discursive realm able to determine
the meaning of an object is excluded]{.underline}. However, such a
stance does not imply that objects of knowledge might not exist
independently of language, that there is no materiality of say a body or
a table outside of discourse. [The fact that every object is constituted
as an object of discourse has nothing to do with whether there is a
world external to thought, or with the realism/ idealism
opposition.]{.underline} An earthquake or the falling of a brick is an
event that certainly exists, in the sense that it occurs here and now,
independently of my will. But whether their specificity as objects is
constructed in terms of 'natural phenomena' or 'expression of the wrath
of God' depends upon the structuring of a discursive field. What is
denied is not that such objects exist externally to thought, but the
rather different assertion that they could constitute themselves as
objects outside any discursive conditions of emergence. (Laclau and
Mouffe 2001: 108)2

Hence, poststructuralism conceptualizes language in a twofold manner.
First, language is highly structured, since -- as Derrida once argued --
it is a system of differential signs, and meaning can only emerge
through a series of juxtapositions, where one element is valued over its
opposite and not via the essence of the thing itself (Derrida 1980). In
principle, signs are composed of the signifier (the letters on the page
or the sound that bounces off our eardrum) and the signified (the
concept that appears in our brain when we read or hear the signifier).
Hence, a drug addict can only be identified as such through a
differentiation from the non-user, a terrorist needs to be delineated
from the legitimate freedom fighter and a state's national identity
acquires meaning via juxtaposition with a different national identity.

While signifier and signified capture the structured nature of language,
meaning within linguistic structures is organized by articulation.
Against the background of the ontological significance of language,
poststructuralists valorize the role of articulatory practices in the
structuring of social relations by claiming that every social process of
putting elements together is to some degree articulatory. [In this
respect, and secondly, poststructuralists conceive of language not only
as highly structured but also as instable at the same time. Due to this
instable nature of language, the practice of articulation is 'the
construction of nodal points which partially fix meaning]{.underline}'
(Laclau and Mouffe 2001: 113). By speaking of the partial ability to fix
meaning only, Laclau and Mouffe highlight the instable nature of
language. Signifiers are always referring to other signifiers without
ever coming to an irrevocable meaning. Derrida circumscribed this
process with his neologism différance: [words and signs can never fully
summon forth what they mean, but can only be defined or explained by
using more words; thus, the 'fuller' meaning is always postponed in
language, there is never a moment when one can say the meaning is
complete]{.underline} (Derrida 1972).

Such diverse writers as Derrida, Julia Kristeva, Foucault, Roland
Barthes, Jacques Lacan or Laclau and Mouffe acknowledge that the
articulatory practice always alters the identity of each articulated
element. '\[C\]ontingency now inhabits not only the different elements
that are linked together to form a discourse, but also the hegemonic
projects or subjects that strive to fix meanings' (Glynos and Howarth
2007: 179). This brings about a conceptualization of discourse as 'the
structured totality resulting from the articulatory practice' (Laclau
and Mouffe 2001: 105). [Hence, discourses refer to systems of meaningful
practices that form the identities of subjects and objects; they relate
elements to establish meaning, since elements need to be set in relation
to other elements to acquire meaning. This is implied when the meaning
of a terrorist can only be established by juxtaposing it to a
non-terrorist]{.underline}. Discursive structures are not cognitive
entities, they are articulatory practices, which constitute and organize
social relations.

Although being defined as a structured totality the process of
constantly relating elements and organize meaning rules out the
impression of discourse as a static, fixed structure. On the contrary,
discourse is a structure penetrated by contingency and temporality,
marked by fissures, ruptures and breaches. Attempts to halt the inherent
dynamic that haunts discourses and to fix meaning around closed
structures are in vain: 'neither absolute fixity nor absolute non-fixity
is possible' (Laclau and Mouffe 2001: 111). Thus, what counts for the
articulatory practice also counts for discourses: meaning can be
partially fixed because without partial fixations the very flow of
differences would not be possible and no identity or social formation
would ever be constructed. Partial fixations are achieved as any
discourse situates itself as 'an attempt to dominate the field of
discursivity \[. . .\] to construct a centre' (Laclau and Mouffe 2001:
111--2) and subjects search for a constitutive decision articulating
social meaning in one particular way rather than another -- to
paraphrase Derrida's 'undecidability' of any text.

[One central implication of denying the existence of an extra-discursive
realm within which things and objects can be constructed consists of
acknowledging that policies like the 'war on terror' and the 'war on
drugs' are based on specific discursive representations of the security
problem they want to address and on specific constructions of
identities, of Self and Other]{.underline}. But how are linguistic
representations and policies like the two 'wars' linked exactly? In this
respect, the notion of practice is crucial. Practices are the ongoing,
routinized forms of human and societal reproduction. As largely
repetitive activities (not entailing a strong notion of self-conscious
reflexivity), they contribute to the reproduction of wider systems of
social relations. However, every practice is also articulatory 'as human
beings constantly engage in the process of linking together different
elements of their social lives in these continuous and projective
sequences of human action' (Glynos and Howarth 2007: 104).

While such social practices and the identities they maintain tend to
dissimulate the inherent contingency that inhabits social systems, the
ghost of this contingency leaves its traces within the structure:
discursive structures are precarious, they are full of breaches and
gaps, i.e. any social edifice suffers from an inbuilt defect which may
become visible in moments of dislocation (Lacan 2006: 693). [Dislocation
destabilizes a discourse due to events that cannot be symbolized by this
very discourse -- it refers to the 'decentring' of the structure through
social processes]{.underline} which disrupt the structure (like a severe
crisis), as they cannot be mastered by it. In such a moment, [new
opportunities arise, allowing (but also forcing) a subject to situate
itself anew]{.underline} as its former points of identification have
vanished in the process of dislocation. We will see later in how far the
terrorist attacks at the Olympic Games in 1972 represent such a moment
of dislocation as they could not be represented in the discourse on
terrorism at that time.

Yet, dislocation is problematic and productive at the same time, since
the dislocated social practices give rise to political practices, as in
the moment of dislocation, of a crisis, grievances or dissatisfactions
are publicly articulated as demands. [Thus, political practices are
about struggles challenging and transforming current norms, institutions
and practices -- or an entire regime of practices -- in the name of a
different, particular idea, ideal or principle]{.underline} (Howarth
2000: 108--9). If political practices are successful in challenging
existing norms and institutions in the name of something new, they bring
about a transformative effect, since they can modify or reorder an
entire regime. Indeed, [to the extent to which political practices are
not only able to challenge an existing regime of practices but also link
various forces and demands into a new regime of practices, they exercise
an enormous transformative effect in the political landscape. Even more:
political practices can be characterized as 'more or less hegemonic
depending on the degree to which the political demands articulating a
grievance are formulated in terms that succeed in having more or less
universal appeal']{.underline} (Glynos and Howarth 2007: 123). In this
sense, a regime of political practices has a structuring function by
ordering a system of practices against something else: the institution
of a particular regime is always dependent on frontiers relating to what
cannot be incorporated in the differential system of the regime. The
establishment of these limits serves to exclude antagonistic otherness,
represented by those elements that have nothing in common with the
regime from which they are excluded. Quite obviously, defining a regime
of practices in contrast to an antagonized regime shapes both of them.
Labelling a drug addict as a criminal or defining her as a sick person
leads to different practices on how to deal with her addiction -- either
by repressive and punitive measures or by prevention and clinical cure.

[Furthermore, considering something as a threat, i.e. to 'securitize' an
issue by designating it as an existential threat and request for
extraordinary measures, is all but interest-free]{.underline} (Buzan,
Wæver and de Wilde 1998: 23--6). [It legitimizes the subject that
securitizes to go beyond the limits of routine political behaviour and
demand extraordinary measures and instruments. In most of these cases
(since these types of demands are most frequently voiced by powerful
stakeholders within a state), the measures serve to discipline the rest
of society and reaffirm the rule of particular subjects over
society]{.underline}. By invoking the extraordinary measures and
practices to defend against the alleged threat, resistance to these
practices becomes increasingly difficult. Moreover, resistance can
easily be described as being subversive and playing into the hands of
the threat.

To characterize practices and regimes, to account for their
relationship, to explain how and why they change or resist
transformations, we need to elaborate on the logics or modes of
construction on which they are based. Most importantly, [in order to
address how and why specific regimes become hegemonic it is especially
necessary to clarify what is understood by hegemony]{.underline}. This
is the task of the next section.

Through demarcating the multiple meanings of liberalism salient to the
securitization of development debate, this article has proposed a number
of additions and amendments to move the debate forward. Understanding
liberalism as a coherent philosophy, as do a number of contributions to
the debate, draws attention to the liberal political discourse of global
governance. However, [depicting global governance as unified through a
liberal consensus endows a greater coherence to these discourses than
they warrant]{.underline}. In doing so, internal contradiction,
contestation and contingency is obscured. An approach to these related
discourses which makes visible the 'messy actualities' (Larner, 2006) of
global governance may reveal potential and spaces for specific
emancipatory change. This would include acknowledging the different
narratives linking security and development, which would engender a more
robust understanding of this discourse. Utilising the idea of
[liberalism as a technology of governance gives insight into how
development involves the production of freedom and entails limitations
and coercio]{.underline}n. It highlights liberal societal transformation
as a key rationale of global governance and offers a salient theoretical
tool for understanding 'ownership' and 'participation' within the global
development agenda. However there is a need to establish greater clarity
regarding the drivers of [liberal societal transformation in the South
and deeper engagement with the wider literature concerned with liberal
societal transformation]{.underline} (Harrison, 2004) Applying
neoliberalism as governmentality to the debate sheds light upon how the
non-liberal practices of development intervention become acceptable to a
global governance network that is essentially liberal. Finally, a theory
of the [securitization of development needs to pay greater attention to
the structural dynamics of the global economy, including how these are
linked to the production of discourse]{.underline}. The (important)
focus on [liberalism(s) as a coherent philosophy or technique of power,
should not exclude an analysis of the underlying structures of global
capital accumulation that perpetuate the very global inequalities that
are currently framed as security issues by global governance
networks.]{.underline} The security-development nexus reinforces the
delinking of development assistance from the principle of solidarity and
the redistribution of wealth. Instead, [development interventions are
understood as a tool of Western security.]{.underline} It is this that
the securitization of development debate is seeking to critique. In
delineating the three strands of liberalism this paper contributes to
the debate by providing greater clarity and further tools through which
to reveal the 'underlying cartographies of power' that inform the nexus.
Furthermore, in demonstrating [that complexity rather than coherence
characterises networks of global governance, it also has implications
for critical global governance studies that lean towards conceptualising
global governance as a knowable, coherent unit.]{.underline}

#### The liberal international order is used as a scapegoat for policymakers to increase security rhetoric

A return to great power competition

Following the 2015 Ashton Carter statement which began this article,
there was a [substantive shift in the threat narrative delivered by
American executive branch officials]{.underline}. According to the 2016
threat assessment: "Emerging trends suggest that geopolitical
competition among the major powers is increasing in ways that challenge
international norms and institutions" (S.Hrg.114-626 2016, 29).
[Although the international system was seen as still possessing
opportunities for the United States]{.underline}, and even possible
cooperation with Russia and China on certain issues, [the threat
narrative that emerged at this time was that an inflection point had
been reached in which the global security order was fundamentally
slipping away from the United States. Russia and China were depicted as
increasingly confident and active in their goals of establishing spheres
of influence]{.underline} through which they could "check U.S. appeal
and influence in their regions" and then use them to act
extra-regionally (S.Hrg.115-278 2018, 15). From this, [they would be
able to transform the international system contrary to American
preferences. Consistent with securitizing moves]{.underline},
policymakers sought to make the case that these [states now constituted
an existential threat to American primacy, unipolarity, and the
liberal-democratic world order.]{.underline} They did this in four ways.

First, [the separate threats of China and Russia coalesced into a single
narrative]{.underline} in which the United States was confronted by
aligned, revisionist great powers throughout the Eurasian land mass.
This [newfound alignment was depicted as having a directly deteriorative
effect on the international system itself]{.underline} and America's
position within it. The fears expressed in the 1998 threat assessment --
of a shift in great power competition to the "military sphere" and "the
formation of an anti-US great power alliance" -- were now seen as coming
to pass. The latter was highlighted as particularly important. [Before,
cooperation between Russia and China was mentioned largely in passing
and depicted as not a threat to America's global position.]{.underline}
Following 2016, this was no longer the case: [their revisionist goals
were presented as having converged into a single, existential
threat.]{.underline} Their opposition to the U.S. was described as
[increasingly coordinated and intense]{.underline}, and occurring across
an expanded number of issue areas and geographic locations. During the
2016 Q&A session, the specter of the Cold War was directly referenced by
the Director of National Intelligence as a touchstone for explaining the
current international system (S.Hrg.114-626 2016, 71). In 2019,
policymakers depicted a new Cold War-era bloc in an unambiguous
comparison made between current China and Russia alignment and their
alliance during the "mid-1950s" (Coats 2019, 4).

Second, there was l[ittle sense that this geopolitical shift was a
consequence of American overextension, the benefits provided to other
states by hegemonic stability, or, notably, a reaction to U.S. primacy
based upon these countries' perceptions of threat]{.underline}. Although
"perceived U.S. unilateralism and interventionism and [Western promotion
of democratic values and human rights" were cited as partial motivations
for their policies,]{.underline} the cause of this newfound great power
competition continued to be depicted as largely arising from Russian and
Chinese internal great power ambitions (Coats 2019, 4). From the 2016
report onward, great power ambitions constituted, on average, nearly 20%
of the content about both Russia and China -- an increase over the
previous decade of approximately 43% and 33%, respectively. There was
[no explanation or context for these ambitions other than simply to cite
them, with the implication being that they existed as an essential part
of these states themselves --]{.underline}something consistent with the
narratives preceding 2016. More importantly, [these ambitions were
expressed]{.underline} through a variety of actions by Russia and China
[to overturn the international status quo]{.underline}. This is
reflected in Figures 2 and 4, in which we see references to intentions
reaching all-time, post-Cold War heights for both states. From the 2016
report onward, 61% of references to China and nearly 74% of references
to Russia cited this factor. Both states were repeatedly described as
"active" and "assertive", though Russia was the most consistently
referred to as "aggressive", which can, perhaps, account for why Russia
was often depicted as a more serious and immediate threat, despite the
differences in objective capabilities between the two.

Third, these [reports highlighted that Russia/China sought to close the
power gap]{.underline} between themselves and the U.S. [by actively
eroding three key advantages that America held over other]{.underline}
powers which are necessary [for maintaining its position in the
international system:]{.underline} military technology, geographic
reach, and alliances. [These advantages were now seen as slipping away,
accelerating the deterioration of the international system]{.underline}.
In terms of their respective military forces, the U.S. had acknowledged
for some time that the power gap between itself and Russia/China was
shrinking, as they reached certain modernization thresholds which
allowed them to emerge as regional peer competitors in conventional
warfare, missile technology, and space/counterspace. [In other realms,
such as cyberspace, foreign intelligence, and influence/information
operations, threats by these states emerged as particular concerns for
American policymakers]{.underline}, as both countries boosted their
respective capacities to carry out such operations. More concerning for
Washington, however, was that [they demonstrated an increased
willingness to utilize these against the United States in ways that
"intentionally blur the distinction between peace and wartime
operations]{.underline}" (S. Hrg.114-626 2016, 29). Thus, it was not
just the fact that they were building up their capabilities, but that
they were actually using them or had developed offensive doctrines which
facilitated their use in the future. Moreover, [while America's global
position relied on the fact that it was the only truly global power, its
competitors had stepped up their efforts to limit America's influence
within their respective regions]{.underline}. By the latter half of the
2010s, Russia had already established its dominance over the former USSR
and continued to consolidate its position. China was seeking to do
something similar in the Asia-Pacific region through its attempt to
control the disputed South China Sea. Worse from the American
perspective was that both states were upping their capacity to carry out
extra-regional operations, demonstrated most significantly by Russia's
intervention in Syria and China's massive investment in its Indian Ocean
naval presence and the Belt and Road Initiative. The latter was
[specifically described as intended "to diminish U.S.
influence]{.underline}" (Coats 2019, 25). Lastly, the [U.S. had built a
network of global alliances since World War II, which gave Washington
influence, leverage, and reach in every corner of the
world]{.underline}. However, U.S. officials noted that this, too, was
eroding. [While there were some hints that U.S. policy under President
Donald Trump may be responsible for this in some way,20 testimony
explained that both states were also actively seeking to bring this
about by increasing their ties to traditional U.S. allies through
selective incentives]{.underline} or by acting to divide the U.S. from
its allies. While the former was China's preferred mode, Russia was
using influence/information and cyberspace operations [to undermine
"Western cohesion"]{.underline} (S.Hrg.115-278 2018, 25).

The fourth factor was [the most significant for undermining the liberal
democratic world order: America was losing control over global discourse
and norms.]{.underline} This was first referenced in 2016 and became a
central theme in subsequent reports, as Russia and China both sought to
shape information in order to advance their interests and undermine
American positions and messaging. Russian influence/information
operations were depicted as the most active and serious of the two,
given Moscow's presumed actions during several European elections and,
in particular, the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Consequently,
"\[[the\] forces for geopolitical order and stability will continue to
fray, as will the rules-based international order]{.underline}"
(S.Hrg.115-278 2018, 15). The 2019 report was particularly alarmist
about "the coming ideological battle," [with references to how Russia
and China were seeking to "shape global rules and standards to their
benefit," "threaten international support for democracy, human rights,
and the rule of law," and "\[take\] advantage of rising doubts in some
places about the liberal democratic model"]{.underline} (Coats 2019,
24--25). Moreover, U.S. officials claimed that China was now actively
promoting its model of authoritarian-capitalism "as an alternative --
and implicitly superior -- development path," which, previously, was
largely seen as just having a possible demonstrative effects (Coats
2019, 25). [Now, for the first time since the disintegration of the
Soviet Union, American policymakers described a global ideological rival
to liberal-democracy.]{.underline}

[While there was obviously mention of capabilities in these later
reports, what was emphasized was the undesguised intent of Russia and
China to transform the international system, building toward a global
struggle between themselves as revisionist powers and the U.S. as
defending the status quo]{.underline}. The 2019 report, in particular,
was indicative of the fact that [the U.S. government was openly adopting
language that had been building for some time amongst commentators and
foreign policy analysts, that the future dividing line in the
international system would be between democracy and
authoritarianism]{.underline}.21 This both fueled and was seen as
fueling what [has been called a "new red scare]{.underline}" (Neuhauser
2018). While not fully a return to the language of the Cold War, there
were strong indications that this would emerge as the central American
narrative moving forward, given that this great power challenge was
described as "increasingly about values" and the incompatibility between
forms of government (Coats 2019, 4).

### 2NC\-\--NATO

#### NATO's security discourse [delegitimizes]{.underline} alternative governance and [solidifies]{.underline} liberalism in Western identity.

and the politics of imagining the Western security community\", SAGE

//AW

In recent years, there has been [renewed interest among International
Relations (IR) scholars]{.underline} in the ability of the Western
security community to protect itself from a variety of threats and
challenges. In this context, longstanding debates concerning the role
played by the organization that is widely regarded as the institutional
expression of that community---NATO---have recently taken on new
dimensions. Scholars [and [policymakers]{.mark} often [disagree
in]{.mark} their [interpretations of]{.mark} the relative [strength of
NATO]{.mark}, but many agree that the [alliance]{.mark} needs to
[play]{.mark} a [central role in protecting the West]{.mark} from a mix
of conventional and non-conventional dangers]{.underline}, ranging from
an increasingly assertive Russia to transnational terrorism. One of the
[key assumptions underpinning many analyses is that NATO constitutes the
institutional expression of a pre-existing Western security community
united around liberal-democratic norms and values. However, a close
reading of the alliance's history shows that]{.underline}, far from
simply representing a pre-given community, [[NATO has always been
**involved in constructing "the West**]{.underline}]{.mark}." At the
[heart of]{.underline} that process of [[social construction lie
practices of]{.mark} collective (re)[imagining of]{.mark} the [Western
world]{.mark} in specific ways]{.underline}, as well as the
[representation---and management of---internal tensions as feuds within
a community united by shared liberal values]{.underline}. Today, the
task of managing internal differences has been rendered particularly
difficult by the rise of radical conservative political forces in
several allied states. This has [[translated into]{.mark} a [clash
between]{.mark} liberal and illiberal [interpretations of]{.mark} the
[Western security]{.mark} community]{.underline}, which has the
potential to seriously complicate inter-allied relations in the
foreseeable future. As this paper shows, contrary to conventional
wisdom, middle powers have always played important roles in the
constitution of the Western security community. More recently, [they
have also [played significant roles in]{.mark} contesting liberal
interpretations of the security community, and [articulating]{.mark} an
alternative, [radical conservative vision]{.mark} of the
West]{.underline}. Recent developments in allied countries such as
Turkey and Poland are a potent reminder that not all middle powers are
alike; on the contrary, based on their socially constructed,
historically specific definitions of identity, they can perform a
diversity of international roles---in support of, or, conversely, as
obstacles to liberal internationalism. The narrative of Western unity
and the politics of collective forgetting during the Cold War One of the
most [influential narratives of international security put forward by
liberal IR scholars and practitioners centres on the Euro-Atlantic
security community, consisting of a group of countries united around a
set of key liberal norms and institutions that generate "dependable
expectations"]{.underline} of peaceful resolution of conflicts that
might arise among them.1 From that perspective, NATO is an institution
that was created in the context of the Cold War to protect the
pre-existing security community from the threats posed by the West's
dangerous other: the communist bloc. Yet, as a series of constructivist
scholars have persuasively argued, [[there is **nothing natural**
about]{.mark} the [Western security community]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 In
Emanuel Adler's words, "[[security communities]{.mark} are [socially
constructed]{.mark}]{.underline} and rest on shared practical knowledge
of the peaceful resolution of conflicts."3 Furthermore, the [absence of
violence should not lead us to conclude that the construction of
security communities in general and the Western community in particular
were power-free processes]{.underline}. On the contrary, as Adler and
Barnett explain, [central to the establishment of a [security community
is]{.mark} the [dialectic between power]{.mark}]{.underline}---primarily
symbolic power---[[and knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}.4 Thus, in the
physically non-violent context of security communities, [power is
primarily "the authority to determine the shared meanings that embody
the identities, interests and practices of states]{.underline}, as well
as the conditions that confer, [defer or deny access to goods and
benefits]{.underline}."5 Applying this logic to the specific case of
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, we can see the alliance [not as the
institutional expression of a pre-given community, but, rather, as an
[organization]{.mark} that has been [deeply involved in power-filled
practices of construction and reproduction of]{.mark} that
[community.]{.mark}6]{.underline} Historical evidence indicates that the
founders of NATO---policymaking elites from the United Kingdom, Canada,
the United States, France, and the Benelux states---did not take the
Western security community for granted. Instead, they engaged in a
systematic set of practices aimed at constructing a sense of community
around a shared set of liberal-democratic norms in the Euro-Atlantic
area, and placed the newly created North Atlantic Treaty Organization at
the heart of those practices. In the intergovernmental [debates leading
up to the establishment of NATO]{.underline}, the threat of [military
confrontation]{.underline} with the Soviet Union was regarded as [less
worrisome than the danger of communist subversion within the weakened
societies of Western European states]{.underline}.7 In that context, as
Louis St. Laurent---then Canadian Secretary of State for External
Affairs---argued, the best way to prevent a third world war was by
confronting "the forces of communist expansion with an overwhelming
preponderance of moral, economic and military force on the side of
freedom."8 At the level of top Western political elites, the [[fear of
communism inspired]{.mark} a collective ([re)definition of political
identity]{.mark} in the Euro-Atlantic area. The "spectre of
[Communism]{.mark}" [provided]{.mark} the [defining other against which
decision-makers]{.mark} on both sides of the Atlantic were [able to
subordinate their differences to a collective definition of a Western
community]{.mark}]{.underline}. That community was seen as based on the
common heritage of political and cultural ideas of member states; its
defining mark was the set of shared values of individual liberal
freedoms, the rule of law, and democracy.9 This view is clearly
reflected in the preamble to the Washington Treaty (NATO's foundational
treaty), which stipulates that the alliance is based on principles of
democracy, individual liberty, and law. Contrary to what conventional
(realist) wisdom suggests, NATO was not simply set up as the hegemonic
instrument of the US. On the contrary, political actors from other
states---most notably Canada---played key roles in driving the process
of establishing NATO and defining its key foundational principles.10 In
fact, one of the key articles in the Washington Treaty is informally
known as the "Canadian" article, precisely in recognition of the
influential role played by Canadian policymakers in its formulation.11
Article 2 clearly shows that NATO was expected to play a role that went
far beyond that of a conventional military alliance. That article
succinctly summarizes the precepts of the Kantian-inspired democratic
peace theory, as it stipulates: "The Parties will contribute toward the
further development of peaceful and friendly international relations by
strengthening their free institutions, by bringing about a better
understanding of the principles upon which these institutions are
founded, and by promoting conditions of stability and well-being." [To
[decision-makers locked in]{.mark} a competition with [forces regarded
as representing communist otherness]{.mark}, it was imperative that
countries of Western Europe, Canada, and the US cultivate a sense of
shared liberal-democratic identity---set in opposition to
communism]{.underline}---among their peoples. In that context, they
[sought to articulate a narrative of Western unity, and disseminate it
as widely as possible]{.underline} in the countries of the Atlantic
Alliance. As Erik Ringmar has argued, [[identities are
constructed]{.mark}, maintained, and transformed [via the telling of
"constitutive" narratives]{.mark}]{.underline}.12 Narratives provide a
set of meanings within which an actor's identity, the situation within
which they are located and the actions deemed appropriate are brought
together.13 The process of telling constitutive narratives is especially
important during periods of fundamental transformation, when new
identities are being formed and old ones are being pressured to
evolve.14 In the eyes of Western leaders, the [[narrative of
unity]{.mark} among NATO members had to [not only cultivate]{.mark} a
sense of [shared identity, but also]{.mark} **to
[delegitimize]{.mark}**---by casting [them as **inconsistent with
Western identity**]{.mark}---communist forces]{.underline} that were
becoming increasingly powerful in many allied states. Once again, some
of the most influential voices in favour of disseminating a narrative of
Western unity and using that to legitimize community-building practices
within NATO were its middle powers---particularly Canada. For instance,
the Canadian Foreign Minister, Lester Pearson, repeatedly argued in the
early 1950s that NATO's long-term goal had to be the creation of a
community of free nations in the Atlantic area. More broadly, Canadian
officials, together with NATO supporters from Norway, the Netherlands,
Denmark, and the UK, were acutely aware of the fact that, in order for
the alliance to be able to help build "a community of free nations"
united around liberal values, it had to find a way to help publics from
allied states transcend recent memories of war among Western states.
What was required, in other words, was a collective
reinterpretation---and a selective forgetting---of the recent past.15
After all, the newly identified enemy, communist Soviet Union, had
emerged from the war as a hero in the eyes of many in the West. The view
of the "[[West as one]{.mark}" became central to a collective
[(re)reading of Western history]{.mark}]{.underline} following the
establishment of the alliance.16 Collective efforts at history
(re)[writing found expression not only within the public discourse
articulated by NATO, but also in confidential documents]{.underline}.
Recently declassified documents from the 1950s reveal a set of shared
understandings among NATO's decision-makers regarding the way in which
the history of member states should be interpreted in order to foster a
sense of Western community. In addition, NATO mobilized its substantial
material and symbolic power to widely disseminate the [[discourse on
Western unity]{.mark} in all the allied states and, simultaneously, to
[**delegitimize alternative readings** of
history]{.mark}]{.underline}---especially those that focused on ideas of
solidarity---and memories of friendship---with the Soviet Union.17 In
particular, as Patrick Jackson has demonstrated, the discourse of
Western civilization played a key role in orchestrating the collective
(re)reading of Germany as a member of the Western community, and on this
basis legitimating its incorporation into NATO. This is not to suggest
that the West was an essential entity that objectively determined a
field of outcomes. Rather, "[[Western civilization]{.mark}" needs to be
[understood as "rhetorical commonplace,"]{.mark} used by allied
policymakers as a [discursive resource for de-legitimating policy
options]{.mark}]{.underline} opposed to Germany's incorporation into
American-led institutions.18 [[In]{.mark} the official [NATO
discourse]{.mark}, [Germany was]{.mark} **interpreted as a [member of
the Western family]{.mark}** that, [under]{.mark} the [Nazi
regime]{.mark}, had temporarily deviated from its core
values.]{.underline} Following the end of that regime, however, (West)
[[Germany]{.mark}---acting under the close supervision of allied
states---[could and should be reintegrated into]{.mark} the
Euro-Atlantic [community.]{.mark}]{.underline} Against the background of
the constitutive discourse on Western unity, disagreements and tensions
that continued to occur among member states could be represented as
"family" feuds, and managed within the framework of shared norms and a
persisting sense of community. A full analysis of inter-allied
disagreements during the Cold War is beyond the scope of this paper.
However, it is worthwhile to briefly examine what could be seen as one
of the most significant set of disagreements within NATO: arguments
concerning the accession to the alliance of states that did not comply
with the liberal-democratic norms and values around which the Western
community defined itself. Particularly interesting were arguments over
the inclusion of Portugal in 1949, as well as the accession of Greece
and especially Turkey (completed in 1952). In that context, middle
powers like Canada and Norway emerged as strong proponents of the view
that countries which did not respect basic liberal-democratic values did
not belong---and should not be included---in the alliance which
represented the Western community.19 In the end, however, all the allies
were persuaded to support the inclusion of those "problem" countries.
Several factors were crucial to the emergence of that consensus: a
shared recognition among the allies of the geostrategic importance of
those countries in the context of growing confrontation with the Soviet
Union, and a sense that, in that particular context, the inclusion of
strategically vital but normatively deviant states was an acceptable
compromise in the name of protecting the community of liberal values.
The prevailing view came to be that the integration of states like
Portugal and Turkey could be managed in a way that would not necessarily
endanger the core values of the West. Furthermore, inclusion into the
Western community was seen by some allied policymakers as a course of
action that could help those countries evolve into stable liberal
democracies. It is revealing, in fact, that a normative compromise that
was eventually seen as reasonable in the cases of Portugal and Turkey
was regarded as inappropriate in the case of a country whose political
regime was perceived as an active threat to liberal-democratic values:
Franco's Spain.20 As Mark Smith put it, "Turkey could be accommodated,
and Portugal's dictatorship had less Fascistic origins than Spain's.
Significantly, neither had a history of active antagonism toward Western
European liberalism. Admitting Franco would be admitting a regime of the
very sort that had overturned European democracy in the 1930s and 1940s,
and as such was wholly unacceptable."21 The "triumph" of the West and
the spread of the liberal security community in the early post-Cold War
period The [[end of]{.mark} the [Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline} was
accompanied by a sense of triumph by the West over its defining other,
and, as a corollary to this, a shared view among allied decision-makers
that a [new [security]{.mark} environment was emerging in Europe. In a
context marked by the breakdown of the Soviet bloc and the eruption of
violence linked to ethnic conflict and the breakdown of states (most
notably in the former Yugoslavia), there was a [shift away from
definitions]{.mark} of security [focused on military power]{.mark}, and
[toward]{.mark} a heavy [emphasis on "good governance]{.mark}" within
states]{.underline}. In essence, [security came to be associated with
the liberal-democratic norms]{.underline} and institutions; negatively,
risks came to be seen as emerging from the absence of liberal-democratic
structures.22 In a situation in which there was no clearly identified
enemy state, but in which developments within the transient former
communist countries threatened to undermine international security, a
[consensus emerged that the promotion of "good" liberal-democratic norms
and institutions within those states would be vital for European and
international security]{.underline} in the new era. In that context, the
project of disseminating liberal-democratic norms into the former
Eastern bloc also became central to NATO efforts to redefine its
mission---and thus demonstrate its continued relevance in the new era.23
In essence, [[NATO]{.mark} became [**deeply involved** in
reconstituting]{.mark} Central and Eastern [European polities
through]{.mark} systematic practices of [socializing military and
political elites]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as next generations of
leaders into liberal-democratic norms and institutions.24 In other
words, the alliance engaged in performing its liberal-democratic
narrative via practices of disseminating liberal-democratic dispositions
and institutions of "self-restraint" into the former communist bloc.25
The idea was to provide the Central/East European political and military
elites with Western, liberal-democratic scripts for rebuilding their
societies, and to turn those elites into "responsible," self-disciplined
actors, who would take Western-prescribed liberal-democratic norms for
granted.26 [Special emphasis was placed on socialising Central/Eastern
Europeans into Western-defined norms in the area of security, including
norms governing the relationships among different branches of the state
involved in the formulation and implementation of defence policies, and
the relationship between the state and civil society.27 NATO's ability
to provide authoritative definitions of the legitimate meaning of
liberal-democratic identity, and more specifically, guidance on how to
correctly enact norms of security provision]{.underline} that
corresponded to that definition, was a reflection of the substantial
symbolic power exercised by NATO vis-a-vis the pro-West elites of
Central and Eastern Europe.28 That power was grounded in the latter's
recognition of NATO not just as a military alliance but as a key
institution of the Western community with which Central/Eastern European
reformers identified.29

Our analysis has shown that [[NATO has]{.mark} developed **[two

two outlets: [a]{.mark} more up-to-date and faster-[developing **threat
discourse** for]{.mark} its [Twitter]{.mark} presence, [and a]{.mark}
more traditional, [slow-moving]{.mark} **threat [presence]{.mark}**

This is particularly interesting and acutely visible in more 20th

military intelligence-related topics that are more frequently mentioned
in official documents, and much less referenced on Twitter. However,
[[the]{.mark} **overwhelming [majority]{.mark}** [of disinformation,
misinformation]{.mark}, hybrid war, information warfare and fake
news-related communication [topics are **securitized on
Twitter**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This shows the emergence of two NATO
discourses: one for its official documents, and one for its social media
presence and messaging. The advent of digital communication technologies
and social media has been significant for the evolution of
securitization. [Since [securitization entails]{.mark} production and
[dissemination of insecurity frames through **discursive networks**,
a]{.mark} more [dynamic]{.mark}, **interconnected [information]{.mark}**
[ecosystem is more conducive for]{.mark} collective
**[meaning-making]{.mark}.** On social media, [the **formation of
insecurity**]{.mark} [processes]{.mark} are more [rapid]{.mark} and
interactive, and are able to influence and **alter** traditional, boring
securitizing acts of elites]{.underline}. To that end, media outlets
like Twitter provide a more interactive and fast-paced securitizing
environment where elites and non-elites can set the security agenda and
mobilize masses. The most clear expression of this novel medium, as
demonstrated in our results, is that NATO's Twitter securitization
efforts change much faster, and spread more widely than traditional
outlets like official speeches, texts and reports. This could be
interpreted in two ways: first, that NATO may prefer securitizing
disinformation exclusively on Twitter, since such threats are generally
more visible and debated on social media platforms. The second
interpretation is that NATO's official statements and documents could
largely be focusing on macrolevel doctrinal issues that pose a direct
military security threat to its members, rather than disinformation,
which is a nuisance, but poses no direct military threat. Since
disinformation is being discussed in contemporary policy debates within
the context of electoral integrity and social polarization, their actual
military relevance may be less relevant to be taken into account in
formal NATO documents[. In either case, our study of the NATO lexicon
demonstrated that disinformation and related terms are constructed as
uniquely 'Russian' nuisances. This isn't surprising since most of these
terms - at least their digital interpretations - have entered the NATO
lexicon after the Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine and
Crimea. However, since then, [Russia remained the **only
country**]{.mark} against which [NATO has **constructed**]{.mark} **its
[disinformation]{.mark}** [narratives]{.mark}, indicating that Russia is
NATO's sole disinformation concern]{.underline}. Although very recently
China has emerged as a runner-up country within the context of
COVID-related disinformation concerns, Russia is largely the main threat
in NATO's lexicon. This could be counterproductive to long-term NATO
efforts to combat disinformation, given the global prevalence of fake
news and information meddling. While Russian disinformation efforts are
observably valid, cornering a universal problem like disinformation into
the limited space of NATO's interactions with a single country may lead
to conceptual contraction. This in turn, may prevent NATO from
mobilizing full alliance resources against disinformation, defined as a
global and universal problem.

#### Here\'s that study.

Disinformation in NATO Lexicon: A Computational Text Analysis,"

[In order to explore how NATO has securitized disinformation in recent
years, [we have scraped **238,452 tweets** from NATO]{.mark} and
official affiliated accounts from January 2014 to February 2021 [and
extracted more than 2000 speeches, press releases, reviews, official
texts, archival documents and publications]{.mark} from the NATO
e-library (?).]{.underline} Out of this sample, [we have extracted
documents and content that contained the keywords 'disinformation',
'misinformation', 'fake news', 'propaganda', 'hybrid warfare' and
'information warfare', and logged the number of their occurrences within
these texts by date]{.underline}. Since this study doesn't focus on the
semantic differences between these keywords and consider them as
different references to disinformation as a discursive strategy, we
[code and merge them singularly as variable 'disinfo']{.underline}. Our
preliminary analysis shows that NATO has used these keywords most
frequently in tweets, followed by speeches, reviews and publications.
However, when analyzed proportionally, [NATO publications focus on
disinformation most frequently (75% of all documents), followed by
tweets (40%), reviews (36.97%) and official texts (21.05%). In this
study, we employ structural topic modeling (STM) - a text analysis
approach that finds 'topics' in an unstructured corpus based on
covariate information (Roberts et al., 2019). It follows a statistical
logic that measures co-occurrence likelihoods of keywords and terms that
are more likely to appear with each other and derives topical meanings
out of those likelihoods.]{.underline} Topic modeling is increasingly
used in the study of large volumes of text in social sciences such as
large archival documents, or social media text datasets by producing
"each word on the basis of some number of preceding words or word
classes," and "generate\[ing\] words based on latent topic variables
inferred from word correlations independent of the order in which the
words appear" (Wallach, 2006). In recent years topic modeling has become
a widely-used method to study large Twitter datasets, and political
discussions that happen on other social media platforms (Giles, 2012;
Hong, Davison, 2010; Liang, Fu, 2015).

#### NATO forms its alliances by securitizing for its own selfish protection---results in the threat generation and allying with powerful states

Many scholars would probably state that much has changed since the early
1990s. [Eastern enlargement has made NATO's membership and strategic
discourse more diverse]{.underline}, disputes over the Iraq war in 2003
were regarded as the most serious crisis in NATO's history and the
conflict in Ukraine and the progress of ISIS in Syria and Iraq symbolise
the sorts of challenge the Alliance will have to face in years to come.
[Statements that NATO is in crisis, the 'alliance crisis syndrome' as
Thiess]{.underline} (2009: 2[) has aptly named it, are nothing new but
do direct our attention to more substantial questions: what is
NATO]{.underline} (for) -- and why has it endured for so long despite
its history of crisis? ST's examination of NATO's past provides some
helpful insights in these regards. In a strictly positivist sense, ST
does not explain the foundation, transformation and/or continuity of the
Alliance where norms, interests or common threat assessments might be
described as the major causes of cooperation. What [STdoes, however, is
provide a conceptual toolbox for describing causal
mechanisms]{.underline} (Guzzini 2011) -- what happens, in other words,
[when actors speak security and move political questions on
(re-securitisation) and off (de-securitisation) the security
agenda]{.underline}. It shows the specific regional patterns of
de-/securitization in the transatlantic regional security complex with
its unique and overlapping institutions (NATO, EU, OSCE). Thus, [ST
might be a critical resource for (neo)realist accounts of
NATO]{.underline}. [Alliance formation]{.underline}, as Walt (1985: 4)
has **[prominently argued, can be regarded 'as a response to threats',
either in terms of balancing the source of danger or allying with the
most powerful state]{.underline}**. As simple as this argument may
sound, it leaves open the question of who poses a danger to whom, and
how and why insecurities might change over time. [ST is able to give an
empirically grounded answer to these questions. Accordingly, a
comparative study on patterns of securitisation/de-securitisation across
time and institutions would be highly valuable in order to understand
how different NATO is]{.underline}. Threats and insecurities have not
ceased to exist even if North America and Europe are zones of peace(ful
change) among states. The main puzzle, then, is not the continuity of
the Alliance after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, but rather [its
ability to invoke and often hegemonise what security means while
consolidating non-violent relations internally]{.underline}. Addressing
NATO's future, ST also suggests some conclusions. Although reliable
predictions are always difficult and risky (as neo-realist claims of
NATO survival show),13 it is possible to argue that [the Alliance will
endure as long as actors (member states as well as NATO officials)
succeed in articulating insecurities of different kinds and thus
legitimise NATO as the central institution where these problems are
negotiated and dealt with]{.underline}. The example of NATO's post--Cold
War re-orientation through its 1991 Strategic Concept and subsequent
strategic discourse illustrates how the Alliance has navigated this
challenge. At the Cold War's end, the Alliance seemingly confronted a
situation of de-securitisation as its erstwhile Soviet adversary
disappeared from the stage. Indeed, de-securitisation was the premise of
policy as NATO embraced former Warsaw Pact states through enlargement
and embarked upon a structured partnership with Russia. But in
parallel**[, NATO securitised other issues by widening its remit of
responsibility, an act given authoritative expression in the Strategic
Concept and then extended in successor documents in 1999 and
2010]{.underline}**. These strategic articulations were manifest in a
wholesale shift of mission evidenced most obviously in interventions in
the Balkans in the 1990s, as well as later in Afghanistan and Libya.
**[The culmination of this process is the re-securitisation of Russia
which has occurred as a consequence of the crisis in
Ukraine]{.underline}**. As for the question what is [NATO]{.underline}
(for), an answer here is more complicated and might contradict
assumptions that the Alliance [has retained its relevance through
securitising (or, indeed, de-securitising and re-securitising) specific
threats]{.underline}. [NATO has been more than a military alliance from
its very beginning, symbolising a special bond between Europe and North
America]{.underline}. Continuous articulations of threat assessments
make NATO members work and even fight together but they are not the
foundation of the Alliance as such: it is, rather, the invocation of a
community of like-minded states (and societies) which share something
important (democracy, human rights and a market economy) in common and
deemed worthy of protection. Thus, Thomas Risse-Kappen (1996: 4) has
argued that the Alliance is not based primarily on common interests and
threat perceptions, but on a collective democratic identity symbolising
an 'alliance of democracies'. His claim is persuasive but it needs
qualifying (Sjursen 2004). [Since the foundation of NATO, its members
have invoked the Alliance as the cornerstone of Western security
cooperation based on common symbolic values.]{.underline} [Whenever
these values have been endangered, the allies have been able to mobilise
and legitimise new policies in order to (re-) affirm NATO's unity,
including a lasting institutional structure of political and military
cooperation, coordination and even integration. It is the capacity of
the members to articulate the values they stand for as universal and the
alliance they form as legitimised to defend them at home and, if
necessary, to realise them abroad, which attaches true value to
NATO]{.underline}. In other words, the presumed 'democratic identity' of
each member and of NATO itself cannot be taken for granted but is the
performative effect of a shared security discourse which changes its
content over time. As Behnke (2013: 1) has argued ['the continued
existence and political relevance of the Alliance rests on its ability
to repro-duce "the West" as a geo-cultural space that serves as its
security referent object'. Processes of securitisation and
de-securitisation are the symbolic, yet powerful expression of this
community.]{.underline}

David Mutimer (1997) has argued that the use of [the metaphor
\'proliferation\' carries certain entailments]{.underline}. That is to
say, it structures our understanding and handling of the problem. In
particular, he refers to the \"image of a spread outward from a point or
source\", and the \"technological bias\" introduced in the discourse
(Mutimer 1997:201-2). As concerns the first point, \'proliferation\'
presupposes a center at which WMD are to be held and controlled, and
from which these weapons disseminate into the body of the international
society. To the extent that this process gets out of the center\'s
control, certain measures have to be taken to \'suffocate\', limit, or
curb the \'spread\' of these weapons. As concerns the second point,
Mutimer (1997:203) points out the peculiar agency implied in the
concept: \"Notice that the weapons themselves spread; they are not
spread by an external agent of some form - say, a human being or
political institution\". [The fact that a large number of these weapons
were actually \'spread\' by Western states is consequently hidden
through this discursive structure.]{.underline} These points are also
relevant for the Mediterranean Initiative. We can add a third entailment
to the list which appears through a critical reading of the NATO/RAND
narrative. As the RAND authors (1998:15) observe, \"The mere existence
of ballistic missile technology with ranges in excess of 1,000 km on
world markets and available to proliferators around the Mediterranean
basin would not necessarily pose serious strategic dilemmas for
Europe.\"

In fact, we might even agree with the neorealist proposition that \'more
might be better\', above all in terms of nuclear weapons. This is
certainly the preferred solution of John Mearsheimer (1990) for the
stabilization of European political order after the end of the cold war.
After all, conventional wisdom has it that nuclear weapons and the
threat of mutually assured destruction preserved stability and peace
during the Cold War. The RAND authors, however, fail to grasp the irony
in their identification of WMD proliferation, which ends up denying this
central tenet of cold war strategy. According to them, [\"the WMD and
ballistic missile threat will acquire more serious dimensions where it
is coupled with a proliferator\'s revolutionary orientation. Today, this
is the case with regard to Iran, Iraq, Libya, and arguably
Syria\"]{.underline} (RAND, 1998:16).

What preserved the peace during the cold war \-- mutual deterrence \--
is now re-written as a strategic problem:

[As a result of proliferation trends, Europe will be increasingly
exposed to the retaliatory consequences of U.S. and European actions
around the Middle East and the Mediterranean basin, including the
Balkans]{.underline}. \... [As a political threat and a weapon of terror
capable of influencing the NATO decisionmaking during a crisis, their
significance \[of conventionally armed ballistic missiles\] could be
considerable]{.underline} (RAND, 1998:16).

Two implications of these arguments deserve elaboration. [First, there
is the reversal of the traditional relationship between WMD and
rationality. For what makes the presence of WMD in the South so
worrisome is the absence of the requirements of reason and
rationality.]{.underline} Within NATO\'s discourse on the South,
\'revolutionary orientation\' accounts for the undesirability of
distributing these weapons to such unfit hands. In order to qualify for
their possession, reason and rationality must be present \-- as they are
obviously assumed to be in the West. [The **discourse of proliferation**
consequently produces a third entailment by **constructing the
relationship between West and South in \'orientalist\'
terms**]{.underline}. In this rendition, [the South becomes the
quintessential antithesis of the West, the site of irrationality,
passion, and terror]{.underline} (Said, 1995). Within this site,
different rules apply, which are not necessarily subject to Western
ideals of enlightened reason. [\'Proliferation\' articulates a
**hierarchical structure** in global politics, with **the West as the
privileged** site of from which to surveil, control, and engage the rest
of the world.]{.underline}

This privilege is further dramatized in the above complaint about the
possibility of retaliation. [For the South to achieve the possibility of
influencing NATO decisionmaking is to violate the epistemic sovereignty
of the West. \'U.S. and European actions\' and interventions have to be
unrestrained in order to constitute proper crisis management. NATO
demands a docile subjectivity and accessible territory from the
South]{.underline}, the latter\'s identity cannot be ascertained against
the West. Its arms have to be surrendered, its retaliatory capabilities
to be revoked.

\'Information\' is the third mode besides \'Securitization\' and
\'Proliferation\' within which we can discern the subjugation of the
South to the strategic Western gaze. A central purpose of the
Mediterranean Initiative/Dialogue is to improve \'mutual understanding\'
and to \'dispel some of the misperceptions and apprehensions that exist,
on both sides of the Mediterranean\' (Solana, 1997a:5). And both the
RAND Corporation and NATO put some emphasis on public information and
perception. Yet the structure of this relationship proves to be
unbalanced and virtually unilateral. As mentioned above, for NATO, the
prime task is above all the \"further refinement of its definition of
security\" (de Santis, 1998). The general identity of the South as a
site of danger and insecurity is consequently never in question. Western
perceptions are never problematized. Knowledge of the South is, it
appears, a matter of matching more and better information with proper
conceptual tools. On the other hand, (mis)perceptions take the place of
knowledge in the South. NATO is perceived widely as a Cold War
institution searching for a new enemy. That is why the best course to
change the perception of NATO in these countries is to focus more on
\"soft\" security, building mutual understanding and confidence before
engaging in \"hard\" military cooperation. Measures should be developed
with the aim of promoting transparency and defusing threat perceptions,
and promoting a better understanding of NATO\'s policies and objectives
(de Santis, 1998:34). To interpret political misgivings about NATO and
its post-cold war diplomacy as \'misperceptions\' which can be put
straight by \"educat\[ing\] opinion-makers in the
dialogue-countries\"(RAND, 1998:75) tends to naturalize and objectify
the Western rendition of NATO\'s identity. The possibility that from the
perspective of the \'Southern\' countries NATO\'s political and
strategic design might look quite different is lost in this narrative.
NATO\'s identity is decontextualized and objectified, the productive
role of different cultural and strategic settings in the establishment
of identities and formulation of interests denied. To maintain such a
lofty position becomes more difficult if we let the Mediterranean
participants voice their concerns openly. Far from being
\'misperceptions and misunderstandings\', these countries\' less than
enthusiastic attitudes towards NATO are based on, for instance, the
establishment of powerful Western military intervention capabilities off
their beaches. Also, NATO\'s attempts to institutionalize a military
cooperation is interpreted as an attempt to gain a strategic foothold in
the region in order to monitor the flow of missile technology and the
possession of WMD (Selim 1998:12-14). In other words, we encounter
rather rational and reasonable security political and strategic
concerns. The fact that NATO is unwilling or unable to acknowledge their
concerns once again demonstrates the \'imperial\' nature of the
purported dialogue. Conclusion: The Imperial Encounter In her
exploration of Western representations of the South, Roxanne
[Doty]{.underline} (1996:3) [describes the relationship between these
two subjectivities as an \"imperial encounter]{.underline}\" which is
meant \"to convey the idea of asymmetrical encounters in which [one
entity has been able to construct \'realities\' that were taken
seriously and acted upon and the other entity has been denied equal
degrees or kinds of agency]{.underline}\". Her focus is on an aspect of
power which has received increasing treatment within critical
International Relations (IR) theory during the last years, that is, the
power to define and articulate identities and to determine the relations
between them. As was argued above, th[e Western invention of the South
during the cold war can be interpreted as an imperial
gesture.]{.underline} The South was rendered into a West-in-the-making,
with its own distinguished historical, cultural, and social features
reduced to indicators of \'underdevelopment\'. Ultimately, the narrative
proclaimed, the South would become part of the Western \'Empire\', the
latter would be able to expand into \'barbaric\' areas of the world \--
provided it could win the war against Communism. [The end of the cold
war saw this \'expansionist\' logic give way to a exclusive
posture]{.underline}. The relations between the West and the South are
no longer mediated through time. Instead, [a spatial differentiation now
structures the imperial encounter, the South is no longer to be
\'developed\' and \'Westernized\'. It is to be surveilled, controlled
and disciplined, its \'spillage\' of crisis and instability to be
contained]{.underline}. NATO\'s Mediterranean Initiative is a
cornerstone in this new rendition. For while we so far cannot observe
any direct military intervention by the Alliance in the Mediterranean
region, NATO\'s discourse on the South in general, and the Initiative in
particular render it accessible and available for such action. Strategic
knowledge is produced as an expression of, and in anticipation of,
strategic power. The \'self-determination\' of NATO as a continuously
capable and competent military agent is effected through a discourse
that inscribes a particular, securitizing, strategic order upon the
South, positing it as a site of danger, irrationality and insecurity
against the West. In this context it is interesting to observe the
exclusion of states from the Mediterranean Initiative that are not
considered to be \'moderate, Western-looking \[and\] constructivist\'
(RAND 1998:57). This differentiation between insiders and outsiders
appears to be based on the degree to which the respective countries are
willing to subject themselves to the imperial encounter with the West,
and to open themselves to the strategic gaze and control of NATO. The
imperial encounter is then made possible and supported by what one may
call the Emperor\'s two bodies. On one hand, the West appears as a
cultural identity among others, located in space (North of the
Mediterranean) and time (in the post-cold war era). In this sense, the
West is the entity that needs to be protected from the dangers and
threats which \'spill over\' from the South through adequate strategic
means. On the other hand, [the West is presented as a \'site of
knowledge\']{.underline}, as the source or [author of the proper and
objective \'world-picture\' that depicts the realities of post-cold war
global politics]{.underline}. In this sense, [the West becomes the
metaphysical grounds from which knowledge can be gathered and
disseminated]{.underline}. And [in]{.underline} its different versions
\-- [securitization, proliferation]{.underline}, and information \--
[this knowledge]{.underline} draws on and [reproduces this
metaphysics]{.underline}. There are consequently reasons to be skeptical
about NATO\'s ability to conduct a \'dialogue\' with an other it is
unwilling to listen to.

### Realism/Neo-Realism

#### The AFF's realist understanding of nuclear proliferation and deterrence relies on a Cold War Era use of ['rationality']{.underline} that [otherizes]{.underline} non-Western states as 'irrational', putting the 'West' on a pedestal that is isolated from the realness of conflict

Alex H. **Chung 14**, MA in IR, PhD Candidate at the Department of
Occupational Therapy, Social Work and Social Policy, November 2014,
http://web.isanet.org/Web/Conferences/ISSS%20Austin%202014/Archive/253053b8-52cd-4251-8a5d-1dd0163cb460.pdf\\\\iris

The traditional [neo-realist security paradigm perceives nuclear weapons
as either "deterrents against overwhelming conventional military threats
or as coercive tools to compel changes in the status quo,"]{.underline}
(Sagan 1997, p. 57). Realist and neo-realist nuclear perspectives were
underpinned by the MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) doctrine --
wherein state actors maximise their security by behaving 'rationally',
given the anarchic nature of the world (Seliktar 2011, p. 190). For
neorealists, the end of the 'Cold War' marked the end of the bipolar
distribution of power that was considered to be more stable than the
introduction of the post-Cold War multipolar arrangement of power. This
resulted in the acceleration of nuclear proliferation (Chafetz 1993, p.
127). [Anxiety over proliferation persisted after the Cold War due to
the fact that those considered 'rogue states' were among those hoping to
join the 'nuclear club',]{.underline} thus igniting serious debate on
'rationality' (Seliktar 2011, p. 191). [Promoters of 'planned' or
'managed' proliferation such as Waltz see the proliferation of nuclear
weapons as both inevitable and not a cause for alarm, given the
overwhelming power of nuclear deterrence; "the ability of a state, not
to defend itself, but to threaten an adversary with unacceptable damage
if attacked,"]{.underline} (Gavin 2012, p. 574). Many neorealist
political scientists, including Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, William Riker,
and John Mearsheimer have promoted the 'managed' or 'planned'
proliferation argument, advocating for the spread of nuclear weapons
into key areas, such as Ukraine and Germany, where non-nuclear states
face nuclear armed enemies, based on the belief that "the chance of
bilateral conflict becoming nuclear decreases to zero when all nations
are nuclear armed," (Sagan 1994, p. 66). The basis for the neorealists'
confidence in deterrence is the 'long peace' maintained between the
United States and the Soviet Union during the 'Cold War' (Sagan 1994, p.
66). [However, even supporters of 'managed' or 'planned' proliferation
in the neorealist school do not agree with uncontrolled nuclear
proliferation]{.underline} (Frankel 1993, p. 39). [In the debate
surrounding deterrence and its applicability to 'rogue states',
Mearsheimer stated that the "**logic of controlled proliferation might
not extend to Third World dictatorships**,"]{.underline} (Seliktar 2011,
p. 192).

For realists, IR theory is based on great power politics (Barkawi &
Laffey 2006, p. 331). [Neorealist and realist perspectives on nuclear
proliferation are based on '**rationality'** constructed via **Western
dominated narratives** of World War II and the 'Cold War']{.underline}
(Biswas, forthcoming 2012; Frankel 1993, p. 40). The Eurocentric IR
paradigm regards the weak and powerless as "marginal or derivative
elements of world politics," (Barkawi & Laffey 2006, p. 332).
[Rationality and objectivity are firmly attributed to 'great powers' as
demonstrated by the scholarly analysis of the 'Cuban Missile Crisis'.
Cubans were depicted as politicised, whereas Americans and Soviets were
characterised as apolitical]{.underline} (Barkawi & Laffey 2006, p.
338). [Agency rests on the 'great powers', while the security interests
and actions of 'weak' states in the 'Global South', such as Cuba, are
conveniently ignored or disregarded]{.underline} (Barkawi & Laffey 2006,
p. 329; Biswas, forthcoming 2012). [The one-sided and Eurocentric logic
of 'planned' proliferation, which promotes horizontal proliferation to
those states that neorealists deem 'rational' and 'objective' is merely
a **reproduction of the superpower-based 'Cold War' era
thinking**]{.underline}. [These ideologies disregarded the agency of the
'weak' and]{.underline} 'powerless', and the importance of the Global
South or 'Third World' in affecting international affairs, and
arbitrarily assigned rationality and objectivity to the great powers.

While [the end the 'Cold War']{.underline} transformed and ameliorated
much of the security concerns of Europe and the West, it [did little to
resolve the widespread feelings of insecurity elsewhere in the
world]{.underline} (Biswas, forthcoming 2012; Singh 1998, p. 41). [The
'Cold War' in many nonWestern parts of the world, including Vietnam,
Korea, Afghanistan, and the many other states that served as proxies for
superpower rivalry, were in fact **very real and very
'hot'**]{.underline} (Biswas, forthcoming 2012). [The deterrence logic
that serves as the fundamental basis for neorealist proliferation theory
has been derived from the postwar period of bipolarity]{.underline}
(Frankel 1993, p. 40). Through the myopic lenses of neorealist
proliferation theory, no consideration is given to 'vertical
proliferation' of the great powers, specifically in the United States
and Russia. Such proliferation is not viewed as a problem, nor is the
possibility of a global convention abolishing nuclear weapons, as
proposed by various nonaligned nations, especially India, been discussed
as a practical solution to the security dilemma that nuclear weapons
pose (Gusterson 1999, p. 114). [The 'managed' proliferation solution
that many neorealists ascribe to is nonetheless racialised and
Eurocentric.]{.underline} Waltz suggests that in a new multipolar world,
Germany, Japan, and possibly Italy should be allowed to acquire nuclear
weapons (Seliktar 2011, p. 192). ['Planned' or 'managed' proliferation
is simply a convenient euphemism for deciding which state should receive
approval to acquire nuclear weapons based on an arbitrary, Eurocentric,
and subjective assessment of rationality.]{.underline} The neorealist
perspective merely serves to perpetuate an already flawed and unequal
system, [continuing to put the 'West' or the 'North' on some type of
intellectual pedestal that affirms its own image of rationality and
objectivity, thereby denying any meaningful agency or possibility of
equality for all states in the world.]{.underline}

### Liberalism

#### Liberal uses of nuclear deterrence are an effort to [otherize]{.underline} non-western regions -- the west uses 'liberalism' and 'freedom' as a cover of for asserting their [superiority]{.underline} over the 'south' 

Alex H. **Chung 14**, MA in IR, PhD Candidate at the Department of
Occupational Therapy, Social Work and Social Policy, November 2014,
http://web.isanet.org/Web/Conferences/ISSS%20Austin%202014/Archive/253053b8-52cd-4251-8a5d-1dd0163cb460.pdf\\\\iris

Unlike neorealists, [liberals do not entirely disregard the existence of
'weak' states, but they are merely of interest, "primarily as bearers of
rights and objects of emancipation...for their normative value in
Western political theoretic terms,"]{.underline} (Barkawi & Laffey 2006,
p. 333). Whereas "realist approaches to security studies are Eurocentric
in that they locate agency and history with the great powers," [liberal
approaches are equally Eurocentric, in addition to defining the West "in
ethical and progressive terms,"]{.underline} (Barkawi & Laffey 2006, p.
340). In the Western imagination, [discourse on nuclear proliferation is
deeply entrenched in relation to the Third World, dividing the world
into states that can be trusted with nuclear weapons and those that
cannot]{.underline} (Gusterson 1999, p. 113). Liberals and conservatives
alike hold the following orthodox belief: "the proliferation of nuclear
weapons to nuclear-threshold states in the Third World, especially the
Islamic world, would be enormously dangerous," (Gusterson 1999, p. 112).
[Nuclear apartheid is justified in the liberal mindset, since western
democracies have the moral imperative and ethical superiority to
**impose their will for the good of the 'other'**.]{.underline}

Edward Said asserts that [Orientalist discourse demarcates the world in
a binary opposition]{.underline} that presents the 'Orient' as the
mirror image of the West, "[where 'we' are rational and disciplined;
'they are impulsive and emotional; where 'we' are modern and flexible,
'they' are slaves to ancient passions and routines; where 'we' are
honest and compassionate, 'they' are treacherous and
uncultivated,"]{.underline} (Gusterson 1999, p. 114). This Orientalist
process has an effect of [creating an **immense sense of 'Otherness'**
separating the Third World from liberal Western democracies, thereby
rationalising and internalising a sense of **liberal
'superiority'**]{.underline} (Gusterson 1999, p. 114). Empirically, this
construct of ethical superiority in the liberal West requires Orwellian
self-delusion. As purported by Barkawi & Laffey (2006, p. 341), [the
Holocaust presents a challenge to the liberal faith in the "Western
myths of progress and ethical superiority." To maintain the Western
belief in liberal superiority, the "sins of Western civilisation" are
displaced "onto an intrusive non-European Other...Germany, that
quintessentially Western society, somehow becomes not
Western,"]{.underline} (Barkawi & Laffey 2006, p. 341). Furthermore, the
brutal and [barbaric slaughter and loss of life amongst 'natives' was a
normative feature of European colonisation and expansion into the
non-European world]{.underline} (Barkawi & Laffey 2006, p. 343). As
observed by Sven Lindqvist, "the Holocaust was unique -- in Europe. But
the history of Western expansion in other parts of the world shows many
examples of total extermination of whole peoples," (Barkwai & Laffey
2006, p. 343).

[Liberal ideology legitimates domination over the Global
South.]{.underline} This can be observed via liberal Western discourse
on nuclear proliferation as it "legitimates the nuclear monopoly of the
recognised nuclear powers," (Gusterson 1999, p. 115). Much like
neorealism, ra[tionality and objectivity is arbitrarily assigned to the
West, while the Global South or 'Third World' is considered to be
**subjective, irrational, or even 'rogue'** and therefore incapable of
the responsibility of a nuclear arsenal. The inherent Eurocentricism in
liberal ideology directly results in a "taken-for-granted politics that
sides with the rulers, with the powerful, with the imperialists, and not
with the downtrodden, the weak, the colonised, or the
post-colonised,"]{.underline} (Barkawi & Laffey 2006, p. 344)

For example, [**Iran has been demonised** by the United States since the
Iranian Revolution in 1979, when citizens of the Islamic Republic laid
siege to the US embassy compound in Tehran, and took fifty-two American
hostages for 444 days]{.underline} (Zenko 2012). [Their suspected
nuclear weapons program and alleged sponsorship of terrorism have deemed
them a 'rogue state']{.underline} (BBC 2001; Munoz 2012). US President
Obama issued a warning to Iran in a September 2012 speech to the UN
General Assembly, stating unequivocally, "The United States will do what
we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon...It would
threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations and the
stability of the global economy," (ABC News 2012). [North
Korea]{.underline}, an NPT non-signatory and nuclear state [is perceived
to pursue "**alien objectives** which are normative anathema to the rest
of the '**civilised'** international system,"]{.underline} leading to
the assumption that the North Korean state is acting fundamentally
outside the norms of the global community, [and is therefore clearly a
"rogue state"]{.underline} (Smith 2000, p. 115). Nicholas Eberstadt
wrote that, "the North Korean regime is the North Korean nuclear
problem," (Smith 2000, p. 118).

[These Eurocentric and racist assumptions]{.underline} in liberal IR
theory [have led to obvious and problematic 'double standards' and
inequities in the treatment of non-Western states, exacerbated by the
existing Northern dominated nuclear non-proliferation
regime]{.underline}. While Iran has suffered debilitating economic
sanctions over suspicions of an unconfirmed clandestine nuclear weapons
program, Israel, one of only four NPT non-signatories, [and the sole
state in the Middle East that actually possesses nuclear weapons, has
remained free from any meaningful, significant, or even symbolic
international oversight]{.underline} (Steinbach 2011, p. 34). Warren
[Kozak]{.underline} (2012) [epitomises the unashamed and blatant
Eurocentricism of the liberal Western perspective on the issue of
nuclear proliferation]{.underline}:

### 2NC\-\--Russia/China

#### Securitization of Russia and China is a natural biproduct of American geopolitical culture\-\--the inherent desire for power recreates the security dilemmas of the 1AC

This article used a consistent set of primary sources, an explicit
methodology, and both qualitative and quantitative data to account for
the evolution of the current securitization process which portrays great
power competition, [in the form of Russia's and China's open challenge
to America's position in the international system, as an existential
threat to America's place in the international system]{.underline}.
While at some level the specific elements of this new narrative --
revisionism, the democracy-autocracy binary, and spheres of influence --
are revivals of Cold War tropes, [this analysis allowed for a better
understanding of the broader issues involved in how this narrative shift
reflects U.S. geopolitical culture, how it believes this challenge has
occurred, and how it perceives America's role in the changing
international system.]{.underline} From these, [the likely future of
American grand strategy and geopolitical culture is coming into clearer
focus]{.underline}. It is the open recognition that the geopolitical
status quo is actually slipping, a situation which some IRT scholars
have been saying for some time (Schweller and Pu 2011; Layne 2012;
Mearsheimer 2019), which has precipitated this narrative shift. **[This
demonstrates exactly how closely tied U.S. self-identity and
geopolitical culture are to the preservation of primacy, unipolarity,
and the liberal-democratic world order.]{.underline} [Should one or more
of these conditions fully collapse, then we are likely to see a dramatic
rupture in American geopolitical culture -- with a difficult
redefinition of its place in the world, a popular backlash, and
unpredictable results]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} Moreover, the
quantitative data reveal that this narrative shift has had less to do
with the growing capabilities of Russia/China than their ultimate goal
to promote a new global architecture based upon multipolarity[. The
ability of Russia's and China's nuclear programs to end the physical
existence of the U.S. has remained virtually the same since the end of
the Cold War, and while these states have begun closing the military and
technical gap between themselves and the U.S., this new geopolitical
narrative more closely corresponds to a notable rise in references to
their intentions, rather than capabilities]{.underline}. This is seen
most clearly by the fact that Russia's more overt challenge has resulted
in it being singled out as the more significant threat over China,
which, based upon raw current and future capabilities, is objectively a
far larger danger. [This raises important theoretical questions about
threat perceptions and securitization processes which seemingly have
more to do with perceptions about current and future aggressiveness than
capabilities]{.underline}. This invites further study. Finally, LeGreco
and Tracy (2009) noted that an equally important aspect of
discourse/narrative tracing is to track what is not said. [There was
little acknowledgment from the American side that it had a substantive
hand in precipitating these changes by either promoting a security
dilemma between itself, on the one hand, and China/Russia, on the other,
or that it has engaged in a grand strategy which has led to
overextension and imperial decline.]{.underline} Therefore, according to
this (self-)limited understanding on Washington's part, there appears
little that it can do to ameliorate the situation, and no course
correction is seen as necessary except for confronting these states when
their actions run contrary to U.S. interests. [If the pattern leading up
to the 2019 threat assessment is any indication, we are likely to see a
closer alignment between this intensified threat narrative and a
reinvigorated mission to preserve the status quo, without any
self-awareness that this policy may be self-defeating. America appears
to be firmly in the "'Try Harder!'" phase of strategic
thinking]{.underline}, to use Legro's (2005, 37) formulation. This is
reflected in the Trump administration's National Security Strategy
(NSS), which appears to double down on the strategy of pursuing American
primacy, even to the point of direct confrontation (Clarke and Ricketts
2017). By doing so, [these officials are neither preparing American
foreign policy nor its citizens for a revised geopolitical culture
better suited to ensure a soft-landing of unipolarity. Consequently, it
is likely that the United States "won't see \[the end\] coming until
it's too late,"]{.underline} as Schweller (2011) speculated. Thus, a
full accounting of why this broader structural change is occurring will
likely elude American policymakers for the foreseeable future, leading
to an [even weaker United States and more fraught great power relations
as the defining features of the international system and America's place
within it.]{.underline}

[How political relations among European and North American states have
developed and how they have contributed to shaping global politics more
broadly has been at the centre of IR debates for several
decades.]{.underline} Taking issue with both realist and
institutionalist scholarship on the origins and mechanisms of
inter-state alliances, [the literature on security
communities]{.underline} (Adler and Barnett 1998) [has highlighted the
constructivist bedrock argument that political order can be conceived of
only as the result of ongoing processes of social
interaction]{.underline}. Hence, at least two reasons as to why the
security community literature provides an instructive starting point
come to mind. First, [the security community approach originated as a
perspective attempting to transcend the state-centric perspective of IR
and, in particular, security studies]{.underline}. It thereby allows us,
second, [to conceive of 'the West' as a political space characterised by
transnational processes of political association and
integratio]{.underline}n. Political entities such as security
communities are not perceived as just being 'out there', but are seen as
the result of transformative processes such as the formation of
collective identities through social learning. Hence, as we share these
premises, choosing the security community literature as a foil to
develop our own argument means to engage relatively close kin. We can
thus not only deliberately refrain from restaging the arguments
vis-a\`-vis realist, liberal, and institutionalist accounts, we can also
focus more specifically on the dynamics by means of which 'the West' is
invoked, reproduced, and eventually transformed, for this is precisely
where we beg to differ with the storyline conventionally presented by
proponents of a security community approach. In a nutshell, we argue
that the literature on security communities simply does not go far
enough in stepping outside of the imaginative geographies characterized
above.

The initial work on security communities that was conducted in the 1950s
by Deutsch et al. (1957/1968) was driven by an interest in identifying
the complex processes and mechanisms which enabled the permanent
elimination of war between states, in particular in the 'North Atlantic
area'. They focused on 'integration' as a complex process by which
security communities might come about. Most importantly they were
interested in examining how a 'sense of community', central to their
account of 'integration', could take shape in diverse and unique
historical circumstances.

In discussing the issue of how one ought to distinguish between
'integration' and 'non-integration' Deutsch and his collaborators argued
that the achievement of a security community would have to involve
'something like the crossing of a threshold'. The problem was that
\[s\]omewhat contrary to our expectation \[y\] some of our cases taught
us that integration may involve a fairly broad zone of transition rather
than a narrow threshold; that states may cross and recross this
threshold or zone of transition several times in their relations with
each other; and that they might spend decades or generations wavering
uncertainly within it. (ibid.: 32--33)

Thus, not only did integration turn out to be a rather complex process
involving at least a dozen 'essential conditions' (ibid.: 58), it was
also evolving along unique historical trajectories in uneven ways. As a
result, Deutsch and his colleagues concluded that a 'sense of community'
should not be applied 'as a matter of static agreement' and that 'more
could be learned by viewing it as a matter of dynamic process' (ibid.:
37).

This keen sense of the processual complexity and non-linearity of
political integration got by and large lost in subsequent research on
security communities in general and in research on the transatlantic
security community in particular. Rather than taking Deutsch's warning
about the 'uncertain wavering' between integration and non-integration
seriously, the research agenda on security communities was increasingly
shaped by a premise 'that community exists at the international level'
(Adler and Barnett 1998: 3, italics added). Moreover, rather than
dwelling on the Deutschian twilight zone between integration and
non-integration, Adler and Barnett suggested looking for various groups
of states that seemed to have abandoned the use of force in their
relations in order to determine whether they fit the definition of a
pluralistic security community. In particular, researchers were advised
to 'look for communities where actors have shared identities, values,
and meanings, many-sided relations, and long-term reciprocity' (ibid.:
33). If these criteria were met, and the citizens of these states held
'dependable expectations of peaceful change', then we would have reason
to speak of a security community.

Not only does such a perspective neglect Deutsch's interest in
open-ended transformative processes, it also embraces a strong
methodological preference for detecting something, which is both
theoretically proclaimed and normatively embraced. Researchers, then,
may lose a thorough and systematic reconstruction of social dynamics and
contingencies out of sight. Pointing to the 19th-century heritage of the
term, Charles Tilly (1998: 397) offers a particularly clear-cut
elaboration of the problem: A haze of Paradigm Lost still surrounds the
word 'community' in popular parlance, the social sciences, philosophy,
and history. Calling up idealized images of solidarity and coherent
identity in compact settlements before the advent of today's complexity,
the term almost inevitably evokes a mixture of description, sentiment,
and moral principle. Users of the term with respect to international
relations are usually hoping to create or restore solidarity among
nations. This volume \[Adler and Barnett 1998\], with its quest not
merely to identify but also to promote security communities, manifests
just such a hope.

Much like Tilly, we share the hope but remain troubled when it seems to
impinge on the actual research process. In his work on the endurance of
the transatlantic security community after 1990, Thomas Risse, for
instance, similarly focused on postulating the existence of such a
community as the key variable in explaining transatlantic cohesion.
Instead of taking NATO as an institutional solution to deal with a
multifaceted set of threats and risks (as realists would do), he argues
that the alliance was the expression of an underlying community of
shared values built on 'mutual sympathy, trust, and consideration'
(Risse-Kappen 1996: 368). In this reading a 'Western' perception of a
'Soviet threat' certainly helped to foster a sense of common purpose
within NATO, but according to Risse 'it did not create the community in
the first place'. Rather, 'the collective identity led to the threat
perception, not the other way around' (Risse-Kappen 1995: 32). In this
view the creation and persistence of the North Atlantic Alliance could
be explained as the institutional expression of 'the values and norms
embedded in the political culture of liberal democracies', which
together constituted the 'collective identity of a security community
among democracies' (Risse-Kappen 1996: 370; Schimmelfennig 1998:
213--4). As long as these values and norms are not seriously challenged
by its members, 'the West' appears as an impressively stable security
community in which conflicts are still resolved peacefully (Pouliot
2006; critically Cox 2005).

In contrast to Deutsch's initial work, this type of research is not
particularly interested in the complex processes that lead to the
creation of security communities in the first place. Instead, it takes
the existence of a transatlantic security community already for granted
and appears to accept, at least implicitly, an essentialist conception
of community. Once again, a 'we-concept' is taken to be based on a set
of values and norms, which are always already there. To be sure, most
scholarship on security communities acknowledges that security
communities are constructed in social interaction. However, rather than
focusing on such interactions and reconstructing the ensuing complex
processes empirically, Deutsch's successors often propose models with
preestablished definitions of 'conducive factors' and 'necessary
conditions' that supposedly foster the development or persistence of
security communities. Adler and Barnett (1998: 37), for instance,
concede that they do this in a 'highly stylized manner'. Yet, they feel
obliged to do so in order to overcome two drawbacks associated with
Deutsch's operationalization of security communities: (1) the concept
was resistant to precise operationalization because it was fuzzy and
ill-defined; and, (2) while Deutsch's behavioral methodology was able to
capture increased transboundary movements that suggested
interdependence, it could not detect a greater sense of cohesion and
community based on mutual responsiveness, value orientation, and
identity. The current challenge is to devise indicators that overcome
these shortcomings. (ibid.: 48--49, italics added)

In other words, where Deutsch's processualism cautioned against a
constricted fixation on abstract 'indicators', the approach adopted by
Adler and Barnett narrowly circumscribes the problem of how inter-state
communities emerge by formal definitions from the very beginning. The
actual efforts are then directed at identifying already existing
security communities and then to determine whether they qualify as
'loosely coupled' or 'tightly coupled'. Hence, the second generation of
security community researchers not only assumes that communities and
shared values already exist, but also focuses methodologically on
identifying indicators instead of analysing processes. However, while
many of the substantive claims of the second generation sound quite
plausible, it remains methodologically unclear how to decide, for
example, whether groups of states do indeed have 'shared identities' or
whether their relations are characterised by 'long-term reciprocity'.
Some critics have therefore objected that Adler and Barnett's framework
was 'not backed by a compelling method of empirical investigation'
(Bially Mattern 2000: 303). Their discussion of questions of research
design suggests that scholars could easily identify features of security
communities that self-evidently exist, just waiting to be discovered.
This understanding seems to rest on the belief that security communities
were 'out there', independent of the concepts social scientists apply
(Jackson 2008: 134--43).

Yet, [to treat democratic values or human rights, for instance, as
attributes that specific societies possess or acquire is to conceal the
intersubjective construction of these concepts and to ignore their
productive, even hegemonic power]{.underline}. This is the reason why
Iver Neumann and Michael Williams [have proposed that constructivist
analyses of NATO's enlargement should consider the alliance's
self-description as a 'democratic security community]{.underline}' not
as an unproblematic fact but as a way of exercising symbolic power.
[Claiming a democratic identity can then be interpreted as a political
practice that assigns legitimacy to NATO's actions]{.underline} and at
the same time structures the realm of possibilities for acceptable
Russian self-conceptions. Hence, [the 'capacity to claim such
identities, and to grant and deny them to others, is a source of social
power']{.underline} (Williams and Neumann 2000: 364).

A[n approach that treats references to common Western values as evidence
for an alleged reality --- the existence of a transatlantic security
community --- risks committing an essentialist fallacy by taking the
invocation of these depictions at face value.]{.underline} One
problematic consequence of such an account is that it becomes
methodologically impossible to distinguish between a political assertion
of 'shared values' and its performative effects. [Assuming an already
existing transatlantic security community with certain 'shared values'
and a 'collective identity' tends to reify prevalent notions of
political discourse instead of interpreting them as an element in
processes of social construction.]{.underline} In our view, [claims to a
democratic identity of NATO or public commitments to human rights
constitute a valuable body of empirical material that social scientists
ought to be interested]{.underline} in. However, [instead of treating
them as evidence for an alleged 'Western' identity, we suggest treating
them as a distinct and powerful move in a political
struggle]{.underline} (Jackson 2006b). [Invocation of 'Western values'
or a 'democratic identity' can then be interpreted with regard to their
performative effects and institutional consequences.]{.underline}

Thus, [instead of presupposing the existence of an Atlantic security
community, we are interested in reconstructing processes of community
formation, that is, processes that lead to the evolution, reproduction
and transformation of an inter-state political space commonly described
as 'the West']{.underline} (e.g., Jackson 2003; Bially Mattern 2005).
Just like Deutsch and his colleagues, we assume that political orders
are integrated via the construction and reproduction of a sense of
community in complex and non-linear dynamic processes. However, in
contrast to the initial work on security communities, which focused on
measuring the quantity and density of transactions, we propose that the
emergence and the reproduction of a sense of community should be studied
by focusing on the productive power of representations in contingent
processes of signification. [As these processes of community formation
are open ended and nonlinear, they can be reconstructed from within by
interpreting how contentious references to 'the West' operate in
political discourse.]{.underline}

Environmental security as ontological politics

To account for the materiality of the visual and for the special role of
visual technologies in the construction of environmental security, I
reread the existing literature on environmental security through the
lens of ANT and the notion of ontological politics. In short, ANT
radicalizes the assumptions of linguistic or visual constructivism.
Instead of viewing texts, images, and other semiotic systems as
representations of a pre-existing single reality, it holds that the
interplay of expert practices, scientific discourses, technologies, and
visuals constitutes *multiple realities* ([Hind and Lammes,
2016](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
81--82). Annemarie [Mol
(2002)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399),
for example, shows through her long-term ethnographic research in Dutch
hospitals how different medical practices and diagnostic tools produce
multiple versions of atherosclerosis. To assume that phenomena are
multiple implies they are 'more than one but less than many' ([Mol,
2002](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
55). According to this understanding, ontology 'is not given in the
order of things but ... ontologies are brought into being, sustained, or
allowed to wither away in common, day-to-day, sociomaterial practices'
([Mol,
2002](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
6). As Ingunn [Moser
(2008](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
99) puts it, natural realities become 'matter-real' and are 'mattering'
only through their 'continued enactment and re-enactment in situated
practices'. Following these assumptions, environmental security can be
understood as a form of ontological politics, in which the ontological
status of phenomena such as climate change, deforestation, or natural
disasters -- as well as the ways of knowing them -- becomes the subject
of debate ([Barry,
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
7; [Schouten,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399)).

I argue that [visual technologies such as [satellite]{.mark} remote
sensing [play]{.mark} a [crucial role in]{.mark} the
[ontological]{.mark} politics of [environmental
security]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider Mol's seminal work in the
ontological politics of disease. A large share of the practices that
render a disease such as atherosclerosis 'matter-real' are based on
visual technologies: X-ray units, MRI scanners, microscopes, molecular
imaging techniques, etc. The same holds true for the realm of
environmental security. [Here, visual technologies, including computer
modeling, [satellite remote sensing]{.mark}, data visualization, hotspot
mapping, and graphs of future scenarios, [enact different versions of
'the environment' as security risk]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Randalls,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399)).
[[Rather than producing]{.mark} mere [representations of pre-existing
environmental risks, visual technologies]{.mark} essentially [**bring
them about**: 'The world does not exist before these ways of
sensing]{.mark}']{.underline} ([Hind and Lammes,
2016](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
90). For, as [Mitchell
(2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
233) crucially reminds us, 'Nature is unable to speak for itself....
[The facts of [nature speak only with]{.mark} the [help of measuring
devices and tools of calculation]{.mark}']{.underline}. To render a
phenomenon such as climate change visible, intelligible, and thereby
'matter-ing' and 'matter-real', a global assemblage of visual
technologies -- including satellites, weather stations, computer
simulations, researchers, and mechanisms of international cooperation --
is required ([Edwards,
2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399); [Wark,
2015](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
166--182).

[To study visual technologies as part of the ontological politics of
environmental security, I first draw on the notion of immutable
mobiles]{.underline} ([Latour,
1986](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399)).
Bruno Latour has coined this term to explain the power effects of
'technologies of visualisation and inscription' ([Latour,
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
77), such as the printing press, cartography, photography, or the
computer, that allow inscribing parts of the real world into flat and
mobile artifacts ([Latour,
1986](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
17). [[Through these technologies, reality becomes
flattened]{.mark}**,** mobile but immutable. Inscribed into pictures,
maps, or charts, inscriptions of local realities -- such as a piece of
soil -- can be circulated globally, reproduced, or combined with other
inscriptions of reality]{.underline}. Pictures of different origin and
different scale can be layered ([Latour,
1986](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
7).

Second, I draw upon the notion of *visual assemblage* ([Bleiker,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
76) to account for the fact that environmental risks and threats are
never produced by a single technology -- never become visible on a
single image -- but become enacted by a complex web of linked
inscription devices, practices, and discourses ([Latour and Hermant,
2006](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
29). The notion of assemblage refers to a temporary form of order of
heterogeneous elements 'whose unity comes solely from the fact that
these items function together, that they "work" together as a functional
entity' ([Patton,
1994](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
158). The visual assemblage of environmental security can be understood
as exactly such a heterogeneous network of visual technologies and
related infrastructures, people, laws and regulations, discourses, and
practices ([van Munster and Sylvest,
2016](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
2[). The immutable mobiles ([satellite pictures]{.mark}, global climate
models, vulnerability maps), which circulate through this assemblage,
create new associative relations between actors as diverse as satellite
operators, climate scientists, environmental activists, or military
officials ([Mayer,
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399)).
Together they [turn 'nature' into a range of calculable, perceivable,
and governable risks through a series of calculations,
transformations]{.mark}, [and translations]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Hind
and Lammes,
2016](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399)).
The notion of visual assemblage makes it possible to account both for
the socio-material character of the visual and for the messiness and
multiplicity of practices and discourses of environmental security.

Using the framework in practice

The perspective of assemblage calls for a pluralization of methods in
the study of visual politics ([Bleiker,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399)).
To grasp the social/technical/discursive/visual character of visual
assemblages, I combine three analytical layers. The first analytical
layer is a semiotic visual analysis ([Rose,
2016](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
106--146). A corpus of highly visible demonstration images -- provided
on websites, in demonstration reports, in social networks, or in
demonstration videos -- has been compiled in each case. Such showcase
images are particularly promising for the objectives of this article
because they are pre-selected by the respective actors to demonstrate
the whole range of possible applications and capabilities of satellite
imagery. A set of heuristic questions helps to structure the analysis:
What do the images show and what is hidden? Are there common visual
characteristics or patterns? How are images arranged and how are colors
used? And what are the aesthetic and political effects of decisions on
the composition, color, framing, or resolution of
images?[^1^](javascript:popRef('fn1-0967010617709399')) Second, a
discourse-analytical layer reveals the interdiscursive context of images
through a study of the reports, homepages, flyers, or policy documents
in which they are embedded ([Rose,
2016](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
186--219). Here, I ask how the different texts ascribe meaning to the
images, and how the latter become linked to broader concepts,
narratives, and storylines in environmental security discourse. A third
layer focuses on the performativity of images as immutable mobiles and
their function in broader visual assemblages. So, here the question is
what visuals do rather than what they show: How are images produced by
broader visual assemblages? How are they circulated or blocked? And how
do they enact different versions of the environment? To study this third
layer, I draw on a comprehensive review of the relevant secondary
literature, combined with a thorough document analysis of legislation,
regulations, and related policy documents in each case.

The co-evolution of remote sensing and environmental security

The roots of the visual assemblage of environmental security can be
traced back to the militarization of geophysical research in the early
years of the Cold War ([Dalby,
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
41). [With its successful launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 during
the so-called International Geophysical Year, the Soviet Union fired the
starting pistol for a technological and scientific race between the two
superpowers. As a crucial part of this race, satellite remote sensing
emerged as a dual-use technology, or 'cyborg science -- the result of an
irreparable fusion of scientific and military concepts, materials and
skills']{.underline} ([Elam,
1999](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
106). At the same time, the strategic communities' interest in the
atmospheric impact of nuclear weapons boosted advancements in numerical
weather modeling, which in the 1960s were further developed into the
first simulation models of global climate change. The ever more detailed
global models at the same time produced 'an insatiable thirst for data
from every corner of the world' ([Edwards,
2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
24), which since the late 1970s and 1980s was increasingly satisfied by
satellite-based remote sensors. In addition, in 1972 the US
administration established the Landsat program within the US National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as the first civilian
satellite remote sensing program. The program's eight satellites
provided multispectral Earth imagery at moderate spatial resolution --
perfectly suited for land (change) monitoring -- and thereby contributed
considerably to the discovery of macro-scale environmental problems,
including deforestation, land degradation, and the ozone hole
([DeLoughrey,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
261).

NASA's Landsat and other emerging remote sensing programs can be
considered as parts of an emerging visual assemblage of heterogeneous
human and non-human components ([Barry,
2013](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
14; [Edwards,
2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399)).
This assemblage includes hardware such as satellites, sensors, ground
stations, and data centers; imagery-processing-and-analysis software;
data such as images or digital maps; human actors like system operators,
policymakers, scientists, and national security personnel; and legal and
regulatory frameworks ([Thompson,
2007](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
2). The capacity to 'see' environmental problems, and to see the planet
from a distance, is distributed across this visual assemblage. Neither
the satellites, which translate the electromagnetic radiation reflected
from the Earth's surfaces into numerical grey-values, nor the operators
in the control room, which process 'wavelengths in false colours'
([Latour and Hermant,
2006](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
8), nor the software tools that turn the data into realistic true-color
images, nor the analysts or algorithms that interpret the resulting
images would be able see anything were it not for the other elements in
the assemblage.

A securitization precursor

I would argue that [[there was a close co-evolution between]{.mark} the
emergence of a global visual assemblage of [satellite remote sensing
and]{.mark} the emerging [discourse on environmental security]{.mark} in
the 1980s and 1990s. The [notion of co-evolution stresses]{.mark} the
[reciprocity of this development.]{.mark} [While]{.mark} the
[satellite]{.mark} gaze [made it possible to **conceive of environmental
change as a global threat** in the first place]{.mark}]{.underline}
([Van Munster and Sylvest,
2016](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
6[), environmental security also became inscribed into technical
decisions]{.underline}, for example when Landsat's remote sensors were
optimized to monitor land change and resource degradation. [The mutual
imbrication of satellite technology and environmental security played
out at several levels. First, the [militarization of]{.mark}
[geophysical research during the Cold War created]{.mark} new
[associations between geoscientists and security actors that were
crucial for]{.mark} the emerging [imaginary of the environment as a
security problem]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Marzec
(2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
244) describes how this emerging actor-network led, for example, to the
US defense and intelligence community's interest in climate change in
the early 1990s:

In 1992 the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) began to establish
relations with climate scientists in the program Measurements of Earth
Data for Environmental Analysis, or MEDEA, when it declassified
satellite imagery for 'patriotic' climate scientists.

Second, [the described [visual assemblage enabled a new 'way of seeing'
the Earth]{.mark} and the human environment, which might be called
a planetary gaze ]{.underline}([DeLoughrey,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399); [Jasanoff,
2004](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
44). The new possibility to look at the planet from the outside produced
a sense both of the earth's singularity and of its radical fragility[.
The [planetary gaze produced]{.mark} a certain [uncanniness]{.mark} --
[a feeling of being detached from]{.mark} planet
[Earth]{.mark}]{.underline} ([DeLoughrey,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
264). [In so doing, the [planetary gaze invoked deep-rooted
**'apocalyptic fears about the end of the earth**]{.mark}']{.underline}
([DeLoughrey,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
266). [This sense of [urgency created by satellite]{.mark} remote
sensing [resonated]{.mark} well [with]{.mark} the early [environmental
security]{.mark} debate in the 1990s [and]{.mark} its [alarmist
tone]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Marzec,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
235). Yet [the [planetary gaze]{.mark} of the described
visual]{.underline} assemblage did not simply produce another discursive
frame of a pre-existing environment. Rather, [it [constituted a whole
new reality of the Earth as a singular, interconnected,]{.mark} and
[fragile system]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Van Munster and Sylvest,
2016](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
4--8). This fragile Earth system became 'matter-real' through the
immutable mobiles -- such as true-color satellite images, simulation
models, graphs, or numerical calculations -- produced by two central
inscription technologies: satellite remote sensing and computer modeling
([Edwards,
2010](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
2). [[By developing these technologies]{.mark} into a
comprehensive global monitoring system[, it was believed it would be
possible to]{.mark} monitor, **[predict, control, and manage the Earth
system]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}([Jasanoff,
2004](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
42; [Marzec,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399):
245). [This global monitoring approach, which highlighted the role of
national leaders as planetary or environmental managers, considerably
influenced the early environmental security debate.]{.underline}

Third, [the [focus of]{.mark} the early [environmental security
debate]{.mark} in the 1990s [was on]{.mark} large-scale global [problems
such as scarcity-induced conflict or migration]{.mark}]{.underline}
([Rothe,
2016](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/0967010617709399)).
[The [detection of these]{.mark} large-scale [problems was closely
linked to the **technical capabilities of satellite remote
sensing**]{.mark}, for [to detect]{.mark} large-scale, slow-onset
[changes like land degradation and resulting scarcities, an abstracted,
distant view from above was required]{.mark}]{.underline}. What is more,
multispectral sensors, such as those carried by Landsat satellites, made
it possible to visualize processes of plant degradation in the infrared
range of radiation. To be precise, these [large-scale environmental
changes were considered as drivers of conflict and migration in the
early environmental security discourse. Remote sensors and their
planetary gaze thus considerably influenced the epistemological
horizon of environmental security thinking.]{.underline}

#### Discourse surrounding the threat of China's cyberattacks on satellites and space assets is based on a [realist]{.underline} sense of security \-\-- [empirics]{.underline}

Francois **Lachapelle 22**, PhD in Department of Sociology at the
University of British Columbia and research fellow with the Center for
Chinese Research (CCR) at the Institute of Asian Research (UBC) and the

and the Racist "China-Threat" Discourse --- Ascension, Peak, and
Downfall", University of British Columbia,
<https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/be2q5> /lg

During this period, the theme of China's cyber-technology dominated
American print media. This focus reflected two related changes in U.S.
foreign policy. Both Washington and Beijing grew increasingly worried
about their each other's cyber-capabilities (Lindsay, Cheung, and
Reveron, 2015; Reveron, 2012), and the newspapers captured a clear
securitization of the U.S.-China relationship. In February 2010, less
than a month after the Google attack, in another front-cover, the media
explained the Obama administration's decision to "explicitly \[accuse\]
China's military of mounting attacks on American government computer
systems and defense contractors" to map "military capabilities that
could be exploited during a crisis."41 Washington's accusation that
Beijing had a "deliberate, government-developed strategy to steal
intellectual property and gain strategic advantage"42 was based on an
annual Pentagon report indicating that 90% of cyber-attacks against the
U.S. came from China. [The [China-Threat discourse]{.mark} was [taking
hold]{.mark} not merely [in]{.mark} the [political field]{.mark}, but in
the White House as well. In 2011, with China in mind, President [Obama
wrote that "the cyber threat to our nation is]{.mark} one of the most
[serious economic and national security challenge]{.mark}s we
face"]{.underline} (in Lindsay, 2015:2). [[The same article]{.mark}
[citing the Pentagon's report includes several securitizers' views
describing a typically **alarmist offensive-realism worst-case
scenario** in which China's increased military power]{.mark}
([e.g.]{.mark}, drones, air flights, icebreakers,
**[satellites]{.mark}**) [was equated with imminent belligerent
behavior]{.mark}. Consider the following [example: "China]{.mark}
\[...\] [has]{.mark} now [leapt into]{.mark} the first ranks of
[offensive cybertechnologies]{.mark} \[...\] [in an effort to **blind
American satellites and other space assets**]{.mark}, and \[...\] push
the United States military presence into the mid-Pacific nearly 2,000
miles from China's coast."43  ]{.underline}

#### Satellite images can be used by presidents to [define reality]{.underline} in a way that makes it impossible for the public to critique or question the notion of a threat \-\-- causes threat construction and [pre-emptive action]{.underline}

Presidential definition. The last function or technique of presidential
public address that I examine in this chapter is the use of definition[.
President Bush's attempts to shape public memory highlights the fluidity
of social reality. In a postmodern sense, [social reality is
fluid]{.mark}, pliable, and full of potential. [It is not a given,
natural, or predetermined state of affairs]{.mark}. Instead, it is
chosen from a multiplicity of possibilities]{.underline}. Zarefsky
(2004) contends that [[political actors contribute to]{.mark} the
[production of social reality]{.mark} and that people actively
participate in shaping and giving meaning to the world around
them]{.underline}. The primary way that people constitute their social
reality is through naming the world around them. [[By naming a
situation, people shape the context for understanding social
reality]{.mark}]{.underline} and determine the parameters for
engagement. Therefore, the ability to define and name is rhetorically
very powerful. [[Defining]{.mark} is the power to identify, name, and
bring forth or allow something new to emerge into a field of
signification]{.underline}. In addition to allowing new meanings and
signs to be constituted and emerge, definitions also frame how something
should be understood. [It [dictates what something is, what value it
has, and the meaning that it signifies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Zarefsky (2004) argues that the [office of the [president has a
sustainable ability to define political reality]{.mark}. The president
has unique access and authority to communicate with a wide range of
audiences]{.underline}. For instance, the president can address the
nation through an electronic broadcast, communicate with the press and
shape the context in which the public encounter specific events, and
speak directly with policy-makers in Congress. [By choosing to define
political situations in specific ways with these audiences, the
[**president is able to frame reality** as if it were natural and
uncontestable rather than selected and open to critique]{.mark} or
discussion.]{.underline} Furthermore, through framing, the president can
dictate what constitutes credible and worthy arguments, data, and proof
(Zarefsky, 2004[). Take for example, the evidence offered by the [Bush
administration]{.mark} to prove that Iraq had weapons of mass
destruction. The Administration [provided **satellite images of what it
considered to be proof** that Iraq possessed
WMDs]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [However, [the satellite data could
only be analyzed and understood by technical experts]{.mark}.
Consequently, [Bush was able to define Iraq as a threat]{.mark} to U.S.
national security [by **controlling what counted as sufficient
evidence.** This control]{.mark} of what constituted data [prevented the
public]{.mark} [from challenging the presidential definition]{.mark} of
WMD threat]{.underline} because it was incapable of analyzing the
evidence that was being presented to them and contesting was it was
ample proof[. Therefore, [the way that the]{.mark} American [public
understood the situation]{.mark} in Iraq [was **framed in terms of
threat construction**]{.mark}]{.underline} that foreclosed or
discredited any discussion about whether or not Iraq posed an actual
threat to national security. 

Additionally, by defining Iraq as a terrorist and WMD threat, [[Bush was
able to control]{.mark} the [discussion about]{.mark} appropriate
[courses of actions]{.mark} in response to the risk. [If Iraq has
WMDs]{.mark}, then the [U.S. was justified in taking **pre-emptive
action**]{.mark} to eliminate WMD use]{.underline}. Furthermore,
presidential definition invited moral judgments that concluded that
Saddam Hussain and his regime was evil and oppressive and warranted
elimination. This was done in two parts: first, [[Iraq]{.mark} was
included in the "Axis of Evil" that [was **defined as the primary
enemy**]{.mark} facing the U.S]{.underline}.; second, Hussain's regime
was bad enough to justify one war against it and now there are claims of
WMD possession. Such an evil and oppression regime necessarily had to be
invaded through the definitional logic of the Bush administration. 

#### Modern, post-apocalyptic governments are forced to counteract [imagined threats]{.underline} like [solar storms]{.underline} \-\-- citizens expect to be sheltered from unimportant or [unlikely scenarios]{.underline}

Those who, with Beck, Adam, and others, consider our present-day
timescape to be a secular apocalyptic one, also have to acknowledge the
fact that today's security policies are completely imbued with this way
of thinking and living (Beck 1986, 1999, 2002; Adam and Van Loon 2000;
Mythen and Walklate 2006). Governments and international institutions
have to deal on a daily basis with the control paradox that calls for
human and technological resources to solve problems that are themselves
caused by new scientific discoveries and techno- logical innovations or
at least come to us via that route. Terrorist organizations, such as
isis, which inundate the world '24/7' on YouTube and Twitter with images
of death and destruction, quickly appropriate new technologies to fur-
ther their cause. These wreakers of havoc and horror are, of course,
themselves products of modern times: they use the most modern weapons
and means of communication and they are, as in the case of isis,
sometimes the product of human intervention and military mismanagement
in the Middle East.

[An important characteristic of contemporary safety thinking is the
expan- sion of security in time and space into the realm of the
imaginary]{.underline}. Security is a linear concept[. Old-fashioned
security policy assumes a concrete threat, somewhere on the horizon, the
harm of which can be assessed using all kinds of calculation and
planning resources]{.underline}. How long will it take before the
hostile army is at the gates, the rocket has reached its goal, the water
level has risen so high that the dam will break those kinds of
calculations[. A risk relates to probability and imagination. [A risk
cannot always be calculated, or the risk is so small that it is
statistically insignificant, yet]{.mark} bad enough that it must surely
be [included in]{.mark} the [plan, such as]{.mark} a terrorist attack or
a **[solar storm]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The [current safety culture
is]{.mark} more [a risk culture]{.mark} [in which **imagined futures and
worst-case scenarios** are visualized,]{.mark} using the latest computer
simulation techniques. [This]{.mark} then [leads to]{.mark} all kinds of
[exaggerated expectations that governments need to respond to
with]{.mark} equally comprehensive and [proactive measures]{.mark}
because before you know it,]{.underline} \...3

This brings us back to the definition of the beginning: [[security
is]{.mark} not just about a physical state of being, but also
[about]{.mark} our future expectations and there- fore about [our
feelings and]{.mark} the things that capture our [imagination]{.mark}.
And [in the current timescape]{.mark} these feelings and images tend to
get overheated quickly]{.underline}. The criminologist Hans Boutellier
explained that today's feelings of insecurity and uneasiness are
bolstered up by our post-Cold War condition of living in a 'network
society'. This is a society that is characterized by the loss of
familiar social settings, by increased diversity, and complexities
greater than ever be- fore (Boutellier 2002/2005; Castells 1996).
Boutellier then states, following the sociologist Zygmunt Baumann
(Baumann 2001a, 2001b), that the moral uncer- tainty that these shifting
sands engender is exactly what generates additional calls for security
(Oppelaar and Wittebrood 2006, 34). The disappearance of familiar
hierarchies and institutions has made citizens more sensitive to inse-
curity sooner. The aforementioned Ulrich Beck likewise made the case
that the [[post-materialistic citizens of]{.mark} the [free West]{.mark}
simply [have]{.mark} [difficulty coping with]{.mark} personal [mishaps,
failures, or setbacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} Individual development and
manufac- turability have a downside: breakdown and tragedies are no
longer accepted. [[Modern citizens work harder at insuring]{.mark}
('protecting') [themselves against damage, inconvenience, or
misfortune]{.mark}. But [they]{.mark} also increasingly [demand]{.mark}
of [the state]{.mark} that it [**shelter them from threat and harm**.
Even though many neoliberal governments are not in]{.mark} a [position
to provide that level of security]{.mark}, all the while the
[reported]{.mark} number of [threats]{.mark} (real and [imagined) is
increasing]{.mark}.]{.underline}

One security expert wrote cynically that the only thing left for
[[authorities in this post-apocalyptic modern]{.mark} [timescape]{.mark}
to do is 'to **[feign control over the
uncontrollable']{.mark}**]{.underline} -- as though the only thing that
seems to matter nowadays is the appearance of security and effective
risk management (Beck 2002, 41; 1999). Risk management has thus also
become a mode of governance; risk researchers speak of 'risk
governance', (Van Asselt 2005; Van Asselt and Van Bree 2011) or of risk
management as a paradoxical (because it is per defini- tion
uncontrollable) 'taming of the future' (Aradau and Van Munster 2008).
[In fact, primary risk management (trying to control the actual risk)
is, as a result, increasingly being replaced by secondary risk
management: a form of deci- sion-making aimed at covering (up), or at
least hedging, the secondary risk of administrative
failure]{.underline}. What happens then is that a lack of clarity
regarding who is accountable in uncertain situations -- which is a
typical characteristic of the 'new security thinking' -- tends to reduce
decision-making to a set of stan- dard protocols and security scenarios,
which in effect offers a formalized, but often highly superficial,
short-sighted and façade-like grid to allocate political responsibility
for 'decisions which must be made in potentially undecidable situations'
(Power 2004, 10). Although this may present itself as accountable and
effective decision-making and control, the primary risk of the impending
threat has, of course, not properly been addressed.

4.2. Boundary expansion I: Galileo merging science and politics

[The first attempt of a jointly developed space infrastructure by both
organisations was the navigation [satellite]{.mark} constellation
[Galileo]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the EU, Galileo had been driven by
worries that Europe would be overly dependent on the US American Global
Positioning Systems (GPS), with user requirement standards and
certification schemes for the security-relevant equipment being set
outside of Europe (EC
Communication [1994](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)).
EU policymakers had just made the experience of what techno-political
dependence means for decision-making processes in conflict situations:
During the Balkans conflicts in the 1990s, US authorities denied
European actors access to US satellite data of conflict regions. As
Darnis *et al*.
([2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039))
have argued, this was a "wake-up call for Europe" in many different
ways: not only was an armed conflict taking place on European soil after
decades of peace, but satellite capabilities for data gathering and
communication could be easily disposed of by the US and Europe was
lacking its own.

[Space technology was now [seen as critical enabling infrastructure for
defence, leading]{.mark} several [EU]{.mark} members [to
increase]{.mark} or create [space capabilities]{.mark} also [for
security and military usages]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most notably, after
the Balkan wars, [**"[space for security]{.mark}**" had [emerged as a
**powerful paradigm in EU space policymaking**]{.mark}
(]{.underline}Darnis *et
al*. [2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
p. 4).

However, the different actors involved in setting-up Galileo began to
draw boundaries around its security and military usage. Galileo is owned
and funded by the EU, but designed and operated by ESA. Despite its
technopolitical legacy, Galileo is defined as "a civil program under
civil control" which does, however, not exclude military usages of its
encrypted regulated service (Hoerber and
Stephenson [2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)).
[According to the EC, Galileo, "constitutes sensitive infrastructure,
the deployment and usage of which are susceptible to affect the security
of the European Union and its Member States]{.underline}"
(EC [2014](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)).
As a form of doing techno-politics -- "the strategic practice of
designing or using technology to constitute, embody, or enact political
goals"
(Hecht [1996](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
p. 15). Galileo and European ([[space]{.mark}) security were now much
more [closely tied to visions of European integration in a changing
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, [[space development]{.mark} was
now [framed as]{.mark} "the concrete translation of a common democratic
European political project", with applications like Galileo [being
"directly linked to Europe's role in the world]{.mark}]{.underline}"
(Giegerich [2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)[).
[Galileo]{.mark} was seen as a collaboration between the EU's [political
interest]{.mark}s [in using space for security]{.mark} and ESA's
scientific and technical expertise in the field of navigation, and it
laid the foundation for ESA's involvement in military space activities
and subsequent boundary work]{.underline}. Interestingly, both actors
framed Galileo's purpose in different ways.

[The EU emphasised that [Galileo]{.mark} as a "European system for
European citizens" would [give]{.mark} "[Europe freedom in its security
missions]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Darnis *et
al*. [2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)).
In turn, ESA aimed at downplaying the crucial military components of
Galileo in public accounts and instead stressed the benefits for the
general public, such as environmental protection and its use for science
(Slijper [2008](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
p. 40).

Yet, the experiences from collaborating with the EU on Galileo and the
subsequent need to adapt to EU security regulations when handling
classified information started a long and controversial process of
"institutional soul-searching" (IP2) about ESA's involvement in military
and security-related space activities. Several debates were held at
ESA's ministerial Space Council -- the forum where ESA members meet to
discuss the agency's future direction -- about the questions whether
ESA's mission and the vision of its founding fathers of an exclusively
peaceful organisation for space would be compromised by taking part in
military-related European space activities (IP 4; IP 12; cf.
Sheehan [2009](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)).
A senior ESA employee remembered that it was a "very tough discussion in
the mid-2000 when the question (of security tasks) was formerly raised
in the Space Council: What does exclusively peaceful mean in the
convention?" (IP8).

4.3. Protection of autonomy: security should pose (no) problems

In this debate on where to draw which boundaries concerning ESA's
partaking in security and military space activities, the agency's
director-general commissioned a group of "Wise Men" to explore these
questions further (Bildt *et
al.* [2000](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)):
The former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt, the then-president of
Credit Lyonnais, Jean Peyrelevade, and Lothar Späth, the CEO of Jenoptik
AG, a major German Arms and Space company, concluded that ESA should
evolve into an organisation capable of developing both civilian and
military flight hardware to ensure that space would and could be part of
the evolving common European foreign and security policy (Hobe *et
al*. [2006](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
p. 540). In the words of Bildt, this was just "logical" and "should pose
no problem"
(Slijper [2008](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
p. 34). Interestingly, the group of Wise Men represented the fields of
politics, economy and industry, but not science or engineering -- the
major pillars of ESA's work. This is also reflected in an article which
appeared in the magazine *Science* on the report, and that summarised
the findings as follows:

Space is too important to Europe to be left to scientists alone,
according to a report on the future of the European Space Agency (ESA)
(that) concludes that better coordination between ESA and the business
and defence sectors is essential to Europe's development.
(Watson [2000](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
p. 1287)

This statement also highlights what was seen as necessary boundary work,
namely that it was less a question of whether ESA should
build *different* space technologies for security usage, but rather if
their intended use by EC agencies in fields such as border security or
defence policy could be aligned with ESA's mission statement. More
precisely, it was a question of legitimacy -- what were legitimate
"security tasks" to which ESA could contribute to? And it was, according
to an interviewee who was involved in the process, a wicked question:
The boundaries between military and civilian space Earth observation
satellites, for instance, was blurry from the outset (IP5; cf.
Neufeld [2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)).
[The [operation of]{.mark} navigation and communication
[satellites]{.mark} was already [overlapping with]{.mark} more
traditional [defence activities]{.mark} -- such as using encrypted
satellite communication during military missions, [so]{.mark} "that [one
could not be achieved without the other]{.mark}"]{.underline} (IP4, cf.
Peter [2005](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
p. 290). Another interviewee reflected on this process of negotiating
institutional boundaries by stating that the pressure on ESA to stay
"relevant" in the changing European space-scape and vis-à-vis a more
active EU gradually increased with the number of commissioned reports.
At a certain point, he mentioned, "it was then more or less accepted by
the ESA leadership that security-related aspects could be dealt with,
but no armament and arms procurement, and nothing aggressive of course"
(IP 5).

The involvement of the military in European space activities -- even if
only through the backdoor -- was not what ESA's founders had envisioned
for the agency (cf.
Sheehan [2009](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)),
yet ESA's boundaries as a civilian organisation were set in a different
period of European integration and global political orders
(Slijper [2008](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)).
When asked about his opinion on that, a senior ESA member told me:
"Well, then the founding fathers should have been clearer about what
they meant with exclusively peaceful!" (IP8). This statement points to
the core of expansionist boundary work at ESA regarding its involvement
in military-related activities, that is, the dynamically changing
interpretation of the first paragraph of its convention that eventually
allowed ESA to "move into policy areas previously denied"
(Sheehan [2009](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
p. 32).

4.4. Boundary expansion II: "Space has a security dimension, and
security has a space dimension"

[The [securitisation of space in Europe]{.mark} was further spurred by
adopting a White Paper on European Space policy]{.underline} in 2003 by
the EC. The paper's title "Space: A New European Frontier for an
Expanding Union -- an Action Plan for Implementing the European Space
Policy"
(EC [2003](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039))
signals that while space might be a new frontier for the EU, it is a
call to action to implement one European Space policy instead of
aligning what have so far been multiple policies. What is particularly
interesting here is how the paper strategically uses expansion as a
mechanism of boundary work by calling for all stakeholders

to mobilise behind new goals and to rise to new challenges as the time
has come to place (space activities) on the Union's political agenda and
at the heart of the European construction process by putting space
applications linked to inspirational goals at the service of the
enlarged Europe.
(EC [2003](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
p. 5)

For the first time, [[space]{.mark} is now fully [recognised as]{.mark}
a horizontal [policy of]{.mark} the enlarged European Union to "support
the Union's key policy goals": economic growth, sustainable development,
or stronger [security and defence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Linking the need for further European integration to the objective of
securing Europe's strategic independence by maintaining autonomous
access to space, the [paper stated what later became a common saying:
That "[space has a security dimension and security has a space
dimension]{.mark}]{.underline}"
(EC [2003](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
p. 19). The White Paper can thus be understood as a form of boundary
work par excellence: It includes, first, novel political practices --
the implementation of a single European Space Policy. Second, we see the
accession into a particular collective (the space sector as dominated by
ESA) or paradigm (that space activities in Europe are civilian) by what
was previously outside of it (the European Commission). Lastly, it shows
how new fields and activities (space for security and defence) get
incorporated into existing practices.

What is more, the [White Paper directly links the envisioned European
integration in space to the broader project of European political
integration. It does so by framing space as a catalyst of European
integration that preserves the security of the EU and mentioned space
security technologies as providing "a linchpin of European policy" and
contributing to the building of an "EU political project]{.underline}"
(Silvestri [2003](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)).

As one interviewee stated about the White Paper, it seemed that if
Europe was to be further integrated through common security policy, then
ESA had to be part of that, too (IP 1, cf.
Sheehan [2009](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)).
The White Paper postulated that "Standing still is not an option" for
the European space sector
(EC [2003](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
p. 21), urging ESA to expand its boundaries towards more
security-related space activities while simultaneously challenging the
agencies' autonomy. This process intensified with the framework
agreement of 2003 between the EC and ESA as a strategic partnership
between the supply-side of space systems (ESA) and the demand-side for
space systems (the EU). The agreement established the Space Council that
merges the Council of the EU and that of ESA at the ministerial level
(cf.
Reillion [2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)).
As a coordination forum, the Space Council has the mandate to provide
broader political views to the formulation of space programmes and to
deepen their security aspects (cf.
Pasco [2009](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)).
Therefore, both the Framework Agreement and the Space Council can be
seen as attempts to reorder the messy European space-scapes once more by
drawing boundaries line between ESA's and the EU's responsibilities and
tasks.

When the Lisbon Treaty entered into force in 2007, the EU
reinforced[^3^](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039) its
aim to become the "natural point of reference for a European space
policy driven by demand"
(EC [2003](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
36). On a broader level of EU policy formation, the Lisbon Treaty
confirmed the European Union's commitment to the progressive framing of
a common Union defence policy mainly through the so-called space clause
that gave the EU a space competence and the possibility to develop and
implement an industrial policy in the space sector. However, while this
is often discussed as a novelty with fundamental consequences, von der
Dunk
([2011](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039))
has argued that this competence is rather formalising practices of
jurisdiction regarding outer space activities which the Union had
exercised since the 2000s, albeit in a somewhat "accidental" fashion. An
ESA senior staff member describes the process of boundary expansion by
the EU follows:

So typically, the EU does the following; It has a treaty which defines
its perimeters and from day one after adopting this Treaty, they
transgress their boundaries and try to grab the next piece. And they do
so until de facto they have it, and then the following Treaty comes and
more or less puts that into a legal text what has already been done in
practice. (IP7)

ESA, according to the Framework Agreement of 2003, should formally
become the implementing agency of the Union. As such, ESA would have to
integrate into the EU framework and modify its convention accordingly --
a step that was seen as having profound consequences for those ESA
member states that are not members of the EU (von der
Dunk [2011](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039)).
What is more, ESA interviewees saw this as an unnecessary multiplication
of actors responsible for space, as plans had already been circulated
that the EU is eventually planning to set up its space agency.

At the latest with the Lisbon Treaty, this "arm twisting between two
organisations that are different in membership, are different in scope
but responsible for space" started (IP1).

A result of such "arm twisting" was the European Space Policy (ESP) that
ESA and the EC jointly adopted in 2007. Although celebrated by both as a
milestone achievement, the ESP covers the same priorities as previous
regulations and communications, except for a stronger focus on security
while maintaining the peaceful exploration of outer space. Thus, it is
consistent with the securitisation framing of previous documents that
all emphasised the need for increased synergies between the space
sector's civil and defence communities. However, seven years later, we
see an interesting shift in the ways that ESA leadership extends the
boundaries of the agency in public representations. In 2014, following a
cooperation agreement with the European Defence Agency to "better
support Europe's security and defence needs" (ESA DG), the then
Director-General of ESA was asked in an
interview[^4^](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039) if
he foresees a militarisation of space in the next decade. Departing from
the principles on which ESA was founded and which had been at least
publicly rehearsed and stabilised for many decades, he stated:

(...) as concerns military space activities, this represents so far the
largest deficit of Europe as compared to other space powers (...).
However, there is an increasing number of programs that, even though
civilian, may have military or security-related users -- such as Galileo
or Copernicus. The ESA itself is not a civilian agency. It is an agency
for peaceful purposes and may have programs with a security component.
If and when Europe needs space as an enabling tool for its security and
defence policy, ESA will be prepared to develop the required programs.

These statements can be understood against the background of ESA's
attempt to stay relevant for both its non-EU members as well as for an
EU increasingly integrated in the fields of defence policy. In 2016,
however, the European Defence Action plan was adopted by the Commission
which proposes in a press
release[^5^](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039) "to
promote the contribution of sectoral policies, such as the EU Space
Program to common security and defence priorities"
(EC [2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2021.1890039),
p. 3).

Some interview partners described [the [securitisation of space in
Europe]{.mark} as [an "unpleasant spiral]{.mark}]{.underline}". (IP5[).
With Europe so heavily relying on a functioning space infrastructure,
now [**fears would grow** that]{.mark} [this infrastructure is being
attacked, leading to calls for increased defence
measures]{.mark}.]{.underline} As IP 3 mentioned, ["this is now only the
beginning of an arms race in outer space (...) where [you say: **I feel
threatened, I have to aggress**]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark}.
According to two interviewees, it is not so much a question if Europe
will at some point set-up a Space Force, "like it or not" (IP4), but
rather if this is to be left on the national domain of individual member
states such as France and Germany or if "we can Europeanize it" (IP5).

**Rhetoric of the "Chinese space threat" proves space threats are often
constructed \-\-- it was [labeled "existential"]{.underline} but nothing
happened**

Construction in American Public Policy Discourse", University of
Bristol,
<https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/the-rise-of-china-in-space>
/ lg

[Almost [every American source that cares to mention China's space
program agrees]{.mark} that [it]{.mark}s recent surge to prominence
[constitutes a grave threat to]{.mark} the [national security of]{.mark}
the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates of America]{.underline}. A
streak of technological determinism was a recurring feature of within
these debates, particularly after 2000 (see Parts 2 and 3). Chinese
space technologies were instrumentalised as tools for the destruction of
the US, contextualised with wider representations of China as a reckless
and aggressive space power (see Chapter 6). [[Coupled with]{.mark} the
[instrumentalisation of American space technology as essential, in an
ontological sense,]{.mark} to the nation, [the "Chinese space threat"
narrative became existential]{.mark} in scope. According to many of the
proponents of this discourse, China's rising space power would
inevitably entail a mix of fear, conflict and space (arms)
racing.]{.underline} Yet the irrefutability of the "Chinese space
threat" in US public policy discourse conceals a multitude of tensions
and inconsistencies.

[[Asking "how" the threat came to be]{.mark} has [revealed its uneven
construction, and]{.mark} thus by extension [demonstrated how misguided
technologically determinist arguments about the "rise" have
been]{.mark}]{.underline}. Part 1 showed both how the "threat" has
varied over time, in some instances becoming side-lined in favour of
cooperation in space. It also demonstrated how space has inconsistently
appeared in broader American debates about China's "rise" more
generally, sometimes cited as evidence of the "rise," elsewhere obscured
by other foreign policy concerns. Part 2 showed how advocates of the
"Chinese space threat" differed in which aspects of American identity,
and which corresponding technologies, they valued and portrated as
imperilled by China's "rise" in space. Finally, Part 3 underlined the
appearance of unevenness by inquiring after the policies and
procurements which were undertaken in the name of the "Chinese space
threat." Beyond the maintenance of the ITAR restrictions already in
place at the start of the century and the limitations on NASA-China
interaction imposed in 2011, no new policies were sanctioned in line
with what by any other measure was an incredibly dominant discourse.
[This disjuncture is the most pressing evidence for the uneven
construction of China's "rise" in space,]{.underline} and sets up a
puzzle for future research to address. Despite this puzzle, the lack of
a technological response is itself is best understood as a part of
technopolitical contestation within American public policy discourse.
Viewed in this light, [the [determinism of]{.mark} the "**[Chinese space
threat" remained unmanifested]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In other words,
[the "[Chinese space threat" was a]{.mark} kind of "[**dog that didn't
bark**"]{.mark}]{.underline} where the omission of response is itself
evidence worthy of consideration.

### 2NC\-\--Terrorism

#### Fear of terrorism is grounded in interventionist logics that propels military interventions and legitimizes state violence

Tina G. **Patel 17**, "It's not about security, it's about racism:
counter-terror strategies, civilizing processes and the post-race
fiction", Humanities & Social Science Communications, p4-7 \\\\pairie

[In combination, these and other counter-terror measures draw on
somewhat normalized notions of the "Islamic terrorist" to justify and
gather support for discriminatory practices. They continue to construct
Muslims as suspicious bodies with criminal tendencies, in need of
increased surveillance, control and regulation, and thus "legitimise a
pre-emptive, **interventionist and securitizing** approach"]{.underline}
(Coppock and McGovern, 2014: 242). As Ansari (2004: 31) notes, this then
serves to "terrorize the Muslim community in Britain". Each day, the
Muslim community have their social, religious and political activities
observed, interrogated and stigmatized, presented as suspect terror
networks (Ansari, 2004: 31). [Having "relegitimised state racism"
(Bhattacharyya, 2008: 75), counter-terror measures have also "involved
derogation from human rights provisions and established elements of due
process" (Rowe, 2012: 160).]{.underline} Any negative impact that they
may have on the Muslim population is considered to be relatively
justified, almost as collateral damage in comparison to the perceived
wider threat. In this sense, Muslims are not considered worthy of human
rights, they are after all goes the civilizing logic, rejecting attempts
to assimilate and be part of Western civil society. This logic is not
unique or new to Muslims in post-colonial Britain. Recall for instance
the use of this logic in the treatment of other BMEs around the world,
for instance, Australia's Aborigines, Native Americans, New Zealand's
Maori, and the African Slaves transported across the Atlantic. In all
these cases, attempts were made to excuse and justify exploitative
behaviour on the basis that the (exploited) subjects were naturally
positioned, either biologically, intellectually or in accordance to (the
Christian) God's plan, as inferior. Thus, legitimized, morally at least,
that the control of BME bodies was necessary and good for society as a
whole.

Civilizing, consuming and controlling brown bodies

[Surveillance and control measures under counter-terror strategies have
without doubt drastically redefined the lives and experiences of
Muslims. Under counter-terror measures, Muslims in particular are
presented as posing a crime and security threat]{.underline}. In
addition, the anti-Muslim rhetoric that underpins the counter-terror
logic presents Muslims, and brown bodies more generally as incompatible
and a threat to civil society, both morally and legally. Consider for
instance, the popularity of Donald Trump's Presidential campaign
(illustrated not least with his win) in the United States, which ran
with the tagline of "Make America great again"---a sentence which forces
the voter to feel shame at having lost a status of greatness, seemingly
awakening them from their zombie-like acceptance of overly liberal
policies, and finally delivering a rallying-cry for them to take action
and regain their status of greatness (by voting for Trump, in the first
instance). Key parts of the campaign were delivered with such enflamed
anti-Muslim rhetoric that was never before seen in American politics,
not even in George W. Bush's style of "cautious Islamophobia", or Barack
Obama's reference to Muslims within a national security context. For
example, Trump called for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims"
entering the country (Trump, 7 December 2015)Footnote3 and fought
publicly with the Gold Star Khan family (whose son Captain Humayun Khan
died while serving in Iraq in 2004), suggesting that Mrs Ghazala Khan
was not "allowed to speak" by her husband at the Democratic convention
because of their Muslim faith.

Within the counter-terror narrative runs a logic that presents brown
bodies as unable or unwilling in the least, to attain a civilized state.
[They are seen as a threat to the social, moral, religious and political
order of Western society]{.underline}. This is the basis of anti-Muslim
ideology[. This logic remains steadfast in the wider imagination due to
the persistence of a "**post-colonial** fantasy".]{.underline} This
fantasy was created during imperial and colonial encounters, and remains
long in its de-colonized aftermath. During this time, the "black Other"
was seen as savage, sub-human and uncivilized. Presenting the colonized
subjects in this way, reaffirmed the colonizers' self-perception as
morally and intellectually superior---God-like almost, which allowed
them to embark on rescue missions to lift colonized subjects, usually
through forced removal and re-allocation of subjects, as in the case of
Australia's Aboriginal children (the "Stolen Generations") or African
slavery in America and its colonies. Of course, the "lifting" was never
to an equal or higher state, and always resulted in advancing the
economic position of the colonizers.

The post-colonial fantasy remains a form of institutionalized power and
systematic control over subjects of ex-colonies. Some have argued that
the fantasy, taken from a scholarly and artistic perspective, evidenced
an evolutionary movement because it signified the West's positive
interest in other countries and cultures. However, this form of
exoticism has been critiqued given that the interest was in reality
superficial and selective, not least because it focused on the female
colonial subject (Gindro, 2003: 112‒113). Therefore, there remained a
selective othering of the post-colonial subject which was filtered
through a Western Imperialist gaze and misrepresented for its own
satisfaction. Hooks (1992) argues that such exoticism was especially
applied to lighter-skinned BMEs who are seen as being able to more
safely satisfy the Western male' sexual desire and colonial fantasy, in
comparison to their darker-skinned, and thus animalistic and savage
counterparts. Unsurprisingly, male BME bodies, especially the
darker-skinned ones, have been constant victims of colonial rule.

This article argues that male BME post-colonial subjects are consumed in
far less favourable ways. For instance, Boskin (1986, cited in
Moody-Ramirez and Dates, 2014: 17) notes how the use of the "Coon", "Jim
Crow" and "Sambo" images in America, especially as objects of laughter,
sought to strip the black African American male of his masculinity,
dignity and self-respect---qualities that would otherwise present him as
a sexual competitor, warrior and economic adversary. Similarly, consider
the use of sexual stereotypes about "the black man and his mythical
penis" which not only served to ridicule, but more actually indicated
"the insecurities of the powerful" (Bhattacharayya, 2008: 87--88).
Still, today there remains other examples of race-consuming which
highlights the persistence of the post-colonial mindset, for instance,
consider the "Black Pete" (Zwarte Piet) celebration in the Netherlands,
which despite criticisms have remained a core celebration of Dutch
culture (see van der Pijl and Goulordava, 2014). Indeed, artist and
political activist, Spike Lee (quoted in Ebert, 16 October 2000) argued
that elements of "gangsta rap" music videos, with their reference to "my
ho's" and "my bitches", can be held up as contemporary popularized
examples of race-consumption performance, namely minstrel performance,
despite their BME/black African-American artists and producers, because
there is an over-exaggerated, stereotypical, crude and ignorant
performance of blackness for the purpose of entertainment and
socio-political commentary.

Specifically, under the counter-terror pre-occupation, the post-colonial
mind-set re-uses established practices of "race-consumption" to control
brown bodies. Race-consumption within counter-terror strategies occur in
very much the same way, by stripping the brown body of its human
qualities. [They are presented by the media, politicians and news
outlets as sexually deviant, insular and intellectually limited. This
representation permits brown bodies to be consumed, that is for them to
be stripped in the white (Western European) imagination of their
threatening status, and for hierarchies of inferiority/superiority to
remain in place]{.underline}. The consuming of race in this sense then
remains focused on alleviating white fears and presenting BME
populations as (physically, intellectually and morally) inferior. As
pre-colonized subjects, brown bodies are rendered powerless through a
continued colonial narrative, that is a representation and a forced
performance of colonial ideas about a supposed passive, immature and
animal-like character, and a "backwards" and "oppressive" culture
(Patel, 2017). For instance, consider the presentation and discussion
around brown families and communities, with presentations of them as
abusive fathers/husbands and subservient daughters/wives who come from
insular and backward cultures supposedly steeped in anti-Western views
(see Sian, 2012). Now, they have come to be represented as Muslim
radicals, Islamic extremists and terrorists, or at least sympathizers of
this ideology. Brown bodies are once again openly popularized as unruly.
Within the terrorist narrative, brown bodies are seen as more dangerous,
given that they are presented as an even more dangerous type of
terrorist, in comparison with the terrorist of previous eras (Pantazis
and Pemberton, 2009). According to this logic, Muslims need to be more
closely watched, scrutinized and controlled, even if this is at the
sacrifice of their fundamental human rights.

The race-consumption practice and post-colonial fantasy are important
features of the counter-terror narrative[. In her analysis of Muslim men
and processes of deviant labelling within the "war on terror" context,
Bhattacharayya (2008) argues that popularized racialized mythologies
about "the dangerous Muslim man" have come to embody "a dangerous
hypermasculinity and a mutilated deviation from proper
manhood...portrayed as impenetrable, secretive, enmeshed in an alien
culture that inhabits the secret places of an unsuspecting host society"
(89).]{.underline} A variety of outlets are used to construct the brown
body in these ways. For instance, the entertainment industry has a long
history of locating the brown body (or brown space) as villainous, who
threatens national security, freedom and civilization itself---a space
only to be neutralized by the white saviour/hero, for example, consider
the popular (1998) American film, "The Siege" which relies heavily on
Muslim/Arab stereotypes of them as violent and ready for martyrdom, and
presents Islamic ritual practices within close context of violent
(terrorist) behaviour (Ameli et al., 2007: 36). These images are found
in more recent films, whether it be subtly such as in "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles" (2014) with the evil Foot Clans' wearing of the
Palestinian Keffiyeh scarf as part of their military uniform, despite
their original Japanese heritage and non-Muslim/Arab connection, or more
openly as in "American Sniper" (2014) where not only are the American
soldiers the glorified heroes, but all the Iraqis are militant fighters,
with the only non-militant civilian Iraqi being one family ... who are
killed by Iraqi militants. Various news outlets, especially those
located in the centre-right of the political spectrum, have delivered a
constant barrage of "news stories" that have situated the brown body in
a dangerous position. Consider for example the "Asian sex gangs" and
"Asian groomer" stories that dominated the British press in 2015 and
2016 (Patel, 2017), where rather than presenting the abuse as an
interplay between gender and power, stories focused on the "Asian-ness"
of the abusers: "Vulnerable schoolgirl raped by at least 60 men after
being preyed upon by Asian grooming gang", reported one tabloid
newspaper (Mirror, 18 May 2015), and "'All white girls are s\*\*gs':
Asian sex gang found guilty of raping and sexually assaulting three
teenage girls in Rotherham", reported another (The Sun, 17 October
2016). These headlines were typical of references made throughout the
reporting of the child sexual exploitation cases. More recently, social
media has been used to host anti-Muslim racism to a scale unimagined
only 10 years ago, for example, consider the volumous anti-Muslim rage
that dominated social media during Britain's "Brexit" vote and America's
presidential elections. [This character-construction (or,
character-assassination) of the post-colonial subject has ultimately
**justified the heightened surveillance** and restrictions on the human
rights of those marked out brown]{.underline}. Society has gone
full-circle (again): having had a state of multiculturalism and equality
of opportunity, the narrative presented is that these have been thrown
back in our generous faces---we (by which I mean white bodies) are the
ones who have been exploited, and the result is a state where the enemy
lies within, unable to devoid itself of its inherent and/or cultural
dark traits, waiting to strike at the heart of (Western and thus,
natural) civilized order. Although conceptually basic and proven to be
problematic by a volume of scholarly work, this narrative remains
constant and dangerously powerful.

[It is important to recognize that within the counter-terror context,
attempts to consume and control the brown body have not gone
unchallenged, especially by those experiencing first-hand anti-Muslim
racism and the **curtailed freedoms resulting from counter-terror
strategies**]{.underline}. Consider for instance, one British case,
"Project Champion", where a CCTV camera surveillance system, funded by
the Government's "Terrorism and Allied Matters Fund"6, was erected in
neighbourhoods in the city of Birmingham which were predominantly
populated by Muslims. Having been told that the system of 200 CCTV
cameras was part of a general crime-reduction strategy, in particular to
protect residents against vehicle crime, drugs offences and anti-social
behaviour, residents challenged the use of the cameras, noting its
negative impact on their human rights, as well as their broader
Islamophobic underpinnings (Awan, 2012; Iskajee and Allen, 2013; Patel,
2017). By June 2011, all the cameras had been dismantled, and the case
can be held up as a excellent example of how community-level challenges
in response to Islamophobic over-surveillance measures can heighten
instances of victimization as well as hold officials accountable for
their discriminatory behaviour. [However, the case also highlights the
power and lived reality of **contemporary counter-terror logic that all
Muslims are terrorists** or, at the very least, potential
terrorists]{.underline}, as one resident said: "Whether we like it or
not, we are the 7/7 bombers. We are the ones who bought down the twin
towers. We are Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden. That's how people see us.
We're the new Jews and we're the new blacks" (Young Muslim female
interviewed in the aftermath of Project Champion, cited in Isakjee and
Allen, 2013: 752).

Concluding comments

The ready association of Muslims with terrorism has been developed
within a particular context largely emerging from "'War on Terror'
propagated by President Bush in the aftermath of 11 September 2001
attacks, co-joined by Blair, and continued in practice, if not on
political rhetoric, by their respective successors" (Rowe, 2012: 159).
This has resulted in "an uncritical and simple-minded acceptance of the
notion of a 'new' kind of 'religious terrorism'" (Jackson, 2009: 177),
which has in turn allowed for the closer scrutiny of all Muslims and an
acceptance of limited human rights. [It is argued that the presentation
of the "Muslim-terrorist", or "Muslim super-villain" (Sayyid, 2008: 1)
has been so readily digested because of the civilizing narratives found
in the old-racism of previous-eras, that is, Said's (1979) Orientalism.
The re-presentation of brown bodies as problematic draws on firmly
established practices of "race-consumption", popularized in recent
history during imperialism and colonialism, where brown bodies were
presented as uncivil, inferior and inhumane, and thus in need of
enlightenment and governing.]{.underline}

In drawing on a post-colonial fantasy and established practices of
race-consumption, this article critiques the claim that we are now
living in a post-race state[. Rather it argues that the fallacy the
post-race condition actually serves to perpetuate and **excuse
anti-Muslim hostility**. Anti-Muslim sentiment has once again become
popularized, fashionable almost, and certainly considered an acceptable
basis upon which the political agenda can be shaped]{.underline}. It is
clear that aside from not living in a truly post-race era, there is
currently the normalization of anti-Muslim racism and a range of formal
measures that victimize members of the Muslim population are
commonplace. This supports the idea that what we have is actually a not
yet post-race state. More so, the ease with which anti-Muslim racism
powerfully permeates society suggests that there will never truly be a
post-race state.

In his 1904 letter on the Russo--Japanese war, Leo Tolstoy---the

this gap. [We ask: [What might we render visible]{.mark} and redress

reveals something about the ethical elision of the tragedy (O'Driscoll
2019) or absurdity (Hartnett and O'Driscoll 2020) of war, this

Abstract

In recent years, the concept of 'prototype warfare' has been adopted by
Western militaries to accelerate the experimental development,
acquisition, and deployment of emerging technologies in warfare.
Building on scholarship at the intersection of Science and Technology
Studies and International Relations investigating the broader discursive
and material infrastructures that underpin contemporary logics of war,
and taking a specific interest in the relationship between science,
technology, and war, this article points out how prototype warfare
captures the emergence of a new regime of warfare, which I term the
experimental way of warfare[. While warfare has always been defined by
experimental activity, what is particular in the current context is how
experimentation spans across an increasingly wide range of military
practices, operating on the basis of a highly speculative understanding
of experimentation that embraces **failure as a productive
force**.]{.underline} Tracing the concept of prototype warfare across
Western military discourse and practice, and zooming in on how prototype
warfare takes experimentation directly into the battlefield, the article
concludes by outlining how prototype warfare reconfigures and normalises
military intervention as an opportunity for experimentation, while
outsourcing the failures that are a structural condition of the
experimental way of warfare to others, 'over there'.

Introduction

In April 2017, the US Department of Defense (DoD) published a memo
announcing the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team, codenamed
Project Maven, to accelerate the incorporation of 'artificial
intelligence and machine learning across \[DoD\] operations'.Footnote1
The work of Project Maven focused on the development and deployment of
machine learning algorithms to automate the extraction of 'objects of
interests' and relevant activity across US surveillance footage. In the
summer of 2018, Project Maven came under public scrutiny when it was
revealed that the US DoD had contracted Google to help military analysts
detect objects in video images. In a letter addressed to Google CEO
Sundar Pichai, over four thousand Google employees stated that Google
'should not be in the business of war' and demanded the contract to be
cancelled.Footnote2 After months of protest, Google ended its work on
Project Maven, although it maintained that it was 'eager to do more' for
the US DoD in other fields of activity.Footnote3

[The case of Project Maven has become central within academic and wider
public debates related to the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in
war and the emergence of so-called lethal autonomous weapons systems
specifically]{.underline}.Footnote4 Promoters of Project Maven have
claimed that the project merely renders existing practices of data
analysis more efficient and precise. Critical voices, however, point out
that such investments 'are poised to automate the process of identifying
targets, including people' and may well serve as the basis for the
development of autonomous weapons.Footnote5 Similarly, critical
scholarship on security has situated Project Maven against the
background of an already problematic targeting regime that operates on
the basis of algorithmic calculations and 'pattern-of-life' analysis,
and which has become entangled with pre-existing and more affective
registers of race and gender.Footnote6 As pointed out by Lucy Suchman,
the automation of data analysis as pursued within Project Maven 'can
only serve to exacerbate military operations that are at once
discriminatory and indiscriminate in their targeting'.Footnote7

[My own interest in Project Maven derives from a different observation,
related to how the project represents a wider ambition on the part of
Western militaries to rethink and revise our very way of
warfare]{.underline}. As explained by Air Force Lt Gen. Jack Shanahan,
in charge of the project, Project Maven served a wider purpose beyond
the development of computer vision algorithms. It was supposed to be
'that pilot project -- that pathfinder -- that spark that kindles the
flame front for artificial intelligence across the rest of the
department'.Footnote8 Understood as such, Project Maven marked the
beginning of what Shanahan called 'prototype warfare'.Footnote9

[Prototype warfare]{.underline}, as described by Shanahan, centres [on
an overarching imperative of military innovation set against the
backdrop of an increasingly fierce technological competition on the
global stage]{.underline}.Footnote10 At its core, prototype warfare
represents a shift in how Western militaries develop and acquire
technology and weaponry. [It promotes moving away from a focus on the
mass production of high-end weapons to the development, rapid fielding,
and testing of prototypes in specific operational environments, 'where
units can fail early and fail small, to scale fast and learn
fast']{.underline}.Footnote11 As formulated by the UK army as part of
its own strategic conceptualisation of prototype warfare, prototype
warfare this way involves more than the modification of existing
acquisition processes.Footnote12 It represents a broader 'mindset' or
'new approach' to military activity, which 'seeks to mimic the pace and
intensity of wartime transformation by prioritizing experimentation and
adaption' and encourage warfighters 'to take calculated risks with a
higher than normal tolerance for failure, enabling them to learn,
succeed and exploit catalytic ideas that deliver asymmetric
advantage'.Footnote13

Tracing recent conceptions of 'prototype warfare' across Western
military discourse and practice, my objective in this article is to map
the contours of a new regime of warfare, which is emerging against the
background of an overarching imperative of military innovation and
speculative understanding of the potential role of 'AI' in warfare.
Broadly defined, regimes of warfare are constellations of discourses,
practices, interactions, technologies, and rationalities that constitute
and organise war in a specific and (largely) shared way. As argued by
Antoine Bousquet, historically, such shared ways of thinking about and
organising the conduct of war have strongly been informed by an
overarching scientific rationality.Footnote14 What Bousquet defines as
'the scientific way of warfare' refers to this systematic and extensive
deployment of scientific ideas 'to inform thinking about the very nature
of combat and the forms of military organization best suited to prevail
in it'.Footnote15 As the regimes that Bousquet identifies are connected
to the prevalence of a specific set of scientific ideas and technologies
in a given period, this means that they are historically variable and
always subject to change.

My argument in this article is that prototype warfare represents such a
shift and is reflective of a broader transformation, or new regime of
warfare. Specifically, I argue that the concept of prototype warfare
captures the emergence of a profoundly experimental way of warfare,
which is driven by an overarching experimental rationality,Footnote16
and largely conducted 'by-experiment'.Footnote17 While warfare has
always been underpinned by experimental activity, what is particular in
the current context is how experimentation spans across an increasingly
wide range of military practices, into the actual (or simulated)
battlefield, and across novel military-corporate assemblages. [What
explains this spatialisation of experimental practice and its ubiquity
in contemporary warfare is a particular, highly speculative,
understanding of experimentation that is increasingly detached from a
more narrow interpretation of experimentation as a scientific practice
of replication and controlled testing and that embraces uncertainty and
failure as a productive force.]{.underline} As Michelle Murphy writes,
[this kind of experimentation **legitimises continued intervention and
is largely self-perpetuating**, hailing 'life as composed of composed of
potential, of chances, of possibilities for becoming, of manipulable
relations that can be triggered and altered, if only the right protocol
and technique can be employed'.Footnote18]{.underline}

As I will argue, this speculative understanding of experimentation in
the context of war has serious political implications. Driven by this
kind of experimental rationality, the experimental way of warfare is
largely immune to failure, or uninterested in the costs or aftermath of
the experiments being deployed. Any result represents valuable data
gained, and so failures only serve to advance further experimentation.
This way, the experimental way of warfare is largely insulated from
critique, as militaries can always point to lessons learned or to the
future potential of the 'next' experiment. As part of this development,
war and conflict become reconfigured mainly as an opportunity to
experiment. Our wars become endless and everywhere, not because of the
(discursive representation of) the enemy, but because of the broader
experimental infrastructure that is created and that needs to be
maintained.

In developing these arguments, empirically, my analysis traces the
emergence of conceptions of prototype warfare across Western military
discourse and practice, with a particular focus on how prototype warfare
is taking experimentation directly into the battlefield, specifically
when it comes to experimental practices of data collection and analysis,
which are seen as foundational to the role of AI in warfare.Footnote19
In so doing, I acknowledge, following Dan Öberg, that 'Western military
discourse is by no means unitary', but 'traversed by logics depending on
service branches as well as on power structures and debates within
them.'Footnote20 At the same time, tracing prototype warfare across
different national contexts and levels of engagement, I do find that an
overarching regime of warfare defined by experimentation can be
identified. In analysing this regime or experimental way of warfare, I
rely on a variety of publicly available sources, such as official policy
documents, speeches, blogs, defence magazine articles, project
descriptions, newspaper articles, video recordings of panels at defence
trade shows, and information coming from freedom of information
requests. Zooming in on how prototype warfare takes experimentation into
the battlefield, my focus is on examples from the US, UK, and The
Netherlands, which can be considered important drivers of prototype
warfare, although my arguments are also relevant for other Western
militaries. My objective is not to provide a full mapping of existing
prototypes in this field, as this would be extremely difficult given the
evolving and experimental character of these projects, as well as
because of a more general lack of oversight of military practice and
operations, but, rather, to map the broader contours of prototype
warfare and the experimental way of warfare that it is shaping by
relying on the sources mentioned.

My argument proceeds in four steps. I first examine the emergence of the
experimental way of warfare as a distinct technoscientific regime of
warfare, drawing on recent literature at the intersection of Science and
Technology Studies (STS) and International Relations (IR) that examines
how wars are made and made possible, with a specific focus on the
entanglements of science, technology, and war. Next, I trace the concept
of prototype warfare from its inception in the early 1990s to its
current invocations across Western military discourse and practice,
focusing on how the experimental way of way of warfare takes shape under
this very term within the US, UK, and The Netherlands. Third, I zoom in
on how prototype warfare takes experimentation into the actual or
simulated battlespace, focusing on the case of the Land Information
Manoeuvre Centre (LIMC), an 'experimental data center' established by
the Dutch Army in March 2020 to collect and assess data to help crisis
response and fight disinformation during the COVID-19
pandemic.Footnote21 I conclude by calling for a more sustained research
focus on the ways in which the experimental way of warfare contributes
to the notion that our wars are endless and everywhere and accelerates
and deepens existing vulnerabilities and asymmetries in war.Footnote22

The experimental way of warfare

This article builds on scholarship at the intersection of IR and STS
investigating the broader 'configurations of people, things and
processes that come together to make war possible and shape its mutable
characteristics'.Footnote23 Specifically, I am following a growing field
of scholarship that focuses on the role of science and technology in
assembling and executing warfare.Footnote24 Antoine Bousquet has
examined this relationship between war, science, and technology in
detail in his book The Scientific Way of Warfare, starting from the
premise that 'an ever more intimate symbiosis between science and
warfare has established itself, with the increasing reliance on the
development and integration of technology within complex social
assemblages of war.'Footnote25 In his book, Bousquet\'s interest is not
so much with the direct role of science or scientists in building
military technology, but with the diverse and historically situated ways
'in which scientific ideas have been systematically recruited to inform
thinking about the very nature of combat and the forms of military
organization best suited to prevail in it'.Footnote26 What he terms 'the
scientific way of warfare' refers to the 'array of scientific
rationalities, techniques, frameworks of interpretation, and
intellectual dispositions which have characterised the approach to the
application of socially organised violence in the modern era'.Footnote27

According to Bousquet, while the overarching role of science in shaping
warfare has remained stable since the eighteenth century, the specific
ways in which science and technology have informed our thinking about
and conduct of warfare are historically variable and dependent on the
prevalence of a particular set of scientific ideas and technologies in a
given period. Bousquet identifies four distinct regimes of the
scientific way of warfare, which are mechanistic, thermodynamic,
cybernetic, and chaoplexic warfare.Footnote28 At the core of each regime
is a specific set of scientific ideas and a paradigmatic technology,
respectively the clock, the engine, the computer and the network. Each
of these technologies has shaped military organisation and the conduct
of war in considerable ways. At the same time, all of these technologies
could only become thinkable or possible as part of a broader regime of
warfare and a distinct set of scientific rationalities. As Bousquet
clarifies elsewhere, 'technology \[does not\] appear ex nihilo: it is
the product of a particular human engagement with the world.'Footnote29

Building on the concept of the technoscientific regime of warfare, in
this article I identify another transformation of warfare -- or an
emergent regime of warfare -- that is linked to a highly speculative
understanding of the current role of AI and digital technologies in
warfare,Footnote30 and defined by an overarching experimental
rationality. Of course, the conduct of war has always been underpinned
by experimental activity. [There is a long history of experimentation
with technology 'out in the field' of war and conflict, or as part of
colonial, interventionist projects]{.underline}.Footnote31 For instance,
much has been written about medical experimentation on populations in
war and on the production of gendered and racialised bodies for
experimentation.Footnote32 [Popular histories of the US Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) or the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA), such as Sharon Weinberger\'s The Imagineers of War Footnote33 or
Annie Jacobsen\'s The Pentagon\'s Brain,Footnote34 have similarly shown
how war and experimentation with technology and weaponry have a long and
entangled history. More recently, experimentation has been linked to
counterinsurgency warfare and the deployment of future-oriented action
(scenarios, exercises, gaming) and creative design thinking in the
context of the Western wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq.Footnote35]{.underline}

[What is specific within the current context, however, is how
experimentation has become truly distributed, informing an increasingly
wide range of military practices and spanning across novel
military-corporate assemblages.]{.underline} As such, experimentation
has become centre stage in military thinking about the organisation of
warfare, what I refer to here as the experimental way of warfare. In
conceptualising the experimental way of warfare, I draw on recent work
within anthropology and associated disciplines on 'experimentality' as a
mode of governing that operates 'by-experiment' and that is driven by an
overarching experimental rationality.Footnote36 In her analysis of
experimentality in 1970s Bangladesh, Michelle Murphy describes how
experimental practice became ubiquitous, spreading across a distributed
field of experts and producing a 'transnationally attached, locally
organized patchwork of unevenly distributing funds, technologies,
practices, infrastructure, experts, services, collectivities, and
workers'.Footnote37 Observing a 'creative explosion of Bangladeshi
trials, pilot projects, and experiments' over the course of the 1970s,
Murphy points out how experimentation transitioned from being a more or
less centralised and spatially confined scientific practice limited to
the lab, clinic, or field site, to a broader way of governing life and
population as part of development practices.Footnote38 As part of this
process, Bangladesh became a key site for experimentation with new
techniques and technologies, as well as a global model for this kind of
governing by-experiment.

What makes experimentality in this and other contexts so generative,
argues Murphy, is that it operates on the basis of a highly speculative
or anticipatory vision of the experiments being deployed.Footnote39 This
speculative understanding of experimentation is what makes
experimentality as a mode of governing largely self-perpetuating. As
Vinh-Kim Nguyen argues, experimentality inverts 'the classical model
whereby evidence of efficacy permits intervention', in the sense that,
'in this case intervention drives the need for self-validating evidence
(that is, the intervention was effective).'Footnote40 Even more so,
experimentality distinguishes itself in the way in which it thrives on
uncertainty or failure. Writes Murphy, 'if an experiment does not work,
\[this only means that\] a better experiment is needed.'Footnote41 The
outcome is the reproduction of 'the infrastructure of experiment
itself'.Footnote42

Extending these insights on experimentality to the context of war, I am
approaching the experimental way of warfare as an emerging
technoscientific regime that relies on experimentation as a shared way
of thinking about and organising warfare today. As part of this
development, experimentation increasingly spans across all levels of
military engagement and brings together a diverse group of actors,
including the military, tech start-ups, and venture capitalists, into
experimental assemblages and informal partnerships.Footnote43 [The
experimental way of warfare operates on a particular understanding of
experimentation that is increasingly detached from a more narrow
interpretation of experimentation as a scientific practice of
replication and controlled testing, favouring a more speculative and
entrepreneurial vision of experimentation (dominant within the
surroundings of Silicon Valley) that is about acting fast, taking risks,
and accepting, or adapting to, failure]{.underline}.Footnote44 It is
this speculative vision of the experiment that makes the experimental
way of warfare largely immune to criticism linked to effectiveness or
failure, as one can always point to lessons learned and a process of
'moving forward' to deflect from failures.

Strategic conceptions of prototype warfare, as they are currently being
pushed by Western militaries, capture these aspects, while also taking
experimentation as an embodied form into the battlefield. For example, a
leading UK defence company defines prototype warfare as 'experimentation
in contact', which 'centers on a willingness to use experimental
technologies, tools and techniques at an earlier stage of readiness in
live environments as part of a continuous cycle of learning and
optimization'.Footnote45 Similarly, a UK General conceptualises
prototype warfare as 'a new, democratized approach to experimentation
and innovation', which 'will extend to the battlespace, with deployed
operations becoming the ultimate laboratories for innovation'.Footnote46
Below, I will further examine this extension of prototype warfare into
the battlespace, where experimentation serves primarily as a proof of
concept or vehicle for constant learning (by doing). The next section,
however, first traces the emergence of prototype warfare as a strategic
concept across Western military discourse and practice, examining how
the experimental way of warfare is taking shape under this concept.

Tracing prototype warfare

While the concept of prototype warfare has recently gained traction
across Western military discourse, it was first coined in 1998 by a US
Lieutenant Colonel, Robert R. Leonhard. In his book The Principles of
War for the Information Age, Leonhard aimed to revise military doctrine
'as warfare progressed through the Industrial Age into the Information
Age'.Footnote47 He argued that in order to create technological
advantage in the Information Age, militaries needed to adapt to
prototype warfare as a radically different approach to warfighting.
Leonhard observed that while technological change in the Industrial Age
developed at a moderate tempo and that, as a result, 'mass production
was the sine qua non of Industrial Age warfare', future warfare would
'feature a constant myriad of technological advances that \[would\] come
at a tempo that disallows mass production'.Footnote48 This meant that a
new approach to technology development was needed that would favour the
deployment of limited-production prototypes tailored to specific
missions. In turn, such an approach would entail a new and more 'dynamic
relationship among economy, organization, and training',Footnote49 as
well as a more general disposition towards experimentation, as part of
which 'military forces \[would\] become comfortable with deploying novel
weapons, supported by novel tactics, in hopes of achieving an
operational advantage against an opponent'.Footnote50

Clearly, Leonhard\'s thinking on prototype warfare at the time was
shaped by existing debates on the so-called Revolution of Military
Affairs of the late 1990s. His ideas were also informed by military
strategic thinking as it developed within the doctrine of
network-centric warfare, as part of which military strategists proposed
to decentralise military organisation, drawing from insights and the
vocabulary offered by complexity theory and the information
sciences.Footnote51 Leonhard writes for instance that '\[o\]ne of the
most exciting technologies of twenty-first century warfare is that of
"situational awareness"', which is to be attained through a 'network of
computers' through which a military commander and his subordinates would
see each other digitally.Footnote52 This network of computers would free
militaries 'forever from the need for mass-based control' and allow them
'to come at the enemy in a patternless fashion that defies anticipation
and complicates the enemy\'s understanding'.Footnote53 Prototype warfare
would entail a shift away from mass as a means of control and towards
'patternless maneuver' or 'precision maneuver' enabled by digital
communications and a decentralised and networked military command
structure.Footnote54

Tracing its origins this way, we can see how prototype warfare does not
present a clear epistemological break with conceptions of decentralised
control and information superiority as they have been central to the
doctrine of network-centric warfare. Indeed, to a large extent, the
emergence of the prototype warfare concept appears to be about
fulfilling earlier promises of a fully legible and malleable
battlefield, this time by taking advantage of the technological advances
that AI and new digital technologies appear to afford. Understood as
such, the emergence of prototype warfare as a concept within Western
military discourse and practice should be situated against the
background of a highly performative and speculative rhetoric around the
transformative potential of AI, specifically in relation to its
proclaimed ability to improve and accelerate military
decision-making,Footnote55 or the way in which it can 'sift through
today\'s data-rich environment', as a report by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) puts it.Footnote56 At the same time,
prototype warfare is rooted in the widely shared belief across Western
militaries that existing military innovation and acquisition strategies
are excessively cumbersome and slow, and insufficiently capable of
incorporating the latest technological advances. [This is seen as
**particularly problematic in the context of**]{.underline} what is
presented as a wider [**technological competition** in which competitors
such as China and Russia are contesting Western technological
superiority, or are at least narrowing the technology gap. **Set against
the backdrop of this global 'technological adoption race'**,Footnote57
prototype warfare, as it is being articulated by Western militaries,
represents and calls for a distinct approach to military innovation that
centres on the rapid deployment of, and ongoing experimentation with, a
smaller quantity of tailored systems. The main rationale is that
prototyping enables militaries to adopt new technologies quicker,
produce them at a lower cost, and increase the level of
surprise]{.underline}.Footnote58 Experimentation underpins this practice
of prototyping as it 'puts prototypes into the Warfighter\'s hands for
assessment in an operational context' and allows for an ongoing process
of adaptation and learning.Footnote59

Within the US context, prototyping and experimentation first appeared as
central strategic concepts within the context of the so-called Third
Offset Strategy that was announced by the US DoD under President Barack
Obama to sustain US military dominance within the broader field of
AI.Footnote60 Under the Third Offset, the US DoD launched a range of new
programmes and offices, including Better Buying Power 3.0, a set of
policies aimed at strengthening and streamlining US DoD innovation,
which focused on 'increas\[ing\] the use of prototyping and
experimentation',Footnote61 and the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental
(DIUx, now DIU), which was meant to be 'accelerating the adoption of
commercial technology throughout the military and growing the national
security innovation base'.Footnote62 In so doing, DIU partners with the
private sector 'including firms and academic institutions outside DoD\'s
traditional orbit',Footnote63 and operates on the basis of a new type of
contracting, called Other Transactions, that can be used for prototyping
activities. This allows the DIU to award 'prototype projects without the
onerous rules and regulations of the traditional defense acquisition
process'.Footnote64

In parallel with these strategic initiatives at DoD level, different
service branches within the US military have established and expanded
initiatives to increase the use of prototyping and experimentation. For
instance, the US Army is investing, prototyping and experimenting under
Army Futures Command, a new command structure founded in 2018, based in
Houston, Texas. Army Futures Command hosts the annual Army Expeditionary
Warrior Experiment, which is described as a 'live prototype assessment'
with soldiers and units, and a 'perfect laboratory to bring industry,
army labs, academia and the acquisition community together'.Footnote65
Army Futures Command also leads Project Convergence, described as 'the
centerpiece of the Army\'s campaign of learning',Footnote66 as part of
which the Army organises experiments every two weeks, culminating in an
annual demonstration, to 'take the service\'s big ideas for future
warfare and test them in the real world'.Footnote67 Similarly, the US
Air Force established the Research Laboratory\'s Strategic Development
Planning and Experimentation Office in 2016 to 'institutionalize
experiments as regular practice in the Air Force'.Footnote68 Part of the
Air Force Laboratory is AFWERX, a dedicated innovation unit that serves
to facilitate the integration of commercial technology into the Air
Force and that operates its own investment fund, AFVentures, to attract
private investment and target early stage companies working on emerging
technology.Footnote69

In the UK, the prototype warfare concept has also gained traction and
informed a wide range of new activities and programmes. The British Army
embraces prototype warfare as their main new approach to warfighting,
defining it as 'a pathway to deliberately enable research, innovation,
experimentation, demonstration then delivery -- rapidly' and as 'an
opportunity designed to secure competitive advantage via trial and error
and adaptation'.Footnote70 Prototype warfare within the British Army is
driven by the Army Rapid Innovation and Experimentation Laboratory, an
innovation unit that 'aims to bring expertise and cutting-edge
technologies into direct contact with Army users', thereby 'challenging
perceived barriers to the rapid prototyping and exploitation'.Footnote71
In 2022, the Army will open its new British Army Battle Lab, which will
feature as the physical manifestation of the Army Rapid Innovation and
Experimentation Laboratory, or as an 'engineering workshop' where
soldiers and industry meet in a shared space to develop ideas and
experiment with technology.Footnote72 Experimentation will also take
place as part of the Army\'s newly established Enhanced Light Force
Battalion (ELFB), a unit that sits 'at the vanguard of the Army\'s
approach to prototype warfare and develop capabilities to be tested on
exercises and operations'.Footnote73 Stationed in Cyprus, the main
purpose of the unit is to be '"supercharging experimentation"' by
trialling new technologies and integrating them into actual Army
operations and way of fighting.Footnote74

To give a final example, in The Netherlands, the Defense Innovation
Strategy, which was published by the Dutch Ministry of Defense (MoD) in
2018, strongly relies on prototyping and experimentation as a means of
innovation.Footnote75 Among the range of initiatives announced by the
strategy is the deployment of Concept Development & Experimentation
(CD&E), described as a specific approach to innovation that is based on
the implementation of small-scale experiments and shorter innovation
cycles.Footnote76 In operationalising this CD&E approach, the Dutch MoD
has established a variety of so-called field labs, where the military
implements and tests specific ideas and technologies in collaboration
with private partners, such as start-ups and (technical) universities.
The Dutch Army has taken the lead in this space, creating, among other
'labs', the Robots and Autonomous Systems (RAS) unit and the Land
Information Manoeuvre Center (LIMC), further discussed in the below.
Both have embraced prototyping and experimentation to gain 'real-world'
experience with new digital and autonomous technologies and demonstrate
their value to the Dutch armed forces, seizing opportunities and taking
action outside of formal frameworks of military acquisition and often
without formal permission.

In summary, while not a new concept, [prototype warfare has in recent
years been gaining traction across Western military discourse and
practice. Driven by a highly speculative rhetoric around the potential
of AI technology and the problematisation of existing military
innovation and acquisition strategies in the context of a performative
global technological competition, prototype warfare operates as the
strategic concept under which the experimental way of warfare is taking
shape, assembling a range of new and experimental practices,
technologies, and interactions.]{.underline} Prototype warfare is also
the concept under which experimental practice and experimentation with
new technologies is taken more explicitly into the (simulated)
battlespace, or near the edge of battle. As a US Army Colonel puts it,
'the idea is the sooner we can bring things out here, get them in the
dirt, get them in soldiers hands, the sooner we can learn'.Footnote77
Again, while the military has a much longer history of engaging in
experimental learning in actual operations or as part of simulated
exercises, gaming and scenario planning, what is different in today\'s
context is how experimentation becomes very much the end goal. In
prototype warfare, the aim is to experiment on a constant basis, with
the purpose of constant learning, optimising, and innovating. [In this
context, experimentation is supposed to happen throughout, in peacetime
training and in actual combat, as part of a continuous cycle of learning
and optimisation, and uninterrupted by failure.]{.underline}Footnote78
By extension, I argue that this means that military intervention becomes
itself reconfigured -- and justified -- as a learning experience and
opportunity for further experimentation. Politically, much is at stake
here: [if warfighting becomes in and of itself experimental and failure
instructive, **how can we then resist military intervention in the
experimental way of warfare?**]{.underline}

[We just can't win. We're perma-lagging.]{.underline} So this was
written by Charles Beames. The bio in the op-ed says Beames, quote, "is
executive chairman at York Space Systems" which is kind of buried,
without mentioning that York Space Systems at the time was up for a
major government contract that would have benefited greatly from the
policies the piece was lobbying for. In Spring of 2020, Beames's small
firm was awarded a \$450,000 contract for "SPACE VEHICLE MAINTENANCE,
REPAIR, AND CHECKOUT SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT V126
TRANSPORTATION/TRAVEL/RELOCATION- TRANSPORTATION: SPACE
TRANSPORTATION/LAUNCH." So that's just one contract, they may have
others. So here you have someone who's[, I mean, so much of these
things, again, whether or not they're laundered through think tanks are
directly the corporate CEOs themselves or they are military brass whose
careers are based on the acquisition of funds, **they're just marketing
tools basically**]{.underline}. This is just like any other, anyone
who's ever worked in marketing, getting an op-ed on CNN saying, 'Man, we
really need to buy all this stuff. Oh, incidentally, my firm happens to
sell this' would seem like a sort of conflict of interest you'd want to
disclose but again, if you sort of keep it a half a degree removed, then
it's just normal journalism.

Nima: [Right now I know we've mentioned the United States outspending
every other country on the planet by a lot when it comes to military
spending]{.underline}. It's very similar in terms of the US outspending
its supposedly adversaries like China and Russia when it comes to this
space race. You wouldn't know it from these articles --- we're always
lagging behind --- but according to account by the Massachusetts-based
Union of Concerned Scientists, the US military and other government
agencies, universities and private companies together operated over
1,300 satellites as of March 2020. China, in contrast, operates 363
satellites and Russia itself has 169 satellites. So the United States
has exponentially more satellite capability. NASA's 2020 budget was more
than \$22 billion, while the White House's 2021 federal budget request
allotted \$15.4 billion to the newly formed Space Force. So yeah, the US
leads the world in space spending. It's not even close. Closest behind
the US budget in this regard is China, which spends a mere \$8 billion,
according to the Space Foundation, a US nonprofit that tracks these
things, and despite the impression that China wants to accelerate
military combat in space, China is actually called the Space Force a,
quote, "direct threat to outer space peace and security" end quote.
Meanwhile, Russia's own government run space agency has kind of pulled
back on its own budget. In 2014 it was about \$5 billion, six years
later, this year, 2020, it is only \$1.7 billion.

Adam: So one of the things I can't do is [I can't tell you how many
times in the stories the US has simultaneously said to be lagging
behind, and then the very next section they say, the US's dominance is
being threatened.]{.underline}

Nima: (Laughs.) Right.

Adam: [And I think what they mean by lagging behind, they mean if I'm
the LA Lakers and I'm playing a high school basketball team, and we're
only up 20 points, they'd be like we're lagging behind the expectations
to be up 40 points.]{.underline} So of course no one's really being
lagged behind here but the average reader reads that and they think[,
'Oh my gosh, you know, **we're going to lose primacy to the evil Chicoms
and Ruskies**.' This is also **very common in cyber security** and other
technology. CNN in November of 2017, quote, "US risks losing artificial
intelligence arms race to China and Russia," reads the headline. Note
the headline doesn't even bother with "according to US officials" or
"according to NATO" or "according to US military spokesman," it's just
asserted as fact]{.underline}. The whole premise is propped up by
statements from Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work. Quote, "More than
60 years after a space race rivalry with the Soviet Union ushered in a
new era of ballistic missile development, the US is facing another
'Sputnik moment.'" A lot of these articles talk about the Sputnik
moment. It's sort of think-tankese for 'Oh, we could be caught off guard
by being inferior. We were beaten for 10 minutes in 1957.'

Nima: It's the same way any article about Iran talks about the hostage
crisis. It's that kind of poke in the eye that will never be forgiven,
and therefore the US foreign policy of vengeance will continue in
perpetuity.

Adam: [Other sources of the article in fact, the only other sources
included in the article, are a September report from the RAND
Corporation, which of course is 90 percent funded by the Defense
Department, State Department]{.underline} and, quote, "former Secretary
of Defense Chuck Hagel." So again, it's just the military saying the
military needs more money. Not a surprise. I wish citations had more
money. Marketplace.com, August of 2018, headline reads, "U.S. lagging
behind in race for tech supremacy." [The article uncritically cites a
report from the Atlantic Council, which was done in tandem with the
company Qualcomm.]{.underline}

CNBC, the next year, the headline read, "[The US is falling behind China
in crucial race for AI dominance]{.underline}." This was written by
Frederick Kempe, President and CEO of the Atlantic Council who was the
main source of the previous article we mentioned. [The Atlantic Council,
of course their major funders are, aside from oil companies and US and
state governments are very much weapons contractors.]{.underline} Major
donors include Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems, Raytheon, Palantir,
as well as direct financing from NATO itself.

So you'll be surprised to learn that [the Atlantic Council always thinks
we're behind]{.underline}. The Hill, July 2019, the headline reads, "US
risks falling behind China on technology and innovation, if we don't
reset our priorities." It's potentially a paid op-ed. [The Hill's
unusual in that it actually lets people pay you to write for them, which
is not usually standard practice.]{.underline} It's actually very
frowned upon. [But this is an op-ed by Robert Hormats, who's VP of
Kissinger Associates]{.underline}, a global consultancy firm with a ton
of weapons contractor clients and government clients[, sort of a who's
who of the deep state as it were.]{.underline}

Nima: Don't let the name fool you, [it actually does mean Henry
Kissinger]{.underline}.

Adam: He is a former vice president of Goldman Sachs and is on the board
of directors of, you guessed it, the Atlantic Council. So again, you
have this idea that we're always lagging being because that's what they
get paid to say. As one would expect the US budget exceeds that of the
countries we're allegedly falling behind. The US is legitimately lagging
in some areas of technological development, we should be clear, and
there are certain aspects like we have less naval ships than China, for
example, but we also have far less naval ships than North Korea, because
naval ships includes little tiny little boats, we also have far more
aircraft carriers than China, which is really what matters. So people
always sort of find it, you know, Mitt Romney did this line where he
says the US's Navy is smaller than it was during World War I and Obama
replied, 'Well, we also have less horses and buggies and bayonets.' So
like, you can always sort of twist anything and make it look like we're
behind but the one sort of objective reference point is how much money
is allotted to it. [That's sort of a good way of looking at it and no
matter how you look at it, the US out spends everyone on nukes, on
ships, on AI capacity, on online disinformation, you name it, we spend
more money. **So either we're spending the money badly, or we're just
pissing away money, or the US isn't actually really lagging behind, it's
just a kind of permanent threat.**]{.underline}

[For example, the US cybersecurity budget in 2020 was \$17.4 billion,
almost \$800 million increase over the previous year, whereas China's
government cybersecurity project was \$7 billion]{.underline}. So again,
we go back to the budget, we're sort of not lagging behind. Before we
talk to Jim, I want you to envision a headline, in cnn.com, you open
your browser window and you see the headline, 'US government officials:
Actually we have all the money we need.' Or imagine this headline in
NPR, 'NATO spokesman or the RAND Corporation New Report: US's Military
Supremacy in Pacific is Fully Funded and Totally Okay,' you would never
see that. God [forbid you would even see this, which is, you know, a
headline in NBC.com. 'US General: We actually have more money than we
need, we'd like to give this excess billion dollars to healthcare or to
give to first responders of coronavirus healthcare,' this would just not
happen right? Because all they do all the time is say they don't have
enough money, because what the fuck else would you say?]{.underline}
That's what your job is, your job is like any other startup or any other
business, which is you're always fundraising, [you're always raising
money and think tanks provide the foe academic veneer of an industry
who's like any other industry, especially ones that are totally
parasitic, which they mostly are, which is to just keep fucking sucking
the blood off of the public till.]{.underline}

Nima: And that's [**why everything is always positioned as a race**.
There's a space race, there's an arms race, there's an AI arms race, the
cybersecurity arms race, the propaganda arms race, we don't want to lose
the race and so when you position things as a race, we're always trying
to catch up and overtake and win and when you position things like that,
you can just continually make the argument that we need more power, more
speed, more money.]{.underline} So to talk more about this, we are going
to be joined by friend of the show Jim Naureckas of Fairness and
Accuracy in Reporting, FAIR, where he has edited FAIR's print
publication Extra! since 1990. Jim will join us in just a moment. Stay

### 2NC\-\--Turns Asia War

#### The liberal international order is just military orientalism\-\--it causes Asian war\-\--Korea military occupation proves

[\\\\pairie](file:///\\pairie)

[CFR and State Department wartime planning was therefore driven above
all by a vision of global--imperial leadership exercised by US elites,
strongly supported by Britain's ruling elites, via an international
order of organizations and relationships.61 The aim was, acting in
concert with Britain's elites, to resurrect European Great Powers by
means including the restoration of shattered colonial trading and
economic and financial linkages]{.underline}. The Marshall Plan viewed
European reconstruction in just that global context.62 The UN was
envisaged as a key international agency for American imperial
internationalism, at least in its earliest days63---and, as its role in
the making of South Korea shows, it remains the official basis of
America's role in that country today. And, as I will show below, the
building of a hegemonic multilateral order indicates the significance of
a Gramsci--Kautsky synthesis.

The UN and Korea

The manner of America's division of Korea, [including **its military
occupation,**]{.underline} [its foundation of the republic in the South
and the war to sustain the division, is highly instructive as to the
character of the new world order that the superpower sought to build and
of its actual conduct as opposed to its publicly stated claims.
Observable behaviour fell far short of the tenets of human rights, the
rights of civilians, and the rule and due process of national and
international law]{.underline}. The building and consolidation of a
South Korean ruling elite and its narrow but important base in civil
society---incorporating critical friends and friendly
critics---undermines liberal explanations and supports the
Gramscian--Kautskyian perspective.

Shortly after detonating two atomic bombs over Japan in August 1945, the
United States divided the Korean peninsula at the 38th parallel,
offering the Soviet Union the northern sector and claiming the southern
for itself. At that time, the Soviet Union chose not to take control of
the entire peninsula, despite American forces' unreadiness to effect an
occupation of any portion of the Korean peninsula. [Upon subsequently
occupying southern Korea several weeks later, however, the United States
declared it 'semi-hostile' territory and applied military law, using
Japanese colonial laws and police methods, reinforcing the national
police and bringing in the **extreme right-wing,** anti-communist
Syngman Rhee,]{.underline} who had been absent from the country for
decades, as putative leader to head the fight against the popularly
established people's committees that had declared a provisional
government.64

In brief, popular uprisings in support of an independent unified Korean
government led to massive repression even before the outbreak of the
(civil) war. The violence preceding the outbreak of war in June 1950 saw
the deaths of 100,000 people. [Thereafter, the United States, going into
action even before the UN had passed a Security Council resolution
authorizing military action, waged a military campaign against North
Korea of rare ferocity. Obliteration and **saturation bombing led to
millions of deaths**. The American mission in Korea was formally
undertaken under the banner of the UN, but the UN had little or no voice
in the 'police action'.65]{.underline}

The creation of South Korea as a separate independent state resulted
from extreme US pressure on the UN Temporary Commission on Korea
(UNTCOK) which was authorized by the UN to hold national elections in
the whole of Korea (North and South).66 [The United States effectively
forced UNTCOK to go ahead with elections in the South in 1948 against
the will of the majority of its inhabitants, apart from Syngman Rhee's
conservative party and the national police, the two most extreme
right-wing organizations in southern Korea. All other organizations from
across the political--ideological spectrum---including labour
organizations, farmers, women, students and youth groups---had opposed
elections on the grounds that **right-wing violence** had made free and
fair polling a virtual impossibility.]{.underline} Hence the declaration
by UNTCOK that elections were fairly held in South Korea was used as a
pretext by the United States in the UN to win recognition of the
Republic of Korea as a sovereign state. UNTCOK observed a mere 2 per
cent of polling stations during the 1948 elections.67 After the
declaration of the Republic of Korea, the North also declared itself a
sovereign state as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Thus the
very creation of South Korea entailed a violation of agreements made at
the UN and between the United States and the Soviet Union.68

[American military violence in Korea has been characterized as
'**military orientalism',**69 in which racist attitudes about the
character of Koreans and Chinese and assumptions of their general
inferiority play a prominent part.]{.underline}70 According to Bruce
Cumings, Anglo-American atrocities outnumbered those carried out by
North Korean and Chinese troops by a proportion of six to one.71
Reginald Thompson, the Daily Telegraph correspondent in Korea, noted
that US marines considered Koreans apes, not humans, and rained death on
them on an unprecedented scale. It was machines versus men, warfare
reminiscent of colonial-era wars, with liberal use of napalm in
obliteration bombing by B-52s that inflicted 'holocausts of death',
eliminating distinctions between combatants and civilians.72

General MacArthur ordered relentless bombing to create '"a wilderness of
scorched earth"'. North Korea was carpet-bombed for three years with
635,000 tons of bombs (half the total dropped on Germany in the Second
World War, and more than in the entire Pacific theatre between 1941 and
1945) and 32,000 tons of napalm. Massive casualties resulted: deaths of
somewhere between 2.5 and 4 million Koreans, 900,000--1,000,000 Chinese,
54,000 Americans and nearly 700 66 The UNTCOK papers in the UN archives
in New York show, among other things, the near-total lack of legitimacy
of the foreign occupation and of any elections planned by the US
military government. 67 UNTCOK papers, UN archives, New York, S-0684,

repression and violence, the control of UNTCOK by the US military
government, the anti-communist framing of Korean conditions by US

and murder. The forces of repression were policing the elections. See

by South Korean troops at a concentration camp in Pusan: 'I had seen
Belsen, but this was worse. This terrible mob of men---convicted of
nothing, un-tried, South Koreans in South Korea, suspected of being
"unreliable" had been starved and chained while US officers took
photographs.' When Cameron took the report to UNTCOK, he was told: 'Most
disturbing, yes; but remember these are Asian people, with different
standards of behavior': Jon Halliday and Bruce Cumings, Korea: the

and MacArthur threatened to use atomic weapons;74 MacArthur advocated
dropping 20 small atomic bombs across Korea to create a no-man's-land
between South Korea and China. There was a general belief that Asians
were weak and could not possibly stand up to relentless high-technology
American firepower; but also a feeling of humiliation among military and
civilian leaders that the weakest 'communist satellite'---North
Korea---was beating the United States. US military operations in Korea
cost around US\$70 billion. A small, largely rural country saw between
40 and 90 per cent of all its urban areas destroyed; even after just a
few months, North Korea had no targets of any worth to bomb.75

[**Military orientalism prolonged the war** and increased casualties.76
It also created the main barrier to ending hostilities by preventing an
agreement on the return of prisoners of war.]{.underline} [As this was
defined as a war between races and cultures as much as between freedom
and slavery, barbarism and the rule of law, both Truman and the military
commanders on the ground wanted to make Asians pay for their
resistance]{.underline}.77 Hence, in violation of the Geneva Conventions
on compulsory and swift return of enemy prisoners of war, the
Anglo-Americans demanded all prisoners be 'screened' to see whether they
wished to return to North Korea or China, thereby prolonging the war.78
The veil of 'voluntary repatriation' allowed the torture and punishment
of Chinese and North Koreans in prison camps run by Syngman Rhee and
Kuomintang forces, leading to thousands of killings, as reported by
numerous press agencies, the International Commission of the Red Cross,
and British, Canadian and US troops who had policed the PoW camps.79
Anglo-American allegations of torture of western troops in Chinese and
North Korean camps were undermined by later US Army studies of released
US PoWs who reported generally good treatment rather than torture.80

After the ceasefire of 1953, [the United States helped build a
repressive state in South Korea with consistently high levels of
military and economic aid that sustained a dictatorial regime headed by
Rhee until his overthrow by popular rebellion in 1960]{.underline}.

friendly critics or critical friends of the regime.81 In effect, this
was an elite fostered in preparation for a period in the future when
repression and dictatorship would become unsustainable in a radical
nationalist populace with leftist tendencies and a desire to reunify the
country. Indeed, by the 1980s, as popular unrest grew, US strategy had
shifted towards 'democracy promotion' (the initial move in this

basis of 'stability'.82

### 2NC\-\--Turns Russia War

and the decision to expand NATO," Mount Royal University, 05/21/2016,
p7-9 [\\\\pairie](file:///\\pairie)

Lieven speculates that the intellectual basis for this Russophobia may
stem from 19th Century British propaganda regarding Russian expansionism
and its inherent wickedness. [Lieven notes that this demonization of
other peoples, sometimes taking on a racist tone, has long been present
within Western, and American, foreign policy making.]{.underline} 34
Moreover, [there is a tendency to assume that what was once assumed
about a nation]{.underline} and its peoples [shall forever be true about
them]{.underline}, even in the absence of supporting evidence. This sort
of historical determinism denies a nuanced appreciation for cultural
evolution and very much denies the potential for American leaders to
view post-Soviet Russia's disappointing struggles with democracy for
what they are. Instead, they have been viewed against the backdrop of
Russia's Tsarist and Communist experiences and are therefore "wicked."35
This is evidenced by Henry Kissinger's 2000 remark that Russian
imperialism has continued for centuries, characterized by subjugation of
its neighbours and "overawing those not under its direct control" and in
Zbigniew Brzezinski's assigning of blame for Stalinist-era policies to
present day Russians.36 For Lieven, to view past conduct as less a
product of history and more a product of culture or "national DNA" of
sorts, comes perilously close to racism. [There is a certain
essentialism in the American discourse on Russia that equates these acts
with "Russianness."]{.underline} Perhaps, as Tsygankov suggests,
[demonizing Russia continued to help justify US strategy toward the USSR
in the Cold War. For Lieven, this legitimized the military buildup, the
containment, the worldview and actions that stemmed from the need to
balance Soviet power]{.underline}.37 Yet, as Lieven importantly notes,
even those who demonize Russia for its past seem to have little problem
embracing Communist China, 38 so perhaps it is not communism in Russia's
past the Western leaders fear, but rather something cultural, something
innately "Russian."

[Lieven concurs about the **self-reinforcing nature** of Russophobia,
noting the US' "need for enemies"39 as an instrumental component of its
own **narrative of exceptionalism.**]{.underline} [Perhaps the result of
viewing Russia as the enemy for so long is the reason it has become
one.]{.underline} Russophobia has enabled the judging of Russia "by
utterly different standards than those applied to other countries."40
Tsygankov and Lieven are correct to suggest a linkage between
Russophobia and America's own mythologies about its place in the world.
America's destiny is to be a cultural hegemon atop the global hierarchy
of nations. [The perception of American superiority seems to require an
"**other" to assume a position of inferiority**.]{.underline} Russia has
long represented a new cultural frontier and a divergent history, one
that was assumed to be far less "exceptional" than the American
experience. Challenges to the presumption of American hegemony have
often been met with not simply disagreement, but a de-legitimizing of
the very existence of the 'other.' Russia is not immune from ideas of
exceptionalism and the two nations have perpetuated a soft rivalry that
possesses "nationalist phobias" 41 that can be mutually reinforcing.

Gertan Dijkink acknowledges that this "gross distinction between East
and West as opposite cultures" is part of the US discourse on Russia.42
For Dijkink, this does not have to be addressed directly, or be part of
a public discussion, because it has become "naturalized," or considered
to be common sense. He notes that experience and discourse create an
imaginative geography of the outside world, which contributes to the
construction of visions of the world."43 Dijkink notes that, after all,
["American foreign policy aims to perpetuate, serve and affirm the
American way of life," 44 thus helping to explain why Russia's
alternative to "the American way," presents a challenge.]{.underline}
Georg Lofflman confirms the impact of 32 Ibid., pp.. 67, 71. 33 Anatol
Lieven, "Against Russophobia," World Policy Journal 17:4 (Winter
2000-2001), p. 25. 34 Ibid., p. 26. mythology on discourse and the
influence on foreign policy outcomes.45 Myths shape identity, become
themselves part of identity, and influence action. It is reasonable to
suggest that American exceptionalism influences Russophobia. If the US
is unique, its values superior, and therefore its preeminence in the
international system assumed, and if Russia fundamentally challenges
these values -- America's very identity -- in some way, then fear of
what Russia represents may be a consequence. Putin himself famously
warned Americans in 2013 of the dangers of seeing themselves as
exceptional.46

Richard Sakwa notes the difficult time US leaders have had accepting
Russia as an equal.47 Russia did not see itself as a defeated power
after the Cold War and conducted itself as such, a view in opposition to
the prevailing Washington narrative. Sakwa notes that Russia as a
democratic state was no less revisionist than Russia as a communist
state and that this was threatening to the existing world order that
presumed the hegemony of western liberal ideas. 48 Even though Russian
foreign policy was actually fairly unthreatening, and could even be
characterized as collaborative for many years, it was not universally
viewed this way because of the geopolitical threat it was perceived to
represent.49 Sakwa also claims that some of the anti-Russianism has a
strong basis in history, as Russia has never really been considered to
be a part of Europe. Its very presence has motivated European
integration; post WWII European identity was constructed on the basis of
Russian exclusion, a reality that was confirmed by decades of the Cold
War. That the fear of Russia and the exclusionary attitude toward Russia
persist, driven largely by the United States and the derivative
suspicion of Russia from the Cold War period, is problematic but not
surprising.50

Russophobia in Western discourse has been written about, by Russians
themselves - poets and writers - for nearly two centuries.51 Some have
suggested that Russian fears of American Russophobia fuel a siege
mentality present within Moscow since the end of the Cold War.
[Russophobia has had an impact; it has influenced the manner in which
Russia approaches its own relations with the West]{.underline}.
Valentina Feklyunina confirms that the assumption of American
Russophobia by Russians themselves has shaped Russia's self perception,
and more importantly it has shaped Russia's expectations for how foreign
nations will engage with them. 52 [Russian leaders anticipate
anti-Russianism in their dealings with the West, which shapes and
perpetuate an **"us vs. them**" discourse among Russian decision makers
that may be reinforcing the narrative of fear in
Washington.]{.underline}

### 2NC --- AT: Neorealism

#### Neorealism [structurally guarantees]{.underline} resource conflicts through [securitization]{.underline}.

Nafeez Mosaddeq **Ahmed 12,** an international security analyst
specialising in the historical sociology and political ecology of mass
violence. He is Executive Director at the Institute for Policy Research

Relations, University of Sussex, "The international relations of crisis
and the crisis of international relations: from the securitisation of
scarcity to the militarisation of society," Global Change, Peace &
Security, 23:3, 335-355, DOI: 10.1080/14781158.2011.601854 \[ML\]

Ultimately, [[this]{.mark} theoretical [hypothesis]{.mark} on the causes
of environmental or resource-related conflict [is **incapable of
engaging** with the]{.mark} deeper intersecting **global [structural
conditions]{.mark}** [generating resource
scarcities]{.mark}]{.underline}, independently of insufficient
government management of the internal distribution of resources in weak
states. It simplistically applies the Hobbesian assumption that without
a centralised 'Leviathan' state structure, the persistence of anarchy in
itself generates conflict over resources. Under the guise of restoring
the significance of the biophysical environment to orthodox IR,
[[this]{.mark} approach in effect [actually **occludes the environment**
as a]{.mark} meaningful [causal factor]{.mark}]{.underline}, reducing it
to a mere epiphenomenon of the dynamics of anarchy in the context of
state failure. As a consequence, this [approach is **theoretically
[impotent]{.mark}** [in grasping the **systemic acceleration**
of]{.mark} global [ecological]{.mark}, energy and economic
[crises]{.mark} as a **direct consequence** of the way in which the
inter-state system itself **exploits** the biophysical
environment]{.underline}. The same criticism in fact applies to opposing
theories that resource abundance is a major cause of violent conflict.
Bannon and Collier, for instance, argue that resource abundance and
greed, rather than resource scarcity and political grievances, generated
intra-state conflicts financed by the export of commodities in regions
like Angola and Sierra Leone (diamonds) or West Africa (tropical
timber). In other regions, abundance rather than shortages of oil, drugs
and gold fuelled and financed violent secessionist movements in the
context of widespread corruption and poor governance.57 Ultimately,
[this departs little from the theoretical assumptions above, with **weak
central state governance** still blamed for generating anarchic
conditions conducive to conflict over abundant resources.]{.underline}
Furthermore, as Kaldor shows, [this simplistic perspective overlooks the
wider context of the **global political economy** -- the [evolution
of]{.mark} regional '[war economies' was]{.mark} often [enabled]{.mark}
precisely [by the]{.mark} devastating impact of **[neoliberal structural
adjustment programmes]{.mark}**, which eroded state structures and
generated social crises]{.underline} that radicalised identity
politics.58 Under traditional neorealist logic, a strategic response to
global environmental crises must involve the expansion of state-military
capabilities in order to strengthen the centralised governance
structures whose task is to regulate the international distribution of
natural resources, as well as to ensure that a particular state's own
resource requirements are protected. [Neorealism understands inter-state
competition, rivalry and warfare as inevitable functions of states'
uncertainty about their own survival]{.underline}, arising from the
anarchic structure of the international system. Gains for one state are
losses for another, and each state's attempt to maximise its power
relative to all other states is simply a reflection of its rational
pursuit of its own security. The upshot is the normalisation of
political violence in the international system, including practices such
as over-exploitation of energy and the environment, as a 'rational'
strategy -- even though this ultimately amplifies global systemic
insecurity[.]{.underline} Inability to cooperate internationally and for
mutual benefit is viewed as an inevitable outcome of the simple,
axiomatic existence of multiple states. The problem is that [[neorealism
**cannot explain**]{.mark} in the first place [the]{.mark} **complex
[interdependence]{.mark}** [and escalation of global crises]{.mark}.
Unable to situate these crises in the context of an international system
that is not simply a set of states, but a **transnational global
structure** based on a specific exploitative relationship with the
biophysical environment, neorealism can only theorise global crises as
'**new issue areas'** appended to already existing security
agendas]{.underline}.[59 Yet **[by]{.mark}** the very act of
**[projecting]{.mark} global [crises]{.mark}** [as security
threats]{.mark},]{.underline} [[neorealism renders itself powerless
to]{.mark} **prevent or [mitigate]{.mark}** [them]{.mark} [by theorising
their **root** ]{.mark}**structural [causes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
effect, despite its emphasis on the reasons why states seek security,
[[neorealism's approach]{.mark} to issues like climate change **actually
[guarantees]{.mark}** [greater insecurity]{.mark} by promoting policies
which frame these 'non-traditional' issues purely as amplifiers of quite
traditional threat]{.underline}s. As Susanne Peters argues, the
[neorealist approach [renders the **militarisation** of]{.mark} foreign
and domestic [policy a]{.mark} **pragmatic and [necessary
response]{.mark}** [to issues such as resource
scarcities]{.mark}]{.underline} -- yet, in doing so, [it [entails the
**inevitable escalation** of 'resource wars']{.mark} in the name of
**energy security**]{.underline}. Practically, this serves not to
increase security for competing state and non-state actors, but to
[[debilitate international security through]{.mark} the proliferation of
**violent [conflict]{.mark}** [to access]{.mark} and control diminishing
[resources]{.mark} in the context of **unpredictable complex
emergencies**]{.underline}.60 Neorealism thus negates its own
theoretical utility and normative value. For if 'security' is the
fundamental driver of state foreign policies, then why are states
chronically incapable of effectively ameliorating the global systemic
amplifiers of 'insecurity', despite the obvious rationale to do so in
the name of warding off collective destruction, if not planetary
annihilation?61

[Realism, in its various formulations, has always had a somewhat
ambivalent relationship to psychology]{.underline} (Donnelly, 2000, pp.
43--80; Edinger, 2021). Hans Morgenthau (1955), the founder of political
realism, warned against the search for the clue to foreign policy
exclusively in the motives of state leaders because it was both futile
and deceptive. Yet many political realists have still paid a great deal
of attention to major figures in international politics and their
actions, starting from some implicit psychological analysis on the basis
of the leader's experience or moral characteristics. [[Political realism
assumes rationality as]{.mark} [the]{.mark} **methodological [starting
point]{.mark}** for analysis]{.underline}, yet [**[Morgenthau]{.mark}**
(1946, p. 154) **himself** fundamentally [doubted the extent to

nature.]{.underline} Structural realism (neorealism) shifted the angle
of the older political realism away from state leaders to the structural
conditions of the international system (Elman, 1996). In a vulgar
reading of structural realism, it is sometimes maintained that any
statesperson would behave in a similar way in given structural
conditions. [The **most visible scholar** of offensive realism in the

[Russia's actions in Ukraine]{.mark} in 2014 [should be]{.mark} seen as
a [self-evident]{.mark} reaction]{.underline} to the West's aggressive

Ross **Douthat 22,** a *New York Times* columnist and *The Atlantic*
senior editor, March 9^th^, 2022, \"They Predicted the Ukraine War. But
Did They Still Get It Wrong?\" *The New York Times*,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/opinion/ukraine-russia-invasion-west.html>
\[ML\]

It's a curious feature of Western debate since Russia's invasion of
Ukraine that a school of thought that predicted some version of this
conflict has been depicted as discredited by the partial fulfillment of
its prophecies.

From the 1990s to the 2010s, from George Kennan's opposition to NATO
expansion to John Mearsheimer's critique of American involvement in
Ukraine, thinkers associated with foreign policy realism --- the school
known for its cold-eyed expectation of great power conflict, its doubts
about idealistic visions of world order --- argued that the attempt to
integrate Russia's borderlands into Western institutions and alliances
was poisoning relations with Moscow, making great-power conflict more
likely, and exposing nations like Ukraine to disastrous risks.

"The West is leading Ukraine down the primrose path," Mearsheimer
averred in 2015, "and the end result is that Ukraine is going to get
wrecked."

But now that Ukraine is, in fact, being wrecked by a Russian invasion,
there's a widespread view that his realist worldview lies in ruins too
--- that Mearsheimer has "lost his reputation and credibility" (to quote
the Portuguese thinker Bruno Maçães) and that the realist conception of
nations as "pieces in a game of Risk" with "eternal interests or
permanent geopolitical orientations, fixed motivations or predictable
goals" (to quote Anne Applebaum of The Atlantic) should be discarded on
the evidence of Vladimir Putin's invasion and the Ukrainian response.

The larger critique of realism that Applebaum and Maçães are speaking
for goes something like this: [Yes, realists]{.underline} like
Mearsheimer [predicted some]{.underline} kind of [conflict over Ukraine.
But [realism's predictions]{.mark} still [did not describe
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}, for three reasons. First, [the
[predictions imagined]{.mark} a **defensive [logic]{.mark}** [to
Russian]{.mark} strategic [conduct]{.mark}, oriented around the
protection of a **sphere of influence**]{.underline}, a fear of
encirclement by NATO. [[But the decision]{.mark} to invade [seems
to]{.mark} have [be]{.mark}en [motivated]{.mark} more [by
Putin's]{.mark} **professed** and **very [personal desire]{.mark}** to
restore a **mystical vision** of greater Russia]{.underline} --- a grand
ideological idea that the mere Western pledge not to admit Ukraine to
NATO was unlikely to appease.

Second, [the realist predictions underestimated the **agency** and
**strength** of Ukrainians themselves]{.underline}, treating Russia's
near abroad as a landscape where only great-power force projection
really mattered, ignoring Ukraine's potential capacity --- now
demonstrated on the battlefield --- to resist Russia and rally global
support even without direct military support from the United States or
NATO.

Finally, [the [realist predictions drain]{.mark}ed [the **moral
dimension** out of global politics]{.mark}]{.underline}, effectively
[[**legitimizing** imperialist appetites and "**blaming the
victim**,"]{.underline}]{.mark} as it were, [when the moral
responsibility for aggression **ultimately rests with the
aggressor**]{.underline}, not with nations merely seeking
self-determination or mutual defense.

As someone who considers himself a realist (to the extent that it makes
sense for a newspaper columnist to claim such affinities), I think part
of this critique has bite. For instance, my sense is that because
today's realist thinkers mostly operate within the liberal West and
define themselves against its pieties --- especially the globalist
utopianism that had so much purchase in the post-Cold War era --- there
is a constant temptation to assume that nonliberal regimes must be more
rational actors, more realist in their practices and aims, than the
naïve idealists in America or Europe. And thus when a crisis comes, it
must be the unrealism of the West that's primarily, even essentially, at
fault.

You can see this temptation at work in the interview Mearsheimer gave to
Isaac Chotiner of The New Yorker, published soon after the Russian
invasion began. On the one hand the interview offers a perspicacious
realist critique of how idealism led America astray in the George W.
Bush era, via a naïve theory of how aggressive war might democratize in
the Middle East.

But then when it comes to [Putin]{.underline}'s aggressive war,
Mearsheimer seems to assume that the Russian president [thinks
like]{.underline} him, the realist, rather than like [the **utopian
politicians** of the West]{.underline}. Putin, he says, "understands
that he cannot conquer Ukraine and integrate it into a greater Russia or
into a reincarnation of the former Soviet Union." And if the United
States only worked harder "to create friendly relations" with Moscow,
Mearsheimer argues, there could be a tacit American-Russian "balancing
coalition" against the rising power of China.

But [why should Putin necessarily be immune from the **hubris** and
**delusions** of Western leaders]{.underline}? Why should we assume that
he doesn't dream of reintegrating Ukraine and Belarus into a greater
Russia? Why should we take for granted that the right diplomatic
strategy will bring him into an American coalition against China, when
he might instead be committed to a sweeping ideological vision of
Eurasian power aligned against the decadent West?

[[Why should we assume]{.underline}]{.mark}, in other words, [[that
**structural** and **schematic** explanations]{.mark} of Putin's war
[are more important than **personal** and **ideological**]{.mark}
explanations]{.underline}? After all, as the historian Adam Tooze points
out, it appears that [**very [few members]{.mark}** [of the
Russian]{.mark} foreign policy [elite]{.mark}]{.underline} --- all
presumably opponents of NATO expansion, all "devotees to Russia's future
as a great power" --- [actually [believed]{.mark} that [Putin would
invade]{.mark}]{.underline}. And if so many participants in Putin's
regime, all good servants of the national interest as realists define
it, wouldn't have made his fateful choice, then did realist premises
actually predict the war itself?

Just as important, did they predict the way the war has played out so
far? I myself did not: My assumption was that Ukraine might mount a
strong resistance in the western part of its territory, but that Russia
would sweep pretty easily to the Dnieper and probably put Volodymyr
Zelensky's government to flight. (Some version of this assumption was
shared by [[U.S. intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[was
predicting the **quick fall** of Kyiv]{.mark} **two days** into the
war]{.underline}.) [After]{.underline} almost [two weeks of stalled-out
offensives]{.underline} and mounting Russian casualties, [[that faulty
assumption does look a bit like]{.mark} a **[Risk]{.mark}-board view**
of the world, [where all that matters is positioning and pieces, not
**patriotism**, **morale**, **leadership** and
**luck**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

And there are a lot of ways that this kind of Risk-board mentality can
deceive. Flash back a few decades, for instance, to the late Cold War,
and a crude realist analysis might have insisted that Poland would
always be in some kind of deep thrall to Russia --- because it had so
often been [[do]{.underline}]{.mark}minated by Moscow, its geography
left it so open to invasion from the east, and so on --- and that it was
strategic folly to imagine otherwise. But Polish leadership and
patriotism, Soviet weakness and unexpected historical events all
contrived to change that calculus, so that today Poland's strategic
independence and Western alignment, while hardly invulnerable, both look
relatively secure.

[Is it unrealistic for Kyiv to aspire to what Warsaw has
gained]{.underline}? Right now I would still say yes. But [is it
**impossible**, in the way that some realist thinking tends to
suggest]{.underline} --- [as though some [**law of physics**
bind]{.mark}s [Ukraine to Russia? **No**]{.mark}]{.underline}: I think
anyone watching this war so far, watching both the struggles of the
Russian military and the solidifying of a Ukrainian national
consciousness, would have to give more credit to long-term Ukrainian
ambitions, and a little less to the inevitability of Russian regional
dominance.

So those are two places where **[[realist theory]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
or at least certain intellectual temptations associated with realism,
[[has **suffered** from its contact with]{.mark} the [reality]{.mark} of
war so far.]{.underline}

#### Realism [can't]{.underline} explain [complex]{.underline} interactions --- omits [every]{.underline} domestic variable.

For Waltz, states in the anarchic international system are, according to
the well-worn metaphor, like billiard balls bouncing off each other and
jostling for position in order to serve their own interests. Waltz's
theory implies that China, like all other states, will compete for
power, territory and resources amid the Hobbesian anarchy of the
Westphalian system of sovereign states. [Waltz's [neorealism is a
**parsimonious theory**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[which depends on a
structural analysis]{.mark} of the international system to predict a
dog-eat-dog world of competing states. However, the very parsimony of
the theory means, as Humphreys (2006) points out, that [its explanatory
power is **limited**]{.mark} **and unsatisfactory**.]{.underline} For
Humphreys, the main problem with Waltzian neorealism lies in the fact
that [[it]{.mark} inexplicably [attempts to reduce]{.mark} the
complexity of [the international system to a **single**]{.mark}
**independent [variable]{.mark}** (anarchic structure]{.underline}).
This means that Waltz perceives the international system in a linear
fashion, with the independent variable of anarchy (i.e., the 'war of all
against all') exerting a direct causative effect on states' behaviour in
the international system, leading them to pursue strategies of
self-help. [The linearity of [Waltz's theory]{.mark} may appear
parsimonious and compelling, but, as neoclassical realists and
complexity theorists point out,]{.underline} [[fails to account for
**complex phenomena**]{.mark} in terms, for instance, of [how foreign
policy **impacts**]{.mark} **upon** [and is impacted by]{.mark}
**developments in [international affairs]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see for
instance Bousquet and Curtis 2011; Kavalski 2007; Rathbun 2008; Rose
1998). In the specific case of China's rise, [[Waltz's focus]{.mark} on
anarchy [tells us]{.mark} that China will compete with other states,
**[but not how]{.mark}**. In essence, [he does not tell us
enough]{.mark} to enable us [to see anything beyond a **vague
picture**]{.mark} of China and self-help, [**undifferentiated**
from]{.mark} all the [other]{.mark} 'like units' ([states]{.mark}).
Waltz's [neorealism cannot predict]{.mark} in what direction [China's
rise]{.mark} will take both it and the world in general, [beyond a
general expectation]{.mark} of competition and increasing influence as
China's capabilities increase.]{.underline} Thus, it does not provide us
with any detailed or useful explanation or prediction beyond what is
already quite obvious. [[This is]{.mark} largely [because of what
Waltz]{.mark} consciously [leaves out]{.mark}.]{.underline} He claims
that the logic of his structural analysis necessitates omitting
'attributes and interactions', by which he means 'questions about the
cultural, economic, political, and military interactions of states', as
well as 'the kinds of political leaders, social and economic
institutions, and ideological commitments states may have' (1979: 80).
Questions concerning 'environment, situation, context and milieu' are,
according to Waltz, 'vague and varying systemic notions' which can be
entirely replaced by the analysis of structure alone because they have
no explanatory value in a theoretical sense (1979: 80). [Waltz does
attempt to account for differences in the sizes and capabilities of
states, but does not satisfactorily build these factors into his
states-as-like-units model. For understanding a rising China, then,
there is ostensibly little more that can usefully be gleaned from
Waltzian neorealism beyond the general expectation of Hobbesian
self-help in an anarchic international system]{.underline}. Because
Waltz believes that the international level of analysis has to be
sharply demarcated from the domestic, and so [[he thinks it is necessary
to **omit all information** about]{.mark} China's [culture, economy,
politics]{.mark}, and so on, [his theory **cannot reveal anything**
about the detailed mechanics]{.mark} of China's rise on the
international stage as the nation interacts and develops its
relationships with other actors.]{.underline} On the other hand,
neoclassical realism offers an interesting development of Waltzian
neorealism, in that it attempts to analyse the complex impact of
domestic policy on international affairs. Neoclassical realists such as
Rose (1998), Christensen (1996), Wohlforth (1993) and Zakaria (1999)
base their theorising on Waltz's emphasis on structure and anarchy, but
attempt to develop his theory further by giving more weight to domestic
factors in foreign policy decision-making. Christensen's (1996) study is
particularly interesting for students of China because it attempts to
apply a 'two-level' analysis of international and domestic factors to
Sino-US relations between 1947 and 1958. Neoclassical realists, in
essence, claim that neorealism, by focusing exclusively on the
international level of analysis, does not account for 'domestic politics
and ideas' (Rathbun 2008: 294) in its analysis of states' behaviour at
the international level. However, there is disagreement about the value
of neoclassical realism, and also about whether neoclassical realists
are really doing something different to neorealists in general or just
expanding on its ideas about structure and anarchy (see Legro and
Moravscik 1999; Rathbun 2008; Vasquez 1997). Two notable neoclassical
realists (Thomas J. Christensen and Jack Snyder) have even further
muddied the waters by going so far as to decline to take part in a
debate about whether they are neorealists or not; they do this on the
basis that they neither want to be 'apologists for neorealism' nor to
attempt to 'reconcile the heterogeneous arguments' of scholars who are
generally labelled 'neorealist' (Christensen and Snyder 1997: 919). The
other major weakness of the neoclassical realist project is that it has
not yet come to fruition in terms of being fully expounded in
theoretical terms. To be specific, while there is value in pointing out
that domestic variables need to be incorporated into realist theory,
neoclassical realism has not yet managed to convincingly posit an
explicit theoretical framework within which this can be done. [It is for
this reason perhaps that neoclassical [realism has been criticised for
being '**an ad hoc** and]{.mark} theoretically [**degenerative effort**
to explain away anomalies]{.mark} for neorealism' (Rathbun 2008: 294),
ince neoclassical [realists' 'use of]{.mark} whatever [tools]{.mark} are
necessary [to **plug the holes of a sinking ship'**]{.mark} [results
in]{.mark} 'paradigmatic **[incoherence]{.mark}** and
**indistinctiveness'** (]{.underline}Rathbun 2008: 295). There,
therefore, remains an obvious need to develop a clear and convincing
theoretical framework for neoclassical realism's attempt to take
neorealism in a direction which systematically accounts for the effect
of domestic variables on foreign policy. Thus, the possibility that CT
might be able to provide the missing link from neorealism to
neoclassical realism, by supplying some conceptual tools with which to
study the way in which foreign policy interacts with international
phenomena, is an intriguing one. In this article it is not possible to
do more than point out the need for more research into the possibility
of CT providing a set of tools for filling out the internal mechanics of
neorealism and neoclassical realism, and to suggest that this could be
done in order to attempt to develop a more complete theoretical
framework within which to analyse complex international phenomena such
as China's rise.

#### Offensive realism is [empirically]{.underline} disproven --- WW2 transition from Britain to the US.

John Mearsheimer's [[offensive realism]{.underline}]{.mark}, derived
from the same structural principles as Waltz's 'defensive' realism[,
[states]{.mark} unequivocally that [a rising power will]{.mark} always
[challenge a hegemon]{.mark} militarily, an outcome he designates 'the
tragedy of great power politics']{.underline} (Mearsheimer 2001).
Mearsheimer, thus, consistently and confidently predicts that a rising
China will inevitably clash with the USA (Mearsheimer 2006, 2010).
Mearsheimer's hard-and-fast prediction of war between USA and its
challenger China gives offensive realism a clear edge over neorealism
and constructivism in terms of theoretical falsifiability. Eventually,
such a war will either occur or it will not. If global leadership passes
from USA to China with or without military confrontation at some point
in the 21st century, then Mearsheimer will be proved right or wrong: it
is simply a matter of waiting to see. However, Buzan and Cox (2013)
point out that [[there is]{.mark} **already [one historical]{.mark}**
[case of]{.mark} peaceful [power handover that]{.mark} [**casts
doubt**]{.mark} upon Mearsheimer's hypothesis: [the transition without
military confrontation from British to USA]{.mark} world
[hegemony]{.mark} in the aftermath of the Second World War.
[This,]{.mark} they suggest, [**invalidates Mearsheimer's** assertion of
the inevitability of a]{.mark} US--China [war]{.mark}, and thus also
upon offensive realism's main tenet.]{.underline} Even if historically
the majority of rising powers have challenged hegemons militarily,
[[**one exception** is sufficient to negate the theory's **predictive
power**]{.mark}**,** and to suggest that a peaceful power transition is
possible]{.underline}. [[Mearsheimer]{.mark} also [does not expound upon
**non-militaristic aspects**]{.mark} of China's rise]{.underline} (such
as economics and soft power), but focuses exclusively on security issues
(see Mearsheimer 2010). So, like neorealism and constructivism,
offensive [[realism emphasises one aspect]{.mark} of China's rise [to
the **exclusion of all others**]{.mark}]{.underline} and thus offers a
clear, parsimonious, but not a complete theoretical picture.

We hold that while [**power relations**, societal and cultural norms and
identities, or **domestic systems** and politics,]{.underline} cannot be
overlooked as structural conditions or causal factors, in the case of
most important foreign policy decisions, this [will not suffice. Such
[structural factors or variables]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} the necessary
but [**not sufficient** conditions for something]{.mark} to
happen]{.underline}. Left alone, as structures without agency, [[they
are nothing more]{.mark} than a frame for various [non-predictable
actions]{.mark}, some of which may blow back at these structures and
modify them.]{.underline} Indeed, [a good test case]{.underline} for the
predictive and explanatory power [of **IR grand theories** is the
aforementioned Russian behavior in respect of the Crimean crisis in
201]{.underline}4. In a poll conducted among 905 American researchers
about a week before Russia invaded Crimea (only) 14% of those
interviewed responded affirmatively to a question on whether Russia
would interfere militarily in Ukrainian affairs. [**[No major
differences]{.mark}** [between]{.mark} the schools---such as [realist,
constructivist, or liberal]{.mark}---[could be
detected]{.mark},]{.underline} although area studies (in-depth knowledge
of Russia and the post-Soviet area) performed somewhat better (Maliniak
et al., 2014; Voeten, 2014). [The **striking fact** remains that a
couple of [days prior]{.mark} to the invasion, [**all IR grand
theories** failed to anticipate Russia's behavior]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
the basis of [their respective]{.mark} and rather stable structurally
oriented explanatory [models]{.mark}, but their advocates **still
rushed** to provide their expected singlefactor explanations of the case
**right after it materialized** (McFaul et al., 2014). This reminds us
that [concepts **such as power, identity**, regime type or domestic
political determinants are so vague]{.mark} that [one can
**always**]{.mark} **use them** to [retrospectively explain an
event]{.mark} that was regarded as unlikely beforehand on the basis of
the self-same concepts (Forsberg & Pursiainen, 2017).]{.underline} The
[[structural factors]{.underline}]{.mark}, or the dynamics of the
agent-structure relationship[, [are]{.mark} hence **not
[sufficient]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} fully explain **or
[understand]{.mark}** [a foreign policy decision]{.mark}]{.underline},
and [[we]{.mark} may [need to consider the **psychological factors**
involved]{.mark} in such a situation]{.underline}. [[Without
understanding]{.mark} the psychological dimension **of the main
decision-maker**(s), namely the notion [that beliefs, cognitive biases,
personality]{.mark}, and interpersonal relations [may play a role, we
are **not** ]{.mark}**really [able]{.mark}** [to explain]{.mark} some
aspects of [any decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not a
revolutionary conclusion, but suffices to raise the question of when and
how psychology matters. While psychology is always present in human
decision-making, [some decisions are rather clear-cut from the
explicitly pronounced psychological perspective and others more
complex]{.underline}. [In some cases, psychological factors matter more
than in others]{.underline}. We can regard it as an empirical issue when
it comes to how much they matter in comparison with a particular
baseline. It is one thing to argue that there are psychological
mechanisms involved in decision-making and we need to study them, but
quite another to say that they are the most important or decisive
factors. Peter Hedström and Petri Ylikoski (2010, p. 60) argue that
"[only those aspects of cognition that are relevant for the explanatory
task at hand should be included in the explanation, and the explanatory
task thus determines how rich the psychological assumptions must
be."]{.underline} Although psychological mechanisms can only provide
partial explanations, they can however sometimes make a crucial
difference. Knowledge of rare or weak mechanisms still increases our
understanding. When conducting research, we may gain more by revealing
new or surprising explanatory mechanisms than proving that the most
obvious explanation for an event or a pattern of behavior has something
to do with it.

### 2NC --- AT: Rational Choice Theory

#### Collapses in on itself.

The key problem with thin [[**rational choice** theory]{.mark} is that
it [cannot be **directly tested**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The very meaning
of [rationality is [too broad]{.mark},]{.underline} and open to post hoc
formulations. If [the idea of utility is subjective, **[any action can
be explained rationally]{.mark}**. [Self-interest understood as utility
may mean whatever one wishes,]{.mark} including altruism or
self-destruction. However, [the more open the]{.mark} **concept of
[utility]{.mark}** is rendered, [the]{.mark} **[less useful]{.mark}** it
becomes.]{.underline} [When [preferences]{.mark} are deduced from the
action, they [are tautological as explanations]{.mark} and rat[ional
choice loses its celebrated predictive powe]{.mark}r]{.underline}. [If
[rational choice theory explains]{.mark} everything, it explains
[nothing]{.mark} (Nicholson, 1996; Smelser, 1992, p. 403), in which case
it is of little help in explaining human choices]{.underline}. Some IR
rational choice theorists think that rational choice is only a partial
theory insomuch as it explains states' behavior when they are behaving
rationally (Glaser, 2010, p. 27), but this reasoning becomes circular.
The logic is reminiscent of Hans Morgenthau's (1955) view of political
realism concerning the life sphere of a 'political man', but not that of
a 'moral' or 'religious man'. Further, rational choice theory's
popularity is not necessarily based on rational reasons. Its theorists
have not been open to criticism and have been reluctant to consider
alternatives to their theory. For example, Donald Green and Ian Shapiro
(1994, pp. 6--7) have argued that a large number of rational choice
propositions have not been tested empirically. [They contend that
[empirical research applying rational choice]{.mark} [has been
theory-driven]{.mark} **rather than problem-driven**, and they suspect
that [rational choice hypotheses]{.mark} are often formulated in ways
that [are **inherently resistant** to]{.mark} genuine [empirical
testing]{.mark}. Even if they have been tested, they have not been
compared with other possible explanations. Hence,
**[proponents]{.mark}** of rational choice theory have [not followed
**their own doctrine**]{.mark} [in weighing]{.mark} the available
alternatives and **choosing the best** among them]{.underline}. In order
to be more than a formal theory of modeling, rational choice needs to be
modified to a middle-range theory. In this way, it can be part of a
larger conceptual toolbox upon which a social theorist can draw when
devising tractable theoretical explanations of social phenomena (Rutar,
2020a, 2020b). [Yet in order to be a middle-range theory, providing
testable hypotheses to begin with, it has to assume more than the idea
of utility maximization in the abstract]{.underline} (Wolbring, 2020).
In security studies, scholars such as Stephen Walt (1999, p. 8) have
seen little value in the increasing volume of very technical research
based on rational choice. In his view, "while the formal techniques have
facilitated the construction of precise and deductively sound arguments,
the problem is that rational choice theorists have generated
comparatively few new hypotheses and have for the most part not been
tested in a careful and systematic way." An interesting question arises
as to when states rely on a rational choice type of decision-making in
practice. [A cost--benefit calculus and a probability assessment make
sense when the alternatives are numerical. This is the case in trade
policy and economic bargaining where the alternatives are known at least
with some certainty and can be compared]{.underline}. [[If there
is]{.mark} **considerable [uncertainty]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} the
**expected [consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [a decisionmaking
calculus becomes **more abstract** and various [cognitive
factors]{.mark} start to [play a more significant
role]{.mark}.]{.underline} Many rational choice theorists have assumed
that the theory is universal; any individual would behave similarly in a
similar situation. Positing that this is not literally true---as in
reality the adoption of a rational choice type of decision-making
depends on the cognitive styles of individuals, or the organizational
culture---but an abstraction, rational choice theorists do not see that
sensible scope conditions were available. However, Brian Rathbun, Joshua
Kertzer and Mark Paradis (2017) have argued that [there are individual
differences that are traceable to psychological microfoundations, at
least on a sliding scale: [rationalist foreign policymakers are
ego-centric]{.mark} and possess high epistemic motivation. The
instrumentally rational archetype[, homo diplomaticus]{.mark}, is
reflective, engaging and active.]{.underline} In Rathbun's (2019) view,
an instrumentally rational leader relies on an objective analysis of the
situation, including taking how the adversary interprets one's own
actions seriously, and conducts careful deliberation before making
decisions. Although such leaders do not necessarily have to be realists,
a policy of Realpolitik is not possible without such rationality.
Rathbun believes that [**very [few]{.mark} state [leaders]{.mark}** or
advisors **actually [follow]{.mark}** such a model of instrumental
[rationality **with any consistency**]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Cosmopolitanism

#### The alternative is to embrace a cosmopolitan ethic

**Burke 2015** (Anthony Burke, Professor of Politics and International
Relations at the University of New South Wales, "Security
cosmopolitanism: the next phase",
<https://doi.org/10.1080/21624887.2015.1065109>) //sethlee

Hence, I disagree with Robinson that we can jettison moral principles or
rules entirely in favour of 'practices of responsibility that emerge in
the thick context of sustained social interactions among moral subjects'
or, differently, in favour of what Arendt termed 'thinking without a
banister', relying on 'the silent dialogue between me and myself which,
since Socrates and Plato, we usually call thinking' (Arendt 2003, 45).
To be sure, there is great value in cultivating practices of social and
internal dialogue that resist the reduction of ethics to unthinking
habits and procedures, or undemocratic structures of institutional
command. However, such practices of responsibility need to be embedded
in a deeper level of guidance and commitment, so that we know what ends
we should seek, whose voices and interests matter, and what kind of
world we ought to try to collectively create on the basis of what we
take to exist there. [[Cosmopolitan calls to move beyond the
nation-state,]{.underline}]{.mark} and posthuman calls to push beyond
anthropocentrism, [[are]{.mark} precisely **[efforts to reshape that
fundamental matrix for ethics]{.mark}** and politics by expanding our
understanding of what exists and matters]{.underline}. In the era of Fox
News, Islamic, Christian, and market fundamentalism, anti-scientism,
climate denial, and right-wing populism, [we cannot rely on the
iterative wisdom of social interaction by itself, because there are
already background discourses]{.underline} working furiously to
instantiate a crippled and divisive vision of common ends that are --
quite literally -- [working to destroy our planet[. In]{.mark} the space
of [i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations, [cosmopolitan]{.mark} and
posthuman [**perspectives are of enormous value** because they are a
metaphysical challenge to existing,]{.mark} architectonic visions of
realist-cumliberal global order]{.underline} (Burke 2013b). Such visions
of order already prescribe a moral and ethical system that has sunk deep
roots in our social and political worlds. It seems selfdefeating to
oppose the articulation of alternative visions because of an automatic
(and historically warranted) poststructuralist suspicion of
universalism. Vulnerable communities and ecologies need the protection
of a just and responsive global order, yet many of my critics disdain
even thinking on the plane of that order[. In this light,
cosmopolitanism and the categorical imperative of security have a
crucial function that many of the commentaries fail to recognise. By
universalising the right to security, [by emphasising the determining
demand of equality between all humans and the planetary
ecology]{.mark}]{.underline} (indeed the moral priority of the ecologies
in which humans are existentially embedded), [[the theory insists that
it is no longer permissible to prioritise one state]{.mark} or group's
security **[over another,]{.mark}** or humanity over
nature]{.underline}. [[It is no longer permissible to license
structures]{.mark} and responses [that undermine fundamental
rights]{.mark} or damage the security of others]{.underline}, including
non-human others, in defense of the imagined self. [The self is
dispersed into the world, into the past and future, and our ethics must
honour that. The ethics of security [cosmopolitanism]{.mark} in fact
encodes contestability and context, while setting up crucial boundaries
and principles of balance. Principle 1 [requires an ongoing]{.mark} and
complex **[dialogue within and between governments,
communities]{.mark},** groups, scientists, [and policymakers over how to
create systems that will preserve the planet]{.mark}ary ecology [and
'protect]{.mark} the vital core of **[human lives]{.mark}** in ways that
enhance human fulfilment']{.underline} across multiple spheres of
activity and risk (Burke 2013a, 21; quotations from CHS 2003).
[Groups]{.underline} may perceive 'survival, livelihood and dignity' in
different ways; their voices must be heard and honoured, but it is when
these differences generate threats to others or a clash over security
needs, that dialogue, compromise, and active forms of ameliorative
politics must come into play. [[**This includes the discursive
dimension:** groups must be willing to redefine their understanding of
security to]{.mark} take account of [the]{.mark} security [needs of
others]{.mark} and the biosphere. [Principles]{.mark} 2 and 3 similarly
**[require dialogue and deliberation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but also
science and expertise, because of the challenge of mapping potential
futures, the technical complexity of many domains, and the profundity of
the responsibility that these principles enact. As earth systems ecology
and the nuclear space highlight, there is a challenging need to combine
predictive scientific models, probabilistic reasoning, the precautionary
principle, and public dialogue to consider potential futures and their
associated responsibilities in the now. [I regard these future-oriented
principles to be the most significant part of the entire
theory.]{.underline} Climate scientists and ecologists implicitly grasp
their import: as the group that warned the world to restrict global
warming to less than 1°C concluded, 'continuation of high fossil fuel
emissions, given current knowledge of the consequences, would be an act
of extraordinary witting intergenerational injustice' (Hansen et al.
2013, 1).

### 2NC\-\--Desecuritize Cybersecurity

#### The alternatives solves the AFF\-\--reject the AFF's securitization discourse in favor of desecuritizing the cyber threats

Desecuritisation and cybersecurity

The Kosovo War, the Millennium Bug, and the war on terror acted as
catalysts for the emergence of a form of cyber securitisation at a
crucial early period in post-Cold War history and demonstrated both how
cyberconflict could spill over into the physical realm and geopolitics
could spill into the cyber realm. They also provided the political
context and ordering ideas and concepts that fed into the emergence of
social media networks in the mid-2000s and the recent growth of
system-wide cyberattacks, such as Wannacry. But while much of the
academic literature on securitisation describes the process by which
issues become securitised, the reverse process, where issues are
desecuritised, is undertheorized (Coskun 2008) and has not yet been
substantively applied to cybersecurity debates and issues. [Articulated
most clearly by Buzan and Wæver (2003, 489), desecuritisation is 'a
process in which a political community downgrades or ceases to treat
something as an existential threat to a valued referent object and
reduces or stops calling for exceptional measures to deal with the
threat'. But how can this be achieved and what are the potential
obstacles and barriers to cyber desecuritisation more
specifically?]{.underline}

[If securitisation is a process driven by ontological insecurity,
defined here as an erosion of identity and an anxiety created and
fuelled by globalisation, then the place to start in a process of
cyber-desecuritisation **must be to reframe discourse and present cyber
'threats' in less apocalyptic, fearful tones.**]{.underline} This
involves moving towards a normalised and less polemic political debate
in which cybersecurity is not continually treated as an emergency but
rather as a regular feature of modern political interactions. It also
means avoiding the Cold War, WW2, and biological analogies that have
dominated cybersecurity discourse. Changing cyber metaphors in this way
could lead to better cyber policy and placing emphasis on more positive
environmental language, such as 'healthy ecosystems', might generate
wider discursive progress (Lawson 2012). [In other words, if
securitisation involves framing an issue as an existential threat, a
process of desecuritisation must do the opposite -- highlight the real
impact and not the expected or likely impact -- to ease tensions and
fear created by cyberattacks, and to manage threats rather than
overreact to them]{.underline}. This will necessarily involve
recognising that cyberattacks exacerbate identity divides and working
consciously to move past characterisations of cyberattacks as technical
tools of state conflict, portraying them instead as extensions of
historical, cultural and political disputes within and between states
and societal groups. Cyberattacks may have serious consequences, but
pose less threat than natural disasters, climate change, nuclear
weapons, and biological agents and pandemics. This observation has come
into stark relief in the context of COVID 19, which has caused over a
million deaths, as opposed to cyberattacks, which, as a result of a
recent attack against a hospital in Germany, appear to have now caused
just one (Wetsman 2020). As this article has shown, however, the fear
they create drives responses that are out of sync with the level of
threat involved.

The Copenhagen School itself recognised the utility of these options,
describing three core processes that desecuritisation can be based upon.
The first is to not talk about issues in terms of security in the first
place (Wæver 2000). Cleary, the rhetoric that cyberattacks have created
over the last two decades render this option obsolete. However, changing
the language from now on, being more cautious about presenting
cyberattacks as an existential threat, and toning down the cyber
rhetoric could help the process of desecuritisation. Specific policy
commitments could be made by governments not to further securitise
cyber, to construct common language across domestic and international
political entities that does not fuel securitisation processes and,
considering the influence of commercial and media entities in the cases
described above, to encourage responsible reporting and advertising that
does not create fear either to sell newspapers or cybersecurity
products.

[The second option when an issue has already been securitised, as in the
case of cybersecurity, is to avoid creating security dilemmas (societal
and interstate).]{.underline} Securitisation in cyberspace has involved
the implementation of defensive measures to protect computer networks.
These include technical, human and virtual tools. But defensive actions
can be interpreted as offensive ones. This is the nature of the security
dilemma. The blurring of the disti2nction between cyberattack and
defence, and the creation of modes of 'active cyber defence' and
pre-emptive network intrusions, has furthered the mistrust and
misperception that exist between prominent cybersecurity actors. In the
most substantive analysis of security dilemmas in cyberspace, Ben
Buchanan (2016) argues that intelligence collection, or cyberespionage,
creates and exacerbates cybersecurity dilemmas, especially as there is a
strong link between intelligence collection and network attack. It is
unreasonable to suggest that intelligence agencies are going to stop
intruding on adversary networks -- this pattern of activity seems to be
widely accepted and commonplace in the contemporary era. However,
progress has been made in limiting the activities of intelligence
agencies and prosecuting foreign adversary hackers when involved in
commercial cyberespionage, and there has been some attempt to reach
agreements between the leading powers to limit the scope of commercial
cyberespionage, as in the case of the agreement between Xi Jinping and
President Obama in 2016. Avoiding security dilemmas will also involve
ongoing dialogue and negotiation between the states even within a
context of 'cheating' -- measures taken to circumvent existing
agreements, which is what has occurred since the agreement between the
US and China, with a notable increase in Chinese espionage observed
during the Trump administration (Harold, Libicki, and Cevallos 2016).
Buchanan further argues that mitigating the cybersecurity dilemma
involves building baseline defences (these will be particularly
important in the societal sector), building trust between adversaries
(difficult in the existing deteriorating environment, but not
impossible), taking unilateral steps to increase international stability
(including, for example, reporting zero-day vulnerabilities, and
establishing and communicating a posture for dealing with the intrusions
when they inevitable do occur). [These steps, when combined with a
discursive commitment to **lower the cyber rhetoric and hyperbole**, may
constitute significant progress towards desecuritisation.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Transform Discourse

#### Vote neg to reject China securitization in favor of transforming our discourse and knowledge production

**Rogelja and Tsimonis 2020** (Igor Rogelja, Fellow at European
University Institute, and Konstantinos Tsimonis, Lecturer at Lau China
Institute "Narrating the China Threat: Securitising Chinese Economic
Presence in Europe",
<https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/13/1/103/5739302?login=true#199079137>)
//sethlee

The structure is thus complete. [[In]{.mark}]{.underline} this
[[securitising narrative, China's actions in Europe
are]{.mark}]{.underline} wholly [**[political,]{.mark}** [designed to
sow dissent]{.mark}]{.underline} and discord and aided by a number of
collaborators and sleeper agents. Yet as we have argued, the
**[[securitising discourse rests on rhetorical
devices]{.underline}]{.mark}**, de-contextualised cases, [[and a callous
disregard for alternative, more convincing]{.underline}]{.mark} and
falsifiable [[explanations]{.underline}]{.mark} which do not take CCP
propaganda at face value. [The resulting image]{.underline} of Chinese
companies, associations, and individuals as the long arms [of the
Chinese state is a distortion]{.underline}, and one can [easily identify
many areas of overlap with the original version of the 1990s China
Threat scenario in the USA.]{.underline}

What is missing in these reports is, first of all, a case-by-case
examination of the deals, the agency and the degree of involvement of
different actors, the behaviour of Chinese companies within existing
regulatory frameworks, and a contextualisation through comparison with
companies from other third countries. [[This would
include]{.underline}]{.mark} fine-grain [[academic research on
Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}-financed [[projects,]{.mark} analysing
their **[actual impact]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and assessing their
individual and collective implications without recourse to disparaging
comparisons]{.underline} to so-called 'banana
republics'.[124](javascript:;) An analytical approach that gives
precedence to facts over perceptions would also contribute to a calmer
assessment of the broader issues of EU--China trade reciprocity and
market access which need to be resolved. In this regard[, [the 'China
Threat']{.mark} frame [advocated by]{.mark}]{.underline} many think
tanks, journalists, and [[politicians **risks transforming these issues
into a zero-sum game**]{.underline},]{.mark} thereby
[**[reducing]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[[political space for
negotiation]{.mark}]{.underline}** and compromise.

[Another common problem in these reports is that think tanks widely
disregard areas of immediate concern to European citizens]{.underline},
such as the impact of Chinese SOEs on industrial relations,
environmental standards, and local economies and societies. This
bottom-up problematisation is missing in the top-down securitising
narrative, possibly because the negative impact of Chinese investment in
these areas is sometimes in accord with the dominant developmental
paradigm of the EU and its member states. In addition, [[**a more
careful line of analysis would need to consider** how current and
prospective **EU member states can best benefit
from**]{.underline}]{.mark} the availability of **[[Chinese
investment]{.mark} and financing]{.underline}** at a time when austerity
and economic stagnation put the European project in question. In this
regard, the EU investment screening mechanism must not prioritise the
interests of high-tech sectors of the wealthy North over the
labour-intensive industries of economically weak countries, or risk
further discord among member states.

Lastly, the [[securitising discourse ultimately reveals an **underlying
hegemonic assumption that a 'core**]{.underline}]{.mark}' of one or two
major **[[European power]{.underline}]{.mark}**s **[[will
decide]{.underline}]{.mark}** the EU's terms of **[[engagement with
China, according to their own]{.mark}]{.underline}** economic
**[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}** and domestic political mood
changes. This assumption runs the risk of entrenching divisions among EU
states on an issue that does not represent a threat to European unity.
In response, a balanced analysis of the challenges and opportunities
that Chinese investment brings needs to emphasise the EU's tested
ability to synthesise different views and interests, which is a
fundamental promise to its members.

### 2NC\-\--Reread World Minus NATO

#### We need to reread the world outside of NATO\-\--it solves best

Giovanni **Ercolani 11**, "Keeping Security and Peace: Behind the
Strategicalization of NATO's "Critical Security Discourse"", Security
Strategies Journal, Vol 7, Issue 14, Dec 2011, p76-80
[\\\\pairie](file:///\\pairie)

Conclusion: We Have to Reinvent Ourselves I would like to conclude this
paper by stating that the human species is living in a particular moment
in which globalisation has made the world smaller and where not
everybody is a NATO model reader. [NATO readers should need to reinvent
themselves and face the world outside their GPNF, and this is a
discourse close to the concept of "emancipation" developed by Ken
Booth.]{.underline}

"As discourse of politics, emancipation seeks the securing of people
from those oppressions that stop them carrying out what they would
freely choose to do, compatible with the freedom of others. It provides
a three-fold framework for politics: a philosophical anchorage for
knowledge, a theory of progress for society, and a practice of
resistance against oppression. Emancipation is the philosophy, theory,
and politics of inventing humanity" (Booth, 2007, p. 112).

Undoubtedly, the NATO Reader has to re-read the world because he can not
pretend to live as an immortal human being in a NATO-kept castle and
forget or ignore not only the two clocks but even the world outside it.
The Alliance structure would really like that its clock could be as the
one of Benjamin Button and run backwards into the time of its youth, and
NATO definitely act as it will live "in aeternum". And this is because,
despite the NATO narrative, despite the fact that NATO is "the most
successful alliance in human history" (Ash, 2011), outside the NATO
GPNF-cave, and NATO lines other realities are taking shape.

1\. Other countries like China (with a population of 1.5 billion) have
produced their own concept of war. "Unrestricted Warfare" is a book on
military strategy written in 1999 by two colonels in the People\'s
Liberation Army, Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui. The book rather than
focusing on direct military confrontation examines a variety of other
means which can be summarized in the Formula: Schwartzkopf + Soros +
Xiaomolisi + Bin Laden (Liang and Xiangsui, 1999).

2\. At the G20 Seoul meeting (2010) even the map of the world financial
crisis was changed. Despite the western countries depicted the financial
crisis as a global one, its perception from other global actors and
emerging economies was completely different. According to O\'Neill
(Goldman Sachs), policy makers in Asia were referring to the global
credit crisis as the "North Atlantic Crisis" (BBC News, Today, 2010).
Thus, and for the first time, the "others" defined our military alliance
as a financial system.

3\. When we look at the "Multiple Stress Zone" map presented by the NATO
General Soligan in 2009, how can we not see that is the exact copy of
Pentagon Map which was produced in the year 2004 (Barnett, 2004) to
highlight the grand strategy for the American foreign policy?
Furthermore, the Pentagon Map is much more than a simple cartographic
representation of the planet, it is a division of the world countries
between the Functioning Core, characterized by economic interdependence,
and the Non-Integrated Gap, characterized by unstable leadership and
absence from international trade. The Core can be sub-divided into Old
Core (North America, Western Europe, Japan, Australia) and New Core
(China, India). The Non-Integrated Gap includes the Middle East, South
Asia (except India), most of Africa, Southeast Asia, and Northwest South
America. Thus using a realist terminology the Functioning Core can
represent the land of order while the Non-Integrated Gap the land of
anarchy and disorder and also it can be seen as a tentative to
"ethnicalize" the world (Aime, 2004, p. 73-100). And if what can happen
in the Non-Integrated Gap can produce security concerns to the NATO
countries (which are part of the Functioning Core) and justify a
military intervention in their internal affairs then "fear is something
that is actually missing in a situation of international anarchy, and
because it is missing it must be invented and skilfully deployed"
(Weber, 2005, p. 23).

4\. World Population Growth Rate: "By 2003, the combined population of
Europe, the United States, and Canada accounted for just 17 percent of
the global population. In 2050, this figure is expected to be just 12
percent. (...) Today, roughly nine out of ten children under the age of
15 live in developing countries. (...) Indeed, over 70 percent of the
world's population growth between now and 2050 will take place in 24
countries, all of which are classified by the World Bank as low income
or lower-middle income, with an average per capita income under \$ 3,855
in 2008" (Goldstone, 2010 and Minois, 2011).

5\. Consumption factor. We have already seen that the estimated one
billion people who live in developed countries, which, coincidentally,
is the same number of NATO people (the "our"), have a relative per
capita consumption rate of 32, while the rest of the "others" (the 5.5
billion people that constitute the developing world, have relative per
capita consumption rates below 32, mostly down toward 1). How will it be
possible to "secure our future" and then maintain a consumption factor
of 32 when the "others" will want to consume like us? "The World Bank
has predicted that by 2030 the number of middle-class people in the
developing world will be 1.2 billion (a rise of 200 percent since 2005).
This means that the developing world's middle class alone will be larger
that the total populations of Europe, Japan, and the United States
combined. From now on, therefore, the main driver of global economic
expansion will be the economic growth of newly-industrialized countries,
such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey" (Goldstone,
2010).

6\. Life expectancy rate. Will the people living in the "multiple stress
zone" (the non- integrated gap) accept their dramatic living conditions,
and live less than the people living in other parts of the globe? Will
they accept the status quo that has produced their misery or will they
rebel? And the peace that NATO will impose on them will be a "positive
peace" or a "negative peace" which will reproduce the same "structural
violence" that provoked unrest and internal conflict, and not seeing
instead the "civil war as a system" (Keen, 2009, p. 11-24)?

[We should accept the reality and we should reinvent ourselves. And the
first step to take will be **to re-read the world out-side the NATO
narrative** because we have to be aware of the advice which one of the
supposed fathers of Realism gave to the Prince: "Therefore it is
unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have
enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. (...)
because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by
what comes of it."20 Then conscious that in front of us there is a
narrative which "has to appear" we have to free ourselves and not act as
the Pavlov's dog but illuminated by the doubt in front a narrative which
pretends to narrate the reality and re-read the world outside the NATO
keep.]{.underline}

It is the gift of the doubt which, as the Italian writer Leonardo
Sciascia wrote some years ago, distinguishes the intellectual from the
charlatan. Because "in the historical and human history the truth can
appear confused and the lie can assume the appearance of veracity"
(Sciascia, 1963).

Then it is in the intellectual intention to emancipate the reader from a
well-defined image-interpretation of a supposed reality that the
"security analyst needs to engage as a political philosopher. This is
because the value of security is in constant tension and interdependence
with other values, most prominent of which are the values of freedom,
prosperity and justice" (Dannreuther, 2007, p. 8).

Thus emancipate the "homo videns", who is entrapped in a NATO GPNF which
reminds us of Plato's Cave and means to give him back his capacity of
abstraction and return to him his ability to think, and act autonomously
and responsibly and not as a proficient apparatus. [And instead of
"securing our future" in which "our" means the NATO people, replace it
with "we**", the international society,** because we have to accept that
in this earthly life there are two clocks and the evolution of the human
being has to be continuous. We are responsible for the coming generation
to which country, race, religion, and the like belong because "we" are
all human beings,]{.underline} all "Homines sapientes".

### 2NC\-\--Rethink Security

#### Vote negative to rethink security 

**Burke et al 2014** - Associate Prof and Reader in International and
Political Studies at UNSW Australia; Anthony, Katrina Lee-Koo, and Matt
McDonald, *Ethics and Global Security*, Routledge, p. 19-21

A final point is necessary on the relationship between security and
ethics as we conceive it, by way of introduction to this book[. To
develop a cosmopolitan ethics of security is not simply a case of
applying \"cosmopolitanism\" to a particular issue area in global
politics]{.underline} (security), **[but rather, rethinking how we
understand and practice security]{.underline}**. [What limits existing
accounts of the relationship between ethics and security is the tendency
to ignore or downplay the particular politic of security: its centrality
to the]{.underline} political [legitimacy of the key actors]{.underline}
in global politics; [its capacity to define the core values]{.underline}
of communities, and the manner in which they might be protected or
advanced; [its capacity to mobilise particular political
responses]{.underline} or the actors undertaking them. -Fins is
particularly applicable to discourses of \"human security\'\', for
example, and to some extent, critical engagement with security grounded
in concerns with emancipation (Booth 2007). It is for these reasons that
[security is often seen to belong to the realm of \"high politics\": the
most important objective of states, wherein the naming and relationship
of \"security\" and \"threat\" designates political priority and can
trigger extraordinary]{.underline} (and frequently illiberal and
antidemocratic) [responses,]{.underline} such as the violation of human
rights or international law. [This political function of security makes
an analysis of the ethics of security more urgent,]{.underline} in part
[because]{.underline} [of what is at stake in **debates about
security**]{.underline} (definitions of community and values, and
responsibilities to the self and others, for example). But [this
politics of security **also complicates** the simple application of
cosmopolitan thought.]{.underline} In our view, [what is needed is
sustained engagement with the \"politics of security\" that argues for
moral progress, while taking seriously the dangers of securitization and
the apparent constraints placed upon the articulation of radical
security alternatives]{.underline}. When taking account of the politics
of security here[, we particularly focus on the \'function of
representations]{.underline} or discourses [of security in defining
group identity]{.underline}, enabling particular policy or legitimating
particular actors as security providers\' (Browning and McDonald 2013).
Engagement with the politics of security in this way has tended to come
from theorists ofs ecurity in the post-structural tradition. For such
thinkers, representations of security define political community or
integrate individuals into an abstract notion of political community or
national values (Burke 2008a; Campbell 1998a; Weldes 1999[).
Security]{.underline}, in this sense, [can become a form of
governmentality that shapes and moulds individuals for political
ends]{.underline}. David Campbell\'s (1992, 1998a) analysis of the
function of Cold War discourses of the communist threat in the United
States is perhaps the most obvious case here. For Campbell[, national
security discourses served to define American identity in a narrow and
highly, politicised way]{.underline}. [In the process of constructing
external threats to which the state]{.underline} ( in this instance)
[positions itself as the actor capable of providing
security]{.underline}, [those with power can exclude dissenting voices
and political alternatives, and **shut down needed debates about
policy.**]{.underline} For the so-called Copenhagen (or
\"securitization\") School, security can be understood as a social
construction, brought into being through \"speech acts\" that define
particular dynamics, actors or things as [existential
threats.]{.underline} In the process, these issues [are elevated above
the realm of \"normal- politics and into the high politics arena of
security,]{.underline} [where they are dealt with]{.underline} through
[urgency and secrecy.]{.underline} While its proponents do not deny the
possibility that such developments may be progressive, ultimately their
preference is for desecuritization: the removal of issues from the
security agenda. This is most frequently based on the claim that
security has an illiberal logic, limiting the possibility for dialogue
and locating responsibility for providing security to those with power.
But such a sedimented view of the logic of security can also apply to
its meaning. For Ole Wxver (1995), at the heart of the concept of
security \'we still find something to do with defence and the state\' (
see also Berki 1986; Neocleous 2008). These alternative conceptions of
security will be examined in more detail in the Chapter 1. They suggest
something distinct about the study of security that makes it
qualitatively different from other issue areas or \"promises\" of
government. In this, we would agree, and reaffirm the need to take
seriously the politics of security. But if these critics have most
explicitly engaged with the politics of security and its dangers, their
proposed response to the dangers of securitization---resisting or
escaping security and its logics is problematic (Dillon and Reid 2009;
Dillon 1996; W;,ever 1995). For these scholars, security is something
that should be resisted, escaped or challenged. We think such critics go
too far. They are right to identify the dangers of an unthinking embrace
of security as a site of progress, and right too in drawing attention to
the ways in which the promise of security for some can all too easily be
defined on the basis of the continued suffering and marginalization of
others, both within a particular political community and beyond. Yet, in
acknowledging the pathologies of a dominant security discourse, and in
failing to articulate a progressive alternative, they mistake this
discourse for the timeless essence of what security means and does,
paradoxically reinforcing its centrality in international relations. In
rejecting the possibility that a range of actors can and do enact
progressive notions of security, they deprive marginal actors and
communities of a site of contestation and change. This pessimism has
been contested in a range of \" positive. \" critical accounts of
security (Booth 2007; Burke 2013a; Floyd 2011; Nunes 2012;
Hoogensen-Gjory 2012; McDonald 2014; Roe 2012). [What is
needed]{.underline}, then, [is an approach that is at once attuned to
the dangers of embracing security]{.underline}---given its history of
contributing to exclusionary practices and the status quo---[while
refusing to give up on defining a cosmopolitan conception of security
oriented towards an integrated global society, and the rights and needs
of the least powerful and most vulnerable]{.underline}. In a related
way, [we are concerned to see global security as a major priority that
can be addressed as a part of the normal]{.underline} (not exceptional[)
practice of government and civil society action that are democratically
and internationally accountable]{.underline}. In part, this is because
[exceptionalist practices]{.underline} have tended to reinforce
nationalism and alienation[, privilege the security of the few and
undermine it for the many, and gravely damage global cooperation and
consciousness]{.underline}. When international organisations become
involved in global security governance, [it is imperative that their
practices and objectives either reflect the global interests and
international norms painstakingly developed over decades]{.underline},
or seek to improve them in the cause of a just global security order
that supports human dignity and flourishing.

### 2AC\-\--AT: AI Securitization (Inevitable) 

#### The link is non unique\-\--securitization is a global trend and an ongoing process\-\--no reason why the AFF is uniquely bad OR triggers the impact

The article also explores how the Chinese AI approach and its security
logic are embedded in China's historical, geopolitical, and domestic
contexts. China's desire for AI sits in the wider context of the
country's pursuit of modern technologies. [China's high anxiety over
technology competition arises from the historical discourse that blames
China's "century of humiliation" on its past under-performances in
global technology competition.]{.underline} In this regard, the
historical experience of "humiliation"---not just in being militarily
invaded, but also failing to keep pace with technical development,
justifies the need for contemporary mobilization, thus to avoid history
repeating itself. [Geopolitically speaking, China's national approach
towards AI and moves to make it a security matter are fuelled by ever
more competitive United States-- China relations. Each side's perception
of the other's AI advancement as a threat accelerates the securitization
process.]{.underline} In the domestic arena, [where the primary concern
is the regime security of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the
practical use of AI and its relevant discourses are geared to securing
authoritarian rule.]{.underline} In this regard, China's bold AI
experiments practice a unique digital technocracy, making its AI
approach quite distinct from that in Western societies.

Currently, **[this securitization is an ongoing process]{.underline}**.
Although the extent of its impact on targeted audiences, namely, local
governments, market actors, intellectuals, and the general public,
remains unclear, all nevertheless enthusiastically echo the central
government's AI campaign. In this regard, [such securitization appears
to convince domestic actors. However, it also generates unintended
consequences. They are: (i) creation of a nationalistic environment that
makes China less attractive to global AI labor and capital; (ii)
impaired industrial efficiency by virtue of focusing on self-reliance;
(iii) obstruction of China's global AI governance leadership; (iv)
reinforced technological rivalry due to disregard for potential global
AI cooperation; and (v) constraints on the global access of Chinese AI
companies. All could undermine China's key objectives of fostering a
booming AI economy and becoming a global AI leader.]{.underline}

Theoretically, this article echoes the call to develop a global
Copenhagen School of security studies by expanding its non-Western
politics agenda.

The Chinese Journal of International Politics, 2021, Vol. 14, No. 3 419

Attendant difficulties notwithstanding, it shows that securitization has
considerable explanatory power in the Chinese context. Empirically, this
article develops a more accurate understanding of China's AI politics,
and also connotes an emerging research agenda for studying the
relationship between AI and security. AI's potential to transform our
society has profound implications for security politics. [As this
article will discuss, the securitization of AI is not solely a Chinese
practice, but **rather a global trend.**]{.underline} [Nowadays, AI is
often framed as a national--- and international---security matter in
both the United States and Europe]{.underline}. In this regard,
securitization of AI, including, but not limited to China's practices,
merits more attention from the Copenhagen School and the wider security
community.

Analytical Framework: Securitization

The concept of securitization in critical security studies is primarily
associated with the so-called "Copenhagen School," and the works of its
leading scholars, including Barry Buzan and Ole Wæver, who consider
security as a "speech act"8 ---"by saying, something is done."9
Securitization refers to the discursive process whereby actors, usually
elites and state actors, transform a particular issue into a security
matter. During this process, actors will label a particular issue as a
security threat and incorporate it into a security agenda to justify
extraordinary countermeasures. Securitization is considered successful
when the relevant audience accepts that the issue in question is a
security threat, thus empowering emergency measures.

The securitization process involves a series of key terms, including
"securitizing actor," "securitizing move," "referent object," and
"audience."10 Securitizing actor refers to the person or actor who
labels a matter as a security issue, an attempt that is a securitizing
move. Referent object refers to that labeled as an object, which needs
to be protected from the claimed security threat during the securitizing
move. Audience is the group for whom this securitizing move is performed
which must be convinced in order that the extraordinary measures to deal
with the security threat are accepted.

Originating in the Western-centric Copenhagen School, most studies on
securitization are based in a Western, or perhaps more accurately,
European, democratic context. After all, securitization is a process
whereby an actor shifts a particular matter beyond the "normal" state of
affairs to an emergency national security agenda.11 This usually
requires a liberal democratic society to represent the regular
democratic polity from which such emergent national security politics 8

Michigan user on 26 June 2022 can appear. As, however, this inevitably
makes securitization theory less useful for understanding security in a
non-liberal-democratic political order, it both limits the scope of the
securitization agenda and fails to realize international relations. In
the context of global power transition, wherein Western dominance is in
decline, many, including Buzan, call for a more global understanding of
international relations and securitization.12 This requires considerable
attention to security politics in non-Western societies.

It goes without saying that this admirable non-Western politics agenda
faces critical challenges, because security politics operates in a very
different way within a non-democratic, often authoritarian, and
illiberal setting. Nevertheless, early attempts have been made to apply
securitization theory to explain security dynamics from the Middle East,
including Egypt,13 Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain14; Africa15; Latin America,
including Brazil and Mexico16; North America, including Cuba17; South
Asia, including India18; to Central Asia, including Kyrgyzstan.19 In the
case of China, securitization has proven useful to understanding climate
and energy politics.20 Vuori's research, for example, shows its 12

crises in the eras of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin,
suggesting that in the Chinese context the principal audience of the
securitizing move is not the general public, but elites who have the
power to shape the security agenda.21

The article expands this non-Western security politics agenda by
studying AI in China. Previous security studies have explored the
relations between securitization and technology.22 The work of Hansen
and Nissenbaum, for example, uses securitization theory to analyze the
concept of cyber security.23 Using Estonian digital structures in 2007
as a case study, it develops a framework to theorize cyber-security as a
distinct sector on the security studies research agenda. This article
draws the security studies community's attention to how a top emerging
technology, i.e. AI, has been securitized in the Chinese context.

[Indeed, securitization of AI has **progressively become a global
movement**. In the United States and Europe, for example, the AI
advancements of geopolitical competitors, especially Russia and China,
are often perceived as a potential threat to national and international
security. The relevant speech act frames AI not as a normal technology,
but as a national security matter that justifies the enablement of
extraordinary actions from the state and society. In effect, it
signifies the urgent need to deploy more resources and support, for
example, in the US case, not only to the American AI-enabled military
sector, but also the AI commercial industry.]{.underline}

States "most serious strategic competitor"24 or "closest
competitor."]{.underline}25 It thus "Securitization and Chinese Climate

Michigan user on 26 June 2022 becomes an inevitable topic and useful
reference point for American AI strategy. As a US Congress report on AI
and National Security points out, "most analysts view China's unified,
whole-of-government effort to develop AI as having a distinct advantage
over the United States' AI efforts."26 Thus, many are calling for a
similar "national-concerted" and "whole-of-government" approach towards
AI in the United States. Here, China's ambitious AI plans are often
labeled as a serious threat to the United States. To Webb, for example,
"Beijing's AI push is part of a coordinated attempt by President Xi
Jinping to turn China into the world's unchallenged AI hegemon,"27
"while market forces and consumerism are the primary drivers in
America."28 Thus, according to Webb,29 "the United States--- working
with its democratic partners---urgently needs to play catch-up and
develop the strong, solid muscles it will need to win the AI race."
These analyses implicitly and explicitly frame China's AI strategy as
coherent, top-down, and geopolitically driven, which inevitably neglects
the nuanced development of China's domestic AI politics and thus
exaggerates the geopolitical threat of China's AI advancement and plans,
as the article will discuss later. [Nonetheless, regardless of whether
those analyses reflect the reality, they have contributed to the
anxieties of China's near competitors.]{.underline}

[For American tech giants, an exaggerated China threat is also helpful
in fending off criticism of their monopoly by appealing to American
national interests. Thus, market actors in the United States have taken
advantage of this China threat to further their cause. For example,
under pressure to break up Facebook, China is referenced in order to
justify Facebook's monopoly. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg once warned
that Chinese tech companies would dominate if Facebook were
dismantled.]{.underline} According to Zuckerberg:

if the (US) government here is worried about --- whether it's election
interference or terrorism --- I don't think Chinese companies are going
to want to cooperate as much and aid the national interest there.30

Historical Context: AI Supremacy for National Survival?

As earlier mentioned, the [State Council considers national security and
economic growth as the two comprehensive goals of China's ambitious AI
plan]{.underline}. Given that economic growth represents China's most
important source of political legitimacy,43 its AI plan to pursue a
booming AI economy is quite understandable.

However, why is national security listed as an equally important goal?
And why does security occupy such a dominant place in China's overall
strategic thinking on AI? This should be understood in the wider
historical context of China's pursuit of cutting-edge technology.
[Although China's AI plans caught public attention on the global stage
during the period 2016/2017, they have long historical roots and their
development is clearly path-dependent.]{.underline} All such plans were
broadly consistent with China's 13th Five-Year Plan and the state-driven
"Made in China 2025" industrial plan issued in 2015. For example, the AI
concept appeared in the State Council's 13th FiveYear Plan in March
2016, along with 5 G, big data, and cloud computing, also considered
national priorities.44 [The advancement of AI, therefore, is part of the
tech package to develop China as a leading technological
power.]{.underline}

[Chinese discourse on its modern history substantially shapes **China's
ambitious AI strategy,** and more broadly its technological aspirations.
China is in a constant state of high anxiety about lagging behind again
in the game of global technology competition.]{.underline} This
obsession with technology is relevant to the Chinese discourse on the
relationship between China and previous industrial revolutions.45
Discussing AI is common practice in the discourses on industrial
revolutions in many international analyses, but the Chinese angle in
this regard is crucial to understanding China's technological
aspirations.

http://bjrb.bjd.com.cn/html/2019-08/19/content\_ 12138618.htm. This
industrial revolution discourse is also evident in official policy
documents. As the Chinese State Council's 2017 "New Generation AI
Development Plan" points out, "AI has become the core driving force for
a new round of industrial transformation, \[which\] will advance the
release of the huge energy stored from the previous scientific and
technological revolution and industrial transformation." Webster et al.,
"Full Translation: China's 'New Generation Artificial Intelligence
Development Plan' (2017)."

In the Chinese official discourse, China, as the Middle Kingdom, was the
leading superpower until the 19th century, when it suffered its first
defeat by a Western power---Britain. To many in China, it was the first
industrial revolution---constituted by the invention of the steam
engine---that took place in Britain in the 18th century that made
Britain a leading power46 with enough military might to defeat the Qing
Dynasty, then ruler of Asia, if not the world.47 Some argue that it was
the Qing Dynasty's failure to keep pace with the current technological
innovation that impelled China's decline into the so-called "century of
humiliation."48

This defeat exacerbated China's unfavorable position during the second
industrial revolution49 of the early twentieth century of being in
transition from the last feudal dynasty (i.e. the Qing Dynasty) to a
republic (i.e. the Republic of China). Political and social turmoil
robbed the country of the opportunity to develop and progress.50 When it
came to the third industrial revolution, or digital revolution, in the
latter half of the twentieth century, the nascent People's Republic of
China was embroiled in domestic disorder and international tumult.
Consequently, China missed its chance again---although some argue that
it caught up somewhat in the second half of that epoch.51 As leading
Chinese public intellectual and policy advisor Jin Canrong observes:

Obviously, those three industrial revolutions have one common
feature---all occurred in the West and consequently enabled the West to
stay ahead of productivity. On [the contrary, China failed to grasp any
of those three industrial revolutions and its productivity thus lagged
behind. As a result, despite years of efforts, China remains a
developing country.52]{.underline}

[The relevant historical discourses on technological revolutions are
explicitly raised in Chinese official documents and top leaders'
remarks. As Xi Jinping observed during a national conference on science
and technology,]{.underline}

[historical experience shows that scientific and technological
revolutions can always profoundly change the world's development
landscapes\... some countries have seized the rare opportunity of
scientific and technological revolutions to achieve a rapid growth in
economic strength, scientific and technological strength, and national
defence strength, and a rapid increase in overall national strength\...
during over 5,000 years of civilization development, the Chinese nation
has achieved world-renowned scientific and technological
achievements\... (]{.underline}however), since modern times, due to
various reasons at home and abroad, our country has repeatedly missed
the opportunity of

scientific and technological revolutions and fallen from a world power
to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country that was bullied by others.
Our nation has experienced more than a century of aggression by foreign
powers, endless wars, social turmoil, and people's displacement.53

To many in China, including Xi Jinping, the rise of new technologies,
including AI, Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data, new energy,
and 3 D, marked the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution.54
Unlike previous industrial revolutions, when China's economic resources
were insufficient and the country lacked a favorable socio-political
environment, China is now keen not only jump into but also lead this
fourth revolution.55 As Jin Canrong elaborates:

the fourth industrial revolution is China's biggest historical
opportunity. Logically, if China grasps this opportunity, in the future
it will be site of humanity's best technology and industry. So, we must
grasp this opportunity.56

In short, the lesson China has learned from its modern history is that
it must master the leading technology as a matter of national survival,
and that this wave of technological development is the "train" that
China cannot afford to miss.57 Although whether or not those discourses
are an accurate reflection of history is debatable, they nevertheless
wield considerable influence on the Chinese quest for technological
leadership.

[Of course, behind these historical discourses and Chinese technological
aspirations is China's quest for national rejuvenation---the **desire
for China to take advantage of this wave of technological revolution led
by digital technology,** including AI, to **resume its "rightful"
place**, i.e., superpower status prior to being defeated by Britain in
the nineteenth century.]{.underline} In this regard, the country's
technological ambitions will inevitably clash with American supremacy
and take China into the arena of great power politics, which the next
section will explore.

Geopolitical Context: Competing for AI Supremacy?

In view of the above historical context, China feels compelled to master
key technology. But reliance on foreign technology is considered a
"security risk."58

Recent conflicts with the Trump administration have heightened Chinese
risk awareness. Many in the United States consider China's technological
aspirations, such as the aforementioned "Made in China 2025" package
that includes AI, as a security threat. This has led to considerable
tension between the two countries. By cutting off China's tech
companies, namely Huawei and ZTE, from global semiconductor suppliers59
the Trump administration plunged the telecom giants into an existential
crisis. United States sanctions also targeted Chinese AI startups, and
restricted the export of American AI software to China in hopes of
slowing down their development.60 Meanwhile, the United States has made
unilateral efforts to pressure its European partners into stemming the
flow of advanced technology to China. One example is the Trump
administration's lobby campaign, on the grounds of security interests,
to block the sale of Dutch-manufactured computer chip-making machines to
China.61

[The serious damage American sanctions have inflicted on Chinese tech
companies has heightened China's awareness of both its technological
weakness and feelings of insecurity in regard to global reliance.
Understandably, therefore, China wants to master leading AI technology
independently]{.underline}. As Xi Jinping elaborates:

accelerating the development of a new generation of AI is an important
strategic handhold for China to gain the initiative in global science
and technology competition\...We need to ensure that the core AI
technologies are firmly in our own hands.62

China's AI aspirations extend to global leadership. [Since China's rise,
the US-led global order has left China dissatisfied due to the limits it
places on China's say in global norms and rules.63 **Rather than a
norm-taker, China now aspires to be a norm-shaper, or even a
norm-maker**. Many Chinese scholars argue that current established norms
are geared primarily to serving interests other than those of China.64
To maximize Chinese interests, therefore, future norms should be defined
by/for China, and on Chinese terms.]{.underline}

A Successful or Failed Securitization?

If the central government is indeed making a securitizing move, has it
achieved success? [**Securitization is still ongoing in China.** The
trend of labeling AI as a security matter will become, or perhaps more
accurately, is becoming more obvious, in light of growing United
States--China tensions over technological competition and also in the
wider geopolitical fields.]{.underline} At this stage it is difficult,
if not impossible, to measure the impact of the securitizing move
quantitatively because the causal relations are difficult to establish.
There is no doubt that local states have got onboard with the central
government's AI plan, and are enthusiastically supporting its AI
campaign. Many local AI policies were released immediately after the
central state's AI plan in 2016/2017, a fact that existing AI analyses
often cite as evidence in support of their claims regarding China's
national-concerted approach towards AI. However, local governments are
primarily driven by the estimated regional gains of a booming AI
economy. As previously mentioned, many such provinces made their
regional AI plans years before that of the central state was issued.
Therefore, it is unclear to what extent they are motivated by the
securitization move per se rather than the economic benefits that the AI
industry generates.

[The economic interests AI offers play a more obvious role in driving
market forces. **AI hype is a global phenomenon,** and China is no
exception.]{.underline} The Chinese central state's ambitious AI plan
has expanded the hype to the extent of engendering concerns about an AI
bubble.121 China's market actors, moreover, have been manipulating the
fuzzy definition of AI to redefine AI products, technologies, and
companies in order to win, or even connive state funding.122 In this
regard, although market forces support the central government's AI
agenda, they are motivated largely by potential business interests.

Similarly, it is difficult to quantify the impact of securitization on
public opinion. The absence of social resistance to state use of AI has
put China in an advantageous position to grow its AI algorithms.
However, this is mostly due to China's domestic political system and the
state capacity to shape public opinion and national debates. The State
Council's AI plan explicitly declares that "guiding public opinion" is
part of its AI strategy. Under the call to promote more AI propaganda,
positive reporting about AI, such as its contribution to enhancing
public security---including anti-child trafficking123 and crime
prevention124---has been prominent in the Chinese media. In this regard,
the outcome of public cooperation is shaped not only by securitization
but also, and more importantly, by China's political environment. It
remains to be seen how the public will respond when the pain of social
transformation, such as massive unemployment, that AI brings about
becomes more obvious.

Concluding Remarks: Securitization, So What?

[This article shows that the Chinese central government is performing a
securitizing move by labeling AI as a security matter in order to
convince local states, market actors, intellectuals, and the general
public. But if AI is indeed being securitized, so what? Although it is
difficult to quantify the exact impact of this securitizing move, it
undoubtedly helps the Chinese central government's mobilization of
domestic actors towards advancing its AI agenda.]{.underline}
Nevertheless, this move also generates unintended consequences for the
securitizing actor's goal in the long run. According to the State
Council's AI plans, its three-step AI plan carries the specific goals of
fostering a booming AI economy, and a grand goal of becoming a global AI
leader.125 Securitization may undermine these key objectives for several
reasons.

Conclusion

In this contribution, we demonstrated that [Swiss cyber-security
politics can be fruitfully approached with constructivist research, more
specifically, one that draws on practice approaches.]{.underline} Of the
three securitization logics as described by Hansen and Nissenbaum, all
three are present in the Swiss case, with technification being the
dominant one at present. For democratic politics, technification is a
particular challenge. Assigning an issue to the technical realm has a
depoliticizing influence, which removes it from democratic
deliberations. [By making cyber-security an issue of the 'genius few',
technification makes contestation from those with less technical
expertise very hard if not impossible or makes it easy for those with
the most valued expertise to discredit others without it.]{.underline}
In addition, 6 See e.g. [the power of technical expertise comes with a
claim of being 'neutral' or 'a-political', and hence, of being more
valid than anything that seems emotional or based on
morals.]{.underline}

The Swiss case also highlights interesting aspects for securitization
research and beyond. In theory, securitization assumes that there is one
powerful actor who can make a convincing case for the exceptional nature
of a policy issue. The entire Swiss political system works against this.
[There are always multiple voices and multiple audiences to convince --
which makes it much harder to be successful in a simple securitization
move based on urgency. In such a political system, less 'visible'
bureaucratic actors need to be studied more thoroughly.]{.underline}
Security is not mainly the domain of security elites and politicians.
Instead, the research focus needs to shift to everyday security
practices, to less traditional security actors, and to actors outside
government that have a central role in the creation of danger knowledge
and everyday security.

[Beyond securitization research, it is evident that looking closely at
the **intricacies of political systems**, power distribution and
political culture,]{.underline} as studied by scholars in comparative
politics and similar fields, becomes necessary to understand security
logics in any policy field. [Bringing the **two research traditions more
closely together** in some form of conversation across sub-disciplinary
boundaries could be beneficial for both.]{.underline}

5.4 THE LIMITATIONS OF DESECURITISATION

[One of the main reasons that cyberspace is difficult to desecuritise is
that securitisation is now **well established, constantly re-enforced,**
and the audiences which accept these securitisations have become
entrenched in their views]{.underline}. As the preceding chapters have
demonstrated, securitisation has been achieved through hyper
securitising rhetoric that portrays surveillance and national security
threats as existentially threatening, and this rhetoric is strengthened
with linkages to fears of authoritarianism, totalitarianism, anarchy and
terrorism.

202 [Audience acceptance of threats is also influenced by political
ideology, with those fearful of the state placing much greater trust in
the securitisations of whistleblowers25 such as Edward Snowden and those
more fearful of external threats, such as terrorism, placing far greater
trust in the securitisations of the state]{.underline}. In addition,
[cyberspace securitisations are constantly re-enforced by daily events,
with instances of terrorism or cyber breaches re-enforcing the national
security threat, and daily reports on the state's surveillance powers
re-enforcing the state surveillance threat.]{.underline}

[It is also far easier to securitise an issue than it is to desecuritise
it. Once an audience has accepted the existence of an existential
threat, it is **difficult to convince them that this threat does not
exist,** or is far less dangerous than first thought]{.underline}. This
is most evident in reactions to terrorism and the war on terror,
although can be applied equally to cyberspace. In 2010, 25% of the
British population believed that the threat of terrorism had grown in
the past five years compared to 17% who believed it had shrunk. By 2016,
the percentage of people believing that the threat had grown was 74%
compared to only 1% who believed it had shrunk (YouGov, 2016) (see
Figure 5.3). Supporters of all political parties believed that the
terror threat had increased, but this belief was stronger on the right
of British politics (Conservative -84%, UKIP -- 83%, Labour -- 71%,
LibDem -- 74%). In the US, when 25 For his supporters, Snowden is a
whistle-blower, but for his detractors he is a criminal who has
illegally disclosed millions of classified documents. Figure 5.2:
American views on terrorist threat 203 asked how they would rate the
chances of themselves or a member of their family or a good friend being
killed or wounded in a terrorist attack, 12% of people responded with
'Very high' or 'Fairly High'. This belief appears at odds with the fact
that the US had not suffered a mass casualty terrorist attack since
2001.

There have been several attempts to explain the discrepancy between the
fear of terrorism and the actual risk of being affected by it (Nellis,
2009; Altheide, 2016; Braithwaite, 2013). These demonstrate how the
visceral images of terrorist attacks such as 9/11, the constant
re-enforcing of the threat, hatred of 'the other' and the uncertain
nature of the threat, combine to create an emotional response to
terrorism. Studies have also demonstrated that it is not necessary to
have been present at a terrorist attack or to have been directly
affected by one, to experience significant symptoms of anxiety and
stress in otherwise healthy citizens (Collins, et al., 2001).

This emotional response to the threat of terrorism renders logical
arguments against it less effective and psychological studies have
repeatedly demonstrated that logical arguments are rarely effective
against existing views. An experiment in Stanford, for example,
demonstrated that when students were provided with fictitious
information, they still based their opinions on this information even
when it was revealed that the data was false (Ross & Mark Lepper, 1975).
A related study at Stanford a few years later revealed that not just
opinions, but people's beliefs and values, which had been formed based
upon false information, were not changed even when the information that
lead them to form these beliefs was shown to be false (Anderson, et al.,
1980). According to another study 'corrections actually increase
misperceptions among the group in question' (Nyhan & Reifler, 2010, p.
303). The authors call this the backfire effect and suggested that if
people Figure 5.3: British view on terrorist threat 204 counter-argue
unwelcome information they may end up entrenching views that are more
extreme than those originally held.

[**Fear and anxiety play a significant role in risk perception**.. And
for those in fear, encountering those who deny the existence of the
threat can lead to greater anxiety since the burden of facing that
threat is considered greater when others do not accept its
existence.]{.underline} Common advice to help people reassure those with
anxieties is that fears should not be invalidated, but should be
accepted as real to those who hold them. When confirmation bias (which
explains how people selectively interpret new information to support
their existing beliefs) is also considered, it becomes clear that
challenging attitudes to cyberspace threats is not as simple as
presenting the case for the other side. Once an issue has become
securitised, it is extremely difficult to convince the audience that
their acceptance of the threat is wrong. This difficulty was
demonstrated following the enactment of the IPA. Some at GCHQ thought
that the act would 'defeat claims of mass surveillance' but this notion
was dispelled after its passing when the ORG described it as 'one of the
most extreme surveillance laws ever passed in a democracy' (David, 2016)
(Killock, 2016).

[Hegemony theory can go some way in this respect as it is able to
consider in more detail the dynamics and structures that lead to power
within discourse]{.underline}. [The power to securitize then lies within
rules of the social]{.underline} -- all of which are, essentially,
discursively constituted. It is the structure of discourses that
determines which [subject-positions may carry legitimacy as well as
which institutionalised positions carry weight and meaning under which
circumstances]{.underline}. The power to [securitise then essentially
lies on the level of differences within discourse, while the power of
securitization is the constitution of an antagonist divide]{.underline}.
Both levels, of course, cannot be analysed independently of each other.
Hegemony theory offers a perspective to combine the analysis of these
two levels. It allows us to move beyond the speaker-audience dichotomy,
and offers a view on the processual formation of identities through the
drawing of antagonist lines. [Its explanatory power hence extends to
both the question of the boundaries of the discursive formation and
simultaneously allows to account for change in this formation. The
hegemony approach articulates an understanding of politics as the
conflictual negotiation of that which represents the common space. 64 In
this understanding, securitization is not the end of normal politics but
part of it.]{.underline}

There is one important point, however that should be underlined here.
The emphasis on the cognitive element as a common ground or a point of
connection between [hegemony as the structure and securitization as the
medium, should not mean that the states' behaviors are determined by
structure of ideas as they are by material structure of the neorealist
hegemony that is by coercive force]{.underline} (McSweeney, 1999:
132-33). The internalization of ideas, values, and the security truths
by the actors is not a mechanistic process of acceptance. The actors
[participate into the construction and consolidation of security truths
through their security practices, acts and decisions in the
international field]{.underline}. In other words, the subordinated units
under hegemony are not only consumers but also producers of
securitization. In this study, the enrichment of the i[dea of
securitization as a medium in the mutual constitution of hegemonic
structure and agents]{.underline} is based particularly on Bill
McSweeney's study on security and identity which is developed on the
basis of Giddens's Structuration Theory[. The Structuration Theory can
be utilized also to analyze the social relations and the constitution of
identities at the international level. According to the theory any
social order, including the international order cannot be considered as
an independent phenomenon, external to acting units within
it]{.underline}. The structure and the agent are ontologically
interdependent (McSweeney: 138-145). In such a framework, security
identity at the state level cannot be viewed as a [dependent variable
with respect to hegemonic security structure and accordingly,
securitization is not a one way process]{.underline}. Here, as McSweeney
proposed, the concept of [political spillover can be utilized to explain
the harmonization of security interests produced intersubjectively in
the international field]{.underline} (McSweeney, 1999: 170-171)
Concerning the subject of this study, that is to [establish a connection
between securitization and functioning of hegemony, again an
understanding of spillover can be used]{.underline}. As in the
integration to a security community, the adherence to a hegemonic order
also necessitates the shifting of loyalties, [expectations and political
activities toward a new security truth and the secondary states learn to
identify their interests with the hegemon]{.underline}. Here, structure
is used by actors to produce meanings of domestic conduct and in that
moment, it is drawn into the temporal, contextual dimension of action,
thus to be reinforced and modified by usage and repetition. In a sense,
actors subject themselves to the constraints of behaving within the
confines of habit. Actors learn and [relearn their security interest in
interaction with the sub-state level actors, with other states but
mainly with and with the hegemon. Such a perspective towards
securitization will provide us a richer conception of security and the
functioning of hegemony]{.underline}. Giddens's Structuration Theory
puts forward that far from being passive receptors and reproducers of an
assumed consensus about meaning and norms, actors draw s[trategically
upon such consensus to establish an agreement or to repair a
relationship, in short they manage the rules that make the game
interaction possibl]{.underline}e. In the same way, under hegemony, the
patterns of meaning about what is to be secured or the shared knowledge
of what is the threat are reproduced through typified behaviors of state
actors that simultaneously sustaining it.

### 2AC\-\--AT: Failed States

#### No link\-\--failed states discourse doesn't cause Western interventions or violence

Sebastiaan **Debrouwere 11**, "Are Failing and Failed States a Post-Cold
War Phenomenon", E-International Relations, -07/16/2011,
<https://www.e-ir.info/2011/07/16/are-failing-and-failed-states-a-post-cold-war-phenomenon/>
[\\\\pairie](file:///\\pairie)

As early as 1651, political theorists, such as Hobbes, warned that in
societies where government fails and no laws exist, there would be "a
coercive Power to tye \[sic\] their hands from rapine, and revenge" that
would doom their citizens to "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"
lives marked by "continual fear, and danger of violent death" (Hobbes,
2003 \[1651\], p. 89). Is the phenomenon of the failed state, in vogue
with security analysts and political scientists alike since the
aftermath of the Iraqi invasion, an expression of the Risorgimento of
Hobbesian fears? Or, are failed states, to which academic literature
includes examples as varied as Afghanistan, DR Congo, Myanmar, and
Somalia (François & Sud, 2006), really a unique new challenge for the
post-bipolar era? Since the end of the Cold War, debates over
international order and threats to security have changed in nature, and
so has their lexicon. Where hazards were once identified as coming from
"tyrannical rogue states", post-1989 challenges are seen as originating
in various "arcs of instability" composed of "weak or collapsing states"
(Ignatie , 2002, p. 114; Ayson, 2007). [The 21st Century's benighted
states are "un-governed, under-governed or mis-governed" (Lamb, p. 15)
dysfunctional societies, where global threats such as terrorist breeding
grounds and transnational crime are present. The real question is,
however, to what extent is the concept of failed and failing states, and
their underlying assumptions and implications, the product of the
politics of language and "a political agenda of security-concerned
Western powers"]{.underline} (Buzan, Waever, & de Wilde, 1998, p. 32).
By first defining the concept of failed states, then scrutinizing its
political implications and the extent to which the idea is politicized,
and finally considering its relevance in the contemporary world, this
essay will argue that the discrepancy between these ideas and their
meaning for the multipolar world is minimal, and they do not merely
represent a taxonomical-linguistic issue. Instead, this terminology is
seen as a logical and valid product of a changed world, a world where
the Westphalian model of international politics, such as the
interactions between equally sovereign states, presents an unrealistic
conception of insecurity.

Defining Failed States

The 'basic unit' of evaluation concerning state failure is how the state
is defined and understood, as this determines how failure is defined.
Broadly speaking, the modern paradigm is marked by two conceptions of
the state, one 'thin' and one 'thick'. The notion of the 'thin', or
neo-Machiavellian, state focuses on the coercive-regulative aspects of
government, as defined by Weber. Definitions stemming from the Weberian
school focus on the state's success in terms of its consolidation of the
monopoly of violence. Subsequently, the use of force is seen as the
basic element of a functioning state, for which all other conditions
such as respect for human rights, and the delivery of social services
will depend (Ignatie, 2002, p. 112). Thus, a state is successful insofar
as it "upholds a claim on the "monopoly" of the "legitimate" use of
violence in the enforcement of its order" (Weber, 1980 \[1921\], p. 30).
In this understanding, territories where power is primarily wielded
illegitimately by warlords or kleptocrats are seen as failed states. The
'thick' conception is contractarian in nature and based on the
Hobbesian-Lockean understanding of the state as a "neutral umpire" that
protects lives, liberty, and the property of those within its territory
(Locke, 1988 \[1689\], p. 212). Proponents of this conception see the
monopoly of violence as an important aspect of state legitimacy, but
argue that additional factors, such as an essential respect for human
rights need to be included. For them, state failure has nothing to do
with "an anomalous response to some sort of irregular or periodic
stress" (Eisenstadt, Abitbol & Chazan, 1988, p. 236) and the associated
interruption of legitimacy, but has much more to do with the state's
collapse in basic function. The absolute threshold of collapse is
defined, then, through a threefold proviso: the loss of sovereignty, the
end of the state as "a tangible organization of decision-making"
(Dawisha & Zartman, 1988, p. 7), and the collapse of the state as the
"security guarantor" for its citizens, and the citizens of other nations
(Zartman, 1995, p. 5).

Politicized Language?

Defining states in thick or thin terms has vast implications on how the
threat is perceived, and thus, how it should be dealt with. Labeling
states as having 'failed' is considered to be highly controversial
because it makes them a candidate for internal intervention and
preventive military invasions. Indeed, the idea that a state can be
successful or unsuccessful in adhering to a particular set of principles
is vaguely reminiscent of the colonial preoccupations in the 20th
century, when state failure was a pretext for great power interventions.
Belgian colonials, for example, justified their colonization of the
resource-rich Congo by claiming that "the indigenous peoples had failed
at self-governing themselves and establishing \[Christian\]
civilization" and that its intervention was merely a humanitarian matter
of "alleviating these throes" (Clark, 1964, p. 136). Quite similarly,
colonial powers have often intervened in the Pacific to quell social
disorder, "simply because it threatened their security and trade
interests" (Dor, 2000). In 1893, British intervention in the Solomon
Islands served "to curtail what we would now call transnational crime,
especially blackbirding", and more importantly, to "ensure that no other
imperial power established a presence there" (Wainwright, 2003, p. 19).
Though, it can be argued that the Solomon Islands, and their "collapsed,
institutions", "paralyzed government", "simmering ethnic tensions", and
"social malaise" (Nguyen, 2005, p. 2) came close to what could now be
considered a failing state, it is beyond doubt that the British Empire's
intervention "was concerned with more than just some local outlaws à la
Harold Keke that terrorized the region" (Wainwright, 2003, p. 487). It
should be no surprise that those with a skeptical view on the
contemporary failed state debate consider its rhetoric to be the
reflection of an ethnocentric political agenda, with the wider purpose
of reforming developing countries, so as to adhere to the worldview of
hegemonic states (Boos & Jennings, 2005, p. 394) or even to "demonize
the other as a pretext for intervention" (Adibe, 1994, p. 492). Some go
even further in asserting that "the idea of failed states...and Western
anxieties over 'new security threats since 9/11...are political
constructions" and "an example of threat inflation" (Thrall & Cramer,
2009, p. 10). [This **reductionist approach** to the failed states
debate sees the concept itself as analytically void,]{.underline} and at
most, a vehicle to legitimize its policy implications for
interventionist hegemons.

[Such a stance, however, displays an essentially flawed understanding.
First, by assuming that malevolent threat-exaggeration and militarized
response dominate the majority of the debate, it gravely misinterprets
the goals and purposes of securitization (Münkler, 2004, p. 61). For
states in a capitalist, multipolar, and post-imperial world, security is
not so much about military presence as it is about regional stability
and trade facilitation. Violent conflict in "declining states"
(Vayrynen, 2000, p. 43), even on the local level, most likely is not the
optimal situation for any actors.]{.underline} Second, they ultimately
seem to value the importance of sovereignty over the well being of
citizens, while realities suggest a different prioritization. Robert
Jackson's thesis on the 'sovereignty game' shows the danger of
considering sovereignty as the main variable, by pointing out that the
populations of some states which "lack the ability to meaningfully
function or provide public services, including order" can live under
'negative sovereignty' whereby the de jure sovereignty provides "legal
freedom from outside interference", even in cases of gross human rights
abuses (Jackson, 1990, p. 1; p. 30; p. 74). He notes that since the
1960s, new and weak "quasi states have been incorporated into the
international community" based on norms of anti-colonialism,
self-determination, and egalitarianism, despite being "juridical more
than empirical entities" (p.5). The resulting 'negative sovereignty
game' allows these states to enjoy an "unqualified right to exist and
high prospects for survival despite their domestic disorganization and
illegitimacy" (p.24) only because of this "uncritical and widespread
faith in self-determination or equal sovereignty" (p.10).

Ultimately, the primary concern that arises from this, for both the
well-being of citizens and the international community, is that these
societies are identified as being dysfunctional, so that adequate
remedies can be proposed. [Though **intervention** is amongst these
remedies, it **is most likely a last resort**, rather than a preferred
option]{.underline}. Examples of multilateral international policy in
recent years, such as the Security Council's affirmation of the
Responsibility-to-Protect principle1 and its recent recall of that
principle in the debates over a Libyan no-fly zone2, indicate that state
failure is increasingly accepted and is not a priori seen as a merely
political construction by intervention-savvy states. [There also appears
to be a consensus that **failing states present significant threats** to
the international community and must, at least, be closely
monitored]{.underline}, as illustrated by Robert Cooper's poignant
assertion that "the Roman Empire, was not brought to fall by the well
-organized Persian Empire... but \[by\] the Barbarians"(Cooper, 2004, p.
68).

### 2AC\-\--AT: Space

#### Space threats are [real]{.underline} and should be considered [security threats]{.underline} based on the many [existential]{.underline} possibilities \-\-- satellites solve ag, fisheries, and environmental damage \-\-- military protection is key 

Michael** Sheehan 15**, Professor of International Relations at Swansea
University who worked for the U.S. State Department, 2015, "Defining
State Security", *Handbook of Space Security: Policies, Applications,
and Programs*, p. 7-21 /lg

Security has been defined as "the assurance people have that they will
continue to enjoy those things that are most important to their survival
and well-being"
(Soroos [1997](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-2029-3_47#CR13),
p. 236). [[For something to be defined as a "security" issue, there
needs to be a sense in which it poses a **real threat to human**]{.mark}
well-being or [survival. If a "security" issue requires that there
is]{.mark} such [an "existential" threat, can]{.mark} the [environmental
issues]{.mark} [in Earth orbit be]{.mark} seen as [security
issues?]{.mark} Is interference with the optimum efficiency of a
frequency, or damage to an inanimate piece of metal, an "existential
threat" in any meaningful sense?]{.underline}

In fact [[such issues]{.mark} can be [seen as security questions]{.mark}
and [in a very real way. Satellites]{.mark} are used for an enormous
range of purposes, and many of them [have]{.mark} the [potential to
produce large-scale loss of life if]{.mark} the [satellite capability is
lost]{.mark}.]{.underline} A 2011 report by the British Royal Academy of
Engineering noted that [[global navigation systems]{.mark} alone [are
crucial for]{.mark} the following functions for UK users: "transport,
[agriculture, fisheries, law enforcement]{.mark}, highways management,
services for vulnerable people, [energy production]{.mark} and
management, surveying, dredging, [health services]{.mark}, financial
services, information services, cartography, safety monitoring,
[scientific and environmental studies,]{.mark} search and rescue,
telecommunications, tracking vehicles and valuable or hazardous cargoes
and quantum cryptography"]{.underline} (Royal Academy of
Engineering [2011](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-2029-3_47#CR11),
p. 13).

[[Threats to]{.mark} orbiting [satellites]{.mark}, whether from military
or environmental sources, [are crucially important]{.mark} precisely
[because satellites]{.mark} have come [to]{.mark} play such a
**[fundamental part in providing]{.mark} [security]{.mark}** to human
beings on Earth.]{.underline} Because of the expansion in the general
meaning of security that has taken place in recent decades, satellites
are clearly relevant to providing these kinds of security. Although
discussions of space security have historically tended to be dominated
by debates about "space weaponization," the reality is that most states
and commercial entities exploit space for a vast range of civil
purposes, so that [[space]{.mark} has now become [crucial for human
prosperity]{.mark} and security on Earth]{.underline}.

The impact of satellite capabilities on human security can be seen in a
wide range of areas. One such is disaster management, which has been
reflected in the signing of the "Tampere Convention on the Provision of
Telecommunication Resources for Disaster Mitigation and Relief
Operations" of 1998 and the "Charter on Cooperation to Achieve the
Coordinated Use of Space Facilities in the Event of Natural or
Technological Disasters" of 2000. Satellites were used to coordinate
disaster relief operations after the Haiti earthquake of 2010 and the
Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011.

But the scope of satellite contributions to terrestrial security goes
well beyond disaster response and now embraces almost all aspects of
human security. Examples include educational programs, including school
and college use, but also programs for education of remote rural
populations on issues such as crop management and birth control.
[Meteorology is used by most countries, but in those subject to
particularly severe weather such as tropical storms, they serve a
crucial purpose in allowing shipping and coastal communities to prepare
for the effects of life-threatening weather systems. [Satellites play an
increasingly important role in]{.mark} the continuation of the [green
revolution]{.mark} in developing countries, [allowing **monitoring of
environmental damage**, from]{.mark} both [natural and human
causes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Soil temperature and moisture content of
soils are monitored from space to allow the choice of optimal planting
times; crops are also monitored for the presence of disease infestation
and threats such as drought, floods, and migrating pests such as locust
swarms. Monitoring of snow lines in areas such as the Himalayas allows
early warning of flooding in India and Bangladesh.
[S[atellites]{.underline}]{.mark} [are used to [detect underground water
supplies and mineral resources]{.mark}, to track shoals of fish, and [to
plan irrigation systems]{.mark}.]{.underline} India uses satellites to
assess the quality of land being considered for building or road
development, so that areas of high agricultural productivity will not be
lost, and uses them to direct its fishing fleets to minimize their time
at sea. In January 2012, satellite imagery was used by the United
Nations to monitor the conduct of the referendum in southern Sudan on
separation and independence from Sudan. On a broader scale[[, satellite
imagery]{.mark} was [crucial in detecting]{.mark} the expansion of the
holes in the [ozone layer and]{.mark} in [monitoring]{.mark} the
increase in global temperatures and associated effects such as loss of
[polar ice cover]{.mark}, which confirmed the dangers of global warming.
In these and countless other ways, [satellites]{.mark} now **[directly
contribute to human security.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

This is important in defining space security in two ways. It means that
the [**[military dimension of space security is]{.mark} [critical
]{.mark}**[not just in terms of]{.mark} the [impact such conflict might
have on terrestrial warfare, or]{.mark} even of the [damage to]{.mark}
the [space environment]{.mark} itself, [but also]{.mark} that the huge
knock-on [effect on human security]{.mark} must be considered if these
satellite capabilities were lost.]{.underline} Secondly, it means that
the terrestrial dimension of human security needs to be considered as
one of the components of space security in its own right, thereby
highlighting the enormous stake that humanity has in the continued
secure exploitation of space.

### 2AC\-\--Russian Cybersecurity Threat

#### Russia cybersecurity threat is real\-\--we're the only team that's read statistics\-\--if we prove it is, it proves we're not securitization

Four months into its war on Ukraine, [Russia is carrying out cyber
operations on much more than its neighbor]{.underline}, according to a
report released by Microsoft Thursday.

In the report, Microsoft said it detected Russian network intrusion
efforts in 128 organizations in 42 countries outside Ukraine, with the
majority of its "strategic espionage" focused on governments, think
tanks, aid groups and businesses. Russia has most often targeted the
U.S. and other NATO countries, including Poland, where military
logistics and humanitarian assistance is being coordinated.

["Since the start of the war, the Russian targeting we've identified has
been successful 29 percent of the time,"]{.underline} the Microsoft
report said. "A quarter of these successful intrusions has led to
confirmed exfiltration of an organization's data, although as explained
in the report, this likely understates the degree of Russian success."

Brad Smith, president and vice chairman of Microsoft, said in a Thursday
conversation with the Washington Post's David Ignatius that Russia's
successful attacks "tend to be in certain kinds of" on premise networks.
Smith said cloud networks, secured by companies "whose core
competencies" are in IT security, are safer than on premise networks.
Smith said globally, private sector companies have moved to the cloud
more quickly than government, a phenomenon especially true in Europe,
putting them at increased risk.

Smith also emphasized the importance disinformation is playing in
Russia's war effort, highlighting an 80% increase in Russian propaganda
in the month after Russia launched its attack.

["We need to address this new cyber threat as well," Smith said, adding,
"it is directed at the core of our democracy."]{.underline}

#### Representations of Russia-NATO war are real -- necessary to avoid war

Our empirical analysis in 3.1-3.4 shows that [Russian official discourse
in the years following the conflict in Ukraine construes NATO as
"genetically" set on grabbing ever more geopolitical space while
claiming to seek security for all states.]{.underline} Russia generally
represents NATO as a two-faced actor, hiding its true agenda of
incessant expansion behind the ["invented" "thesis" of Russian threat
and distractions like "instrumentalized" universal values]{.underline}.
This idea of a **[false West hiding the real reasons for its value
agenda has deep roots in Russian thinking.]{.underline}**184 Our
analysis shows that [this view fundamentally structures Russia's
interpretation of NATO, in turn illustrating how discursive change --
the making of hostility through intense securitization and
naturalization]{.underline} [-- takes place on the background of
continued, long-nurtured rhetorical tropes]{.underline}. Our analysis
has also shown how all spheres and actions are entangled, seen as part
of NATO's war-like campaign targeting Russia[. The Russian leadership
conflates Russia-critical statements and conventional military build-up
into a single package of hostility. We conclude that MOD and MFA
representations post-Crimea attach a near-total level of danger to NATO
and associated Western others]{.underline}. Here we wish to emphasize
the extreme density and repetitive nature of these representations in
our material. They confirm previous scholarly claims that the entrenched
worldview in the Kremlin is that the West with NATO is threatening to
destroy Russia.185 Our study has shown how such a [worldview is
constructed through official statements on a day-to-day basis, becoming
naturalized]{.underline}. [Further, the overall impression is that
Russia deems conspiracy as the signature tune of both NATO and the
USA]{.underline}. The "lesson learned" as per official speech
post-Crimea thus seems to be that Russia should never trust NATO
promises again -- anywhere. [From our analysis of texts on NATO in the
Arctic we find that the dramatically heightened level of securitization
of this Western antagonist is almost fully replicated in this polar
region]{.underline}. We cannot ignore the pattern of representation of
NATO as hostile by nature, with its every move in the Arctic as the next
step in a planned offensive against Russia. [This image is achieved
through use of predicates, juxtapositions of selves and
other]{.underline}s (Russia embodies cooperative Arctic in the face of
NATO threat), the recirculation of rhetorical tropes of enmity and
discursive merger of social entities that might have been framed as
distinct and "friendly[". By these mechanisms, relations with individual
Arctic NATO states are increasingly rephrased through the prism of NATO
hostility, with Norway as a prime example. Although our findings may
indicate the impossibility of compartmentalizing the Arctic away from
rising Russia--NATO enmity, our material also shows Russian resistance
to the securitization of relations in this region -- as when
interactions and institutions in the Arctic are recirculated as benign
encounters and arenas or when official language invokes dual
identifications of NATO countries, using historical tropes or predicates
of amity.]{.underline} Indeed, the discursive lumping together of
different Western political entities into one hostile agent is not
complete in the Arctic context. Entering these findings into the
framework and debate about the securitization dilemma, locating them as
part of a broader Russia--West interaction pattern, addresses several
questions. As to how misplaced certainty about the other party's intent
emerges, we suggest that Russia [creates certainty about NATO's
hostility through the way it repeatedly and with increasing fervour
speaks of this political entity. Moreover, with NATO's growing European
presence and concerns over the "Russian threat", Russian leaders
increasingly indicate that the West's previously hidden agenda is now
out in the open.]{.underline} This "uncovering" cements the view of
NATO's intent as undeniably hostile[. As to the question of distrust, so
often said to be the driver of security dilemma dynamics,
we]{.underline} hold that the power of spoken words is underrated.186
[Although assessing such emotional qualities is beyond the reach of our
methodology, we would highlight the contingent nature of trust -- thus
rejecting distrust between Russia and NATO as something given and
unchanging.]{.underline} The historical animosity between [Russia and
NATO does matter for the growing securitization dilemma in the Arctic
and elsewhere in Europe, because political speakers make it
matter]{.underline} -- for example, by repeatedly re-inserting Cold War
references into the debate and re-phrasing Cold War relations as sheer
hostility. [Also, trust can be rebuilt, by imagining and giving voice to
positive identifications of and cooperative experiences with the Western
Others.]{.underline} Here the Arctic has a clear potential, but that can
be realised only if political actors decide to act. As our study has
shown, the constant invoking of NATO activity as hostile in contrast to
Russia's alledgedly reactive and defensive posture serves as the core

Securitization and emergency governance in global health", Security
Dialogue, Vol. 45, No. 4, p. 331-348 /lg

Given the spectre of exceptionalism that comes with security, research
in the tradition of the Copenhagen School has focused mostly on averting
securitizations that facilitate emergency measures (see Roe, 2008;
Wæver, 2000: 253--254). [It has been [claim]{.mark}ed [that]{.mark} a
[securitizing]{.mark} move that shifts an issue from normal politics
into the realm of the exception [needs to be countered by]{.mark} an
[explicit desecuritizing]{.mark} move that shifts the issue back to the
normal [by discursively undermining]{.mark} the [threat
construction]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hansen, 2012: 542--545; Huysmans,
1995: 65--67; 1998; Roe, 2004: 285--287).8 [Such a
conception]{.underline} of securitization and desecuritization presents
several ways back to normal politics[.]{.underline} However, it also
[[reproduces the categorical belief that there are only two
possible]{.mark} [political forms: 'non-security']{.mark}]{.underline}
(associated with normal politics) [[and 'security']{.underline}]{.mark}
(associated with the logic of war) (see Figure 1). [[This]{.mark}
perspective [is conceptually constraining because **non-security is not
always an option**:]{.mark} on one hand, [desecuritizing]{.mark} moves
[**may simply not be successful** because desecuritizers]{.mark} [lack
discursive authority or]{.mark} because their discursive [strategies do
not resonate with]{.mark} the [relevant audiences]{.mark}]{.underline}
(see Buzan et al., 1998: 26). On the other hand, [[non-security]{.mark}
may be [undesirable]{.mark} owing to the negative side-effects that
[desecuritization]{.mark} can produce -- for example, by
**[undermining]{.mark} [legitimate claims to protect vulnerable
groups]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Roe, 2004). [[Without an alternative to
desecuritization, this would mean **letting**]{.mark} **the logic of
[war unfold.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The alternative we propose here is based on the assumption that [there
is [little reason to accept that speaking]{.mark} [about security
concerns]{.mark} necessarily [leads to]{.mark} the use of full
[emergency measures]{.mark}.]{.underline} Paul Roe (2004: 292--293) has
argued convincingly that [[securitized issues can be
managed]{.underline}. [**While the language of security remains
present**, its effects can be mitigated]{.underline}]{.mark} (see also
Tjalve, 2011). As the debate on the state of exception among legal
theorists shows, [[there are]{.mark} different [ways of constitutionally
dealing with emergencies that]{.mark} [foresee]{.mark} particularly the
[taming of sovereign power]{.mark} through constitutional
containment]{.underline} (see Dyzenhaus, 2006; Ferejohn and Pasquino,
2004; Gross, 2003; Scheuermann, 2006). For example, what has been termed
the 'accommodation model' of exceptionalism is based on the
understanding that it would be unrealistic to think that the existing
constitutional order could remain completely untouched during times of
crisis. [Nevertheless, the basic pillars of the constitution need to be
protected and the legal order should therefore have mechanisms ready to
keep an emergency within these constitutional confines]{.underline}
(Ackermann, 2004; Gross, 2003: 1043--1044; Tushnet, 2005). Thus, from a
legal theory perspective[, one important **[alternative and complement
to]{.mark} [desecuritization ]{.mark}**[is constitutional
accommodation]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Figure 1). [[It]{.mark} is an
alternative insofar as it [mitigates]{.mark} the [effects of
securitizations that cannot be avoided]{.mark}. However, [it is]{.mark}
also [**complementary to discursive desecuritization** because
it]{.mark} counteracts the tendencies of the emergency trap outlined
earlier -- in other words, it [removes]{.mark} or mitigates a
[precondition for further securitizations]{.mark}]{.underline} (see also
White, 2013: 14--15 for the inverse approach).

[[Such confines can be]{.mark} both ex ante and ex post [constitutional
checks on discretionary powers]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ex ante, both the
initiation and the scope of emergency measures can be constrained.
[Regarding the initiation of [emergency rule]{.mark}]{.underline},
Schmittian decisionism -- [according to which the sovereign themself
determines the exception -- [can be countered by]{.mark} functionally
[separating]{.mark} the [decision on]{.mark} the [presence]{.mark} or
absence [of]{.mark} an [emergency and]{.mark} the [decision]{.mark} on
the means [to overcome it]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is seen as a
fundamental precondition for keeping emergency rule 'constitutional'
(Rossiter, 1948: 299--300). At the IO level, [this could mean that a
member-state body or other subcommittee is entitled to formally invoke
the state of exception and that only then can an IO organ decide on
emergency measures. The range [of available emergency measures can be
circumscribed so]{.mark} that the [sovereign's discretion does not
trespass]{.mark} [on elementary rules and rights]{.mark}]{.underline}
even in the state of emergency.

In addition, IO emergency powers can be contained ex post with the help
of accountability mechanisms. As scholars in the literature on emerging
global administrative law argue, basic principles of domestic
administrative law -- and thereby mechanisms of political and judicial
review -- can and should be instituted within the international legal
system to increase IO accountability (see Kingsbury et al., 2005).9
[[Accountability can take the form of political review]{.mark}, whereby
an interstate assembly or executive board watches over IO emergency
powers. Legal review, in turn, can be achieved by either a [legal
counsel or]{.mark} an [internal review panel]{.mark} to assess the
lawfulness of the actions of IOs.]{.underline} In addition,
[inter-institutional processes of steering and control can contribute to
the review of an IO's deployment of emergency competencies]{.underline}
(Kingsbury and Casini, 2009: 337). An important side-effect of
[[accountability mechanisms]{.mark} is that they [enhance]{.mark} the
[transparency and public scrutiny of]{.mark} IO [activities.
This]{.mark} may also [prove to be **positive feedback for
desecuritization**]{.mark} efforts [by opening]{.mark} the [possibility
of discursively contesting]{.mark} the [securitizing moves]{.mark} of
IOs.]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Cosmopolitanism Perm

#### Perm Do Both -- Policy can utilize technology towards security concerns while maintaining cosmopolitan ethics

**Schmidt 2022** (Nikola Schmidt, factuly at the institute of political
science in Charles University, "Space Community as an Enabler of
Cosmopolitan Ideas Through Large Technical Systems"

The traditional approach to socio-technical interactions is anchored in
post-WW2 technological determinism. While positive technological
determinism entails a conviction that technology can solve many social
problems and bring good to society, negative technological determinism
understands the role of technology in a society in the exactly opposite
way \[77\]. However, the argument that [**[technology impacts the way we
live]{.mark}** is undisputable, as current studies within the sociology
of technology]{.underline} focus mainly on perspectives on how to study
that relation in terms of evolution or dissolution of LTS and how they
influence sociotechnical change \[78\]. We argued previously "that
[[large technical systems have constitutive power to shape global
governance system]{.underline},]{.mark} because of their mere existence.
[[This can be turned to **humanity's advantage**]{.mark} if we develop a
normative framework for them]{.underline}, before they influence our
lives in an undesirable way" \[74\]. [Each technology not only has
potential to influence the way we live, but is designed to do
so]{.underline}. A well-considered normative framework is the way to
ensure that such positive potential is realized in society. [[The
normative framework should be read as a desirable
direction]{.underline}]{.mark}, desirable design of intended
technological use, or desirable state of the future in general. This
dynamic is even more interesting in an age in which states are
continuously unable to govern technological inventions \[79\]. Nation
states were crucial in shaping undertakings such as the Manhattan
Project, CERN, and ISS. All these [[ideas would have never materialized
without]{.mark} a direct **[political interest]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and direct investment by the government that had some larger picture of
the future behind its rationalization; however, today's technological
inventions, and even the development of LTS, influencing the way we live
are in the hands of private persons (Facebook). [What the nation states
could do is [to encourage scientists]{.mark} and engineers towards
certain unanswered questions,]{.underline} which is actually done
[**[through financial instruments of research]{.mark}**
projects,]{.underline} or draw more specific contours of long-term
projects and include cosmopolitan ethics, as the political explanation
of why it is worth pursuing. **[[Cosmopolitan ethics should play a role
in shaping policy intentions]{.mark}]{.underline}** before creating LTS,
[[which could influence]{.underline}]{.mark} how [[engineers and
scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} approach their task to build LTS
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} how politicians understand [[their role in
keeping]{.underline}]{.mark} the project in line with possible
**[[national security concerns.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In other terms,
the design of the project should have practical objective-solving
problems (debris, asteroids, propulsion) **[[but also a
normative]{.mark} [objective to enable responsible cosmopolitan
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In our understanding of pragmatism as
(re)introduced by Jonna Nyman reflecting both is the pragmatic approach
to practical politics. [[One]{.mark} single [example]{.mark} of such a
policy approach [is CERN]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scientists wanted a
particle accelerator that did not exist at that time, while politicians
wanted a united Europe around civilian nuclear physics research \[80\].
[CERN was unique due to the historical circumstances]{.underline}. ITER
is unique due to very specific research that is not affordable by a
single global actor, and as a research project it will last almost or
even more than a hundred years from the first ideas to the development
of tokamak that would test all the technologies. [The result will be a
developed high-end international science in fusion physics with
practical impact on humanity in general -- electricity]{.underline} from
a fusion reactor. Fusion reactors can be [key to climate
change,]{.underline} they will enable completely new possibilities in
space, and the whole scientific megaproject already united countries
around a critical scientific task. [[Striving for such global
cooperation should be a central interest]{.mark} of any responsible
cosmopolitan state]{.underline} -- it is practical, nurtures
international security, unites humanity, and yields breakthrough
scientific discoveries solving key problems on the planet.

### 2AC\-\--AT: Cosmopolitanism Alt

#### The Cosmopolitanism alt is vague and full of contradictions, providing no basis to actualize a cosmopolitan utopia

**Chen 2019** (Xunwu Chen, PhD in philosophy at University of Texas at
San Antonio, "Beyond Kant's Political Cosmopolitanism in advance:

Now, Kant has bequeathed [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}n enduring,
[[**daunting question** to the present discourse of
cosmopolitanism:]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[how is a global order under
the rule of cosmopolitan law without a global state
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**? Kant wanted a constitutionalized global
order, but not a world state. As he claimed, ["[the proposal for a
universal cosmopolitan nation]{.mark}, to whose power all individual
nations should voluntarily submit, and whose laws they should obey, may
sound ever so nice in the theory of the Abbe St. Pierre or of a
Rousseau, yet it **[is of no practical use]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Kant
1972: 89). Also, "the idea of international right presupposes the
existence of many separate, independent, adjoining nations" (Kant 1972:
124). As Kant saw it, the concept of international right contradicts the
idea of a world state. "If there were such a global political body,
there would strictly speaking be only one state, and then international
right would not be applicable" (Kant 1972: 60). [[How can a global
order]{.mark} under the rule of law without a world state [be
possible]{.mark}? The key challenge here is to locate a legitimate
public authority as the necessary enactor of cosmopolitan
sovereignty.]{.underline} Kant did find one but his choice leaves much
to be desired. [He proposed the mechanism of a world
congress]{.underline} or federation as the candidate: "This would be a
federation of nations, but it must not be a nation consisting of
nations" (Kant 1972: 115). In spite of his confidence, [Kant's [world
federation may not be competent to be the enactor of cosmopolitan
sovereignty. Some **problems with it are inherent and
irradicable.**]{.mark}]{.underline} This can be seen as follows: (1) The
proposed cosmopolitan order is one under the rule of law; (2) the rule
of law calls for a sovereign power that defines and enforces laws and
that is the necessary enacting agent and condition for the rule of law;
that is to say, the rule of law calls for a government of sovereignty as
the necessary enacting agent and condition; (3) in our time, a sovereign
government is associated with the sovereignty of a state; (4) therefore,
[[how can we talk about the sovereignty of cosmopolitan laws]{.mark} as
civil laws [without a world state]{.mark}? In his misgiving about global
justice, Thomas Nagel raises a similar question]{.underline}. As he
indicates, [global justice calls for the rule of law; the rule of law
calls for government as the necessary enacting conditions for
justice;]{.underline} no wonder, "the nation-state is the primary locus
of political legitimacy and the pursuit of justice"; "justice as a
property of the relations among human beings (and also injustice, for
the most part) requires government as an enacting condition" (Nagel
2005: 114). [Thus, Kant has bequeathed a defining, enduring question to
the present discourse of cosmopolitanism: how can we have sovereign
global laws without a global state-power?]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Realism

#### Realism isn't unethical or a promotion of war

Kevin **Blachford 22**, Kevin is a lEcturer of IR at the Baltic Defence
College, "Realism After the War in Ukraine," The National Interest,
06/24/2022,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/realism-after-war-ukraine-203150>
[\\\\pairie](file:///\\pairie)

The war in Ukraine has opened up a renewed debate on the merits of
realist foreign policies and the realist paradigm. The invasion has
challenged assumptions of the post-Cold War era and both critics and
proponents of realism seek to prescribe a response to the crisis. Much
of the debate has centered on John Mearsheimer's provocative 2014
Foreign Affairs article "Why the Ukraine Crisis Is the West's Fault."
While supporters may celebrate Mearsheimer's prescience, for critics,
the invasion of Ukraine merely shows realists' callous disregard for
morality and a lack of concern for the values of the liberal
international order. One recent critic complained that realists "have
very little to say about" the "evil" of Putin's actions and that the
offensive realism promoted by Mearsheimer is not just "morally slimy"
but "plain offensive." To question NATO expansion, as Mearsheimer did,
is to be on the "wrong side of history" and realism has therefore become
a "bogeyman" for polite society. But [Mearsheimer's realism is not a
thin theoretical veneer for a morally bankrupt policy of power politics.
During his long career, he has repeatedly warned against hubris,
unnecessary wars, and the dangers of escalation. Indeed, Mearsheimer's
realism follows a long American tradition of republican
realism.]{.underline}

There can be no doubt that the invasion of Ukraine is unjustifiable. The
conflict in Ukraine has resulted in shocking images of innocent people
under attack in their cities and homes. This has understandably created
a moralistic urge to "do something" and an emotional appeal to make
"Putin pay". [Yet, this does not necessarily mean that realism as a
theoretical perspective can be disregarded for being ambiguous about
moral issues.]{.underline} The celebrated economist Adam Tooze launched
one of the most thoughtful recent critiques of realism in the British
political magazine New Statesman by arguing that realism is based on the
"naturalization of war." One of his most challenging critiques of
realism is aimed directly at what he sees as realism's support for
military force and aggression. As Tooze argued:

Other than wars of national liberation, one is hard pressed to name a
single war of aggression since 1914 that has yielded clearly positive
results for the first mover. A realism that fails to recognise that fact
and the consequences that have been drawn from it by most policymakers
does not deserve the name.

[For Tooze, realism is a continuation of pseudo-fascist ideas, and his
critique is based on the premise that realism has "dark roots in the
imperialist era."]{.underline} Building on the work of the intellectual
historian Matthew G. Specter, this position sees realism as having "dark
origins" in controversial thinkers such as Karl Haushofer and Carl
Schmitt. The imperial era Germanic influence over realism should come as
no surprise to international relations scholars, given that the German
emigres who fled to America played a founding role in the discipline,
most notably John Herz, Hans Morgenthau, and Henry Kissinger, among
others. But modern realism is also influenced by a uniquely American
tradition of thought traced back to the founding of the United States
and the Federalist Papers.

Realism is a diverse approach that is too often turned into a caricature
as a war-like and power-hungry paradigm. It has therefore become a
cliche to see realism as an approach synonymous with power politics and
little else, but there has also been a consistent strand of realist
thought which has cautioned against the temptations of power and viewed
war and militarism as destructive of liberal-republican values. The
realist canon provides a basis for a conservatism that demonstrates a
commitment to attacking moralistic foreign policy crusades while urging
restraint against universalism and pursuing limited policy goals[. The
**realist critique of imperial adventures** corrupting democratic
institutions at home can be seen primarily with the resistance to the
wars in Vietnam and Iraq. Leading realist thinkers such as Morgenthau,
Reinhold Niebuhr, and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. all criticized the Vietnam
War]{.underline}. In the post-Cold War era, realists responded to the
neoconservative aggression of the Bush Doctrine by forming The Coalition
For a Realistic Foreign Policy to counter the arguments of those in
favor of American primacy. [Crucially, these realist warnings against
wars of primacy have been coupled with concerns about the corrosive
effect such conflicts can have on democratic institutions.]{.underline}
American power in the post-Cold War has often been compared to the
imperial republics of Athens and Rome. In making these analogies,
realists have warned of the hubris of American military power and the
previous fates of republics that suffered from military overstretch. The
extent of American power and its relationship to conflicts has therefore
always inspired debates within realism that represent a classical
republican concern, namely, can a republican polis be commensurate with
empire?

[Contrary to the caricature of realism as supporting a Machiavellian
Prince-like figure, Mearsheimer has warned of the "damage" a
militaristic and bloated security state can cause to the "fabric of
American society."]{.underline} In this sense, Mearsheimer follows the
realism of Hans Morgenthau whose later career increasingly turned to
discussions about the "national purpose" of the United States and the
importance of American morals and values. As a political commentator,
Morgenthau consistently warned against an overreliance on military power
and the challenge of a bureaucratic military-industrial complex limiting
democratic debate. In examining the corruption of democracy and threats
to American liberty arising from the Vietnam War, Morgenthau framed his
analysis using the example of Rome's transformation from a republic into
an empire. He observed how the concentration of power within Rome in
"the hands of one man" resulted in the appearance of a republic, but
without the "substance." Morgenthau was aware of the Federalist authors'
fear of a Caesar-like figure, and he used this concern to critique the
centralization of power and lack of presidential accountability during
the Vietnam War. Niebuhr and Schlesinger made a similar critique by
warning about the growth of an "imperial presidency." Crucially, wars
were seen by these thinkers as having an inherent tendency to be a
source of instability and a threat to a free society that rests on a
stable and balanced order.

The realist critique against wars of primacy and the threats such wars
pose to domestic democratic institutions remains valid today. Liberals
have broadly interpreted the invasion of Ukraine as an assault on global
democracy and the liberal values of the West. Their prescription is to
double down on the expansion of the European Union and NATO and to
create a stronger liberal world order, with direct intervention if
necessary. Mearsheimer's provocative claim that the Ukraine crisis may
have been caused by Western overreach has led to howls of rage from
liberal voices, but this merely reflects the liberal frustration over
the West's limited options to respond to a nuclear-armed Russia.
Advocates for no-fly zones, humanitarian corridors, escalation, and
direct intervention may attack Mearsheimer for blaming the West, but
they also have little response to the realist cautions against the
unpredictable and corrupting nature of war. [Far from being a theory
that supports war, American realists have long seen war as having a
degenerative effect on America's institutions.]{.underline}

Attacks against Mearsheimer are a reflection of the Western experience
of the post-Cold War unipolar era that has left it blind to its own
hubris. Over two decades of wars of choice against rogue states and
pariah regimes have led the West to believe that military force can be
used to install a peaceful liberal order and that reactions against
constant Western expansion are indicative of irrationality. The West has
lived under conditions of American primacy for so long that it lacks a
vocabulary to understand the current moment or formulate a realistic
response. [The sidelining of realist voices is therefore a detriment to
meaningful debate which risks downplaying the dangers of the escalatory
and unpredictable nature of war.]{.underline}

#### Realism is true and not immoral or unethical

Center for the National Interest and an elected associate fellow at the
Royal Historical Society, "Hatred for Realism Is an Elite Afflicition,"

[\\\\pairie](file:///\\pairie)

[Why do people hate realism so much?]{.underline} It's a thoughtful
question asked by Stephen Walt in Foreign Policy. Walt is a
card-carrying foreign policy realist, his work on alliances and his
theory of balance of threat influenced the theoretical framework of much
such research with major explanatory power. Walt argues that at the time
of realism's triumph, as the theory predicted a conflict in Ukraine,
we're observing a withering attack on the worldview. "Much of this ire
has been directed at my colleague and occasional co-author John J.
Mearsheimer, based in part on the bizarre claim that his views on the
West's role in helping to cause the Russia-Ukraine crisis somehow make
him 'pro-Putin' and in part on some serious misreadings of his theory of
offensive realism," Walt writes, adding that "another obvious target is
former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, whose recent comments
urging peace talks with Moscow, a territorial compromise in Ukraine, and
the need to avoid a permanent rupture with Russia were seen as a
revealing demonstration of realism's moral bankruptcy."

Walt concludes that there are several reasons people dislike realism.
[Primary among them is the idea that realism is
pessimistic]{.underline}. "It's not hard to understand why many people
are reluctant to embrace such a pessimistic view of the human condition,
especially when it appears to offer no clear escape from it." Second,
realism is "indifferent or hostile" to ethical considerations, being an
amoral framework where power is the chief determinant. "There is a grain
of truth in this charge, insofar as realism's theoretical framework does
not incorporate values or ideals in any explicit way," Walt writes, "for
realists, noble aims and good intentions are not enough if the resulting
choices lead to greater insecurity or human suffering." Realists do not
consider any country exceptional, as their worldview argues that every
country, every power will usually act in a certain way, facing a certain
set of variables. [That also rubs most people the wrong way, as most
people tend to think in group dynamic, and any criticism of their own
country's behavior or dissent and nonconformity to the "current thing"
or conventional wisdom, are considered unpatriotic.]{.underline}

Finally, [Walt writes that **realism got major questions right, and
naturally got major ideological opponents on the way**]{.underline}.
Walt writes, ["realism tends to be unpopular because its proponents have
an annoying tendency to be right ... realists were right about NATO
enlargement, dual containment in the Persian Gulf, the war in Iraq,
Ukraine's ill-fated decision to give up its nuclear arsenal, the
implications of China's rise, and the folly of nation-building in
Afghanistan]{.underline}, to note just a few examples."

There is a lot of sense in these arguments. Realism, a framework which
privileges (to borrow a word used often by the academic Left) power and
national interest, is by definition a "reactionary" theory, more at home
within political conservatism and hierarchy. It is fundamentally opposed
to mass democracy and subsequent volatility of public passions. And
while it is sternly in favor of national interest, it also favors
compromises and a balance of power based on relative gains. Furthermore,
being a reactionary theory, it believes in a cyclical view of history,
instead of a steady arc of progress. Therefore, realism falls squarely
opposed to any worldview that affirms egalitarianism or progress,
whether liberalism, socialism, feminism, or Marxism, all of which are
theories stemming from the enlightenment, with an egalitarianism
embedded. In turn, all progressive theories, from liberalism to Marxism,
are normatively opposed to any political reaction. [The opposition to
realism (and realists) within the academy is therefore qualitatively
similar to all the progressive fanaticism about statue toppling,
hierarchy, and canceling classics, a deep aversion to anything vaguely
reactionary from patrimony, to authority, to national borders, an
opposition which isn't just academic or theoretical, but
ideological]{.underline}. To borrow Peter Hitchens' famous words, a rage
by "tiny figures scuttling through cavernous halls built for much
greater men."

[Realism is,]{.underline} of course, amoral, but [not **cruel or
unethical**]{.underline}. In fact, the instinct for compromise and
balance of power comes from a higher ethical consideration. As Hans
Morgenthau wrote,

[Realism maintains that universal moral principles cannot be applied to
the actions of states in their abstract universal formulation, but that
they must be filtered through the concrete circumstances of time and
place.]{.underline} The individual may say for himself: "Fiat justitia,
pereat mundus (Let justice be done, even if the world perish)," but the
state has no right to say so in the name of those who are in its care.
Both individual and state must judge political action by universal moral
principles, such as that of liberty. Yet while the individual has a
moral right to sacrifice himself in defense of such a moral principle,
the state has no right to let its moral disapprobation of the
infringement of liberty get in the way of successful political action,
itself inspired by the moral principle of national survival. There can
be no political morality without prudence; that is, without
consideration of the political consequences of seemingly moral action.

While realism isn't blameless, the record of realism isn't comparable to
the democracy crusades of the last thirty years.

But to return to the original question, one must add that the framing of
the question itself is flawed. The people don't hate realism. In fact,
public opinion is usually fundamentally reactionary, if channeled
rightly. The majority favors national borders and opposes foreign
misadventures. What could be more reactionary than that in our time?
[**Public opinion can be volatile and appeals to emotion succeed in the
short term.** But overall, the public understands their interests if
clearly communicated with. Consider the recent drop in support for a
No-Fly Zone (NFZ) over Ukraine, the moment it was explained what an NFZ
would actually entail. The hatred for realism (and any political
reaction) is an elite progressive affliction, aided by an ideological
academy.]{.underline} What realists sometimes refuse to accept is that
they are at a structural disadvantage. This isn't the time of
Metternich, nor is it the time of Yalta, or even Kissinger's secret
China visit. Realism isn't a worldview that can succeed automatically in
the age of social media, NGOs, hyper-democracy, and an activist academy
and internationalist news media. To succeed in that scenario, realism
and realists will need to use the inherent reactionary public instinct
to their advantage, and communicate in ways that might at times go
against electoral propriety, and sound like an uncouth New York tycoon.
Whether it is a compromise academic realists are willing to entertain,
to regain a hand in policy setting, is a key question.

#### Realism is the only theory that [correctly]{.underline} structures the world.

Emerging Technologies. Vol 24. No. 2 \[ML\]

It might be objected now that if this account of political realism is
correct, then we would have to admit that structural realists, too, have
to take for granted a specific conception of human nature, namely that
human beings naturally strive for security and survival. Waltz himself
admits that [[there is a basic "**wish for survival**]{.mark}" common to
all states ]{.underline}(Waltz 2001, 203). Yet, if there is a conception
of human nature at issue here, it is a very modest one. [This is,
actually, the assumption that makes intelligible a wide range of human
activities. [We strive to make **safer cars, better medicines**]{.mark},
and earthquake-resistant [buildings on the assumption]{.mark} that
[people will]{.mark} generally [prefer **security and survival** rather
than **danger and death**]{.mark}. Human institutions, just like cars,
medicines and buildings, can also be designed to promote the **basic
goals** of security and survival.]{.underline} Both positive law, in the
context of domestic politics, and the system of states as a whole, are
institutions that clearly reflect the human quest for security and
survival. Positive laws can certainly make our lives more secure in the
context of states, where a powerful institution is in a position to
enforce them. But in the context of interaction among states, the
absence of such an institution means that states will have to rely upon
themselves in order to promote the basic goals of security and survival.

 

[Once we have understood how the structure of [international
relations]{.mark} often **[constrains actors]{.mark}** operating within
the structure [to **prefer war over peace**]{.mark}, as well as
[conflict over cooperation]{.mark} and mistrust over trust, in
situations]{.underline} in which everyone would be better-off by acting
otherwise, we can ask more pertinent questions. In particular, [we can
ask ourselves whether, given the goals of security and survival in a
world in which weapons of mass destructions are becoming so readily
available, we would not have reasons to radically change this structure
or even get rid of it.]{.underline} My intention here is not to propose
a blueprint for the implementation of radical change in world politics.
[I simply intend to explain why this option is not incompatible with the
realist approach, nor with the project of the moral enhancement of human
beings.]{.underline} Quite the opposite: the idea of a "world state,"
devoid of state borders and ruled by "supra-national institutions," was
perfectly in line with the original project of some human nature
realists, although it eventually disappeared in the works of the
so-called "neo-realists," such as Waltz and Mearsheimer.

 

**VI.**

 

[[The suggestion that]{.mark} the **system of [states]{.mark}**
[could]{.mark} one day [be **abolished**]{.mark} might perhaps be
dismissed [as a **far-fetched idea**]{.mark} and, indeed, as **wholly
incompatible** with political realism itself]{.underline}. [For
[political realism presupposes the]{.mark} very [existence of]{.mark}
the system of [states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Should the system of states
ever disappear, political realism would fail to make any sense. It is
not entirely clear, however, whether political realism must be
understood as both a *descriptive* and a *prescriptive* theory. [If
political realism is both descriptive and prescriptive as a theory of
the structure of the international relations, then the objection is
justified.]{.underline} For one could not endorse political realism and,
at the same time, prescribe the dissolution of the system of states as
part of a solution to a range of problems to which some moral
enhancements theorists rightly draw attention. But although [some
realists do advocate political realism on both descriptive and
prescriptive grounds, it seems to me that we can coherently retain only
the descriptive aspect of the theory.]{.underline} Consider, for
instance, the following passage from Mearsheimer's book *The Tragedy of
Great Power Politics*:

 

> It should be apparent from this discussion that offensive realism is
> mainly a descriptive theory. It explains how great powers have behaved
> in the past and how they are likely to behave in the future. But it is
> also a prescriptive theory. States should behave according to the
> dictates of offensive realism, because it outlines the best way to
> survive in a dangerous world. (Mearsheimer 2001, 11)

 

[[Political realism]{.mark}, in my view, [**correctly describes** the
**structure** of t]{.mark}he [international relations]{.mark} in a world
devoid of central government. [The absence of an institution]{.mark}
with the real power to enforce laws for mutual benefit on a global scale
[means]{.mark} that the [states can only count on **self-help**]{.mark}
in their attempts [to guarantee their]{.mark} own **security and
[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But if the survival of humankind in
the future becomes threatened for some of the reasons to which moral
enhancement theorists plausibly call attention, then abolishing the
system of states, rather than following the "dictates of offensive
realism," may very well be the best prescription to follow.

#### Realism [evolves]{.underline} to accommodate the international order and explains the [factors]{.underline} of war.

\[ML\]

An unintended and unfortunate consequence of the debate about neorealism
is that [[**neorealism** and]{.mark} a large part of [its
critique]{.mark}]{.underline} (with the notable exception of the English
School) [[has been expressed in **abstract**]{.mark} scientific and
philosophical [terms]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This has made]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [theory of [international politics]{.mark} **almost
[inaccessible]{.mark}**]{.underline} to a layperson and [[has divided
the discipline]{.mark} of international relations [into **incompatible
parts**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Whereas classical realism was a theory
aimed at supporting diplomatic practice and providing a guide to be
followed by those seeking to understand and deal with potential threats,
[[today's theories]{.mark}, concerned with various grand pictures and
projects, [are **ill-suited**]{.mark} to perform this task]{.underline}.
This is perhaps the main reason why there has been a renewed interest in
classical realism, and particularly in the ideas of Morgenthau. [Rather
than being seen as an obsolete form of **pre-scientific** realist
thought, superseded by neorealist theory, his thinking is now considered
to be more **complex** and of greater contemporary relevance than was
earlier recognized (Williams 2007, 1--9]{.underline}). It fits uneasily
in the orthodox picture of realism he is usually associated with.

In recent years, scholars have questioned prevailing narratives about
clear theoretical traditions in the discipline of international
relations. Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes and other thinkers have
become subject to re-examination as a means of challenging prevailing
uses of their legacies in the discipline and exploring other lineages
and orientations. Morgenthau has undergone a similar process of
reinterpretation. A number of scholars (Hartmut Behr, Muriel Cozette,
Amelia Heath, Sean Molloy) have endorsed the importance of his thought
as a source of change for the standard interpretation of realism.
Murielle Cozette stresses Morgenthau's critical dimension of realism
expressed in his commitment to "speak truth to power" and to "unmask
power's claims to truth and morality," and in his tendency to assert
different claims at different times (Cozette 10--12). She writes: "The
protection of human life and freedom are given central importance by
Morgenthau, and constitute a 'transcendent standard of ethics' which
should always animate scientific enquiries" (19). This shows the
flexibility of his classical realism and reveals his normative
assumptions based on the promotion of universal moral values. While
Morgenthau assumes that [[**states are** power-oriented]{.mark}
actors]{.underline}, he at the same time acknowledges that international
politics would be more pernicious than it actually is were it not for
moral restraints and the work of international law(Behr and Heath 333).

Another avenue for the development of a realist theory of international
relations is offered by Robert Gilpin's seminal work *War and Change in
World Politics*. If this work were to gain greater prominence in IR
scholarship, instead of engaging in fruitless theoretical debates, [[we
would be better prepared]{.mark} today "[for]{.mark} **rapid [power
shifts]{.mark}** and geopolitical change]{.underline} "(Wohlforth, 2011
505). We [[would be able to explain]{.mark} the [**causes** of great
wars]{.mark} and long periods of peace, [and the **creation**]{.mark}
**and waning** [of international orders]{.mark}. Still another avenue is
provided by the application of the new scientific discoveries to social
sciences]{.underline}. The evidence for this is, for example, the recent
work of Alexander Wendt, Quantum Mind and Social Science[.]{.underline}
A new realist approach to international politics could be based on the
organic and holistic world view emerging from quantum theory, the idea
of human evolution, and the growing awareness of the role of human
beings in the evolutionary process (Korab-Karpowicz 2017).

[[Realism is]{.mark} thus [**more than** a static]{.mark}, amoral
[theory]{.mark}, and **cannot be accommodated** solely within a
positivist interpretation of international relations. [It is a practical
and evolving theory]{.mark}]{.underline} that depends on the actual
historical and political conditions, and is ultimately judged by its
ethical standards and by its relevance in making prudent political
decisions (Morgenthau 1962). [[Realism]{.mark} also performs a useful
cautionary role. It [warns us against]{.mark} **progressivism**,
[moralism, **legalism**, and]{.mark} other [orientations that **lose
touch** with]{.mark} the reality of **[self-interest]{.mark} and
power**]{.underline}. Considered from this perspective, the neorealist
revival of the 1970s can also be interpreted as a necessary corrective
to an overoptimistic liberal belief in international cooperation and
change resulting from interdependence.

#### Realism is a [logically sound]{.underline} theory that [explains]{.underline} and [analyzes]{.underline} past behavior.

John J. **Mearsheimer 06** an American political scientist and
international relations scholar, who belongs to the realist school of
thought. He is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor

influential realist of his generation, 2006, "China's Unpeaceful Rise,"
Current History 105, no. 690 (April 2006): 160--2. \[ML\]

Can China rise peacefully? My answer is no. If China continues its
impressive economic growth over the next few decades, the [United States
and China are likely to engage in an intense security
competition]{.underline} with considerable potential for war. Most of
China's neighbors---including India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea,
Russia, and Vietnam---will join with the United States to contain
China's power.

[[To predict]{.mark} the future in Asia, [one needs a theory]{.mark} of
international politics [that **explains** how rising]{.mark} great
[powers]{.mark} are **likely to [act]{.mark}** [and how]{.mark} other
[states]{.mark} in the system [will **react to them.**]{.mark} [That
theory must be **logically sound** and]{.mark} it must [account
for]{.mark} the **[past behavior]{.mark}** of rising great
powers.]{.underline}

[My theory of international politics says that [the **mightiest states**
attempt to **establish hegemony**]{.mark} in their region of the world
[while making sure]{.mark} that **[no rival]{.mark} great power**
[dominates]{.mark} another region. [This theory]{.mark}, which [helps
explain US foreign policy]{.mark} since the country's founding, also has
implications for future relations between China and the United
States.]{.underline}

The contest for power

According to my understanding of international politics, [[survival
is]{.mark} a state's **[most important goal]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[because [a state **cannot pursue**]{.mark} any other [goals if it
**does not survive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} basic structure
of the international system [forces states]{.mark} **concerned about
their security** [to compete with each other]{.mark} for power. [The
ultimate goal]{.mark} of every great power [is to maximize]{.mark} its
share of world [power]{.mark} and eventually dominate the
system.]{.underline}

The international system has three defining characteristics. First, the
main actors are states that operate in anarchy, which simply means that
there is no higher authority above them. Second, all great powers have
some offensive military capability, which means that they have the
wherewithal to hurt each other. Third, no state can know the intentions
of other states with certainty, especially their future intentions. It
is simply impossible, for example, to know what Germany or Japan's
intentions will be toward their neighbors in 2025.

In a world where other states might have malign intentions as well as
significant offensive capabilities, [[states]{.mark} tend to **[fear
each other]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That fear is compounded by the fact
that in an anarchic system there is no night watchman for states to call
if trouble comes knocking at their door. Therefore[, [states
recognize]{.mark} that [the best way to survive]{.mark} in such a system
[is to be as **powerful as possible**]{.mark} relative to potential
rivals]{.underline}. [[The mightier a state is, the less likely it is
that another state will attack]{.underline}]{.mark} it. No Americans,
for example, worry that Canada or Mexico will attack the United States,
because neither of those countries is powerful enough to contemplate a
fight with Washington. But great powers do not merely strive to be the
strongest great power, although that is a welcome outcome. [Their
[ultimate aim is to be **the hegemon**]{.mark}]{.underline}---that is,
the only great power in the system

### 2AC\-\--Not Monolithic

#### Securitization shouldn't be a yes/no ethical question\-\--you should evaluate our unique instance of action instead of blanket opposition against our AFF

A Tragic Vision of Securitization

Tragedy is largely absent from the existing normative debate on
securitization. Instead, [the debate has become organized around whether
securitization is a "negative" or "positive" concept.]{.underline} In
the classic formulation, the Copenhagen School points to how
"\[n\]ational security should not be idealized. It works to silence
opposition and has given power-holders many opportunities to exploit
'threats' for domestic purposes" (Buzan et al. 1998, 29; Williams 2003).
Securitization has negative effects when it functions as "a political
technology that consistently favors the interests of the powerful and
enables violence and exclusion" (McDonald 2015, 154). Correspondingly,
Wæver admits a "'bias' for desecuritization" or de-escalation, although
he quickly notes that this is "not always better than securitization"
(Wæver 2011, 469). At the same time, a number of approaches point to
cases where securitization is ethically desirable. In her compelling
consequentialist argument, for example, Floyd asks "whether the
consequences of, and the gains from, the securitization are preferable
relative to the consequences and gains from a politicization" (2007,
338). [Relatedly, Roe contends that "the extent to which securitization
necessitates a lack of openness and deliberation has been
overexaggerated" and suggests it may even elicit unappreciated forms of
cooperation]{.underline} (2012, 250).

[The problem with the negative/positive debate is that it **appears to
impose moral certitude where there often is none**]{.underline}.
Registering securitizing moves as clearly positive or negative can be
difficult because their effects can be mixed and temporally distant. The
difficulty in making this determination may also be an indicator of the
uncertainty surrounding securitizing moves. [In the end, because the
outcomes of security claims are uncertain, we cannot know in advance
whether they will lead to positive or negative
consequences]{.underline}. Instead, we should entertain a distinctly
tragic vision of securitization that councils an ethic of
self-limitation. The core of this tragic vision is a recognition that
the powerful allure of using security talk to "gain control" over a
situation will always be present (Wæver 1995, 54). However, we should
also recognize that this control is always illusory because it presumes
all of its effects can be predetermined. The tragedy of securitization
is that the failure to recognize how contingency imposes limits on
action lures political actors into a false sense of certainty and the
conviction that they can determine the future. This leads to a hubristic
adoption of "misplaced certainty," such as when Vice President Dick
Cheney declared in August of 2002 that "there is no doubt that Saddam
Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction" (quoted in Mitzen and
Schweller 2011, 3). A similar situation emerged when Secretary of
Defense Donald Rumsfeld subsequently claimed in November that the Iraq
conflict could be "\[f\]ive days or five weeks or five months, but it
certainly isn't going to last any longer than that" (Esterbrook 2002). A
similarly misplaced certainty is evident in US General Stanley
McChrystal's assurances to the Obama administration in 2009 that a surge
in troops and resources were critical to stave off American defeat in
Afghanistan (Woodward 2009). More recently, it is visible in President
Donald Trump's 2018 assertion that he was "100 percent right" on the
weaknesses of the Iran nuclear deal (CNN 2018).

Yet, tragedy cuts both ways. [**Blanket opposition to securitizing moves
can also have unanticipated effects.** Ironically, the desecuritization
of an issue may not just result in its repoliticization, but in **its
disappearance from public view** (Floyd 2010, 57--58). Viewing security
discourse as negative also underplays how the management of threats can
serve as a focal point for democratic cooperation among different
political actors]{.underline} (Roe 2012, 250, 257--58). The point is not
that every security discourse and the practices it justifies has
catastrophically perverse consequences. Instead, the goal is to
highlight a sensible restraint over the limits of seeing into the
future, how this shapes choice, and the dangers of hubris that follow.
[When properly adapted to this constructivist context, the tragic vision
of securitization **can be an important tool** in cultivating prudence
and restraint]{.underline} (cf. Lebow 2003, 364).

### 2AC -- AT: Discourse 

#### Discourse cannot explain [sensory]{.underline} experience.

Dave **Elder-Vass 12,** a senior lecturer in sociology at Loughborough
University. He is the author of The Causal Power of Social Structures
(Cambridge University Press, 2010), 2012, "The Reality of Social
Construction," Cambridge University Press,

\[ML\]

At one level, Edwards et al. are right. Realists cannot prove there is a
world beyond discourse if by prove we mean 'demonstrate with absolute
certainty' as analytical philosophers have traditionally demanded. No
one can absolutely prove, for example, that the world is not a figment
of the imagination of some disembodied consciousness (that would have to
be my consciousness of course, not yours, since I know that I can
imagine the world!) [But there would be something **rather ironic**
about a **group of [self-proclaimed relativists]{.mark}** who [disown
notions of absolute truth]{.mark} demanding that other people's claims
can only be justified by that standard]{.underline}. [Nor does the
argument work as an **immanent critique** of critical realists, as it
might if we were ourselves committed to such a standard, because
critical realists insist on the **fallibility** of all knowledge claims:
the possibility that they might be wrong]{.underline} (e.g. Bhaskar
1986: 15). What we claim is that [it is so **overwhelmingly likely**
that the world 'out there' exists that we can take this as a firm
working assumption]{.underline}. As Bruno Latour, a very different kind
of realist, has said: "[why burden this solitary mind with the
impossible task of finding **absolute certainty**]{.underline} [instead
of plugging it into the connections that would provide it with all the
**relative certainties** it needed to know and to act?]{.underline}"
(1999: 12). To come to this conclusion, however, we must question the
assertion that our only access to reality is through discourse.
[[Banging on a table]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, may well be an
act that is given discursive employment, but it [[is not only a
discursive act]{.mark}. The person [striking the table feels]{.mark} its
**[resistance]{.mark}**, its [**solidity**, and]{.mark} those present
**hear the [thump]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although our ability to label
or interpret that solidity or that noise as such depends on the
possession of language and a personal history of discursive interaction,
[[there is]{.mark} nevertheless [a **sensory experience** that]{.mark}
also [occurs]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [If the realist]{.underline}]{.mark}
[were to [try to bang]{.mark} on [an illusion]{.mark} of a table,
[no]{.mark} such **[solidity]{.mark}** would be experienced,
[and]{.mark} no such [**noise** would occur]{.mark} to demonstrate the
point.5]{.underline} It is only because humans have some access to a
sensory experience of reality that we can make the realists' point by
banging on a table, although making that point also requires a shared
linguistic and discursive environment. And of course, we can move one
step further away from the discursive case, as Harry Collins does, for
example, when he discusses the case of stumbling accidentally against a
rock. When such events occur, the experience of the rock's solidity is
not a discursive act at all, yet it is a sensory experience that gives
us good evidence for the belief that there is a real material world in
which we move. Edwards, Ashmore, and Potter reject such claims on the
grounds that in making the claim we switch between the stumbling event
to a discursive account (1995: 30). But this response is viable only if
we accept the constructionist argument that language cannot refer beyond
itself. This argument was criticised in Chapters 5 and 7, and also by
John O'Neill in his reply to these authors: "That the argument is in
language doesn't entail that it is 'trapped' in language" (1995: 101).
Furthermore (and this is a point to which I shall return in discussing
neo-Kantianism), [[our conversations]{.mark}, our speech [acts]{.mark},
**our [rhetoric themselves]{.mark}** [depend on]{.mark} such
[**sensory** experience]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Speaking is transmitted
as [sound waves through the air]{.mark};]{.underline} [journal
[articles]{.mark} like 'Death and Furniture' [only succeed in
communicating]{.mark} to [us if we can **sense them** as patterns
on]{.mark} pieces of [paper]{.mark} or computer screens]{.underline}
(whether as patterns of black and white, or as raised marks). While it
is not true that we can experience the material world only through
discourse, it is the case that [[we can experience discourse **only
through the material world**]{.mark}!]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Security Discourse Good

#### If our impacts are true, Securitization is justified

**Floyd 2019** (Rita Floyd, Security Studies at the University of
Birmingham, "The Morality of Security"
<https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108667814.010>) //sethlee

In the process I have set forth eight principles determining just
securitization. These principles are supposed to hold regardless of the
origin of the threat, the nature of the referent object (i.e. the entity
threatened and to be made safe by securitization) and the provider of
security. In more detail I have argued that [[securitization is
**morally permissible**]{.mark} only [in the presence of a just
cause]{.mark} which in turn is [made up of an objective **existential
threat**]{.mark} to a just referent object of security]{.underline}.
Referent objects are just provided they satisfy basic human needs,
specifically autonomy and physical health. I further insisted on a
sincerity of intention condition, whereby the right intention for
securitization is the just cause. [Just initiation of securitization was
complemented by a criterion specifying macroproportionality, which held
that the [expected good gained from securitization must be]{.mark}
judged [**greater** than expected harm]{.mark} from
securitization]{.underline}. I further specified that just
[[securitization needs to take account of the probable
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline} of treating an issue in security mode.
[Specifically, [securitization has to have a reasonable]{.mark} (i.e.
greater than that of nonsecuritization alternatives) [chance of
succeeding in achieving the just cause.]{.mark}]{.underline} The second
of the two research questions was discussed as part of the development
of the principles designating just conduct during securitization[. I
argued that the security measures used must be appropriate for dealing
with the threat in question]{.underline}, and not serve some ulterior
motive. A second criterion was concerned with reducing harm as much as
possible[; I argued that while the nature of the security measures
differs according to the source of the threat, as well as the nature of
the referent object, [securitizing actors must consider]{.mark} the harm
caused by the measures, and aim to choose the [least overall harmful
option]{.mark} available]{.underline}. In addition, I argued that
securitization is unjust if the measures used are more harmful to the
referent object than the threat they seek to solve. A third and final
criterion specified just conduct of executors of securitization,
including security professionals. I argued that although securitization
necessarily involves the infringement of some human rights, executors of
securitization should when they -- as part of securitization -- harm
people be appropriately constraint those people's rights to life,
freedom from torture and arbitrary detention. Like recent versions of
the just war theory, JST goes beyond theorizing simply the moral
permissibility of securitization. Instead, it also considers the issue
of just termination of securitization. In JST, desecuritization is
conceptualized as a process (not an outcome) that occurs (in time) after
securitization. This has meant that unlike securitization, which in JST
remains a political choice decided by securitizing actors, not scholars,
desecuritization is obligatory for actors who are remedially responsible
for unmaking the preceding securitization, either on the basis of
outcome responsibility or by connection. Although securitization and
desecuritization are then interrelated processes, in JST the justice of
one is judged independently of the justice of the other. In other words,
an unjust desecuritization does not render a just securitization unjust
and vice versa. JST specifies three principles of just desecuritization,
concerning 1) the timing when desecuritization must ensue (notably, I
have argued that a securitization can remain just only for as long as
there is a just cause); 2) the dismantling of the security measures
taken, as well as the reversal of security language; and 3) a series of
restorative measures aimed at reducing the possibility of renewed and/or
reactionary securitization. In addition to providing criteria
determining the justice of securitization and desecuritization, the
wider research argument also revealed a number of difficult issues such
as that of the moral culpability of executors of securitization who have
followed the rules of just securitization, but who have acted in
securitizations that were unjustly initiated (Chapter 6, section 6.6).
Or the question of whether just desecuritizing actors who played no part
in securitization have fewer restorative responsibilities than
desecuritizing actors culpable of unjust preceding securitization
(Chapter 7, section 7.9), or the issue of whether securitization and a
relevant counter-securitization can be just at the same time (Chapter 6,
section 6.7). I have in this book advanced answers to these and other
difficult questions, but I recognize that more can and needs to be said
on all of them, as well as on all of the substantive principles
advanced. Beyond contributing to security studies, this book also
contributes to the just war tradition. This is especially the case
because some just war theorists are increasingly interested in wars that
do not involve kinetic force, and as such, phenomena that may be called
securitization. By thinking about what the just war tradition's criteria
mean for securitization, JST speaks to just war theorists interested in
these softer versions of war. I have mentioned on more than one occasion
on the preceding pages that the argument is conceived as very much a
first word on just securitization. I hope that other scholars will
devise theories of just securitization of their own volition. [This is
important because I believe that research on the [principles of]{.mark}
just [securitization has]{.mark} more than just **[the potential to
impact positively]{.mark}** on the scholarly study of security and/or on
the **[decisions and actions of practitioners]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Beyond that it could -- provided the idea of just securitization becomes
widely known, which, in turn, is likely to happen only if just
securitization becomes a research area in its own right -- equip the
public with tools to question the ethics of the decision to securitize
including the security measures used and thus hold security
practitioners accountable. In other words, the long-desired (in some
parts of critical security studies) goal of emancipation can quite
conceivably be achieved through just securitization. The room for
competing theories of just securitization is vast. One reason for this
is that my interpretation of securitization is only one among many
possible interpretations of the concept. For example, a theory of just
securitization that theorizes securitization as an intersubjective
process and focuses on audience acceptance of the speech act as pivotal
would look quite different to the principles proposed as part of JST.
Among other things, such a theory of just securitization would have to
focus on ethical language, that is, on what kind of things securitizing
actors are allowed to utter when it comes to securitizing speech acts,
while they would also have to focus on what kind of audiences make ideal
ethical adjudicators of the speech act and other new issues besides.
Another reason for the open-endedness of just securitization research is
that JST focuses only on the circumstances when securitization is
morally permissible, when it is equally valid and important to ask:
when, if ever, is securitization morally required? A theory of just
securitization that prioritizes the obligation to securitize is bound to
be quite different from JST. Unlike JST, its objective would not be to
reduce the number of securitizations in the world, but to use the
mobilization power inherent to securitization to achieve security as a
state of being. With this in mind, potential advocates of such a theory
might utilize a scalar as opposed to a categorical approach to
principles of just securitization (e.g. one where not all principles
advanced as part of such a theory have to be met all of the time),
largely to facilitate the ease with which securitization can take place.
Theories of just securitization that focus on moral obligation could
differ widely from one another depending on whether their proponents
broadly concurred with cosmopolitan/global or communitarian/statist
ethics. Moreover, [theories of just [securitization could]{.mark} also
[derive their inspiration from virtue ethics, and]{.mark}]{.underline},
for example, [[**devise principles** that determine what makes for a
virtuous securitizing actor.]{.mark}]{.underline} Theories of just
securitization could supposedly also take a permissive view of the
justice of securitization and seek to develop principles that specify
the circumstances when securitization is forbidden. In future, just
securitization research also needs to engage with the issue of what can
reasonably be expected of security practitioners when it comes to the
issue of ethics and security.1 These concluding remarks show that
[[there is huge potential for]{.mark} research in the area of [just
securitization]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In fact the diversity and
thus potential for just [[securitization]{.mark} research is such that
it [could become a]{.mark} meta-theoretical **[framework
organizing]{.mark} thinking on [ethics]{.mark}** and security in
general, in the same way as thinking about the morality of war is
systematized by the just war tradition]{.underline}. Whatever happens in
terms of just securitization research from here on in, this book has
shown not only that questions concerning the morality of security ought
to be taken seriously by anyone interested in the study and/or practice
of security but also that clear and systematic [answers are
possible.]{.underline}

#### Security Discourse within the debate space does shape reality, but also shapes specific policy solutions which are critical to decision making.

A crisis is defined as an unstable or crucial time period, or state of
affairs, in which a decisive change is impending, or a time when a
difficult or important decision must be made. [[Discourse is]{.mark}
defined, in its most basic form, as a written or spoken form of
**[communication]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the context of culture,
[discourse is defined as a mode of organizing knowledge, ideas, or
experience]{.underline} that is rooted in language and its concrete
contexts. Balzacq notes that using discourse, or discursive action is,
"compelling power to cause a receiver or the audience to perform a
deed." He adds, "**[[through]{.mark} mutual [knowledge, discourse
shapes]{.mark} social [relations]{.mark}]{.underline}** and builds their
form **[[and content]{.underline}]{.mark}**... \[and\] on the causative
sides, [as vehicle of ideas, [discourse]{.mark} targets and **[creates
the instantiation of a particular communicative
action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For the purposes of this research,
[crisis discourse is defined by the rhetorical practices employed in
order **[to construct threats as]{.mark}** clear and
**[present]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [[requiring immediate
action]{.underline}]{.mark} or resolution. In the tradition of frame
analysis, advanced by David Snow and Robert Benford, or in the tradition
of William Sewell's "schemas" and Swidler's "tool kit", [[crisis
discourse provides]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[behavioral
rules]{.mark}]{.underline}** and linguistic structure, [[as well
as]{.mark} the repertoire of **[social and political
practices]{.mark}**]{.underline} that enables an agent or actor to act
upon structures to manifest transformation. Borrowing from Snow et al.
and Goffman, I define a frame as a, "'schemata of interpretation' [[that
enable **individuals** to]{.mark} 'locate, **[perceive]{.mark}**,
identify, and label']{.underline} occurrences within **[[their
life]{.underline}]{.mark}** space [**[and the world]{.mark}** at
large]{.underline}. By rending events or occurrences meaningful,
[[frames function to]{.mark} organize experience and **[guide
action]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Robert Entman adds that framing denotes
[the selection or emphasis on,]{.underline} ["some facets of events or
issues]{.underline} and making connections among them so as to [promote
a particular interpretation]{.underline}, evaluation and/or solution."
It is therefore necessary for prioritization. I define [crisis
discourse]{.underline} as characterized by 1) [the identification of a
threat as a hazard]{.underline} to the current state of affairs, or
existence of a group of individuals (i.e. community, state, or way of
life); 2) [[constructing a threat as the cause]{.underline}]{.mark}, or
existing as a critical part, of a given situation in which change is
impending and will significantly impact the future course of events; and
3) [the framing of a solution(s) in response to the threat]{.underline},
as a byproduct of the identification and construction of the threat.
This is particularly important when threats are clear or present
because, Daniel Kahneman and Jonathan Renshon note, [hawkish biases
[are]{.mark} more **[persuasive where conflict
is]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or perceived as being, more likely.
**[[Crisis discourse is critical]{.underline}]{.mark}** because
political culture, [[and its effects on **institutional decision
making**, are best exemplified by]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}** used to frame a threat. As Deva
Woodly notes, "[**[communication matters]{.mark}**, because [**changing
public discourse, changes power relations**, and]{.mark} altered power
relations change **[politics]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- the principles
and policy that are at stake in the struggle over who shall govern and
how." She add the "critical battleground" for change is political
discourse, where "[political issues take on popular meaning and affect
the common-sense understanding." [Discourse can, "advance particular
interests]{.mark} \[and\] [to actually change politics itself,]{.mark}
rewriting the common understandings present in the discursive field upon
which political possibilities are considered and wherein binding
decision are made.]{.underline}" As Holland notes, "9/11 generated a
discursive void as the events could not be subsumed into existing
foreign policy discourse. However, 9/11, in and of itself, was not a
crisis. Initially unregulated but discourse, the 'events' did not mean
anything for certain. Instead 9/11 became a crisis through a process of
discursive construction, which reinstated 'politics' over 'the
political.' Crises... are constructed."

2\. Securitization Theory and Biological Weapons

Securitization theory is a constructivist approach informing how certain
issues become framed through a security lens6 . It offers a useful
analytical framework for understanding how, why, and what issues come to
be viewed as security threats. Securitization is an active process
wherein a securitizing actor, in this case the American government,
presents and addresses an issue as an existential threat to a particular
group, or referent object7 . In these situations, emergency response
measures and extensive resource commitments are considered justified7 .
Securitization theory generally promotes desecuritization as preferable
because it avoids the negative consequences of securitization, including
a heavy-handed state response, reduced democratic accountability, and
the narrowing of public choice8 . However, [it also recognizes that
securitization is sometimes appropriate]{.underline}. [Recent
considerations of securitization theory identify three criteria that, if
fulfilled, justify securitization: an objective, **existential threat, a
referent object** whose protection promotes human well-being, **and a
response appropriately measured** to the particular threat]{.underline}6
.

[In the case of bioweapons securitization, the second criterion is less
controversial]{.underline}, given that the referent object is human
population; thus, [any harm to the referent object would directly reduce
a human well-being]{.underline}. However, the question of whether
securitization of biological weapons meets the other two criteria is
more contentious. Skeptics may point to Colin Powell's 2003 address to
the United Nations as a case where the biological weapons security
threat may have been exaggerated and securitization was promoted for
political ends, thereby calling into question the legitimacy of the
securitizing actor, the U.S. government. In his speech, Powell made the
case for an invasion of Iraq by claiming Iraq had capabilities to
produce biological weapons of mass destruction, including mobile
bioweapons labs, a claim that later turned out to be false9.

Critics also target the policies resulting from securitization, arguing
that the capacity of aggressors to carry out large scale attacks causing
mortality has been overestimated, calling into question whether an
existential threat truly exists and whether the response has been
appropriately measured10. Government funding may be seen as
unjustifiably skewed in favour of biodefense, defined as the capacity to
respond to a biological weapons attack, to the neglect of other key
areas, such as endemic and pandemic diseases. For instance, Klotz
calculated what is referred as the "likelihood-adjusted mortality" for
biological weapons, pandemic diseases, and endemic diseases by
multiplying the probability of occurrence by an estimate of mortality
were an event to occur11. By comparing these values with government
funding allocated to each category, he demonstrated that biodefense
receives more funding than its likelihood-adjusted mortality estimate
would suggest is warranted11 .

However, objections have been raised to this argument. [Supporters of
biodefense prioritization point to the fact that focusing solely on
potential fatalities ignores other issues, such as the negative social
and economic fallout from an attack]{.underline}12. Additionally, [they
point to the possibility that it is more expensive to combat intentional
threats, where there will be an explicit effort to circumvent current
practices by exploiting weaknesses]{.underline}12. It should also be
considered that the probability of one attack is not independent from
another, and that an increasing probability of success may elicit more
attempts12. To follow will be an examination of whether government
spending and policies constitute a justified response to the threat of
biological weapons. [Securitization is relevant in that it was a way for
decision-makers to implement the policies they want and is justifiable
to the extent that the programs themselves are necessary and
appropriate.]{.underline} Despite other consequences of securitization,
such as public fear, political manipulation, and a heavyhanded response,
which may give the impression of an overreaction, the reality is that
securitization was a means of enabling the implementation of certain
policies and programs necessary to respond to the threat of biological
weapons.

3\. Consequences of an Attack

[A government's decision to securitize an issue is a strategy to make
extreme responses seem justified, and it centers on the perceived
existential risk a threat poses to the population]{.underline}7 .
Beginning with a brief history of biological weapons use, this section
will aim to defend the framing of biological weapons use as an
existential threat by examining their E-International Relations ISSN
2053-8626 Page 2/10 Securitization Theory and Biological Weapons Written
by Patrick Saunders-Hastings ability to cause mortality or to generate
negative social and economic fallout. A brief discussion of the
potential catastrophic consequences of a smallpox attack will illustrate
the argument.

The use of [biological weapons dates back centuries. Examples include
the Tatars catapulting plague-infected corpses over city walls at the
siege of Kaffa in the 14th century, the deliberate triggering of a
smallpox epidemic among Native Americans]{.underline} via contaminated
blankets [in the 18th century during the French and Indian War, and the
contamination of salad bars with salmonella]{.underline} at a restaurant
in Oregon in the 20th century2 . However, with the development of the
germ theory during the 19th and into the 20th century, there was an
increase in scientific knowledge about biological weapons10. [States
became increasingly interested in such weapons, with Japan establishing
a bioweapons program between 1932-1945, the United States in 1942, and
the Soviet Union in 1973]{.underline}13 . In 1972, in response to
increasing concern about the threat of biological weapons[, the United
Nations proposed]{.underline} the Convention on the Prohibition of the
Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)
and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction , more commonly known as [the
Biological Weapons Convention (or BWC)]{.underline}14 . [The treaty came
into effect in 1975]{.underline}, and banned the development,
acquisition, and stockpiling of biological weapons1 . However, it failed
to halt the research and development of biological weapons, which have
continued into the 21st century.

Those who argue that government response to the biological weapons
threat has been overstated point to very low mortality in previous
attacks11. The anthrax attacks of 2001 in the United States, for
example, resulted in only 5 deaths15. This argument could be used to
urge governments to instead invest resources in areas that consistently
cause higher mortality, such as infectious diseases like AIDS or even
the seasonal flu. However, [in carrying out a threat assessment, it is
also important to look at the potential for mortality. Here it has been
suggested future attacks may not be on the same relatively small scale
as those in the past]{.underline}15. It is difficult to produce reliable
estimates of fatalities that might result from an attack; there is huge
variation in estimates and, often, little statistical evidence to
support the predictions11. [That said, it is agreed that, in theory,
even small amounts of a dangerous biological agent could cause
significant mortality if prepared and disseminated
effectively]{.underline}16. For instance, the WHO estimates that 50kg of
B. anthracis distributed upwind of a population of 500 000 would leave
95 000 people dead and 125 000 more incapacitated17. Other sources
suggest that 100kg of B. anthracis, disseminated via a crop-sprayer,
could kill as many as three million people, and comparable values have
been projected for other agents2,18. Another concern is that a
contagious biological agent will result in person-to-person
transmission, creating a self-sustaining effect not present in any other
weapons class10 .

[While mass casualties are possible, it is also important to note that,
even in situations with few casualties, biological weapons attacks may
have **profound social and economic ramifications**]{.underline}3 .
[Such attacks could lead to widespread social panic and disorder,
resulting in self-destructive behaviour and creating what is called a
"societal autoimmune effect" involving increases in crime and
looting]{.underline}19. While there is little evidence to predict this
would occur based on previous disaster situations (such as the terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001, where the public
reaction is described as effective and adaptive, rather than panicked
and disruptive), it must remain a consideration20. The effects of a
largescale attack involving biological weapons are unknown, and
epidemics of highly fatal diseases may cause serious social disruption20
.

[The economic consequences of biological weapons attacks are severe and
suggest that investing in defense makes good economic
sense]{.underline}. While there were only five deaths [in the 2001
anthrax attacks, those attacks resulted in tens of billions of dollars
in government spending]{.underline}21. Also, the financial sector may be
negatively impacted if investor confidence plummets3 . Similarly, [an
attack on the agricultural sector, which accounts for 15% of the United
States GDP, could have severe economic ramification]{.underline}s3 . If
[the biological agent being used is contagious, there could also be
implications for trade and travel restrictions]{.underline}3 . The SARS
epidemic of 2003 showed the economic consequences of a highly infectious
disease, essentially ~~"crippling~~"\[killing\] some of the most dynamic
cities in the world4 . [The Center for Biosecurity has estimated the
economic cost of a biological weapons attack in the U.S. could exceed
one trillion USD15]{.underline}. In short, there are social and economic
consequences that, considered in conjunction with the potential for
catastrophically high mortality, justify the framing of biological
weapons as a significant existential threat to the United States. This
is illustrated by considering the specific case of smallpox.

[The Variola virus,]{.underline} which causes smallpox, is an example of
an agent that, if [weaponized and used in an attack, would pose a
serious existential threat to the United States]{.underline}22. [It is
highly contagious]{.underline}; in a 1972 outbreak in Yugoslavia, even
with routine vaccinations, which are no longer carried out, the disease
spread rapidly, with each affected individual infecting 11 to 13
others23[. It is also lethal, with a 30% fatality rate]{.underline}1 .
Human populations are highly susceptible because, since eradication,
vaccinations have not been given for 20 years24. Other features make
smallpox an appealing option for bioterrorism: it has no treatment once
symptoms occur; it would not be detected for 7-17 days; it is physically
disfiguring; and the virus is stable in aerosol form1,24. Perhaps the
most problematic aspect of smallpox is that those infected are
contagious before symptoms appear. [Simulations have been carried out,
including a 1999 exercise by the Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies
at Johns Hopkins University, where a terrorist release of Variola virus
grew into a global outbreak, which the health and emergency response
system was unable to control]{.underline}22 . [Here it could be
suggested that prevention efforts promoted by securitization are the
only option, given the apparent inability to contain a global outbreak
after an attack has occurred.]{.underline} While the dangers posed by
the Variola virus are not contested, skeptics argue that it is too
difficult to acquire to be a real danger10. However, there is
significant concern over unaccounted Soviet Union smallpox samples, and
a 1999 U.S. report pointed to evidence that secret stockpiles of the
virus are held by North Korea, Russia, and Iraq1,25. It has also been
suggested that the terrorist organization Aum Shinrikyo holds quantities
of the Variola virus22 .

Threat and risk assessments should not rely solely on the worst-case
scenarios of biological weapons attacks, especially since practical
challenges still limit terrorists' ability to conduct attacks that will
have the greatest possible effect. However[, it is equally crucial to be
aware of the wide range of consequences of such an attack. This section
has argued that there could be serious ramifications on several
dimensions, **ramifications which justify the framing of biological
weapons as an existential threat** to the United States and warrant
investment in an appropriate response capacity. Securitization,
therefore, **played an important role encouraging policy responses that
were justified and appropriate.**]{.underline}

### 2AC -- AT: Securitizing structural violence bad

#### Securitization is [morally permissible]{.underline} if the threat is [objectively existential]{.underline} \-\-- proven by justified responses to white supremacy's existential risk

Jessica **Wolfendale 22**, professor of Philosophy at Marquette
University, 03/08/2022, "White Supremacy as an Existential Threat: A
Response to Rita Floyd's The Morality of Security: A Theory of Just
Securitization", European Journal of International Security /lg

Rita Floyd's The Morality of Security: A Theory of Just Securitization
is an important and insightful book that delineates a theory of just
securitisation (modified from the jus ad bellum and jus in bello
criteria in just war theory) involving three sets of principles
governing the just initiation of securitisation, just conduct of
securitisation, and just desecuritisation. This book is a much needed
addition to the security studies and just war
scholarship.[ ]{.underline}

[Here, [I explore]{.mark} the potential of Floyd's just [securitisation
theory]{.mark} (JST) [to provide insights into]{.mark} the moral
[justifiability of]{.mark} non-state groups that are not political
entities engaging in [resistance]{.mark} [against]{.mark} forms of
**[structural violence that pose an existential threat]{.mark}** to
those groups. [Using the case study of]{.mark} the Black Lives Matter
([BLM]{.mark}) movement [and the threat of white supremacy to African
Americans]{.mark} as an illustrative example, I argue that [structural
forms of violence can meet]{.mark} Floyd's [definition of an objective
existential threat, **justifying the resort to securitisation**]{.mark}
by groups such as BLM]{.underline}. As Floyd writes in chapter 5: 

non-state actors are permitted to \[securitize issues normally under the
state's jurisdiction\], and thus effectively defy the state, when states
fail to do their duty to protect against an objective existential threat
... this allows non-state actors to securitize against those unjust
regimes that pose objective existential threats to non-state groups
within states.38[ ]{.underline}

In section 1, I argue that Floyd's analysis of non-state groups leaves
open the possibility that loosely organised protest groups such as BLM
may constitute a non-state group for the purposes of applying Floyd's
just securitisation framework. In section 2, I argue that [[white
supremacy poses an **objective existential threat** to African
Americans]{.mark}, meeting the criterion of just cause in Floyd's JST.
The multilayered ways in which [white supremacy]{.mark} creates an
objective existential threat to African Americans [illustrates]{.mark}
the [potential of]{.mark} Floyd's [conception of an objective
existential threat to offer insights into]{.mark} the impact of [other
forms of structural violence, such as entrenched
sexism]{.mark}.]{.underline} In section 3, I show that, despite the
gains of the civil rights movement, the threat of white supremacy has
not been curtailed through legal reform or by democratic means. Thus,
groups like [[BLM]{.mark} may be [justified in resorting to
**extraordinary measures** to combat]{.mark} the ongoing threat of
[white supremacy, including]{.mark} 'whatever most reasonable persons
would agree constitutes exceptional means and actions ... non-state
[securitization]{.mark} can take the form of [secession, civil
disobedience,]{.mark} acts of [sabotage and
resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}.' 39 Applying Floyd's JST to the threat
of white supremacy thereby demonstrates the value of her approach for
thinking about securitisation outside the traditional foci of security
studies but, as I discuss in section 3, also reveals some limitations in
her theory, particularly in relation to the criterion of reasonable
chance of success when applied to non-state groups resisting an unjust
state.

1.  Does Black Lives Matter constitute a non-state group?

Floyd does not explicitly define the kinds of non-state groups that
could, in principle, engage in securitisation. On p. 61 she writes that,
according to Copenhagen School, 'sufficiently organized societal
groupings united by a strong enough "'we' identity" ... can revert to a
course of conduct that can only be described as securitization'. The
Copenhagen School included 'nations, religion and racial groups' 40 in
'societal groupings'. However, in a footnote, Floyd notes that many
security scholars now hold that 'other − smaller − non-state
securitizing actors than those who can cement a large enough we-feeling
are now a possibility', 41 suggesting that a shared identity is not
required in order for a non-state actor to engage in securitisation. But
it appears that Floyd agrees with the Copenhagen School that non-state
groups need to be 'sufficiently organized' to engage in securitisation,
although she does not define this term. 

In her book, Floyd discusses organised and relatively small groups such
as the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and Arizona Border Recon,42 but
does not discuss broad protest movements such as BLM. That said, there
are two reasons to think that BLM can fit her conception of a nonstate
group. Firstly, while some might object that the Black Lives Matter
movement does not have legitimate or representative authority to engage
in securitisation on behalf of African Americans, Floyd explicitly
rejects the criterion of representative authority in her theory of just
securitisation,43 and so BLM does not need to claim to represent (or be
viewed as representing) the interests of all African Americans in order
for it to constitute a non-state group for the purposes of applying her
framework.44 Secondly, while BLM is diverse in its strategies and has a
loose organisational structure, it supports and facilitates organised
action across the United States and elsewhere to protect the interests
of African Americans. As the BLM website states: 'Black Lives Matter
Global Network Foundation, Inc. is a global organization in the US, UK,
and Canada, whose mission is to eradicate white supremacy and build
local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by
the state and vigilantes.' 45 These factors are sufficient, I argue, for
BLM to constitute a non-state group for the purposes of evaluating the
possibility of just securitisation.

2\. Is white supremacy an existential threat to African
Americans?[ ]{.underline}

In Floyd's theory, [just initiation of [securitisation]{.mark} by a
non-state group [requires **a just cause**]{.mark}: '[an objective
existential threat]{.mark} to a referent object, that [is]{.mark} to say
[a danger that]{.mark} -- [with a **sufficiently high
probability**]{.mark} -- [threatens]{.mark} the [survival]{.mark} or the
essential character/properties of either a political or social order, an
ecosystem, a non-human species, or individual.]{.underline}' 46
Existential threats include 'all those things that threaten basic human
needs, which when met, enable humans to live minimally decent lives'. 47
Does white supremacy pose an existential threat to African Americans? 

The term 'white supremacy' does not simply refer to individuals' racist
beliefs. Rather, as Charles Mills explains, white supremacy 'is a
political system, a particular power structure of formal or informal
rule, socioeconomic privilege, and norms for the differential
distribution of material wealth and opportunities, benefits and burdens,
rights and duties'. [[48 In a system of white supremacy, whiteness
confers social, material, and political advantages on white-identified
people at the expense of]{.mark} the welfare and interests of [non-white
persons]{.mark}]{.underline}: 'From slavery, federal land grants ...
through differential access to education, job opportunities, white
markets, union membership, and equal wages and promotion chances to
ghettoization, restrictive covenants, redlining, white flights, and
differential allocation of resources to schools and neighborhoods,
whites have historically been materially advantaged over nonwhites,
particularly blacks.' 49 

[The concept of [white supremacy]{.mark} thus [captures]{.mark} [the
ways in which]{.mark} interconnected set of practices, [norms, and
institutions]{.mark} (social, legal, political) [privilege white
identity and negatively structure]{.mark} the [lives of]{.mark} African
Americans (and other [people of colour]{.mark}) regardless of the
specific intentions of the individuals involved]{.underline}. So
defined, white supremacy is embedded within multiple formal and informal
institutional and social structures that affect all aspects of life for
African Americans, including (but not limited to) the education system,
the criminal justice system, and the healthcare system.50 

[But [it is one thing to say that white supremacy systematically
disadvantages African Americans]{.mark}; [it is]{.mark} quite [another
to claim]{.mark} [that it poses an existential threat]{.mark} to African
Americans]{.underline}. Below, by applying Floyd's threat categories to
the examples of the criminal justice system and the healthcare system I
show that [[white supremacy creates agent-intended threats]{.mark}
('where an aggressor is at the source of the threat intent on
harming'),51 [agent-caused threats]{.mark} (where 'an actor's behaviour
leads to a threat to someone else ... without the actor intending to do
harm'),52 [and exacerbates the harm of agent-lacking
threats]{.mark}]{.underline} ('threats that occur irrespective of human
agency').53 [[The combined impact]{.mark} of these threats on the
ability of African Americans to live minimally decent lives [is]{.mark},
I argue, [sufficient to **meet the definition of an existential
threat.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
