Thanks to Rishi, Won, Saturn, Maikle, Rishi, Ana, Andrew, Justin, and
Seiji for all their hard work on this file.

This is the camp orientalism file!

Orientalism is a theory that first emerged in the 1700s but became most
popular after Edward Said published "Orientalism" in 1978. Orientalism
is a critique of representations, especially reps of the 'the orient'
(first originated as the middle east/Islamic communities but has evolved
to really anything excluded from the global west, think of it basically
as like any country that's not in NATO, typically represented or
characterized as backwards). The K is best read as a critique of western
centric discourse which the K argues endorses a process of 'othering'
which operates to create a separation between, basically, "the west and
the rest". Orientalism as a theory explains colonialism as the product
of excessive othering, where "the orient" is dominated by "the occident"
(western powers, opposite of the orient). In order to win, the most
important things for you to win is 1. a link that explains why the aff
upholds western outlooks of the world, endorsing a process of othering
that necessitates colonialism and 2. that their representations of "The
Orient" are incorrect (win this through impact defense).

As far as FW goes, there's 2 routes it can go. You can try and go for a
you link you lose method, where as long as you win they are western
centric and uphold orientalist outlooks on the word you should be good.
The better method, however, in my opinion, is to prefer an epistemology
shift, or retooling of rhetoric. I think this is good because it meshes
well with some of the alts and also follows the broader trend of the K,
which is largely a reps/discourse centered K. I also think that most of
the FW DAs can function as impacts and vice versa.

There's also a techno-orientalism version of the K. Techno-orientalism
as a theory is similar to normal orientalism in that it critiques
descriptions of the east (in this case, it's more specific to
East/Southeast asia) but instead of describing "The Orient" as
technologically backward, it critiques the fears of a rising Other. I
think this version of the K is pretty good especially since a lot of the
affs have China or at least tech related impacts, which means it
probably links to most of the affs. The k still revolves around the idea
that the Orient is subhuman but it also incorporates the Yellow Peril,
which is essentially extreme racialized violence against East/Southeast
Asians. A lot of the alts for this version of the K are encompassed
around a form of futurism, in which you use Asian culture (i.e poetics)
to imagine a better future (reading the ev in depth and doing some extra
reading will help you understand it better).

How to answer the K

The best way to beat this K is to win the "threats are real" and
"discourses don't shape reality" debate, at least the way this file is
structured you should be good to treat it like a security K. You could
also try and go for indicts of Said, the original author of orientalism,
but that might be a little harder since we didn't cut anything straight
from Said so the neg would probably be able to get around that easily.
However, there are a few good indicts of orientalism as a theory, not
just Saidean orientalism. There's also a few good alt fails cards that
talk about how a retooling of rhetoric isn't probably and that
western-centrism is inevitable and good. Some of these links are a
little weak and you could probably easily impact turn some of them (i.e
to a heg link you can just say heg good, that O/W). Like I said above,
it's a really FW heavy K so just winning case o/w will get you far
already.

#### We are living in the age of fear politics -- the war on terror ended years ago yet today's politicians still insist on the expansion of the western security state -- fear-mongering rhetoric like that of the 1ac serves the purpose of continuing the political project of collective political fear 

**Robin 11**(Corey Robin, 2011, "The Politics of Fear",
https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/22/the-politics-of-fear/)**//BRownRice**

In my 2004 book Fear: The History of a Political Idea, I argued that
"one day, the **[war on terrorism will come to an end]{.underline}**.
All wars do. And **[when it does, we will find ourselves still living in
fear: not of terrorism or radical Islam, but of the domestic rulers that
fear has left behind."]{.underline}** When I wrote "one day," I was
thinking decades, not years. I figured that the war on terror---less the
invasions, wars, torture, drone attacks, and assassinations than the
broader atmosphere of pervasive and militarized dread, what Hobbes
called "a tract of time, wherein the will to contend by battle is
sufficiently known" and an enemy is perceived as permanent and
irrepressible---would continue at least into the 2010s, if not the '20s.
Yet even before Osama bin Laden was killed and negotiations with the
Taliban had begun, **[[it was clear that the war on
terror]{.underline}]{.mark}**, understood in those terms,
**[[had]{.mark} [come to an end.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As early as the
2004 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate John Kerry had hinted
at such a possibility in an interview with Matt Bai in The New York
Times Magazine: When I asked Kerry what it would take for Americans to
feel safe again, he displayed a much less apocalyptic worldview. **["We
have to get back to the place we were, where terrorists are not the
focus of our lives]{.underline}**, but they're a nuisance," Kerry said.
"As a former law-enforcement person, I know we're never going to end
prostitution. We're never going to end illegal gambling. But we're going
to reduce it, organized crime, to a level where it isn't on the rise. It
isn't threatening people's lives every day, and fundamentally, it's
**[something that you continue to fight, but it's not threatening the
fabric of your life."]{.underline}** A Kinsley gaffe if ever there was
one, Kerry's comment may have helped seal his fate in that election.
Even so, it laid down a marker of what has essentially come to pass:
**[[Though]{.mark} the [wars in Iraq and Afghanistan go on,]{.mark}
though the United States continues to assassinate actual and suspected
terrorists throughout the Middle East and Central Asia, though [security
lines continue]{.mark} to snake around airport corners, the high-octane
[politics of fear we saw in the aftermath of 9/11 has,]{.mark} for all
intents and purposes, [dissipated]{.mark}. The threat of [terrorism is
no longer the focus]{.mark} of our days]{.underline}**---indeed,
probably hasn't been since 2006; **[it is instead a
nuisance]{.underline}**, something the government continues to fight but
not something threatening the fabric of our lives.
**[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as others in this symposium have noted,
**[the [political infrastructure of fear]{.mark}]{.underline}**---the
bureaucracies and institutions created in the wake of 9/11, the
profiling and practices of surveillance, the laws and enforcement
agencies---**[[survives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We still have a
Department of Homeland Security and a Patriot Act, Guantánamo is open
for service, and what my colleague Jeanne Theoharis calls "Guantánamo at
home"---the draconian policies and procedures, directed primarily at
Muslims and Arabs, in the federal prison system---has not been
scrutinized or even discussed. And all this, it hardly needs be said,
nearly three years into the Obama Administration. From these polar
realities---a **[thinning atmosphere of political fear, an [expanding
infrastructure of political fear]{.mark}]{.underline}**---I draw two
conclusions. **[First, the politics of fear is far less dependent upon
the actual psychic experience of the public than analysts would have us
think. While many believe that the individual emotions of the citizenry
propel the policies the government pursues, I see little evidence of
that. Even if we assume that each and every member of the public is
experiencing fear, that experience still doesn't explain the policies. A
frightened population could just as easily inspire the government to
pursue policies that would dampen rather than arouse fear. It is
politics that produces policies, not fear.]{.underline}** In any event,
the **[public's putative experience of fear cannot explain the
persistence]{.underline}**, indeed the enhancement, **[of the kind of
government policies]{.underline}** and practices **[we've
seen]{.underline}** in the last five years or so. A combination of
bureaucratic inertia and partisan interests, in which neither party has
much incentive to do anything on behalf of a persecuted minority---the
sorry stuff, in other words, of old-fashioned political
science---explains far more than do speculation and experiments in
social or cognitive psychology. **[Second, journalists and
scholars]{.underline}** too often **[assume]{.underline}** that the
**[public is united in its fear because the objects of
fear]{.underline}**---terrorism, radical Islam, and so on---**[are
equally threatening to each and every member of the
public]{.underline}**. But as Hobbes understood so well, men and women
do argue about political threats---whether they exist, whom they
threaten, whence they come, how to respond to them. They argue about
political threats for the same reason they argue about other political
matters: **[[Perceptions of harm]{.mark} are [dependent upon beliefs
about good and evil]{.mark}, justice and injustice, and experiences of
harm are mediated by material factors such as one's standing in the
world.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[it was this profoundly human penchant
to argue about [threats]{.mark} that [drove]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Hobbes to insist it was among the sovereign's most important duties to
simply decide, **[to [declare by fiat, whether a nation was]{.mark}
[threatened]{.mark} or not]{.underline}**---and that it was among the
subject's most important duties to allow the sovereign to make that
decision. **[Far from assuming that this right of the sovereign to
identify public threats would be easily accepted]{.underline}**,
however, Hobbes understood that it **[had to be defended through a
comprehensive effort of popular instruction---a project, judging by the
debates over national security that have punctuated American history
from its inception]{.underline}** (remember the Hartford Convention?),
in which few governments have ever succeeded. That **[[sovereigns have
to assert that]{.mark} [they are the deciders of our fears]{.mark}
testifies to the fact that [national security]{.mark} is [no more a
source of unity than Social Security]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As we've
seen over the last decade, **[[citizens]{.underline}]{.mark}** still
disagree about threats and how to respond to them, and they
**[[experience]{.mark} political [fear in different ways]{.mark}. A
Muslim or Arab citizen of the United States might well be more afraid of
government surveillance than of a terrorist attack. An unemployed
middle-aged woman may be more concerned about economic insecurity or
poverty than Al Qaeda. And even threats that do temporarily command the
public's attention seldom yield united responses beyond the very short
term. A [unity of fear]{.mark}, then]{.underline}**, is not an artifact
of mass psychology; it **[[is a political project, crafted
through]{.mark} leadership, [ideology]{.mark}, and collective
action.]{.underline}** Like many political projects, it often fails, or
at least does not fully succeed. And when it fails---dissenters question
whether we need be afraid, citizens cease to pay attention to "orange"
and "red" alerts, parties focus on other items of public
concern---governments either try to enlarge the infrastructure by
insulating it against the vagaries of public opinion, or dampen the
dissent. Again, old-fashioned politics. **[Since 9/11, we've gotten used
to the phrase "the politics of fear." It's high time we started taking
the politics part more seriously.]{.underline}**

#### **US-NATO security cooperation is a further perpetuation of the western military-security state, resulting in relentless racialization of "The Orient"**

**Amin-Khan 12**(Tariq Amin-Khan, 2012 New Orientalism, Securitisation
and the Western Media's Incendiary Racism,
[https://mascriticalrace.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/neworientalism.pdf)**//BRownRice**](https://mascriticalrace.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/neworientalism.pdf)//BRownRice)

**[The [Long War]{.mark} may be a war [against militant
Islam]{.mark},]{.underline}** but it is also against those
Muslim-majority states that do not accept the empire's diktats. An
analysis of the rise of militant Islam is beyond the scope of this
paper, but it is important to note that militant Islamist and Salafist
groups have become a powerful social force in many Muslim-majority
states and have violently confronted the post-colonial state in pursuit
of their dogmatic and narrow doctrinaire ideas. However, the **[current
resistance of militant Islam [against the USA and]{.mark} its
[NATO]{.mark} allies [cannot be seen as anti-imperialist]{.mark}, as the
objective of anti-imperialism is the social and economic liberation of
imperialised society---this seems contrary to the goals of militant
Islam.]{.underline}**49 **[US and NATO military
commanders]{.underline}** have **[[used fear in trying to
defeat]{.underline}]{.mark}** militant
**[[Islamists]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Reliance on this tactic remains,
even though it has been **[unsuccessful in instilling
fear]{.underline}** among Afghani and Iraqi Islamists---**[despite their
[dehumanised and brutalised treatment]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The Iraqi
prisoners in Abu Ghraib were subjected to this inhuman treatment, which
still continues with some modification in Guantanamo Bay, while the
**[USA and NATO take no responsibility for the [deaths of
unarmed]{.mark} innocent [children, women and men]{.mark} by their
militaries or by pilotless aerial drone attacks]{.underline}** in
Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen, among other Muslim-majority states.
WikiLeaks' release of footage showing a US military helicopter
deliberately targeting two unarmed Iraqi journalists working for
Reuters, along with other men and two children, is a poignant reminder
of how little the lives of the orientalised are valued.50 Similarly,
**[[Western politicians]{.mark} and the media have also [used]{.mark}
[fear to justify]{.mark} the increased [suppression]{.mark} of due
process, introduction of anti-terror laws, and [heightened use of
surveillance]{.mark} and intimidation in their respective states. The
invocation of fear during the Long War parallels the recent cold war
history. The [USA]{.mark} used fear---of the 'red menace'---to
[construct]{.mark} the [security state]{.mark} through the enactment of
the 1947 National Security Act that also created the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA).]{.underline}** Likewise, the fear of the
'Muslim terrorist' in late 2001 led to the enactment of the Patriot Act
and the **[US security state [propelled]{.mark} the notion of
[securitisation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which was **[universalised
[beyond]{.mark}]{.underline}** the borders of the
**[[USA]{.underline}]{.mark}** to Canada, the rest of the **[[Western
states]{.underline}]{.mark}** and to key **[[client post-colonial
states]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in order to **[[launch the war on
terror]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, as noted earlier, the **[current
era of securitisation is at a [historically]{.mark} [unique
moment]{.mark}. While it may [incorporate]{.mark} some old [Orientalist
tropes,]{.mark} and some ideological and imperialist motives may be
similar to those of the cold war period security state, there is little
relationship to the latter.]{.underline}** During the Cold War's
post-McCarthy era although the **[US security state guided its
militarism, fed the arms race]{.underline}** by strengthening the
military-- industrial complex, and **[[presided
over]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[[imperialist expansionism for world
hegemony]{.mark},]{.underline}** Western societies actually became more
open. Due process was generally respected, movements for civil rights,
women's liberation, gay rights and democratic change generally
blossomed, and anti-democratic practices and the high-handedness of
Western political leaders were broadly challenged. In **[its current
specificity the security state and securitisation have been enormously
strengthened by the suppression of dissent and civil liberties with the
corresponding expansion of anti-democratic practices and intrusive
surveillance within Western states.]{.underline}** Simultaneously
**[[xenophobia]{.underline}]{.mark}** and societal/ anti-Muslim racism
have been **[[fuelled by the Western media's incendiary racism]{.mark}.
The [USA and]{.mark} its [NATO]{.mark} allies have [persistently
violated]{.mark} the [sovereignty of]{.mark} many
[Muslim]{.mark}-majority [states]{.mark} at will, through aerial drone
attacks, intrusive surveillance and military
occupation.]{.underline}**51 This focus on militarisation and
securitisation has also **[allowed]{.underline}** the field of
**[security studies to proliferate]{.underline}**. Scholars in this
field appear to be on a self-fulfilling mission of promoting
securitisation, given the number of journal articles that are silent on
the invasiveness of surveillance and the antidemocratic character of
security regimes. A recent book by Stuart Croft, however, was expected
to provide critical intervention on security issues and
securitisation.52 It turns out that, despite Croft's desire to broaden
the discussion of identities within particular time and space, he ends
up essentialising identity without analysing power or the role of
dominant identities. He also **[does not examine [imperialist domination
and racialisation]{.mark}]{.underline}**; in effect he
**[reinforces]{.underline}** securitisation as **[social constructions
rooted]{.underline}** immemorially **[in history,]{.underline}** which
he claims have a mutual impact on both the 'Self' and the 'Other' (p
92). **[To treat the securitiser and the securitised as coterminous and
to contend that they are mutually affected by security regimes means
that there is no analysis of power or understanding of powerlessness and
racialisation.]{.underline}** Similarly, to claim as Croft does, that
the 'securitisation of Islam is not a unique event' as it is just
another social reconstruction among hundreds in history, albeit of a
different 'Other' (p 259), is to be unmindful of the colonial legacy and
the consequences of current imperialist forays in Muslim-majority
states, as well as to ignore the deep racism and xenophobia prevalent in
Europe and North America. Croft's ahistoricist views on the subject
allow him to maintain that, just because Catholics suffered during the
formation of Britain and the Irish through British imperialism, and that
the Dutch, Germans and Jews were targeted in Britain, it is now the turn
of Muslims to also join the throngs of oppressed people (pp 39--44, 74,
259)--- which is indeed a very disturbing rationale for the prevalence
and intensification of xenophobic oppression and violence in society.
This enables him to conveniently opt out of interrogating
securitisation, a field in which he is completely invested. In effect,
Croft's approach '**[[normalises']{.mark} the [securitisation of the
'Other']{.mark} as an uneventful ahistorical phenomenon. And the most
that he can then do is to undertake a proper post-structuralist textual
analysis of xenophobic writings against Muslims and Islam by British
'public intellectuals', politicians and religious leaders, and compare
them to the atrocities against the Catholics and the Irish or the
ridiculing of the Dutch---to further reinforce his historicist
approach]{.underline}** (see chapters 1, 5 and conclusion). The effect
of such an undertaking, while it recognises that securitisation creates
xenophobic responses from the dominant community, is to **[make a
mockery of due process for the securitised and to remain [inattentive on
how]{.mark} their [rights are consistently trampled by]{.mark} the
coercive arm of the [Western state]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But Croft is
not interested in challenging the notion of securitisation at the level
of the state; rather, he seeks merely to move beyond the Copenhagen
School of security studies to offer a theory of securitisation that is
more encompassing of identities, time and space (see pp 77--91). In
other words, he wants theory to account for the role of influential
non-state actors, and media and cultural elites, as well as the military
and the police (which are really part of the state's coercive arm) in
shaping the securitisation regimes (pp 70--85). Croft's penchant for
conceiving the development of the securitisation process as outside the
state (through the actions of individuals) is so overwhelming that he
dwells at length in his text on the **[notion of 'ontological
security']{.underline}**---the idea that the nature of the security of
the self is effectively a 'relationship between identity, narrative and
security', which is 'achieved \[almost reflexively\] through the
creation of a series of relationships performed through everyday
routines and practices' (p 17). But the nature of this type of framing
completely omits the role of the state and focuses mainly on his notion
of 'ontological security', which becomes a coping mechanism for the
individual to deal with the 'benefit' or the fallout from
securitisation. This approach therefore permits Croft to treat the
'Self' and the 'Other' as coeval, and to exclude the security state and
its securitisation policy from a critical gaze. I have argued here that
securitisation is a historically specific process, a post-cold war
phenomenon that emerged as the US model of the security state was
universalised in the aftermath of the September 11 events, and the
paradigm was emulated by all Western, and some key client Muslimmajority
states. Furthermore, I have also tried to show that racialisation is
deeply embedded in, and a concomitant part of, securitisation through
discussions on the niqab, sports, terrorism suspects, and incendiary
racism. To ignore racialisation as a process of dehumanisation and to
treat it merely as a form of 'othering' (an oxymoron that inoculates the
dominant group from absorbing the suffering of the 'Other') authorises
writers like Croft and others in his field of security studies to focus
on deepening securitisation without really problematising the role of
the **[[Western]{.mark} nation-state]{.underline}** and the media in the
**[ongoing [subjugation]{.mark} and xenophobic treatment [of racialised
communities]{.mark}. In addition to the dehumanised treatment of the
Muslim and people who 'look like Muslims' in European and North American
societies and by the US and NATO militaries, [racialised immigrants and
Muslims]{.mark} are [made scapegoats]{.mark} for Europe's social ills,
and are even [blamed for]{.mark} the continent's economic
[woes]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Journalists and writers---Mark Steyn,
Barbara Amiel, Melanie Phillips and Robert Spencer---have referred to
the 'demographic threat' of Muslims overwhelming Europe and other
Western countries in apocalyptic terms, and have even developed a new
term for their characterisation: 'Eurabia'.53 **[Given this attitude,
and as long as some of the incendiary racist media coverage peddles
anti-immigrant and antiMuslim vilification and fables about 'Eurabia',
hatred and the new Orientalism will eat away at European and North
American societies in the Long War era.]{.underline}**

#### **Western-centric political discourses like the 1ac fuel a process of constant othering, where "The Orient" is always depicted as subhuman and subjected to endless violence -- turns case**

**Garcia 19**(Paola Garcia, Sep 22, 2019, \"On Orientalism and the
Dehumanization of the Other,\" Inside Arabia,
https://insidearabia.com/on-orientalism-and-the-dehumanization-of-the-other/)**//BRownRice**

**[The [dehumanization of the "Other"]{.mark} is at the core of most of
humanity's tragedies]{.underline}**. It is **[[responsible for all
manner of violence]{.mark},]{.underline}** whether physical, spiritual,
or intellectual. Nationalism necessarily places one's culture as
superior to all others, making that which is culturally different
inferior and less human, rendering it at worst inert material to be
subjugated for one's benefit and at best a mere source of entertainment.
We live in a time plagued by these issues. **[We are encountering
[terrifying ideologies and politics]{.mark} that are [racist to their
core]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We are dealing with the resurgence of
fascism, neo-Nazism, white supremacism, institutionally endorsed racial,
sexual and gender discrimination, walls, apartheids, anti-immigrant
laws, and it goes on and on. **[These [catastrophes]{.mark} all [stem
from "othering,"]{.mark} that is, from thinking that those who are
different from us are inferior and threatening by
default.]{.underline}** **[Behind the othering lens, there is little
room to acknowledge the humanity inherent in every single culture and
individual.]{.underline}** The Quran fittingly states, "We have . . .
made you into nations and tribes, so that you might come to know one
another."\[2\] Citing scripture carries the risk of being perceived as
irrational and unaware of what is appropriate in intellectual discourse.
However, if we disregard the source and focus on the idea itself, we
will find it extremely pertinent to the discussion. The notion of
knowing one another is crucial because it implies a relationship of
equals. It assumes the existence of a common denominator between them:
humanity. This understanding appears, regrettably, to be lacking in
today's world. In Timothy Mitchell's excellent book, Colonizing Egypt,
**[we learn that "We" have been attempting to know not each other, but
the "Other," the lesser object of our exploitative designs. This "We"
can stand for any individual, discipline, institution or nation that
systematically [views cultures other than its own as inferior
and]{.mark} often, even [subhuman]{.mark}, a view which nationalism
tends to produce and promote]{.underline}**. In the United States, we
presently have a president who unapologetically brags about his racist
views and boasts about the supposed inferiority of cultures different
from his own. This tragically deranged man has fought and continues to
fight tooth and nail to have these chauvinistic views implemented as the
laws of our land: travel bans for Muslims, a wall to keep "threatening
intruders" away, racial slurs turned into political slogans, immigrants
in cages, children dying in detention centers, away from their parents,
etc. The appalling examples abound. **[[In the Trump era,
xenophobia]{.mark}, narcissism, and anger have become [normalized
and]{.mark} even [glorified]{.mark}, seen as an effective means to make
our country "great."]{.underline}** In the Trump era, xenophobia,
narcissism, and anger have become normalized and even glorified, seen as
an effective means to make our country "great." The situation is
heartbreaking, and only by reflecting and fixing our hearts about how
each of us sees "others" can we begin to veer from the destructive path
we are on. Professor Edward Said 1935 2003 Professor Edward Said
(1935-2003) This type of bigotry has its counterpart in the intellectual
world. As Edward Said articulately explains in Identity, Authority and
Freedom: "**[If the authority granted our own culture carries with it
the authority to perpetuate cultural hostility, then a true academic
freedom is very much at risk, having as it were conceded that
intellectual discourse must worship at the altar of national identity
and thereby denigrate or diminish others]{.underline}**."\[3\] Said, who
had several conflicting identities, including Palestinian, American, and
academic, asserted that he found it impossible to identify with the
"triumphalism of one identity because the loss and deprivation of the
others are so much more urgent." Similarly, citing Said, Nora Akawi
explains that **["'[to make the practice of intellectual discourse
dependent on conformity to a predetermined political ideology']{.mark}
or predetermined canon of learning, western or other . . . '[is to
nullify intellect altogether]{.mark}.'"]{.underline}**\[4\] **[And this
is what has happened in much of our learning about "other" cultures,
learning which [promotes]{.mark} the [views]{.mark} [that lead to
today's devastating politics]{.mark}. "We" have "triumphed" in defining
"our" culture as superior and this gives "us" the right to look down at
whatever "we" want, in whatever form "we" want and for whatever purpose
"we" deem worthy. This triumph has come at a great loss.]{.underline}**
The price of excluding all the others is actual poverty of the spirit,
allowing us to keep only "dust", projections, and imaginings that stand
in for reality. The price of excluding all the others is actual poverty
of the spirit, allowing us to keep only "dust"\[5\], projections, and
imaginings that stand in for reality: "'Think of it no more!' wrote
Nerval to Théophile Gautier, of the Cairo they had dreamed of
describing. That Cairo lies beneath the ashes and dirt, . . . dust-laden
and dumb.' Nothing encountered in those Oriental streets quite matched
up to the reality they had seen represented in Paris. Not even the cafés
looked genuine. 'I really wanted to set the scene for you here', Nerval
explained, in an attempt to describe the typical Cairene street, 'but .
. . it is only in Paris that one finds cafés so Oriental.\[6\]'" The
reality for these "travelers" was the French representation of the
"Orient." Anything else, was unacceptable. The Orient itself, in this
case, Cairo, appeared to them completely chaotic, incomprehensible,
disappointing. The "Orient" they found existed outside of their "world
of exhibition," lacked "genuine" cafes, and was empty of most of what
they expected to encounter. The "Orient" Europe had produced was a much
better "Orient" than the one inhabited by other (lesser) types of human
beings. They desperately wanted foreign countries to mirror the "Orient"
they had brought with them. But, to their disillusionment, this foreign,
non-European "Orient" would reflect everything but the image embedded in
their imagination. This foreign "Orient" seemed to have nothing to do
with their manageable, easily representable, homegrown "Orient." Later,
colonialists attempted to force and forge their "Orient" into being, in
the European mold of "order" and "progress" that, in their view, should
reign globally. The alleged preeminence of western culture and
Euro-American supremacism are promoted and exported all over the globe,
unconsciously accepted by many everywhere as the truth. **[Although most
cultures have engaged in some form of othering throughout history, in
western modernity and post-modernity, [othering]{.mark} has been [taken
to an unprecedented level,]{.mark} with the most [atrocious
consequences: genocides, apartheids]{.mark}, all forms of
[colonialism]{.mark}, the [destruction of]{.mark} native peoples and
[cultures]{.mark}, atomic [bombs]{.mark}, nuclear [weapons, etc.]{.mark}
The [alleged preeminence of western]{.mark} culture and Euro-American
[supremacism]{.mark} are promoted and [exported all over the
globe]{.mark}, unconsciously accepted by many everywhere as the truth.
It takes, however, little awareness to realize that these supposedly
superior cultures are built, to a lesser or greater degree, primarily on
the edifice of an overarching underlying value: pure material progress
at the expense of ethics and human values. In other words, the chief
value of our time and culture is the worship of material wealth above
all else. This "theology of progress" makes us believe that unbounded
economic and material prosperity is the ultimate aspiration of human
beings, and what will make one "happy."]{.underline}** This "theology of
progress" makes us believe that unbounded economic and material
prosperity is the ultimate aspiration of human beings, and what will
make one "happy." In reality, it leaves people spiritually bankrupt,
mentally and emotionally sick, willing to do pretty much anything,
including poison their own people (the food industry/medical industry
mafias), for profit. These are values that come directly from our
western liberalism and monstrous form of capitalism and which, sadly,
most of the world is striving to adopt. It is, therefore, **[worth
approaching the issue of "[Orientalism]{.mark}" as just [another
expression of "Othering]{.mark}," a toxic and [inhumane
perspective]{.mark} on the differences that in actuality make our

races, cultures, languages and heritage, [society will]{.mark} wither
and [die. Diversity is]{.mark} the mother of creativity and expansion,
it is [to be valued]{.mark} and encouraged. The mark of a great society
is its ability to embrace others, cultivate their uniqueness, and mold
their contributions into a sacred wholeness. The "others" are Us, the

Far from being an expert in China or East Asia, 16 I read Peters'
article through my own work that, in part, centers on critical
theories/pedagogies, and comparative and international education (CIE).
[[Through critical pedagogical lenses]{.underline}]{.mark}, I see
Peters' overall argument as [calling for [**(re-)reading** the politics
of]{.mark} the **'[threat']{.mark}**[, question]{.mark}ing [if it
emerges from]{.mark} [(neo)coloniality and epistemologies of the
North]{.mark}.]{.underline} Peters details a [[histography of
sociopolitical]{.mark} [delegitimization on]{.mark} how non-western
[othering has encouraged]{.mark} Western assimilation and the [need to
disrupt the politics of Western supremacy. **Comparative work is
essential** here]{.mark}]{.underline}, but comparative fields inherently
form contested terrains. CIE work becomes problematic when
non-contextually positioning one educational system as 'best' for all
others to blindly assimilate to. Opposingly, critical CIE is crucial for
better understanding the commonalities and differences between
educational systems to allow for true contextual lending and borrowing.
Two important notations need to be given. First, critically reading the
world is largely comparing what we 'know' with new knowledges, so such
comparative problematizing the self's ingenuous knowledges is also
needed beyond the professionalized CIE field. This includes critically
reading our own comparisons guided by Western benchmarking. Second,
'education' here is beyond schooling to include non-formal and informal
models (e.g. public pedagogy through Hastie's comparisons with Nazism).
Largely avoiding giving explicit self-analysis, [[Peters calls]{.mark}
on readers [to reflect upon what]{.mark} [needs to be **(un)learned**
from hidden curricula of Western supremacy]{.mark}. I read
[Peters]{.mark}' article through the lenses of Said's (1979) Orientalism
and Boaventura de Sousa Santos (2016, 2018) [calls to **counter
epistemologies** of the North's dominance and **resulting
oppressions**]{.mark}. As such, Peters critiques [West]{.mark}ern
policymaking to thwart 'threats' of [los]{.mark}ing [global hegemony
through de-Orientalization and dethroning epistemologies of the
North]{.mark}.]{.underline} I see two [[conundrums]{.mark} which [are
difficult but not impossible to overcome through teaching for critical
literacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} First, [such [reflectivity is
meaningless]{.mark} and without transformative praxis if
[epistemological dominance is not]{.mark} critically
[problematized]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hidden curricula of untethered
Western supremacy without contextuality that Peters argues hardens the
difficulty of its disruption, but also amplifies its necessity. [For
example, this coincides with my article on being a self-defined Freirean
scholar in China in which I problematize both Western-centric rubrics of
'quality' academics and how, ironically, [Western]{.mark}
[academics]{.mark} too-often [do not **critically compare themselves**
within their self-legitimized rubrics]{.mark}]{.underline} (see
Misiaszek, 2018). The second conundrum I see is the perceived 'threat'
of a global paradigm shift of epistemologies of the North eastward and
thus Orientalism is disrupted, not by ceasing epistemological dominance
but rather shifting them eastward. [Two issues come to mind here. One is
de Sousa Santos' framing the grounding of epistemologies of the North
with **coloniality, patriarchy, and capitalism**. Peters argues China's
lack of histories of being the colonizer and China is 'becom\[ing\] a
vast and encompassing global capitalist power' but not the Western
perception of a 'capitalism and liberal democracy \[a\]s a holy
combination'.]{.underline} [Second, [epistemologies of the South should
not replace Northern epistemological dominance, but rather]{.mark} exist
to [**counter them for teaching**,]{.mark} learning and decision-making
through ecologies of knowing (Santos, 2018). Without question, [global
**epistemological shifts will occur**, but their]{.mark} processes and
emergent [outcomes should be read]{.mark} as
[possibilities]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than fatalistically
determined already. Not writing in a fatalistic manner, [[Peters'
leaves]{.mark} open the [possibilities for]{.mark} these upcoming shifts
by [learning from]{.mark} the [politics of supremacy]{.mark} and
dominance [to **avoid global oppressions** and **planetary
unsustainability**]{.mark} from continuing/reoccurring. Unfortunately,
if we learn or not is questionable.]{.underline}

#### International intervention of the west into the east is justified by orientalism-it metaphysically separates the west and the east causing not only western intervention and wars, but also terrorist sentiments in the east. Recognition of orientalism is the first step to change

Imaan **Zia** **19**\[Imaan Zia, Mass Communication graduate from NUST,
\"Orientalism and its International Implications\",4-26-2019, Voice of
Balochistan,
https://voiceofbalochistan.pk/culture/orientalism-and-its-international-implications/,
1LEE\]

In its initial stages **[[orientalism was justification of the West's
domination of the East]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Colonialism **[created a
legitimizing ideology of their own to rationalize their hold over the
East]{.underline}**. Therefore, one may say that **[colonialism created
orientalism]{.underline}**. Orientalism is about the West asserting its
power over the East. **[[It is a form of erasure, silencing and
over-simplification of the Eastern and Islamic culture internationally
by blending all of its subcultures, so that it can only be perceived
through the Western lens.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

There's also plenty of evidence to prove that **[[orientalism effects
international politics and policy-making.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
According to Oxford Analytica, an independent strategic-consulting firm,
since **[[orientalism forms the basis of interaction between the West
and East, it affects the Western politicians' perception of any
population they think is "oriental"]{.underline}]{.mark}** and vice
versa.

It **[presents [the Orient as passive and incapable of
self-representation]{.mark}, mostly because it observes it from an
external point of view rather than a realistic
understanding]{.underline}**. According to a 2015 research paper written
at the University of Cologne, Germany, **[[Orientalism is an act of
"metaphysical segregation" of the West and East]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Simply put, it **[[creates]{.mark} clear [distinctions between the West
and East]{.mark} in a way [that puts them on opposite ends of a
spectrum]{.mark}]{.underline}**; the **[[West being the
superior]{.underline}]{.mark}** one. This promotes an Us versus Them
ideology; the **[Occident versus the Orient.]{.underline}**

This same ideology, derived from Orientalism, is more often than not,
**[[used as justification for when the West interfere in matter of the
East]{.underline}]{.mark}**. An example is the **[US,]{.underline}** who
have given some **[variation of the same idea every time they've needed
to justify their invasion of Iraq, their bombings in Syria and Yemen,
and even their policies regarding the East]{.underline}** like Trump's
"Travel" Ban that targets travellers exclusively from Muslim states.

According to Oxford Analytica, another argument is also **[[that
terrorist ideologies originating in the East are]{.mark} also [derived
from colonial-era legacies]{.mark} i]{.underline}**.e. the idea that
**[[the West is culturally and morally superior to the East stimulates
anti-west sentiments in the East.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The **[West needs to acknowledge and challenge these primitive ideas and
concepts regarding the East]{.underline}**. They need to develop an
improved and more inclusive understanding of non-western societies
without falling into their paternalistic and restrictive mindsets.
Acknowledging this gap and trying to account for it can help alleviate
resentment on all sides.

**[Diminishing these colonial influences [will require an
inter-generational effort to change attitudes and
behaviors.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The **[[first step]{.mark} however,
[is the recognition of these influences.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Orientalism cannot be reduced to just an academic and intellectual
misunderstanding. **[[It has to be recognized as an intellectual
weapon]{.mark} that provokes conflict between the West and
East.]{.underline}** Once recognition sets in, **[[efforts to alter the
resulting attitudes and behaviors can be
continued.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Orientalism continues in the modern era-the characterization of India as uncivil and non-progressive within covid 19 reports made by the west proves that the weaponization of distinction still exists-even native writers proliferate this due to orientalist subjugation and infantilization embedded in the narrative

The **[[reordering of global power relations]{.underline}]{.mark}** with
the emergence of the East has begun to **[[alter the West's imagination,
narratives and processes of self-identification.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
One discernible and strengthening trend arising from this changing
political landscape is the increasing deployment of **[reductive
stereotypes]{.underline}** in the Western media**[[, reminiscent of the
colonial era]{.mark}]{.underline}** when **[the West appropriated to
itself the]{.underline}** **[["burden of civilising the
savage]{.underline}]{.mark}**" East.

This effort to devalue, deplore and defame the East is **[[now a
recurrent theme]{.underline}]{.mark}** and, perhaps, is an attempt to
define oneself as distinct from the "other" in these troubled times.
More insidiously, it is [also **[deployed as]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[a method of control]{.mark} and as a projection [of a superior
agency]{.mark}]{.underline}** for achieving definitive economic and
political goals. Simply put, the West seeks to tower above all by
diminishing the East.

With its **[increasing economic influence]{.underline}** (the pandemic
notwithstanding), igreater presence in world affairs, and an emerging
and louder identity (wth passionate supporters and detractors),
**[[India's actions]{.mark} and policies [have come under]{.mark} close
and often [critical scrutiny]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in powerful]{.mark}
sections of the liberal media in the Atlantic system. This, by itself,
is both natural and unsurprising.

What is disturbing is the near universal, **[[vicious]{.mark} and
negative [portrayal]{.mark}]{.underline}** of **[[a land that is proud
of its democratic politics]{.underline}]{.mark}** (just as many other
nations are), [with]{.mark} a loud, disruptive and often **[aggressive
media]{.underline}**, and **[[mobilisations led by
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} have toppled
governments and, sometimes[, **[catalysed perverse
outcomes]{.underline}**]{.mark}. It is a far from perfect, largely
low-income country, with its fragilities debated with gusto at home and
judged at the hustings repeatedly. What is curious about the naked
aggression of the liberal Western media is [its **[visible
conflation]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[of]{.mark} the [domestic
debates]{.mark} of [their]{.mark} [land with those in foreign
land]{.mark}s]{.underline}**; their sense of loss of their old place and
space and the externalisation of grievance onto the "outsider"; and,
[their **[weaponisation of differences]{.underline}**]{.mark} in much
the same manner as their far Right counterparts.

Many a time, this "reduced" portrayal of India or other lands may be
just journalistic or editorial carelessness. When it does happen**[, [it
must be called ou]{.mark}t]{.underline}** and now is a good time to
engage with this trend. The distasteful grammar, and gloomy imagery that
dominates Western coverage on India says less about the country under
the scanner and more about the malaise within media organisations as
they move from editorial and ownership structures of the past to the
digital and decentralised realities of today. The ugly underbelly of a
section of the media continues to reveal itself as it engages with India
and its efforts in coping with the Covid-19 pandemic.

Over the last two months, organisations such as the BBC, the Atlantic ,
the Washington Post and the New York Times, among others, have run
series of **[reductive [commentaries]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the state of
[India's]{.mark} preparedness and its [capacity to deal with the
Covid-19 pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If we are being honest, they
are being biased and blasé about it.

From alarmist commentaries (one report hypothesised that half of India
could be infected!) and ridiculing the capacity and agency of the
government, to deriving vicarious delight by focusing on well-known
social inequities, their **[reporting has been ["misery
porn]{.mark}]{.underline}**" with the spotlight being **[[on India's
vulnerabilities and shortcomings in the fight against the
pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These are embellished through a
cleverly selected presentation of events and facts; compelling images of
poverty, denial, and deprivation; and, an overdose of virtue
showboating.

The **[[recurring portrayal of marginalised
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}** and migrants lacking economic,
social, and political agency is presented **[[as distinct
from]{.underline}]{.mark}** the values of **[esteem, equality and
harmony,]{.underline}** which form the **[bedrock of [a "civilised"
society]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This narrative **[deliberately ignores
the universal acceptance of these "ideals]{.underline}**" to meet its
singular objective --- the perpetuation of a needless discourse of
discord instead of a more worthwhile debate on the failure of
globalisation and the extant economic models, something which is on
stark display around the world.

This media narrative on India is perhaps not meant to only highlight
inequality within the country because inequality is all prevalent around
the world, more dazzlingly so in the West. It appears to be **[[an
attempt to distance a country and its mainstream from the
civilised]{.mark} "self]{.underline}**" which resides in the moral and
emancipated world of publishers, editors and reporters. India and its
large population are being **[painted as the proverbial
"other]{.underline}**" even as New York, the beacon of Western
civilisation, is being scorched by the scourge.

Incidentally, and expectedly, many of these **[[reports have been penned
by native authors]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This old trick affords
plausible deniability to the publications against any allegations of
White bias or racism, which is still resplendent in each of these
reports. Nobel Laureate professor Amartya Sen and renowned
pan-Africanist and political philosopher Frantz **[Fanon have argued how
centuries of [colonial subjugation and cultural infantalisation]{.mark}
have [left deep imprints on the self-image of the
colonised]{.mark},]{.underline}** with the **[natives]{.underline}**
often **[viewing themselves]{.underline}** and their cultures
**[through]{.underline}** the **[coloniser's prism of
prejudice.]{.underline}** This phenomenon is one of colonialism's most
dehumanising byproducts and has now achieved viral potency alongside the
pandemic.

Literary critic and linguist Namvar Singh, in his essay Decolonising the
Indian Mind, alluded to this desperate **[[urge that resides within
Indian English-language]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[writers to be
accepted]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and understood by Western
audiences]{.underline}** as being part of their own identity continuum.
The absurdity of the writings are, therefore, astounding. Just how
absurd can be guessed from the assertion that a country with a per
capita income of \$2,000 must have the governance infrastructure and
attributes similar to those with multiple times the resources and
capacity --- the leitmotif of much that is published on India. What is
often forgotten in the "one village" discourse perpetuated by this class
is that this village never was and never will be. This pandemic is the
story of "millions of villages" seeking their own salvation as the
"global ethic" promoted by the liberal media was the first victim of,
and culprit-in-chief for, the pandemic and its heavy toll.

For a nation the size of a continent with many inherent challenges,
India's response has been bold and feeble at the same time, just as it
has been universal and differentiated. While states such as Kerala and
some others appear to have contained the crises well, other states with
more complex and complicated politics are battling to keep this virus in
check. There are shortcomings galore but most importantly, there is
resolute intent across society and politics to fight the pandemic**[.
States are adopting different models]{.underline}** --- unique to their
local situation --- drawing heavily from aspects as diverse as their
specific cultural practices, topography, information systems and
technology, along with government intervention.

Arguably, some states in India have outperformed some of the developed
nations. A fair and balanced reportage should have presented these
myriad experiences in combating the novel coronavirus, rather than just
those narratives that build stereotypes and biases. In fact, the odd
positive story out of India has the focused objective of establishing
chaos and disorder as the norm --- the outlier province with West-like
predisposition, the snake-charmer and the bazaar magician, the bandar
and the bandarlog, and other such notions lurk among words and between
lines. This is reminiscent of the debates in 19th-century Britain with
its praise of some quaint developments in India and its resolute
determination to tame the East.

Celebrated political thinker Edward **[[Said]{.mark} [situated]{.mark}
this impulse [in the colonial domination]{.mark} of the [non-West by the
West]{.mark},]{.underline}** and the attendant perceptions of
superiority that accompanied such domination. He argued that [the
**[West was able to manage]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and even produce[,
**[the non-West]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[by projecting itself
as]{.mark} progressive, rational, [civil]{.mark} and humanistic [as
opposed to the non-West]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This reductive narrative
was a purposeful one, created to morally justify the colonial enterprise
and legitimise the civilising mission which was the "White man's
burden".

[This **[civilising purpose]{.underline}**]{.mark} perpetuated through
literature, popular culture and politics for over two centuries has not
only informed and influenced the trajectory of colonial politics and
popular Western imagination, but **[[has]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[also
[become embedded]{.mark} as the indisputable truth[, forever colouring
Western understanding of the Orient.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Starting with James Mill's influential History of British India (1817)
to Katherine Mayo's Mother India (1927), diminished narratives on native
agency, Professor Amartya Sen argues, have informed the views of
generations of the Western intellectual and political elite, from
Alexander Duff to Theodore Roosevelt and beyond. Works such as Rudyard
Kipling's White Man's Burden, whom George Orwell called the "prophet of
British Imperialism", are considered reflective of this seemingly benign
ethnocentric trajectory of colonial discourse.

French Jewish thinker Emmanuel Levinas traces this bias to the West's
philosophical bearing, where identity is sought in the indurate logic of
the self, rather than the expression of self in relation to difference.
This predisposition manifests in a skewed representation of non-Western
experiences. It is the cornerstone of the age-old identity debates that
have troubled and defined human interactions. The sense of ["**[Us
versus Them]{.underline}**]{.mark}**["]{.underline}**, [or **[our
superior agency versus theirs]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}**
**[[proliferates the reports around Covid-19]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
articles in the New York Times deploy a lack of empathy to create the
"identity distance". The Atlantic deploys lack of agency as a missing
virtue, and social inequity defines the coverage of the BBC and the
Washington Post in this instance. Unfortunately, the pandemic has a
different tale to narrate.

A study of infection patterns in New York, for instance, presents vivid
glimpses of elite depredations. The Black and marginalised communities
have been significantly more affected than the rest, with one report
assessing that Black Americans were thrice as likely to die from the
infection than their White compatriots. The virus has indubitably driven
a wedge between the economic haves and have-nots in the US, with
significantly higher than average infections and deaths even among
caregivers, who are people of colour, than their White counterparts.
This isn't very different from the Indian experience where the more
impoverished are facing the fury of the pandemic.

Universally, and without exception, catastrophic events such as the
raging pandemic tend to disproportionately affect the economically and
socially marginalised more. In India, struggling migrants seek a path
back to their hamlets. In the US, the rich and powerful escape to the
Hamptons. This is an identity discourse of another variety that poses
the same question for all humanity on the form and format of our
economic agenda and priorities.

Colonial biases and stereotypes form an intractable part of the Western
subconscious. However, the representation also needs to be viewed within
a grander scheme. Beyond the articulation of the reductive occidental
logic, it [also **[offers a convenient moment for some to mobilise the
newly dispossessed intelligentsia]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[against the
new nationalist urge that is shaping India's political and economic
discourse.]{.underline}**

The story of the media reportage on India's response to Covid-19 is,
perhaps, not about the country's efforts and its successes and failures.
I**[t is [a narrative of perverse politics]{.mark} where the
increasingly under threat elite opinion makers]{.underline}** --- the
**[[post-colonial custodians of virtue]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- are
expressing (through their media) their contempt for those who do not see
their path as either divine or preordained. This is political coverage,
not one on the pandemic, [and **[it has been]{.underline}** **[scripted
with the ink of exclusion.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

#### Discourse shapes the hegemonic power relations that enable gendered and Orientalist hierarchies that construct the way we perceive and construct meaning on Others

**Khalid 17** (Maryam Khalid \| *Gender, Orientalism, and the 'War on
Terror': Representation, Discourse, and Intervention in Global Politics*
pg 4-6 \| DOA: 7/16/2022 \| SAoki)

**[Understanding how [gendered and orientalist]{.mark} categories and
[identities 'work' in i]{.mark}]{.underline}**nternational
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**elations **[entails exploring the
relationship [between power, discourses, and
representation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Rather than attempting to uncover
'what is out there' (that is, rejecting the idea that 'reality' is
something that is knowable), **[this research is focused on the politics
of knowledge, on questioning [the emergence of categories]{.mark} such
[as 'barbaric', 'oppressed', 'civilised', 'free']{.mark}]{.underline}**
(to name a few), **[[and how they work to produce and sustain knowledge
about 'us' and 'them', making]{.mark}]{.underline}** specific courses of
action such as **[[military intervention]{.mark} possible and
[legitimate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The theoretical framework for this
analysis is poststructural, and informs the 'analytical strategy' that
guides my research and analysis in this book. My research is concerned
with how **[[gendered and orientalist]{.mark} [categories are utilised
in ways that necessitate military intervention through the construction
of an enemy]{.mark} (and thus creating a 'Self' in reference to this
enemy)]{.underline}**. I argue that **[this is done [by
exploiting]{.mark} long-held [assumptions]{.mark} about race/ethnicity
and gender, [such as]{.mark} the naturalness of [ascribing 'feminine'
traits like sensitivity, weakness, and emotionality to 'women', and
'Othered' traits such as irrationality, lack of development, and]{.mark}
a lack of [civilisation to non-'Western'
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Subscribing to an understanding
of discourse that is poststructural in its commitment to the
constructedness of knowledge, I argue [that **[language is a
not]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[simply a [neutral medium]{.mark} used [to
convey 'facts']{.mark} or pre-existing meaning]{.underline}**.
**[Instead]{.underline}**, I **[view [discourse]{.mark} as a
'[structured, relational totality']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Doty 1996, 6)
**[in [which language]{.mark} (writing, [speech]{.mark}, pictures, any
system of signification that represents our ideas in a way that allows
others to 'read' meaning) [is not simply used to 'communicate
information']{.mark}]{.underline}** (carrying meaning that we intend to
project), **[[but is the site of the]{.mark} [creation of meaning
and]{.mark} implicated in the [establishment of the 'regimes of
knowledge and truth']{.mark}]{.underline}** [(]{.mark}Gee 1999, 1;
Shaprio 1985--1986, 193--194). Language is not an objective means
through which we interpret the world, conveying predetermined, natural,
or neutral 'meanings' which exist a priori and are intrinsic to things,
events, people, or groups. Rather, as Terrell Carver argues, **[language
has 'meaning only in virtue of our inscribing it there'; it is [used to
inscribe meanings]{.mark} onto the world, objects, and experiences, [and
to read 'those meanings back]{.mark} to ourselves as if they had always
resided in the objects or experiences']{.underline}** (2002, 50). This
approach most closely reflects my research concerns, in particular for
**[exploring the construction of identity in terms of discourse, and the
role of power in discursive identities]{.underline}** (Torfing 1999,
90--91, 96). That is not to say that this poststructuralist
understanding of discourse conceives of **[[objects, events, and
people]{.mark}]{.underline}** as 'not existing' outside discourse:
rather, it asserts that they **[[have no meaning and are
incomprehensible]{.mark} to us [without language and discourse as
interpretive tools]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Campbell 1992, 6).
**[[Discourses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in this understanding, **[are
ways of [construct]{.mark}ing [knowledge]{.mark},]{.underline}** and of
referring to knowledge, about particular topics. They are groups of
ideas, images, and practices that are relational (they all refer to
another in some way), providing us with ways of talking about, knowledge
about, and conduct associated with particular topics, events,
activities, or institutions (Hall 1997, 6). As such, **[they are
'practices that systematically form the objects of which they
speak']{.underline}** (Foucault 1972, 54). These 'discursive formations'
**[[enable]{.mark} and limit [our knowledge and ways of speaking about
something by defining]{.mark} [what is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
appropriate (and inappropriate), useful (or unimportant), and **['[true'
about particular subjects]{.mark}, and 'what sorts of persons or
'subjects' embody its characteristics']{.underline}** (Hall 1997, 6). By
setting out these 'rules of acceptability', **[[discourses become
'regimes of knowledge and truth']{.mark} [that utilise procedures of
inclusion and exclusion to 'regulate our approach to ourselves, each
other and our surroundings']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Andersen 2003, 3).
That is, discourses produce insiders and outsiders by
excluding/including particular 'themes, arguments and speech positions',
**[[denouncing]{.mark} some [groups]{.mark} of people [as 'abnormal or
irrational' and granting others 'the right and legitimacy to treat these
people']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Andersen 2003, 3). Therefore,
**[[discourses are imbued with power:]{.mark} discursive representations
define and limit what is 'truth' and 'knowledge']{.underline}** (by
allowing one 'truth' to be elevated over another), and **[these
[representations]{.mark} or ideas [about people can be used to
subjugate, control, and order them discursively]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Discourses reflect, enact, and reify power relations, and certain
actors play a privileged role in the]{.mark} [discursive production and
reproduction of meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Weldes et al. 1999, 13).
Within discourses certain meanings and statements are privileged,
objects and subjects are created and ascribed attributes and others are
ignored, certain acts are legitimated whilst others are made improbable.
**[[Dominant discourses successfully marginalise and displace
alternative]{.mark} (contesting) arguments, activities, and [discourses
by naturalising certain meanings and hierarchies; they 'seek to render
themselves incontestable']{.mark} by defining what is 'common sense'
knowledge, creating an a priori 'givenness' for certain identities, the
relevance (and irrelevance) of particular categories, and simultaneously
obfuscate the construction of these categories and
identities]{.underline}** (Laclau and Mouffe 2001, 134--145; Martin
2000, 24--25). Identity (gendered, racialised, for example), then, is
not something we possess but is constructed out of discursive practices.
**[It is]{.underline}** not pre-given or 'natural', but **[always being
constructed and reconstructed]{.underline}**, and is established in
relation to someone or something else (another group, individual, or
state, for example), in relation to what it is not (Connolly 1991,
64--66; Street 1997, 141). These relationships allow discourses to make
things intelligible: they provide us with ways of knowing the world, of
being in it and acting towards it by 'operationalizing a particular
'regime of truth' whilst excluding other possible modes of identity and
action' (Milliken 1999b, 229). **[[Hegemonic]{.mark} [practices]{.mark}
that attempt to fix meaning in discourses [are inextricably linked to
representational practices]{.mark}, and it is in these practices that we
can locate the operation of power [in
identity-making]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Doty 1996, 8--10). However, this
does not mean that **[gendered relations of power and gender
discrimination and [inequality are]{.mark}]{.underline}** 'merely'
constructs (created through discourse); they are also **[[material
'realities' that]{.underline}]{.mark}** (while they cannot be understood
outside discourse) **[[give rise to practices, acts, and material
effects that]{.underline}]{.mark}** can (and [**[need to]{.underline}**)
**[be]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[challenged, transformed, and
[changed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Women (and men) in Afghanistan and Iraq
(but also in the broader 'global south' and in the US and Europe) have
lived experiences of discrimination, violence, and oppressive practices
that are inherently gendered and, at times, racialised. In the Afghan
and Iraqi contexts, these have impacted particularly on women, both
before and after the US-led military interventions (Al-Ali and Pratt
2009; Brodsky 2003). While these **[lived experiences]{.underline}** of
Afghans and Iraqis **[are drawn upon in official US gendered orientalist
'War on Terror' discourse, they also exist beyond this specific
discourse]{.underline}**. That is, the material practices of the Taliban
and Hussein are not simply the products of 'War on Terror' discourse.
Rather, they themselves are the outcomes of broader gendered (and at
times racialised) relations of power which, although they cannot be
understood outside of 'discourse', give rise to material actions. That
is, **[[discursive meanings must be understood as enacted through and
constructed by material practices such that '\[d\]iscourses and material
practices are . . . mutually constitutive']{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Epstein 2008, 5).

Said's debt to the Foucault (1977) of Discipline and Punish is clear
when the former affirms the latter's archaeological method, whereby
**[rules of discursive engagement produce subjects based on their
inclusion, as opposed to exclusion, into statements that do not
determine but define their participation]{.underline}**. In other words,
**[it is through their appearance (in statements, in documents, in
narratives) that natives as such are transformed into
natives]{.underline}**. Said (1979: xix) writes that **[[this 'will to
understand' the Orient turned into]{.mark} a certain '[will to
dominate']{.mark} it]{.underline}**. **[France's ability to 'know' the
Egyptians [brings the Orient]{.mark} and its subjects [into]{.mark} view
or [existence, as objects of consumption]{.mark} for the Occident. They
are brought into vision by a civilizing force capable of
supervision]{.underline}**. Like Foucault's description of technologies
of surveillance, **[[the colonial panopticon sees the Orient without
being seen, writes it without being read]{.mark}, [surveys it without
being marked.]{.mark} This happens through writing and other forms of
capturing the natives for nativist purposes, that is, of asserting
European superiority over the naturalized inferiority of the Orient. But
Said disagrees with Foucault by asserting the author's imprint rather
than disappearance from discourse]{.underline}** (see Foucault 1991).
**[This is consistent with [Said's]{.mark} 'worldly' [analysis of
literature]{.mark} and other linguistic practices [as]{.mark} not
reducible to text but instantiations of concrete relations with their
context. They function as [representations o]{.mark}f the material
[world]{.mark}]{.underline}**, not in the reductive sense that
compromises orthodox Marxism's effectivity but in a Vician (1984)
recursive sense of play between cultural traffic, knowledge production
and human participation. **[Sometimes credited with Said, postcolonial
analysis does not signal a break from anti-colonial analysis as much as
it is a shift in explaining its processes.]{.underline}** Said is
concerned with the same colonialism that provided Fanon (\[1952\] 2008)
and Césaire's (\[1955\] 2000) problematic but **[[Said's is]{.mark} a
[colonial]{.mark} predicament turned into a [literary
phenomenon]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Its brutality is not only its
capacity to turn targets of colonialism into non-beings but equally
their disfigurement through metaphor and other linguistic practices.
**[The worldliness of language, for example, means that [annunciation
cannot be divorced from]{.mark} the [earthliness]{.mark} that
interpellates it. [Disfiguration happens when knowers are]{.mark}
perversely [consumed]{.mark} as objects in the orientalist knowledge
industry and ignorance ironically asserts itself as the only legitimate
form of knowledge]{.underline}** (see Mills 2007). Said shares Anibal
Quijano's (2000) turn away from studies of official, administrative
colonialism and towards the 'coloniality of power'. Following the
grooves of Quijano, **[Nelson Maldonado-Torres]{.underline}** (2007:
243) **[describes coloniality thusly: Coloniality is different from
colonialism.]{.underline}** Colonialism denotes a political and economic
relation in which the sovereignty of a nation or a people rests on the
power of another nation, which makes such nation an empire.
**[Coloniality, instead, refers to long-standing patterns of power that
emerged as a result of colonialism]{.underline}**, but that define
culture, labor, intersubjective relations, and knowledge production well
**[beyond the strict limits of colonial administrations. Thus,
[coloniality survives colonialism. It is]{.mark} maintained alive in
books, [in]{.mark} the [criteria for academic performance]{.mark}, in
cultural patterns, in common sense, in the self-image of peoples, in
aspirations of self, and so many other aspects of our modern
experience]{.underline}**. In a way, as modern subjects we breathe
coloniality all the time and everyday. Nxot to be underestimated, the
fall of traditional colonialism marked a transition in the modern world
system of race from colonialism to coloniality, from subordination to
subjectivation, from the transparency of power to its opaqueness, and
finally, from what Said (1994a: 23) characterizes as the reliance on the
'business of empire' and 'empire of business'. Just as Henry Giroux and
Peter McLaren (1986) describe curriculum as simply the introduction to a
particular way of life, so we can characterize, with William Appleman
Williams, 'empire as a way of life' (cited in Said 1994a: 55).
Immigrants, refugees and other categories of people enter colonialism as
a structure already lying in wait, whether or not a colonial power
administers a colonial state (see Grosfoguel 2007). In short, the world
witnesses the coloniality of power turn into the power of coloniality to
direct life outcomes even after the end of the official colonial era.
Just as the end of US enslavement ended one peculiar form of racism and
not racism itself, thus inaugurating another form (i.e. Jim Crow
segregation) to replace it (Bonilla-Silva 2001), ending colonial
occupation does not sound the death knell of coloniality. Knowledge and
the epistemic problem **[To say that decolonization is a curricular
problem is to suggest that curriculum reform is part of the decolonial
project. [Knowledge production has always been part of the colonial
project]{.mark} for it was not only a material imposition of a foreign
or external power but a concerted effort internally to supplant an
existing way of life with another. This means that [decolonizing the
curriculum]{.mark} [is no less than decolonizing]{.mark} the dominant
theory of knowledge, if not [knowledge itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}** By
theory, Said favours a secular version not reducible to its abstract,
even religious, overtones but theory as part of human activity in Vico's
(1984) The New Science, which is that humans can only understand (and
therefore undo) what they themselves have made. It shares a family
resemblance with Lukács' (1971) **[affirmation of theory's place in
forging critical consciousness as part of creating the world we can get
behind rather than only describing the one we reject in front of
us]{.underline}** (see Said 1983: 234). But **[neither is theory the
same as critical consciousness]{.underline}**, **[the second providing
spatio-temporal context for the first as well as accounting for the
untidy nature of historical experience that resists standardization
through theory.]{.underline}** In this sense, **[[knowledge is]{.mark}
less a thing of human nature than [a thing humans do.]{.mark} As part of
undoing what colonial knowledge has made of us to which we no longer
consent, the gift of [colonialism must be returned]{.mark} with interest
[within a]{.mark} decolonial [project]{.mark} [that dis-orients the
curriculum.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In recent decades, **[multicultural
reform has put a dent in Eurocentrism's hold on the US curriculum. That
welt has been noticed as its sentinels were awakened in order to defend
their territory.]{.underline}** Once thought to be something about
re-indigenization of land, decolonization moves on to new territory,
this time the realm of knowledge and cognition. It is one thing to
remove the colonizer from the first and quite another to purge them from
the second. For the colonizer's stench remains long after the denouement
of decolonization. **[Insofar as [the colonizer]{.mark} was able to
[insert themselves into every nook]{.mark} and cranny of the colony,
inner city or township, [including the]{.mark} colonial [subject's
self-concept]{.mark}, a decolonizing violence of the same magnitude,
what Fanon]{.underline}** (\[1961\] 2005) **[calls [a 'cleansing
force']{.mark}]{.underline}** (51; italics in original), **[[must take
place]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Colonialism redefined the category of
'human' as part of the radical departure within humanism to reduce it to
essential traits like abstract reason. **[Since at least the Cartesian
cogito, which pronounced the mind-body split in favour of a
decontextualized, rational spirit, the coloniality of being meant that
cognition was a cog in the juggernaut of European, capitalist, colonial
expansion. [Western epistemology has oriented humans]{.mark}, as part of
defining their essence, [towards knowledge as]{.mark} a
[conquering]{.mark} impulse.]{.underline}** This 'ego conquiro' and its
accompanying 'imperial attitude' became a constitutive part of
knowledge, practically and conceptually (Maldonado-Torres 2007: 245;
italics in original). **[In practical terms, it means a fundamentally
suspicious and misanthropic attitude towards the other as a threat to
European being, who must be stamped out or violently assimilated in what
has become a perpetual state of war.]{.underline}** Conceptually,
**[europocentrism has a virtual monopoly on what it means to be
human]{.underline}**, for as Charles Mills (1997) reminds us, **[within
the racial contract European humanism is just as it sounds: only
Europeans are humans.]{.underline}** To make matters worse, the
'educational racial contract' (Leonardo 2015) is flanked by the
'colonial contract' (Leonardo and Vafai 2016). **[Even accursed Whites
in the form of white women and the white working class, for example,
retain the mark and possibility of being human; they are beings, after
all. [The radical cut within]{.mark} the denominator of [the human made
by colonialism]{.mark} within an imperialist ontology [makes
curriculum]{.mark} reform [a matter of life and death]{.mark} as
colonial subjects fight off forms of social death in everyday

The affective power of the images, however, is not secured by what they
simply wish to signify, but rather, in how they accomplish it. In the
Western imagination, they cannot be conceived in any other way than
being manufactured. Yet, the boundary between what these photographs
denote and connote is seemingly rendered impossible to maintain or
grasp. Their imaginary force works by a monstrous transgressive
immediacy which threatens to short-circuit the ordered Manichean
representational schema of the "West and the Rest. " Islamic culture, as
the absolute Other of the West, has been unleashed ---and Islamaphobia
rationalized**[. The original [suspicion of racialized Others as
a]{.mark}n external [threat to]{.mark} security and culture of [the
West]{.mark} [materializes]{.mark} into a paranoid reality. The
[threat]{.mark} has [transmuted]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, and it
is **[now as much from within than without: Al-Qaeda really are
everywhere, and unstoppable because of their haunting
omnipresence.]{.underline}** Bush 's twin declarations of the "**[war
against terror]{.underline}**ism " and the "**[axis of
evil]{.underline}** " not only seek to **[[reassert]{.mark} an
[imperialist hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}** through an incredulous
bifurcation of global political relations, they also **[express the
[dread of]{.mark} contagion in the fear of [losing control]{.mark}
.]{.underline}** The Islamicized representations of the West described
above are not the hybrid cosmopolitanism envisaged by the political
imaginary of a liberal multiculturalism. **[The [identity and
superiority of the West]{.mark} has traditionally been [discursively
produced by Orientalist systems of representation]{.mark} [based on
maintaining a rigid]{.mark} and absolute [difference against its "Other.
"]{.mark}]{.underline}** However, Edward Said alludes to an ambivalence
in the **[[Western]{.mark} fascination and [fear of the Other]{.mark}
that lies [at the heart of]{.mark} the [discourse of Orientalism.
If,]{.mark}]{.underline}** following Said, the
**[[representations]{.mark} of the East (as despotic, barbaric, exotic,
sensuous, spiritual . . .) are actually disavowed Western projections on
to the Other, what happens when this material, imaginary, and
representational boundary appears to breakdown and
implode?]{.underline}** Our contention is that **[contemporary
Orientalism is figured on a boundary in jeopardy of being unable to
maintain its own apparatus of power. This is not to say that Orientalism
's disciplinary capacity has been diminished. As a matter of fact, the
[Western]{.mark} multicultural [desire for otherness]{.mark} is a motor
force [to a deterritorializing capitalism]{.mark} in the new globalizing
Empire]{.underline}** (Hardt and Negri 2000). Nevertheless**[, [as the
consumption of otherness accelerates]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the
fractured global economy of racialized bodies, information, media,
fashion, ethnic cuisine, and displaced labor, **[[Orientalism]{.mark}'s
ability to regulate and objectify the Other has [become increasingly
vexatious.]{.mark} Contemporary Orientalism is confronted, infiltrated,
and defied by its own abjured structure of exclusion. Considered as a
historically specific [racializing regime of power]{.mark}--- knowledge
fixated on difference, [Orientalism]{.mark} has been, par excellence, a
[cultural racism]{.mark}. Perhaps this accounts for why the
[relationship between Orientalism and Whiteness]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(as an exnominated racial category) has been
**[[underplayed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this article, we wish to
explore how a **[contemporary Orientalism]{.underline}**, as inscribed
in cosmopolitan culture, **[is intimately [tied to]{.mark} the
production of a [paranoid white subjectivity]{.mark}. The political
necessity of "[making whiteness strange]{.mark}" in order [to divest its
power]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Dyer 1997) **[is [not]{.mark}, however,
the [key concern]{.mark} here, as [identifying white paranoia does
not]{.mark} necessarily [undo]{.mark} its agency or
[violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Our intention is to
**[[interrogate]{.mark} a contemporary [politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(pathology) **[[of a self-fashioning Whiteness]{.mark},]{.underline}**
whose empty universality as the measure of humanity is unraveling in the
age of Empire. **[Orientalism Now]{.underline}** . . . **[Empire
establishes no territorial centre of power and does not rely on fixed
boundaries or barriers. It is a decentred and deterritorializing
apparatus of rule that progressively incorporates the entire global
realm within its open, expanding frontiers.]{.underline}** Empire
manages hybrid identities, flexible hierarchies, and plural exchanges
through modulating networks of command (Hardt and Negri 2000: xiii). In
their sweeping account of the emergence of a new post-imperialist
political constitution of world order, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri
insist that fixed boundaries and limits are no longer the defining
features of an "inclusive" Empire. **[On the contrary, mobile borders
and the multiplicity of difference, labor, and commodities are the drive
and desire of Empire. The authors announce that a new operation of power
and rule has emerged---a global postmodern sovereignty---which thrives
on "differential hierarchies" and "hybrid fragmented subjectivities."
They contrast this with the essentializing power of imperialism, in its
will to [manage]{.mark} the [Other through colonial terror and
domination]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The **["crisis of
modernity"]{.underline}** has been most **[acutely expressed in the
invariable exigency of a Manichean division between an emergent Europe
and its abject Other.]{.underline}** That which is **[excluded and
negated gives birth to a positive identity for the European
colonizer]{.underline}** (Said 1978). Said has cogently argued that the
inverted absolute difference of the Other is essential for the
possibility and maintenance of a superior Occident. **[The requisite
Other is then not what is merely excluded, but has to be acknowledged at
the same time.]{.underline}** Hardt and Negri take this up when they
highlight that the **[dialectical recognition of otherness is an
"intimate" kind of estrangement for the colonizer.]{.underline}** They
write: Knowing, seeing, and even touching the colonized is essential,
even if this knowledge and contact take place only on the plane of
representation . . . **[This intimacy in no way blurs the division
between the two identities in struggle, but only makes more important
that the boundaries and purity of identities be policed]{.underline}**
(Hardt and Negri 2000: 127). **[It was Frantz
[Fanon]{.mark}]{.underline}** (1986) **[who clearly
[demonstrated]{.mark} that the [policing of]{.mark} the [racial/cultural
boundary]{.mark} was a profound [site of anxiety for]{.mark} the [white
European]{.mark}. In reality, its transgression (and violent
consequences for the Other) has been the norm rather than the exception.
But it is the ineluctable necessity of upholding and sustaining the
besieged boundary of absolute difference that produces such
dread.]{.underline}** Why else, as Homi Bhabha (1994: 77) contends, are
"the **[same old stories of Negro's animality]{.underline}**, the
Coolie's inscrutability . . . told (compulsively) again and afresh . .
."? **[In their exposition of Empire, Hardt and Negri read postcolonial
theory as importantly deconstructing and challenging essentialist racial
binaries of modernity. Yet they accuse theorists such as Bhabha and Said
as operating with an anachronistic dialectical notion of colonial power
that can only seek to displace a binaristic hierarchy, by the
postcolonial incantation of hybridity and difference. The failure to
fully grasp the new modality of a decentered and deterritorializing
global power, results in postcolonial theory marking the shift towards
Empire, rather than being able to challenge its extant form of
rule]{.underline}**. This is not the place to challenge Hardt and
Negri's rather reductive reading of what they characterize as
"post-colonial theory." However, their project compels us to consider
how Orientalism operates in the age of Empire. Even though
**[[Orientalism's]{.mark} bifurcating [racialized
structure]{.mark}]{.underline}** (inside/ outside) **[appears to be [at
odds with]{.mark} the [subsumption of difference in Empire]{.mark}, what
unites the discourses of Orientalism and Empire is the interest in
(cultural) difference.]{.underline}** "**[Real
subsumption]{.underline}**," according to Hardt and Negri, has no
"outside" for the expansion of capitalism. It does not exclusively lead
to the exclusion or obliteration of difference; rather, it can
equivocally produce differential hierarchies and hybrid subjectivities
in the incorporation of all forms of life. These authors argue that the
racism of Empire is a cultural (or imperial) neo-racism of segregation,
which primarily integrates others (differences are ordered and
controlled). It is distinguished from the colonial racism of division
and hierarchy, which takes place across the racial boundary of
Self/Other (differences are excluded and negated). Following Deleuze and
Guattari, they contend that cultural racism needs to be conceived as a
"strategy of differential inclusion," as opposed to the absolute
exclusion of the Other. White supremacy functions . . . through engaging
alterity and then subordinating differences according to degrees of
deviance from whiteness. This has nothing to do with the hatred and fear
of the strange, unknown Other. It is a hatred born in proximity and
elaborated through degrees of difference of the neighbor. . .
Subordination is enacted in regimes of everyday practices that are more
mobile and flexible but that create racial hierarchies that are
nonetheless stable and brutal (Hardt and Negri 2000: 194). While these
authors properly maintain that a contemporary racism "rests on the play
of differences" instead of a Manichean bio-racial divide, Policar (1990:
100) reminds us that the two formulations "easily flow into each other
and so that they cannot be found in a pure state." The issue is not just
one of historical specificity, as the **[practice of [Western
racism]{.mark} has been [irrevocably imbricated with
culture]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see Young 1995). To highlight, contra
Hardt and Negri, that **[[Orientalist discourses]{.mark} have
[embodied]{.mark} both [colonial and cultural
racisms]{.mark}]{.underline}** is an obvious but **[necessary point to
make.]{.underline}** Arguably, **[the marking of "cultural"
otherness]{.underline}** has been the **[cardinal [differentialist
racializing operation of Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Said
observed a shift in the regime of colonial power during the nineteenth
century which "**[turned the Orient from an alien into colonial
space]{.underline}**" (1978: 211). This materialization of power over
the "Orient" attempted to penetrate its "cultural, temporal, and
geographical distance . . . expressed in metaphors of depth, secrecy and
sexual promise . . . the 'veils of an Eastern bride' or 'the inscrutable
Orient'\..." (Said 1978: 222). The **[closing down of distance between
the West and its Other in the actual encounter with the spaces and
bodies of the "Orient" did not result in existing boundaries melting
away.]{.underline}** **[Colonial governmentality]{.underline}** was
onerously **[preoccupied with maintaining a racial and cultural divide.
For the colonizer, the ambivalent coupling between racism and sexualized
desire for the Other was undoubtedly the most destabilizing and perverse
to police. And the popular colonial tales of Westerners "going native"
or insane in exotic foreign lands were thinly disguised warnings for not
getting too close to the Other.]{.underline}** As Deborah Root notes,
the **[[exoticism of the Other]{.mark} has worked]{.underline}**: . . .
**[by [generating]{.mark} excitement and [delirium]{.mark} precisely
[from the viewer's ambivalent relationship to difference]{.mark},
qualities that in one context are classified as negative---[such as
violence]{.mark}---can with the proper distance produce delight, desire,
and of course, the edge of danger and ambiguity that supplies an added
frisson]{.underline}** (1995: 34).

logical deduction produced from this discourse is that there can be [no
crime in eliminating the 'other']{.mark} fundamentally because its
mythical construction of this 'other' means that [one cannot]{.mark}
kill or [injure 'a thing' that is already dead]{.mark} or on the
sure-path towards death, and particularly after having been 'cast out'
from time.]{.underline} 136 Here this [[discourse compresses a
future-time death]{.mark} with the present life of the 'other' being.
Thus, [in]{.mark} this [orientalist discourse, the 'other' is the
embodiment of death]{.mark}]{.underline} (albeit not happened yet) [and
the orientalist discourse [portrays this 'other' as having no future,
because the orientalist has taken claim of the 'other's'
future]{.mark}]{.underline}, in a course in which there can be only one
future, that of the orientalist 'us'. Hence, [according to the
[orientalist discourse of the settler-colonial type,]{.mark} the
['other']{.mark} nations are [deemed lifeless]{.mark} as they have [no
future in the course of the settler-colonial
project]{.mark}]{.underline} except that which has been determined by
the 'us' of settler colonials. This in turn means a [total de-railment
of the 'other']{.underline} from the progression of time. In other
words, the [linear sequence of the progression of time accorging the
orientalist settler colonial discourse is made up as follows: Where the
'other's']{.underline} (indigenous nations) [past has progressed to
their present, it]{.underline} (the indigenou's present) [is replaced
with the 'us's' present]{.underline} (of the settler colonial) [so that
there can only be one future -- that of the]{.underline} 'us's' [(the
settler colonial's). Any residuals of [the 'other']{.mark}s' phases of
time still in the present [should be eliminated]{.mark}]{.underline} as
they have (or must have) no future. In this sense, [settler colonizers
seem to be [time-jacking]{.mark}]{.underline}137 the 'other's
([[indigenous nation's]{.underline}) [future]{.underline}]{.mark}
[indefinitely,]{.underline} rendering the latter non-existent. Patrick
Wolfe has refered to [[settlercolonial tendency to genocide as
manifesting "the logic of eliminantion...]{.mark} \[which\] refers to
the summary [liquidation of Indigenous]{.mark}
people]{.underline}..."138 [Therefore, according to the logical outcome
of this [settler-colonial-orientalist discourse, the 'other' nations
should be made to have no future]{.mark} by [physical
elimination]{.mark} or by [rendering them]{.mark} without souls,
[non-human]{.mark}, and therefore [expendible]{.mark} physical
[relics]{.mark}]{.underline} with no place in the future in the contest
over existence -- the power to decided who conceptually and therefore
existentially has a tomorrow (the 'us' or the 'other'). [In such a
configuration, [there can be no]{.mark} future where both the '[us' and
the 'other']{.mark} exist [in this orientalist discourse]{.mark}. It
follows according that any elimination practices of the indigenous is
claimed by the settler colonizers to be primarily a 'selfdefense' from
an indigenous reclaim of their temporal future. Hence, the seeming
driving factor of total war waged by the settler colonials is not out of
self-defence from actions by the indigenous nation may necessarily do in
the present. Rather it represents and offensive by the [settler
colonizers]{.mark} to [create a future totally void of
indigenous]{.mark} [participation]{.mark} or claim. In other words, [if
there are no indigenous left to participate]{.mark}, then there can be
[no indigenous re-claim to a future]{.mark}.]{.underline} The means to
realize this seems to be through total war which assumes a temporal in a
addition to an existential-eliminating dynamic: rendering the indigenous
nations without a temporal present, thus cancelling both the
indigenous's past and future by eliminating the linking temporal
component, the present and its physical manifestion in terms of
indigenous people, culture, relics of heritage, and institutions which
could shape their future

### Exclusion DA

#### Theres an [EXCLUSION DA]{.underline}: Status quo westerncentrism in IR scholarship crowds out marginalized voices -- a retooling of rhetoric is crucial now to include Asian perspectives of IR to disrupt white epistemologies 

**Eun 18**(Yong-Soo Eunm Yong-Soo Eun, PhD, is Associate Professor of

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0263395718805401)**//BRownRice**

Mapping the terrain of the **[[ongoing debate over 'non-western'
IR]{.mark}]{.underline}** In these contexts, whether there are any
**[substantial [merits]{.mark} to developing a '[non-Western']{.mark}
[IR theory]{.mark} and what such a theory would]{.underline}** (or
should) **[look like]{.underline}** are topics of heated debate in
contemporary IR. **[This interest in the theorisation of 'non-Western'
IR results largely from [discontent wi]{.mark}th the [epistemic value of
mainstream theories]{.mark}]{.underline}**, namely realism, liberalism,
and constructivism, **[all of which have
'[Western']{.mark}]{.underline}** -- or, more specifically,
'Eurocentric' (Patomaki, 2007) -- **[analytical or normative
[underpinnings]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Acharya and Buzan, 2017;
Johnston, 2012). **[[Western]{.mark}/Eurocentric [theories]{.mark}, the
criticism goes, [misrepresent]{.mark} and therefore misunderstand much
of ['the rest of the world']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Acharya, 2014: 647).
**[In addition, advocates of 'non-Western' IR theory building often
point out that [Asia has cultures]{.mark}, institutions, norms, and
worldviews that are [inherently]{.mark} [different from]{.mark} those
derived from or advanced in [Europe]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Long-standing interests and growing endorsement Consider, for example,
David Kang's critique. In his well-known piece, 'Getting Asia Wrong',
Kang (2003: 57--58) calls for 'new analytical frameworks', noting that
'**[[most]{.mark} international relations [theories]{.mark} [derived
from]{.mark} the [European experience]{.mark} of the past four
centuries]{.underline}** ... do a **[[poor]{.mark} job as they are
[applied to Asia']{.mark}]{.underline}**. Critiques of this kind have
**[long served as a starting premise in theoretical studies on Asian
IR.]{.underline}** Almost two decades ago, Peter Katzenstein (1997: 1)
wrote as follows: '**[Theories based on Western]{.underline}**, and
especially West European, **[experience have been of [little use
in]{.mark} making sense of [Asian regionalism']{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Similarly, Jeffrey Herbst (2000: 23) commented that '\[i\]nternational
relations theory, derived from an extended series of case studies of
Europe, has become notorious for falling short of accounting for the
richness and particularity of Asia's regional politics'. Amitav Acharya
and Barry Buzan have made a similar argument in their edited volume,
Non-Western International Relations Theory: 'The puzzle for us is that
the sources of international relations theory conspicuously fail to
correspond to the global distribution of its subjects. Our question is
"**[why is there no non-Western international theory]{.underline}**?"'
(Acharya and Buzan, 2010: 1). **[Here, China's rise has added momentum
to long-standing attempts to build new or indigenous theoretical
frameworks -- especially within the Chinese IR community.]{.underline}**
Yaqing Qin at the China Foreign Affairs University argues that 'Chinese
IR' theory 'is likely and inevitabl\[y\] to emerge along with the great
economic and social transformation that China has been experiencing'
(Qin, 2007: 313). The scholarly practices of building an IR theory 'with
Chinese characteristics' are a case in point (Callahan, 2001, 2008)
Although consensus on what 'Chinese characteristics' actually are has
yet to be determined, many Chinese (and non-Chinese) scholars hold that
the establishment of a Chinese IR theory or a 'Chinese School' of IR is
desirable or 'natural' (Kristensen and Nielsen, 2013: 19; Qin, 2016b);
in this light, Confucianism, Marxism, 'Tianxia' (all-under-heaven), and
the Chinese tributary system are all cited as theoretical resources for
Chinese IR (see, e.g. Kang, 2010; Qin, 2016a; Song, 2001; Wan, 2012;
Wang, 2011; Xuetong, 2011; Zhang, 2012; Zhao, 2009). **[In short, there
has been a [great deal of studies]{.mark} that aim to
[ameliorate]{.mark} the [Western]{.mark} parochialism of [IR.]{.mark}
This trend includes a strong and increasing commitment to the
[development of 'national schools' among
non-Western]{.mark}]{.underline}** (in particular, Chinese) **[IR
[scholars]{.mark}. In other words, many IR scholars in non-Western
countries have made [considerable attempts to discern]{.mark} [their
nations' unique social ontologies]{.mark} or historical-cultural
traditions [in their quest to develop]{.mark} an indigenous IR theory or
['non-Western' IR.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Knowledge production DA

#### Occidental stereotyping of China based upon perceptions from the Maoist era [distorts]{.underline} the literature and all Oriental knowledge

You remember Kosygin at the 23rd Congress! 'Communism means the raising
of living standards,' of course! And swimming is a way of putting on a
pair of trunks! - Mao Zedong, as told to (or imagined by) Andre Malraux
If it is repeated often enough will a truth-claim necessarily become a
truth? Such appears to be the case with the verdict on historical
Maoism. **[The [demonization]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [Mao]{.mark} era is
a general, if under-explored feature of China studies and
intellectual-political culture around the world - not least among
liberal Chinese intellectuals.]{.underline}**1 In this chapter I
critique this **[[production of truth about Chinese
Maoism]{.underline}]{.mark}** by documenting where it has occurred, and
what new **[knowledge and figures of [colonial discourse]{.mark} it
turns upon.]{.underline}** En route, I will argue that **[the ["new"
truth about the Mao era]{.mark} - perhaps not new but what was always
already "known" or at least assumed by the U.S.-West - [is]{.mark} an
indispensible [part of]{.mark}
Sinological-[orientalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed **[the
[demonization of Maoism is]{.mark} arguably [the lynchpin of the entire
discursive edifice surrounding the P.R.C. because it serves as]{.mark}
what [China]{.mark} is [in]{.mark} the process of [overcoming]{.mark} on
its [road to normality and]{.mark} political
[modernity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In that sense it is also a sign of
what contemporary China still lacks. **[It is the presupposition of the
construction of [post-Mao China]{.mark} as [becoming-the-same]{.mark} as
"us." The Mao era of socialist construction and mass mobilization is
what China is recovering from]{.underline}**; it is **[conceived of as
some type of oriental aberration]{.underline}**, a despotic nightmare
from which it is still trying to fully awake; at the very least it is a
space of negative difference from the present. Most simply put, **[the
chief blame for [China\'s]{.mark} lingering [history]{.mark} of
political, economic, and cultural deformation and "lag" [lies with
Mao]{.mark} Zedong and his Party state.]{.underline}** This in itself is
a highly interesting formulation. It is certainly better, in a
liberal-humanist-Cold War kind of way, than older traditions of blaming
China\'s problems on the Chinese character, race, or even Confucianism.
But what it shares with such older views, in addition to an implicit
teleology, is a refusal to take the actually existing, "Chinese"
realities and views seriously as something other than negativity and
lack. By this I mean that **[such views - the truth on Chinese Maoism -
do not take the Chinese revolution or Chinese-Marxist
developmental/constructive efforts seriously.]{.underline}** Not in
terms of either what they achieved (or even failed in), what was
attempted or intended, the complexities and ambiguities of what
resulted, nor in terms of the self-understanding of the era and its
partisans, actors, or witnesses. Nor do the complexities and differences
of contemporary China fare too much better; it is allowed to be an
emergent and rising economy, but not so much an emergent society (to put
this more conventionally). By "taking it seriously" I refer then not
only to the Maoist accomplishments --- its other failures
notwithstanding - in political economy or social development, and its
achievements in egalitarianism and human welfare. I refer more
fundamentally and conceptually to the ways in which that **[revolution
and post-1949 trajectory until at least 1979 understood
itself]{.underline}**, so to speak: what it said and did, and what it
was trying to do. I want to emphasize its positive record, surely, but
also its positivity or complexity, including this level of
**[self-understanding and discourse.]{.underline}** Above all else,
**[the hostile or [demonizing knowledge about]{.mark} the [Mao]{.mark}
era [is premised upon]{.mark} the [negation of Maoist discourse]{.mark}
itself.]{.underline}** By that, and following the work of Gao Mobo among
others, I refer to the rational-practical-affective framework that
enabled people to make sense of their lives and world during the Mao
years. I characterize this further below, momentarily. But it is the
**[[negation]{.mark} of this discourse that, in turn, [allows the Mao
era to be re-coded as]{.mark} totalitarianism, extremism, brainwashing,
[terror]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Or in somewhat more sympathetic codings:
as sheer, sublime utopianism or something like a spiritualistic
apotheosis of collective desire. It produces the triumphalism of China
discourse vis-à-vis the Mao era: that we now know the awful truth. That
discourse and that whole era need not be taken seriously aside from its
body counts because it was, in a word, fake. That is a view that can be
easily verified by liberal intellectuals on the mainland and diaspora,
or by self-professed "dissidents" of the current regime. (It is not I
think controversial to say that these largely Westernized and English
fluent Chinese intellectuals, businessmen, and artists represent China
to the West.) **[But this shift and [regime of truth]{.mark} is about
still more than the triumph of de-Maoification, the market mentality,
liberalism, American education, the Cold War victory of the U.S.-West,
and so on: it [reflects]{.mark} not only a Cold War perspective but - as
my analyses below and throughout this book attempt to show - is also a
[colonial discourse that turns upon orientalist tropes about]{.mark}
[despotism, cruelty, passivity, and irrationality]{.mark} running
rampant [in China]{.mark}. It marks China\'s [essential difference from
the normative U.S.-West, and]{.mark} again it is this [Maoism]{.mark}
that China must and is leaving behind.]{.underline}** In short, **[this
[new knowledge of the Mao era marks]{.mark} the imbrication of Cold War
("[totalitarian]{.mark}") [and colonial discourse within]{.mark} an
[orientalist production of knowledge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is "new"
in the sense that prior to the mid-1970s the "anti" views of the P.R.C.
were always countered to a certain extent by the very visible specter of
the **[Maoist revolution and discourse]{.underline}**: their
**[existence in China at least implied that the self-understanding of
the Chinese - howsoever "brainwashed" - was different than that of the
Cold War and racist discourse about Red China.]{.underline}** There were
far fewer "dissidents" and exiles, not to mention Sinologists, who could
serve their representative functions. And **[one should not
underestimate the (past) symbolic power and good name of China in the
former Third World and various postcolonial contexts.]{.underline}**
With the Western triumphalism after the "end" of the Cold War as well as
real de-Maoification in China, this is simply no longer the case. So,
too, **[the resurgence of modernizationist and liberal-humanist
discourse around the world marks the same eclipse.]{.underline}** It is
this shift that I wish to document below by examining how
**[[knowledge]{.mark} of the Mao era is produced in a way that [smacks
of colonial discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}** - both in terms of
old-fashioned (Cold War) orientalism and the enumerative modality
investigated by Bernard Cohn among others in their studies of knowledge
production under British imperialism. I begin with a discussion of
Maoist discourse and of scholarship on the nature of Maoist governance;
from there I will attend to codings of the relatively under-studied yet
crucial period of the Great Leap Forward and its famine. While mapping
the production of such Sinological knowledge, I also broach a wider
argument: that **[this is a [global phenomenon]{.mark}, a [part
of]{.mark} cultural/ideological globalization and its attendant [spread
of Eurocentrism and orientalism]{.mark} if also in liberal or other
guises.]{.underline}** What I am saying, in other words, is that despite
the obvious and in other ways welcome increase of flows of information,
commodities, and people in recent decades, **[what [we have
seen]{.mark}]{.underline}** is in fact **[an increase in the orientalist
production of knowledge.]{.underline}** In the case of China, **[this
turns fundamentally upon the negation of Maoist discourse in favor of an
[orientalist coding of the Mao era as aberration]{.mark} or
nightmare.]{.underline}**

#### **[Western propagation of knowledge has caused a "Sinologization" of global thought]{.underline}**

**Vukovich 11** \[Daniel F. Vukovich is currently an Associate Professor
at the University of Hong Kong., 11-21-2011, "China and Orientalism:
Western Knowledge Production and the PRC", Taylor & Francis,

The "Sinologization" of global thought The previous chapter examined a
Cold War-colonial production of knowledge about the Mao era in general
and the Great Leap Forward in particular. Of particular importance is
not just the enumerative modality in general, but more specifically the
work of American demographers and the British Indian, Nobel Laureate Sen
in propagating a regime of truth about Mao and the famine of 1959-61.
This is all to say, then, that this coding is indeed a global phenomenon
and not limited to China experts. **[Given the long-standing importance
of China to twentieth-century politics as well as the global influence
of Maoism itself, from South Asia to Latin America and beyond, it is to
be expected that there is such a thing as a [global production of
knowledge]{.mark} - a regime of truth - [about]{.mark} Mao and [Maoist
China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And **[yet this phenomenon is rarely
remarked upon as such within the academic field]{.underline}**, not
least because of the belief in objective or neutral knowledge. What this
chapter aims to do is to make the case for the global distribution of
such knowledge and to show that it does not simply hail from truth and
expertise. What we have to deal with, instead, is the **[[Sinologization
or orientalization of]{.mark} global [thought about
China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** By that I mean both the
**[[influence]{.mark} of authorized, "expert" knowledge and the
imbrication - or inseparability - [of]{.mark} this with more popular and
self-evidentially orientalist/[colonial]{.mark} forms of
[knowledge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** What is at stake here are **[two
standard problems from within the postcolonial and Marxist
traditions]{.underline}**, respectively, that have not been adequately
addressed to the subject of modern China: the **[[writing]{.mark} of
[the]{.mark} [Other]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and where incorrect ideas
come from. It is here, then, where **[we can begin to track the global
circulation of Sinological-orientalism, its system of dispersion, in
this case the demonization of [Chinese]{.mark} [Maoism]{.mark} as a
nightmarish aberration within China\'s incomplete but
[inevitable]{.mark} long [march to]{.mark} Western modernity and
liberal, democratic [capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But this
**[abstract coding of [China]{.mark} and the Mao period is subtended by
a deep anxiety and at times paranoiac fear of its "massness," and of its
[perceived threat to the West]{.mark}, especially its "freedom" and
liberal individualism.]{.underline}**1 Much of this discourse can be
seen reflected and refracted in Don DeLillo\'s Mao II (1991), arguably
his most prescient novel, at least in a symptomatic sense, in its
obsession with the "threat" that **[global, [non-Western
"terrorism"]{.mark} presents to authorship, freedom, the liberal
individual, and "modernity."]{.underline}** The novel\'s protagonist,
Bill Gray, is a reclusive, Pynchonesque writer with severe writer\'s
block. His two closest friends are his publisher Charles Everson and his
live-in assistant Scott Martineau, whose girlfriend, Karen Janney, he
has an affair with. Gray agrees to be photographed by a New York City
photographer named Brita, who is doing a series of portraits of
important writers. In a conversation with Brita and others, Gray laments
the declining significance of literature in an age where **["terrorists"
and "crowds" have supplanted novelists' function as the conscience and
brain of a culture.]{.underline}** The future belongs to crowds, as the
text famously puts it in its opening prologue (itself a televisual scene
of a mass wedding ceremony of the Unification Church, aka the "Moonies"
of old). After this, Gray disappears again and secretly decides to go to
the UK to speak on behalf of a Swiss poet who has been kidnapped and
held hostage in war-torn Beirut. He then meets George Haddad, a
representative of the Maoist group responsible for the kidnapping, and
secretly agrees to go to Lebanon to negotiate the poet\'s release. En
route, he is hit by a car in Cyprus, unknowingly lacerates his liver,
and dies in the night. His last coherent thoughts are of wanting
"devoutly to be forgotten," as if in the end the crowds are victorious.
The fate of the poet is left ambiguous. The novel ends with the
photographer in Beirut, snapping photos of the Maoist leader of the same
group (as if a confirmation of Gray\'s earlier remark about
"terrorists"). With perfect American-colonial arrogance, for the last
snap she suddenly tears off the hood of a boy, the leader\'s son, who
has been guarding the door. Later, she more happily photographs a random
wedding party on the streets outside her hotel, as if to say small
apolitical crowds are still okay. Through it all, the novel is delivered
in DeLillo\'s characteristically televisual imagery, his rich,
minimalist dialogue, and omnipresent indirect discourse. Yet while the
**[theme]{.underline}** of crowds is central to the novel, with all the
depth of some 1950s-era screed about mass society, it is in fact fully
**[articulated to the theme of terrorism - of leftist, [Maoist]{.mark}
so-called "[terrorism]{.mark}" in particular.]{.underline}** The bulk of
the novel\'s plot is centered on the "terrorist" kidnapping of the Swiss
poet by a Lebanese resistance group in Beirut (one with a "Marxist
component") (124). The Swiss detail is significant when we recall that
that place, for a certain imagination, remains the very paragon of
neutrality and social, liberal democracy. Utopia achieved for the
Europhilic intelligentsia perhaps. But for all the novel\'s resonances
with the post 9/11 U.S.-West - and these are what make it prescient
indeed - **[["terror"]{.underline}]{.mark}** here
**[[signals]{.underline}]{.mark}** less Islam than the very massness,
the overwhelming numbers of **[["others" who]{.mark} seemingly [refuse
"individuality"]{.mark} or the autonomous self for a
communal]{.underline}**, collective identity, cause, and way of life -be
it nationalism, Islamic fundamentalism, Maoism, and so on. Or
alternatively this is what makes the novel resonate so strongly with the
new, postcolonial world system after 9/11. As one of DeLillo\'s editors
put it: "Long before he had written anything Don told me he had two
folders - one marked 'art' and the other marked 'terror'."2 **[[The
collective and]{.mark} the [communal]{.mark}, while a seductive threat
everywhere, just so happen to [belong in the East. They are]{.mark} also
[seen as "backward"]{.mark} by all the major characters]{.underline}**,
including the narrator and implied author. The emotionally disturbed
Karen is the only possible exception, and she is nonetheless
pathologized throughout the text. To a significant extent, then, **[we
also have to see the novel\'s lament about Maoist and other forms of
terrorism as of a piece with the older, more familiar bogey of communism
and the specter of the Red East.]{.underline}** There is again an
articulation between the colonial and the Cold War worldviews at work in
this novel. Whether it affirms this or simply ambiguates it in more
"postmodern" fashion is not our concern here. The fact that in the
novel\'s Beirut there are other, "real" or Islamic fundamentalists in
existence, as opposed to the Maoists/political radicals, underscores
what I am claiming here. For the novel and presumably DeLillo, there is
not much difference between the leftists and the fundamentalists, the
Iranians and the Lebanese, or between the Moonies and the Maoists. This
is what Spivak once pithily called an assimilation of the Other through
non-recognition. Thus the first chapter opens inside a packed Yankee
Stadium, as 6,500 "anonymous" couples (anonymous to whom?) and followers
of Reverend Moon get married all at once; it ends with the narrator\'s
ominous prognostication about the future belonging to crowds (16). By
the end of the novel, with Brita watching that small wedding party in
the streets of "the dead city" Beirut, we have been taken around much of
the world outside the West (241). En route, and as noted earlier, the
novel establishes a chain of equivalence between the Moonies, the
various groups of the Lebanese civil war, the Iranian "masses" of the
revolution and later of the death of the Ayatollah Khomeini, the
Peruvian Maoists, and China. But it is a specifically Maoist China, even
when the much-later Tiananmen protests are signified. The latter is
established by both the image of the massive protest in Tiananmen
Square, which occupies the novel\'s front pages in a cinematic "opening
credits" form, and Karen\'s witnessing on television the aftermath of
the bloody crackdown ordered by Deng Xiaoping (in reality the
anti-Maoist par excellence). And yet, it is in fact impossible to say
for certain that the opening, unspecified photo is in fact of Tiananmen
1989. It could just as easily be one of any number of Cultural
Revolution rallies from decades before. So, too, Karen is enthralled by
the portrait and name of Mao, as well as by "Mao suits" (fairly
anachronistic by 1989) and the crowds. That, perhaps, is the point: it
is all one, an undifferentiated mass society cathected to a Great
Leader, external to and threatening the West. Clearly the 1991 novel is
obsessed with Mao/Maoism, and its overall image of China is akin to the
older, Cold War vision of an "army of blue ants." **[What we have again,
then, is an [abstract and reductive yoking together of radically
different]{.mark} - but all non-white - [groups]{.mark}, cultures,
nations, and moments in time. They form one chain of equivalence that is
seen here [as a]{.mark} vague but [powerfully looming threat]{.mark}. It
is a threat not just to individual lives (e.g. Karen\'s, Bill\'s, the
poet\'s) but to an entire way of life and to the "self" as such. More
specifically, this is [the self]{.mark} - independent, coolly rational,
introspective, and autonomous - [of]{.mark} both [Western]{.mark}
liberal [capitalism]{.mark} and, relatedly, of an earlier modernism and
the figure of the artist-writer as the conscience or
legislator-interpreter of "mankind." [The threat]{.mark} against this
imaginary institution [is established and made immanent to the
U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}** in several ways. In addition to the opening
"cult" ceremony, there is the presence of the name "Sendero Luminoso"
(the Shining Path of Peruvian Maoism) spray-painted on ruined buildings
in Tompkins Square Park in New York. When Karen asks someone where these
guerrillas are, she is told "everywhere" (175). As Jeoffrey Bull has
aptly noted, the novel then brings together these Maoists and the Beirut
war by having, two pages earlier, people saying "Beirut, Beirut, it\'s
just like Beirut" when they see fireballs from nearby gas main ruptures
(173). As to the substance of the threat, this is left vague overall but
still menacing (or perhaps menacing because vague). This is done in part
through the invocation of the violence of the crowd as such, whether it
is the Ayatollah\'s frenzied mourners nearly pulling his limbs apart,
the violence in Tiananmen (burnt bodies), or the Swiss poet\'s likely
demise at the hands of the terrorists/kidnappers. Moreover, the novel
articulates this threat through - self-indulgent - dialogues on the
eclipsed role of the artist/novelist. Thus Gray will comment to Brita
that: Years ago I used to think it possible for a novelist to alter the
inner life of the culture. Now bomb-makers and gunmen have taken that
territory. They make raids on human consciousness. What writers used to
do before we were all incorporated. (41) The so-called
**[terrorists]{.underline}**, then, have stolen the artists' thunder and
this privileged stratum has been **["incorporated" to
boot.]{.underline}** Not incorporated by capitalism but by a certain
shift in the Geist of the world: a rising, soon to be triumphant
practice of and desire for "absolute being" and "All men one man" for
"the end of time"; this is how DeLillo characterizes what the Maoists,
Moonies and the like desire (163, 235, 16). They seek an erasure of the
self through "cultish" belonging and through experiencing the "link to
the fate of mankind," and thereby living "in history" (82,235). To be
fair, Mao II sees this as a universal, not explicitly "Oriental" Geist
and problem, just as Karen serves in some sense as a foil character and
moral antithesis to the narcissistic, and eventually quite pathetic
protagonist and his assistant, Scott. But on the other hand, Karen is
nonetheless consistently pathologized as being merely "postcult," and it
is no accident that, save for one photo of a European soccer crowd
crushed against a fence, all the "terrorists" (Mao, the Ayatollah, Abu
Rashid, the Shining Path) and their slavish followers or crowds are
not-white (82). Not unlike how Kennan et al. saw totalitarianism, the
threat originates in the "Asiatic" East. There is clearly an asymmetry
and therefore a prejudice here, one rooted at the very least in anxiety
if not the paranoia characteristic of much Western postmodern fiction.3
Bull, too, is almost on to this point when he notes - albeit
uncritically - that "terrorists have taken control of the West\'s
narrative (as Bill \[Gray\] predicted)" (222). **[[Within this
orientalist bifurcation of the world, China occupies the paramount
place]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As I will go on to explain shortly**[, it
is a dichotomy that the novel unsettles and disturbs, or cannot quite
contain.]{.underline}** As Ryan Simmons has cogently argued, the "Salman
Rushdie affair" following the Ayatollah\'s fatwa against the great
Indian novelist is an important backdrop to the book; Rushdie may well
be imaged in the protagonist himself as well as in the Swiss
poet-kidnappee (Simmons 677). But few have commented on the centrality
of "Maoism" and China in the novel, and when this has been done it is
mostly along the lines of the above equivalence. The real, historical
Mao and the P.R.C. are indeed assumed to be part of the same,
naturalized chain and threat. Thus Mark Osteen will refer to Bill
Gray\'s (and the novel\'s) opposition to "Maoist or terrorist
monologism" in favor of "Bakhtinian heteroglossia" (661). **[This
[ahistorical conflation of Maoism and China]{.mark} with the Shining
Path, revolutionary Iran, the Unification Church of Reverend Moon, and
Abu Rashid (whose characterization as a Maoist has no historical basis
itself) - in the novel and its scholarship - [is]{.mark}, in short,
[deeply misleading]{.mark} as well as surprising in work as erudite as
DeLillo\'s.]{.underline}**

**[The [fear]{.mark} of migrants and refugees, stoked by politicians,
[is]{.mark} setting a [defining narrative for]{.mark} elections in [the
West]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The **[Brexit]{.underline}** vote directly
played on these fears as did the U.S. elections with its narrative of
Mexican "criminals and rapists," both **[[setting]{.mark} a [tone
for]{.mark} electoral [victories]{.mark} that would have been
unthinkable just a few years ago.]{.underline}** The Dutch elections,
where the nativist trend grew but was held at bay, also saw much
negative rhetoric around Islam. With elections in France and Germany
coming up, the trend seems unlikely to abate. It is worth remembering,
however, that while the recent refugee crisis presents an easy target,
**[the [social tensions]{.mark} and challenges reflected in these
elections [are]{.mark} a [decades-old]{.mark} phenomenon.]{.underline}**
The advent of refugees from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan certainly
didn't create these tensions. Nor did the accompanying economic
migrants, who sought refuge in a Europe where identity politics had been
part of the political landscape for decades. In the meantime, **[the
reality of their links to crime and terrorism have been lost in harsh
campaign politics.]{.underline}** During the U.S. campaign, with loud
assertions linking migrants and refugees to crime waves, the Sentencing
Project noted, "Foreign-born residents of the United States commit crime
less often than native-born citizens." This is echoed by the libertarian
Cato Institute, which reported, **["All immigrants are less likely to be
incarcerated than natives relative to their shares of the
population".]{.underline}** The first comprehensive study in Germany to
look at its 1 million refugees, noted, "The refugee influx to Germany in
2014 and 2015 wasn't followed by a "crime epidemic." Instead, "there
were 'muted increases' in some criminal activity in the immediate
aftermath of the record influx of refugees, which saw an uptick in drug
crimes and fare-dodging in areas with bigger reception centers...also
associated with increased minor crime for German citizens---partly
explained by increased police presence." Research points to an
**["immigrant paradox,"]{.underline}** which isn't fully understood
according to Boston University's Salas-Wright: "One theory is that
**[people who pick up their lives and move to a foreign country and set
up a new life tend... to be interested in making this new life
work."]{.underline}** This likely holds true for refugees fleeing war,
especially if they are with their family or are anchors for them. On
refugees, migrants, and terrorism, the Migration Policy Institute,
noted, **["The United States has resettled 784,000 refugees since
September 11, 2001.]{.underline}** In those 14 years, exactly three
resettled refugees have been arrested for planning terrorist
activities... two were not planning an attack in the U.S. and the plans
of the third were barely credible." Another study looked at four decades
of foreigners coming into the U.S., noting that "the chance of an
American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1
in 3.64 billion per year while the chance of being murdered in an attack
committed by an illegal immigrant is an astronomical 1 in 10.9 billion
per year. By contrast, the chance of being murdered by a tourist on a B
visa, the most common tourist visa, is 1 in 3.9 million per year." What
we do know is that from Orlando to San Bernardino and others, U.S.-born
terrorists remain a far greater threat. This is also a significant
factor in Europe as seen in attacks in Paris, Brussels, Copenhagen, and
London. Yet here too it is worth remembering that attacks from radical
Islamic groups in Europe are a decades-old phenomenon, long predating
the recent influx of refugees and migrants. The reality is that the
challenges of integrating some Muslim youth has indeed provided (a tiny)
opening for terrorist recruitment in Europe. Fifteen years ago, the now
infamous neighborhood of Molenbeek from where many of the Brussels and
Paris attackers came, was known for riots "born out of desperation... in
a neighborhood characterized by poor job prospects, bad housing and
deficient education"---much like similar outbursts in the U.K., France,
and elsewhere. There is also an emerging link between petty
crime---another point of call for the disenfranchised and
alienated---and terror groups. **[Islamic State is now deliberately
tailoring its message to appeal to this small subset within the European
Union's 20 million Muslims.]{.underline}** According to Professor Peter
Neumann from King's College London, "There is now a perfect fit between
these young men and (IS) that has shed any attempt at serious
theological discourse." Alain Grignard, from Belgium's counterterror
agency, says that "Young Muslim men with a history of social and
criminal delinquency are joining up with the Islamic State as part of a
sort of 'super-gang'"---enticements including "gamified" recruiting
videos from IS. **[[The channels through which terror and crime affect
the West are overwhelmingly homegrown---including a trend of violence
targeting these newcomers]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Banning the displaced
and migrants will have little impact on this challenge---a point
underlined by the U.N. **[What will matter will be [better integration
of disenfranchised]{.mark} youth and support to narratives from Muslim
communities in the West and elsewhere against the ideology of
terror.]{.underline}** Also worth remembering is that the vast majority
of Muslims in the West and beyond are firmly against IS and their ilk,
even with the outrages the nativists continue to inflict.

### Occidentalism DA

In Orientalism, Edward Said's efforts were dedicated to uncovering how
the **[["Oriental" other of the Occidental self]{.underline}]{.mark}**
was formed and conjured up. His seminal book would also explicate the
constitution of this Occidental self, an explication that would become
generative of a large body of literature that followed in its footsteps.
In this brief contribution, I argue that **[[the]{.mark} lasting and
ongoing [impact of Orientalism is its uncovering of the Occidentalism
that subtends Orientalist discourse]{.mark} and
institutions.]{.underline}** Whereas Said does not always name what
Orientalism presupposes as "Occidentalism," and although his engagement
with the notion of Occidentalism in this book and in later writings is
sparse and not always consistent with the theoretical apparatus that he
constructs in Orientalism, the definition of Occidentalism that I offer
is based, as will be shown, on a decidedly Saidean apparatus. The term
has been rebarbatively appropriated and extracted from his text by
critics, both sympathetic and antipathetic to his project. A careful
reading of Said's major line of argumentation in his book, however,
offers a particular understanding of
**[[Occidentalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** as the **[[discourse]{.mark}
through which what came to be constituted as the Occident [was
reactively formed]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in the Nietzschean sense, by a
series of projections that othered the entire world outside of this
constituted Occident. Said explains that **[[the Oriental conjures up
the identity of the Occidental]{.underline}]{.mark}**: "Such categories
as impostor (or Oriental, for that matter), imply, indeed require, an
opposite that is neither fraudulently something else nor endlessly in
need of explicit identification. And that opposite is 'Occidental.'"1
Examples include how "the 'bizarre jouissances' of Orientals serve to
highlight the sobriety and rationality of Occidental habits."2 Said
concludes that the function of Orientalism in the twentieth century is
as "a code by which Europe could interpret both itself and the Orient to
itself."3 He tells us while discussing the work of Ernest Renan that "it
is not too much to say that Renan's philological laboratory is the
actual locale of his European ethnocentrism; but what needs emphasis
here is that philological laboratory has no existence outside the
discourse, the writing by which it is constantly produced and
experienced. Thus even the culture he calls organic and
alive---Europe's---is also a creature being created in the laboratory
and by philology."4 Said's astute reading of Raymond Schwab identifies
this relationship in the latter's work clearly: "In Schwab's view,
**[[the Orient]{.mark}, however outré it may at first seem, [is a
complement to the Occident]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and vice versa."5
Orientalism then, given Said's explications, is a, if not **[the, major
component in the formation of Occidentalism's putative object: the
Occident.]{.underline}** Whereas Said defined
**[Orientalism]{.underline}** clearly and unambiguously as **["a style
of thought based upon an [ontological and epistemological distinction
made between 'the Orient' and]{.mark} (most of the time) [the
'Occident]{.mark},'"]{.underline}**6 **[and [as "a Western style of
dominating]{.mark}, restructuring, and having authority over [the
Orient]{.mark},"]{.underline}**7 he anticipated what Occidentalism would
be without naming it when he added that **["European culture gained in
strength and identity by setting itself off against the Orient as a sort
of surrogate and even underground self."]{.underline}**8 He would
clarify that "as much as the West itself, **[the Orient is an idea that
has a history and a tradition of thought, imagery, and vocabulary that
have given it reality and presence in and for the West.]{.underline}**
The two geographical entities thus support and to an extent reflect each
other."9 Said mentions the term **[[Occidentalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**
ambivalently in Orientalism on a few occasions and brings it up briefly
in subsequent writings, which would be later cited by his critics and
political enemies. He seems to posit the term as sometimes **[[operating
as the opposite of Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, its mirror image
(rather than its "secret sharer"), which seems **[at odds with his
understanding of Orientalism.]{.underline}** But, as the following will
show, he is not always clear that this is his intended meaning. Said
announces early in the book that "to speak of scholarly specialization
as a geographical 'field' is, in the case of Orientalism, fairly
revealing since no one is likely to imagine a field symmetrical to it
called Occidentalism."10 **[What Said thinks this "reveals" is that for
those who constituted themselves as Occidentals and who continue to
constitute themselves as such to study Occidentalism, to acknowledge how
they have formed themselves and been formed would undercut the very
fiction of their claim that the Occident was a real place, and not an
Idea. This would, in turn, overturn the [binary]{.mark} which makes them
able to study what they constituted as the Orient.]{.underline}** In
this sense, **[Occidentalism is always an uninterrogated essential point
of departure for Occidental Orientalist subjects.]{.underline}** As any
type of **[symmetry between Orientalism and Occidentalism was not
evident]{.underline}**, something about **[[Occidentalism]{.mark} in its
[distinct]{.mark}iveness [from Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** struck
Said as important to note. He tells us: One of the important
developments in nineteenth century Orientalism was **[the distillation
of essential ideas about the Orient]{.underline}** \[ . . . \] **[into a
separate and unchallenged coherence]{.underline}**; thus for a writer to
use the word Oriental was a reference for the reader sufficient to
identify a specific body of information about the Orient. This
information seemed to be morally neutral and objectively valid; it
seemed to have an **[epistemological status]{.underline}** equal to that
of historical chronology or geographical location. In its most basic
forms, then, **[Oriental material could not really be violated by
anyone's discoveries, nor did it seem ever to be revaluated
completely.]{.underline}** Instead, the work of various
nineteenth-century scholars and of imaginative writers made this
essential body of knowledge more clear, more detailed, more
substantial---and more distinct from 'Occidentalism.'11 Again, here Said
does not offer a definition of this "Occidentalism" nor an explanation
of what it is. Rather, he seems to imply that the term designates **[a
discursive lens through which [Orientals represent the Occident]{.mark},
which again is not symmetrical to Orientalism, as it lacks its power as
a [dominating]{.mark} or authoritative discourse and set of
[institutions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In contrast to Said, Egyptian
philosopher Hasan Hanafi uses "Occidentalism" in exactly this sense when
he proposes that the others of Europe (Orientals, Africans, and Native
Americans), especially Arabs and Muslims, should study the Occident's
Orientalism not as source material to understand Arab and Muslim
civilization or the Arab and Muslim self, but rather as an object of
study which would allow them to study Europe and the Occident in a
"neutral" way. **[Instead of idealizing Europe and falling in the trap
of ["westernization,"]{.mark} they would be undertaking this work
without [seeking]{.mark} or possessing [power over the
Occident]{.mark}.]{.underline}**12 Said's last reference to
Occidentalism is found on the last page of Orientalism---lodged in the
very lesson that he hopes his book will impart to future generations:
**[If this book has any future use, it will be as a modest contribution
to \[ . . . \] challenge \[worldwide Orientalist hegemony\], and as a
warning: that systems of thought like [Orientalism]{.mark}, discourses
of power, ideological fictions \[ . . . \] are all too easily made,
applied, and [guarded]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Above all, I hope to have
shown my reader that **[[the answer to Orientalism is not
Occidentalism]{.mark}. No former 'Oriental' will be comforted by the
thought that having been an Oriental himself he is likely---too
likely---to study new 'Orientals'---or 'Occidentals'---of his own
making.]{.underline}**13 This is perhaps the most perplexing of Said's
invocations of the term. Whereas on the previous two occasions, he
demonstrated clearly that **[Occidentalism]{.underline}** could not be
the opposite of or even the same ("symmetrical") as Orientalism, indeed
that it would be an impossible phenomenon altogether, here he conjures
it up as **[a potential "answer" to the "challenge" of
Orientalism.]{.underline}** Yet Said cautions against this dialogic
correspondence, which implies that **[[Occidentalism]{.mark}, as the
opposite of Orientalism, can be willed or chosen by Orientals answering
the question or ["the challenge" of Orientalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
But if Orientalism "is the whole network of interests inevitably brought
to bear on (and therefore always involved in) any occasion when that
particular entity 'the Orient' is in question," then in the ongoing age
of European Empires and their U.S. extension, how could
**[Occidentalism]{.underline}**, if defined as **[the opposite of
Orientalism]{.underline}**, be possible at all?14 I find that this third
mention is the weakest of Said's invocations of the term and smacks of a
proleptic political defensiveness that posits a liberal egalitarianism
between two incommensurable terms that cannot be equalized. Here Said
seems to suggest that Orientals could answer the challenge of
Orientalism with an Occidentalism of their own; thus he posits
**[[Orientals and Occidentals]{.mark} as equal terms and
subjectivities]{.underline}**, after he had already shown us that
**[they [could only exist as a binary in a hierarchy that structured
their inequality]{.mark} a priori.]{.underline}** Also, in this last
invocation he seems to present **[Orientalism and Occidentalism as
ontologies and epistemologies that are not connected to institutions of
power]{.underline}**---including economic, military, social,
ideological, and political---although he had previously insisted that
this was the case with Orientalism. In fact, given his other explicit
invocations of Occidentalism and his implicit references to it when he
speaks of what Orientalism presupposes, we can see clearly that
**[Occidentalism is indeed enmeshed in the very same network of powerful
institutions. [The Occident]{.mark} and Occidentals are thereby
[produced through]{.mark} the ruse of presupposing their existence as
anterior to the [discourse and]{.mark} the [institutions]{.mark} that
produce them in the first place.]{.underline}** Both Said and his
analysis of Orientalism in the book would be accused by facile critics
of being "Occidentalist" or "reverse Orientalist," pushing Said into
more defensiveness in later writings. In Culture and Imperialism, for
example, he restated his argument in a different, even more damning,
way: "We \[American intellectuals\] have rarely been so fragmented, so
sharply reduced, and so completely diminished in our sense of what our
true (as opposed to asserted) cultural identity is. The fantastic
explosion of specialized and separatist knowledge is partly to blame:
Afrocentrism, Eurocentrism, Occidentalism, feminism, Marxism,
deconstructionism, etc."15 This defensive posture is ironically manifest
in the very book where Said expands on his notion of
**[Orientalism]{.underline}** to **[include Europe's relationship with
the entire world.]{.underline}** As he informs us at the outset, "About
five years after Orientalism was published in 1978, I began to gather
together some ideas about the general relationship between culture and
empire that had become clear to me while writing that book . . . I have
tried here to expand the arguments of the earlier book to describe a
more general pattern of relationships between the modern metropolitan
West and its overseas territories, \[including\] Africa, India, parts of
the Far East, Australia, and the Caribbean."16 What is remarkable in the
list of "isms" that Said invokes above is that
**["[Occidentalism]{.mark}" seems [out of place]{.mark} amongst them (as
is Eurocentrism).]{.underline}** What comes across most of all in this
list, aside from Said's irritation and impatience with the other terms
and the proliferation of their "isms," is his seeming inattention once
again to the asymmetries between Occidentalism (and Eurocentrism) and
the rest of the isms he lists. Said's defensiveness is manifest
throughout his "Afterword" to Orientalism, published in 1994, where he
sought to fend off those who attacked his book for allegedly being
"antiWestern" as opposed to being an analysis of how the Occident/West
came to be.17 He would later make the mistake, including in a 2003 new
preface to Orientalism, of falling into the unfortunate trap of a
liberal equivalence between Orientalist-inspired imperial jingoism in
the United States and Arab and Muslim "anti-Americanism," thus echoing
the last paragraph of the 1978 edition of the book where he had
forewarned against the use of Occidentalism as a response to
Orientalism, which I mentioned above.18 Still, this defensiveness did
not halt his interest in how Occidentalism worlds the world of Europe
and non-Europe. This concern, which haunted him till the end of his
life, is invoked again as the problematic of identitarian essentialism
and binaries in his late book, Freud and the Non-European. 19 I take
Said's first definition of Orientalism as also applicable to
Occidentalism, but I have rewritten his words with a slight
modification: **[Occidentalism is a style of thought based upon an
ontological and epistemological [distinction]{.mark} made
[between]{.mark} (most of the time) ["the Orient"]{.mark} (but often the
entire world that lies outside what is defined or imagined as the
"Occident") [and the "Occident]{.mark};" it is a "[West]{.mark}ern style
of [dominating]{.mark}" [the]{.mark} entire knowable [world]{.mark},
including the Orient and the Occident.]{.underline}**20 In this context,
Said's judgment, which alienated many Europeans and Euro-Americans,
should be slightly modified. He states**[: "It is therefore correct that
every [Europe]{.mark}an, in what he could say about the Orient, was
consequently a racist, an [imperialist, and]{.mark} almost totally
[ethnocentric]{.mark}. Some of the immediate sting will be taken out of
these labels if we recall additionally that [human]{.mark}
societie[s]{.mark}, at least the more advanced cultures, have [rarely
offer]{.mark}ed [the individual anything but imperialism, racism, and
ethnocentrism for dealing with 'other'
cultures."]{.mark}]{.underline}**21

### Poststructural DA

#### Poststructural DA\-\--the AFF reproduces 'War on Terror' logics that establish gendered and oriental classificatory frameworks that naturalize Otherization as a 'truth' for the construction of Western imagination

**Khalid 17** (Maryam Khalid \| *Gender, Orientalism, and the 'War on
Terror': Representation, Discourse, and Intervention in Global Politics*
pg 9-11 \| DOA: 7/16/2022 \| SAoki)

\-\--DA = discourse analysis, not disad (or is it?)

I apply **[[a poststructural DA]{.mark} approach [to reading
'texts']{.mark}]{.underline}** (as words, images, sounds, anything
through which we aim to communicate meaning) **[[through
identifying]{.underline}]{.mark}** as **[[discursive attempts to]{.mark}
'fix' as [legitimate]{.mark} certain [knowledges and
'realities']{.mark}]{.underline}**. The key analytical techniques I use
are presupposition, predication, pre/proscription, and (re)production, 4
**[[to uncover]{.mark} the [contingent bases]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(contingent [**[on gendered and orientalist logics and
knowledge]{.underline}**) **[that discursive practices seek to mask and
naturalise as 'truth']{.underline}**]{.mark} (Martin 2000, 25). I look
at how what is presupposed and predicated about people, places, things,
ideas, functions to present as true particular knowledge and
'identities' through particular verbs, adverbs, and adjectives (that is,
how characteristics are attributed to subjects and objects).
Specifically, I explore how the Bush administration's **[[discursive
practices construct the]{.mark} appropriate '[Self' and inappropriate
'Other' in terms of logics of gender that privilege particular
expressions of masculinity]{.mark}]{.underline}** (over femininities and
inappropriate masculinities), **[[and logics of
orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (and broader racialised logics)
**[[that privilege whiteness and 'Westernness' over non-white and
'Eastern Others' through relational distinctions]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(free/oppressed, civilised/barbaric, benevolent/threat, for example)
**[[structured]{.mark} according [to hierarchical logics]{.mark} of
gender and of race/orientalism]{.underline}** (in which masculinity,
maleness, whiteness, and 'Westernness' are privileged), particularly in
terms of their deployment in constructing narratives of intervention
(Doty 1993b, 306; Milliken 1999b, 232). In establishing background
knowledge and subject/object qualities, analysing presupposition and
predication along with pre/proscription can show how a causality that
prescribes 'truth' is asserted. In delimiting 'truth' and 'knowledge', I
see discourses as pre/proscriptive because they function to exclude or
demand particular actions based on the 'knowledge' they assert (Griffin
2009, 43--44). That is, **[once a 'fact' has been established through
presupposition and predication, the [conclusions]{.mark} drawn from
these 'facts' [are]{.mark} also discursively [established as
'truth']{.mark}]{.underline}**; processes of pre/proscription attempt to
'fix' (albeit partially) certain 'truths', 'facts', and 'knowledge', and
from these, the actions, behaviours, conclusions that logically follow
as 'acceptable'. '**[[War on Terror' discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I
argue, prescribes certain desirable characteristics (on which the 'Self'
is predicated) and performances (of masculinity, for example) and
proscribes others (for example, behaviours toward women ascribed to the
barbaric 'Other') **[[based on]{.mark} logics of [gender and
orientalism]{.mark}, and [draws 'natural' or 'logical' conclusions
from]{.mark} these]{.underline}**. This is where
**[([re)production]{.mark} occurs [through]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for
example, **[the use of [classificatory schemes that categorise people
into identity groups to which they 'naturally' belong, and which produce
hierarchies of identity that are]{.mark} also [based on
naturalised]{.mark} '[truths' about the world and its
people]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For example, **[particular identities
constructed through predication, such as backward Afghans, oppressed
women, dangerous Muslim/Arab men, pre/proscribe 'logical'
actions]{.underline}** (or inactions) such as oppressed (without agency)
Afghan women, irrational and uncontrolled barbaric Afghan men, and a
benevolent, civilised US. From these 'truths' it can be concluded in
official 'War on Terror' discourse that 'oppressed Afghan women' need to
be 'saved' by the 'benevolent and superior US' (through military
intervention). **[[These processes]{.mark} also need to be understood in
terms of the productive power of discourses]{.underline}**, that is,
**[productive of power, in [naturalising and making 'truth' of the
knowledge(s), 'facts', narrative, realities, meanings, and identities
that discourses speak of, construct, and order]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Through **[continually employing discursive processes]{.underline}** (of
presupposition, predication, pre/ proscription), **[[they are
(re)productive of the 'meanings, subject identities, their
interrelationships, and a range of imaginable
conduct']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Doty 1996, 4) defined by the discourse.
(Re)production is particularly important for my analysis in Chapters 5
and 6 , as the ways in which 'War on Terror' discourse expanded since
its beginning in September 2001 to function both consistently (in terms
of its broadest logics) and adapt to changing events (in terms of
specific narratives) through the 2001--2003 'War on Terror' period,
resulting in two military interventions (in Afghanistan and Iraq) that
were highly connected to each other in this discourse. A logic of
difference ('us'/'them', 'East'/'West') underlies this, which operates
to (temporarily) 'fix' these differences, and the contingency of this
logic is itself masked by discursive practices (Doty 1996, 8--11). For
example, official US 'War on Terror' discourse functions to make
'natural' certain identities, and structures them according to gendered
and orientalist assumptions, but the way it does this is contingent on
the successful 'silencing' of other possibilities and representations.
That is, official US 'War on Terror' discourse is contingent on
marginalising those **[representations and narratives that challenge the
'truth' of the assumptions and understandings that shape this
discourse]{.underline}**. Thus the analysis of how discursive
**[representations are made 'natural' (through processes of
presupposition, predication, pre/proscription, articulation,
interpellation, and (re)production)]{.underline}** also requires
engagement with how identities and categorisation in discourse are
contingent and how the assumptions of, and knowledge offered in,
**[particular [discourses are not 'natural' but
constructed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I use analytical methods of
juxtaposition and deconstruction to demonstrate that the world can be
interpreted differently from the world as it is discursively constructed
in official US 'War on Terror' discourse. Using textual analysis to
interrogate the basic assumptions of texts (deconstruction) and drawing
on alternative representations of events, issues, or identities that are
not acknowledged in this discourse ( juxtaposition), I seek to unsettle
the privileged knowledge that informs official US 'War on Terror'
discourse.

### Discourse shapes realities

#### Studies prove that representations that demonize the Other increase the likelihood of conflict by providing justification for aggressive military action.

The filter presented by media coverage exists on a number of levels;
however, the scope of this article focuses only on two aspects: the lack
of complexity, and the lack of humanity. **[In the first instance the
[presentation of]{.mark} the [state in]{.mark} the [form of]{.mark} a
mono[lithic entity leads to]{.mark} the [reduction of]{.mark} its [human
component]{.mark}, in terms of citizenry and culture, to a single
representative individual.]{.underline}** This figurehead, as we have
seen has been the case with **[[figures]{.mark} [such as Putin]{.mark},
Assad, Kim, Hussein]{.underline}**, [[becomes]{.mark} an easy [target
for]{.mark} media [demonization]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[The [danger
lies in]{.mark} the possibility [that by]{.mark} [presenting this
figure]{.mark} as both representative of the state, and [as]{.mark} a
[personification of clear black and white]{.mark} [morality, it becomes
easy for]{.mark} the media's [audience]{.mark} to come [to view]{.mark}
the [state]{.mark} itself, and by extension the citizens of that state
[as extensions]{.mark} [of]{.mark} this clear [black and white
morality]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [**This [tendency is
exacerbated]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}]{.underline} the second element of
**[[sidelining representation of]{.mark} the wider population and their
[culture]{.mark} and instead focusing only on affairs of
state]{.underline}**: security, politics, economic issues, etc.
**[[There is strong evidence that]{.mark} these [patterns]{.mark} are
likely to [produce greater acceptance for military action, especially if
framed as]{.mark} a '[just']{.mark} act of retribution for moral
transgressions]{.underline}**. Berinsky (2007) found that [[citizens
are]{.mark} most [strongly influenced by]{.mark} elite attitudes,
typically expressed through **[mass media promotion]{.mark}** of the
opinions of professed policy experts, [in deciding whether to
support]{.mark} or oppose **[military action]{.mark}. When these
messages are framed in terms of good versus evil, or as confronting a
foreign villain, there is an even stronger tendency to offer
unconditional support**]{.underline} (Liberman, 2006). **[These
[patterns are tied to our]{.mark} deep-seated [distrust of 'the
other',]{.mark} especially when tied to a sense of anger or
hostility]{.underline}** (Kim, 2014). **[Additionally, [when the 'out
group' is perceived as a cohesive whole there is a]{.mark} heightened
[desire to]{.mark} achieve retribution or [inflict
punishment]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Liberman & Skitka, 2019). Clearly
**[these patterns can only be enhanced by both media personification of
the state as a whole in the form of the all powerful
leader]{.underline}**, **[and through the lack of awareness
of]{.underline}** the diversity and humanity of the state's citizenry
that exists as a side effect of distorted and imbalanced thematic
framing of the state in question. The analysis here clearly shows
certain trends at play in how different states are covered. **[Despite
each state's importance in world affairs they are treated differently by
the media.]{.underline}** This is, of course, perfectly natural as,
depending upon their size, relationships and policies, they will play
different roles, and have a greater or larger impact on specific areas
of news because of this. In other words, it is understandable, to an
extent, that an imbalance in fields of coverage exists. **[Nonetheless,
the [manner in which they are represented]{.mark} will have an impact on
public perceptions and these will, in turn, [have an impact on]{.mark}
how the public responds to [calls for aggressive military]{.mark} or
political responses to the states in question, potentially
[making]{.mark} such [military responses more tempting]{.mark} as a
first, rather than last, response]{.underline}**. From the results,
there appears to be a clear correlation between a state's status as
either threat or ally and its media representation. In the case of
Japan, there is a significantly higher focus of media attention on
cultural stories that reflect the more human or natural aspects of the
country, and an inversely weak tendency to focus on its leader. In this
case, Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan, is not simply a temporary
state leader. He has been in power longer than the five preceding Prime
Minister's combined and was Japan's preceding Prime Minster before those
five took power. He is, by far, the most dominant figure in twenty-first
century Japanese politics yet he is comparatively rarely the focus of
Western reporting on his country despite his involvement in a number of
political scandals that might have further justified such attention. The
argument might be made that, unlike Putin and Xi, Abe is not an
authoritarian leader. Yet in the same two year period, King Salman of
Saudi Arabia, a Western ally despite his authoritarian rule, features
just once in headlines from the New York Times (a 300:1 ratio against
headlines featuring the state name) and five times in the Guardian (a
40:1 ratio). In the same manner, Japan's general populace, its social
issues and its culture receive greater attention despite the fact that
both China and Russia have equally rich, vibrant societies capable of
providing ample fodder for interesting and illuminating articles. Even
in regard to more neutral 'news' stories, focusing on criminal events,
natural disasters or reporting of unusual occurrences, there is a clear
discrepancy in the amount of coverage Japan receives in comparison to
the other states. It is hard to say whether such trends are a deliberate
pattern designed to produce specific reactions in the audience or an
unconscious bias that exists within the media itself, leading them to
shy away from the investigation of and reporting on more human-oriented
news regarding countries commonly perceived as threats. The reasons for
the tendency among journalists and their host organizations to do this
is something that might be examined in future research. The important
factor is that a bias in the presentation of these countries does exist
and it is one that is likely to contribute to the adoption of more
two-dimensional, monolithic, institutionally-oriented perceptions of the
states in question that exacerbate the natural tendency of audiences to
view foreign nations with a higher level of suspicion and moral
certitude than they do their own. **[As such, [in times]{.mark} of high
tension, [where]{.mark} the possibility of [military conflict]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} the [West and]{.mark} these [states becomes a]{.mark}
real [possibility]{.mark}, the [patterns employed by]{.mark} the
[media]{.mark} in such coverage are likely to [allow military
options]{.mark}, which should always be a last recourse, [to be adopted
with]{.mark} greater [ease]{.mark} and acceptance than they otherwise
might. The institutions of the media have a powerful and important role,
both within their host societies and beyond.]{.underline}** They have
the power to promote greater understanding and awareness among the
states of the world by highlighting the appeal of foreign cultures, and
the social patterns that reveal the common bonds of humanity that are
shared by diverse people. **[That the [media is moving in a different
direction that]{.mark} limits such awareness-raising solely to states
viewed as political allies [is not simply a missed opportunity
for]{.mark} enhancing [global stability and peace, but a]{.mark}
dangerous [trend that is likely to increase]{.mark} the likelihood of
future [conflict]{.mark}s by seizing upon military action as a
justifiable default response to perceived transgressions, rather than a
policy of last resort.]{.underline}**

### AT binary DA

#### Orientalism is not binary-its dogmas can include a wide range of variations and serves to be a hegemonic discourse between the west and the other, rather than the West and East.

In an essay surveying the impact of Edward Said's seminal text
Orientalism1 on film studies, Gerald Sim claims that "there are few film
scholars who demonstrate command of Said's full thesis," and that the
focus has primarily been on Orientalism's Foucauldian pedigree, at the
expense of its humanist and Marxist sources.2 **[[A common critique of
Orientalism is that it]{.mark} [suffers from the same essentialist
binarism that its author identified in Orientalist
discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}**.3 I shall argue instead that **[[Said's
analysis is more nuanced than is often implied]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
while **[[remaining a fairly]{.mark} [clear paradigm]{.mark} that can
help to both locate patterns within Western]{.underline}** film
**[representations of the East and [evaluate degrees of conformance to
Orientalist stereotypes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In particular, I shall
examine exoticism as a fundamental ingredient in Orientalist fiction,
one defined by a paradoxical interplay between attraction and repulsion
that reveals an inherent ambivalence towards the Orient. Superficial
readings of Orientalism have overlooked exoticism's ambivalent nature,
and thus partially misunderstood the West's fantasy about Asian cities
such as Shanghai and Singapore as idealized, imaginary spaces.

The commercial sea trade between China and America in the mid-nineteenth
century involved the use of clipper ships anchored at ports on the West
Coast of the United States. Trips across the Pacific Ocean could include
an outbound journey from San Francisco to Shanghai, allowing some
Chinese men to return home after they had made enough money from the
California Gold Rush of 1849, and an inbound journey featuring a cargo
of tea, silk, porcelain, spices, and other goods purchased in China. The
speedy clipper could have as many as thirty-five sails, requiring extra
hands to operate them, which became problematic for boarding masters
when sailors decided to jump ship and prospect for gold instead of
unfurling acres of canvas. The resulting shortage of skilled labour led
to the widespread practice of forcibly kidnapping men to serve as
sailors, known as crimping or shanghaiing. Various techniques were used,
from serving drinks spiked with drugs, to knocking people over the head,
as portrayed in the film Shanghaied (Charlie Chaplin, 1915). Shanghaiing
was made illegal in 1915 by the US Congress with the Seamen's Act, but
by that point the association between kidnapping by rendering someone
unconscious and heading for Asia had been cemented in the popular
imagination. To be **[shanghaied has also come to designate a general
sense of disorientation caused by the mysteries of the
Orient]{.underline}** and, more specifically, to refer to the Western
male's fear (or fantasy) of being overpowered by a dragon lady in
Chinatown.

I shall refer to Euro-American narrative fiction films set in Singapore,
particularly the Bette Davis film The Letter (William Wyler, 1940) and
the recent action thriller Hitman: Agent 47 (Aleksander Bach, 2015), to
illustrate **[the aforementioned Orientalist alternation between fear
and desire]{.underline}**, and to underscore the point that **[[Said's
model does in fact provide opportunities for a multi-dimensional study
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** filmic **[[texts]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Singapore was chosen in part due to its multi-ethnic identity, composed
primarily of diasporan Chinese originally from coastal provinces such as
Guangdong, Fujian, and elsewhere, as well as Malays and Tamils. This
diverse mix more easily reveals the artifice of Orientalism, given the
tendency to portray the East with a broad stroke, which in Hollywood
films can create the impression that Singapore is an ethnically
homogenous Chinese city similar to Hong Kong, for instance. The
historical contexts in which these films were produced and the periods
they represent (Singapore as a wild, nineteenth-century Eastern port, a
colonial entrepôt for the export of rubber in the thirties, a modern
banking centre in the nineties, etc.), can also be a significant
parameter in gauging variations, not so much in the degree of empirical
misrepresentation of Singapore, but rather in the Westerner's
self-perception visà-vis the East. Focusing exclusively and
systematically on depictions of a single location rather than
cherry-picking films set in different Asian countries should be a useful
way to assess the variety of genres that engage in Orientalist
discourse. My research has uncovered over seventy feature-length
narrative fiction films set in Singapore, but since the present article
is concerned mainly with the application of Saidian dogmas to film, an
exhaustive analysis of the Orientalist Singapore filmography cannot be
included, although it is hoped that the sampled films, specifically the
classic melodrama and contemporary action films mentioned above, will
provide a sense of why Singapore has been one of the main exotic
destinations in the history of Hollywood cinema. Other such locales
include Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tangier, Casablanca, Calcutta, Macao, and
Istanbul, all of which "provide a suitably romantic, mysterious and
colourful background for thrillers, adventure films and romantic dramas,
a sort of composite Orient."5 Singapore was a privileged trading hub in
the British Empire that inspired many literary and filmic narratives
embodying Said's dogmas, whereas Shanghai, as a frequent non-stop
destination for American sailors in the nineteenth century, has the
added distinction of functioning as a verb, especially in its passive
form, that refers broadly to what might be termed the Orientalist peril.

It must be noted that, in spite of the significant influence of Said's
Orientalism on the development of post-colonial studies, references to
this text in the film studies literature are uneven. Film scholars have
usually engaged in textual analyses focusing on stereotypical
representations of Asian cultures and peoples, often with a brief
acknowledgement of Said's foundational work, but without addressing its
specific arguments directly.6 One exception might be Ella Shohat and
Robert Stam's Unthinking Eurocentrism, although this changes the terms
as well as the scope of the analysis, on the grounds that Eurocentrism
is the broader concept, which includes not only East--West but also
North--South relations, as well as relations with Indigenous Nations.7
**[However, [there has been little attempt to discuss Said's own summary
of his argument]{.mark}, namely [the four dogmas of
Orientalism,]{.mark}]{.underline}** a **[[list of themes or cultural
stereotypes]{.mark} [that]{.mark} actually [describe]{.mark}
[Eurocentrism]{.mark} quite well]{.underline}**.8 In fact, Shohat and
Stam provide a partial (and unacknowledged) response of sorts to Said's
dogmas, as a kind of complementary mirror image of or flip side to
Orientalism, in the form of five "mutually reinforcing intellectual
tendencies" that describe Eurocentric discourse.9 Ironically perhaps,
the conceptual breadth of these tendencies is narrower than that of
Said's dogmas, because they focus almost exclusively on Western
political history (specifically, on the enduring co-presence of
democracy and totalitarianism), eliding other social and cultural
institutions. In contrast, Said himself had already engaged in a similar
terminological broadening a year prior to the publication of Shohat and
Stam's study, when he released Culture and Imperialism (1993). In this
self-described sequel to Orientalism, **[[Said]{.mark} [provides]{.mark}
another [list of five themes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, meant
**[[to]{.mark} [outline the ideological relationships between culture
and imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, drawn from a number of
disciplines, including ethnography, history, and literary studies.10

The fact that Said's four dogmas are listed on pages 300--301 of
Orientalism may in itself partly explain why the dogmas have been
overlooked, perhaps by impatient scholars expecting to extract the
essence of an important book's argument in its introduction. The
**[[first dogma establishes the Orient's incommensurable difference
from]{.mark}, and inferiority to, [the]{.mark}
[Occident]{.mark}.]{.underline}** These are the two key features of
Orientalist discourse, according to Said, and arguably the most
controversial: **[[its]{.mark} [stark binarism and its axiological
nature]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Not surprisingly, this also happens to be
the first theme mentioned in Culture and Imperialism. We may note that
here the **[[opposition]{.mark} [is]{.mark} no longer between the West
and the East]{.underline}** exclusively, **[but [between the West and
the rest]{.mark}:]{.underline}**

On the fundamental ontological distinction between the West and the rest
of the world there is no disagreement. **[[So strongly]{.mark} felt and
[perceived]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [the]{.mark} geographical and cultural
[boundaries]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [West]{.mark} [and its
non-Western peripheries]{.mark} that we may consider [these boundaries
absolute]{.mark}]{.underline}**.11

The **[[binarism allows one to polarize Orientalism further by
overlaying the civilizational distinction between East and
West,]{.underline}]{.mark}** which by default includes religion and
race, by adding other categories of identity such as gender, class, and
sexuality. So **[[one could line up the binaries mentioned in all four
dogmas,]{.underline}]{.mark}** creating two columns of adversarial
terms. The West is of course associated with the Self, and described as
good, rational, developed, humane, superior, modern, scientific,
diverse, and safe, whereas the East is the domain of the Other, and can
only be bad, aberrant, undeveloped, savage, inferior, primitive,
superstitious, uniform, and dangerous.

**[[Listing]{.mark} these paired terms [shows how different they
are]{.mark}]{.underline}**, how they refer to different concepts that
range from identifying types of economic development, modes of knowledge
acquisition, moral behaviour, and so forth. This may strike one as an
informal list of features, but the [**[common
thread]{.underline}**,]{.mark} indeed the structuring principle, of
these varied terms **[[is the assignment of]{.mark} [positive and
negative values]{.mark},]{.underline}** which is meant **[to [highlight
the hegemonic quality of Orientalism]{.mark},]{.underline}** as a
political discourse that seeks to justify its will to dominate others.
**[[Said's primary aim]{.mark} was [to expose the binarism of
Orientalism as an axiological]{.mark} rather than a logical
system]{.underline}**. It does not necessarily follow that the apparent
binarism of his own method, which is partly a rhetorical matter,
represents a contradiction. It may help to recall that **[[he explicitly
rejects the notion of]{.mark} [Occidentalism]{.mark},]{.underline}** for
instance, **[[as an equally essentialist and symmetrical response
to]{.mark} [Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which can only support
belligerent ideas such as the Clash of Civilizations.12

There has been a lot of research done on China within the academic field
of security studies. [[Researchers]{.mark} have [studied the]{.mark}
**[Western view of China]{.mark}** from both critical and non-critical
perspectives. Some [research is a **Western attempt to
understand**]{.mark} and predict the tactics and [strategies used by
China]{.mark}. Ratner (2011) argues that it is important to look at the
Chinese government through different perspectives, and not only
strategic ones, and tries to perceive the emergent security threats
which China will have to handle in the future. Zhang (2019) investigates
how the PRC use coercion, both military and non-violent coercion as a
tactic against other states in the South China Sea. Saunders (2020)
explores China's strategies and calculations when it comes to their
national security.]{.underline} [He looks at aspects such as their
**modernisation of their military** as well as their international and
regional cooperation and diplomacy in both military and other [security
fields]{.mark} to [analyse how China is trying to secure]{.mark} its
strong [position in]{.mark} the [world order]{.mark}. [The focus is on
how China is protecting]{.mark} its [national interests]{.mark} overseas
[by looking]{.mark} at their [military]{.mark} [strategies]{.mark}, and
their peacekeeping operations to better understand China's
behaviour]{.underline} (Saunders 2020). Overall, these **[[studies do
not tell us]{.mark} that [much about China, as they are]{.mark} still
[from]{.mark} a [Western perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Other
studies about China focuses on how the West views China. Möller (2007)
gives an account of how the West has researched China from the 80s until
the early 2000s. He looks at how the debates have gone from discussing
multipolarity to China's rise, and conclude that the research has been
dominated by different strands of thought at different times: The
evolution of the European debate over two decades points to an early
dominance of Sinological exceptionalists, followed by a challenge by
"internationalists" that pulled the Sinologists back in conceptional
terms, followed in turn by the emergence of constructivism that provided
the Sinologists with an excuse to once again turn exceptionalist (Möller
2007, 183). Hook, through a descriptive study, gives an account of how
the British threat perception of China has changed and developed from
1945-2000, with a focus on Hong Kong and how the handover of Hong Kong
to China affected it (Hook 2004). Roy (1996, 758) conducted a literature
review over the different arguments on the pro-China vs anti-China
stances politically. [[Focusing on]{.mark} the China threat, the
arguments he presents concern regional instability and [how China could
transform into a superpower]{.mark} which would [increase]{.mark} both
their power and [threat level to the West]{.mark}.]{.underline} More
recently, Song (2015) did a securitisation analysis with a
poststructuralist approach and analyses how [the **[West]{.mark}
[securitises China from three different
perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One of the more interesting pieces
of research is by Pan Chengxin (2012), who discusses how, in the current
Western research on the rise of China, China is usually approached
either as a security threat or as a country full of economic
opportunities. Building onto arguments by Said, Clifford, and Geertz
about the autobiographical nature of knowledge, Pan argues that [**most
[studies about China's rise]{.mark}** to power [say more about
how]{.mark} the [West views itself rather than]{.mark} **producing
[actual useful knowledge about China]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[[Two]{.mark} paradigms (or [narratives]{.mark}), opportunity and
threat, [perpetuate]{.mark} the **[East as]{.mark} something [Other to
the West]{.mark}** (Pan 2012, 43). Focusing on this othering, Pan argues
that it "is not so much about treating others as threats per se as it is
about the employment of such discursive tactics as imposition,
reduction, and denial when it comes to understanding other's
subjectivities" (Pan 2012, 56). Furthermore, using the thre[at paradigm
when looking at China tells us]{.mark} about how the West is afraid to
be treated like they have treated others in history; the **[West is
afraid to be colonized]{.mark}, conquered [by China]{.mark}**. This
paradigm is built onto ideas about Western superiority due to knowledge
-- i.e. modernity and technology -- which allows/have allowed them to
justify not only the current world order but also colonisation (Pan
2012, 43ff). Hence, it includes ideas of **Orientalism**, 'the white
man's burden' etc.]{.underline} [[Through representing China as a
monolithic whole]{.mark}, dismissing its subjectivities, and/or imposing
onto it a singular, fixed subjectivity of power politics, [the **"China
threat**" paradigm acts as]{.mark} a [discursive construction of
an]{.mark} **objectified [Other]{.mark}**, cast as an Other and
threatening object, China by definition lacks the kind of rationality
and subjectivity that are characteristic of the Western knowing
subject]{.underline} (Pan 2012, 55).

#### Perceived threats of Chinese technological dominance inaccurate and nonsense -- rather, they are sinotechnophobic projections of Western technological insecurity and an inability to move towards the future.

The role of theory here is to provide the connective tissue of ideas and
concepts to help us perceive the bigger picture and the various
intersections within, changing and moving through time, but anchored
with examples in a material reality that is familiar to us. The role of
theory however is not explain everything perfectly. **[Nevertheless, my
purpose has been to illustrate the role that advancing China as a
technological society has played during its modern development, how this
has in turned been received by others. What we find is that each period
has been deeply entwined with competitive nationalisms and often,
various forms of cultural, political and even racial
discrimination.]{.underline}** **[I have not discussed whether
[Sino(techno)phobia is]{.mark} in some way justified. This is [the
defining concern]{.mark} [among those who]{.mark} assert that [Chinese
tech]{.mark}nology [is dangerous]{.mark}, even without the taint of
Digital Orientalism. To be sure, [Chinese tech]{.mark}nology [can now
compete]{.mark}, and perhaps "win" in a decade or so; [but it did not
start]{.mark} the world [down the path of]{.mark} competitive
nationalism, imperialism or [hegemony]{.mark}, nor did it innovate the
first technological society. [China]{.mark} can still argue that its
[advances have been to secure sovereignty]{.mark} and national wellbeing
and [not hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}**, arguments that are less
credible elsewhere. This is why in part I find **[[arguments]{.mark}
advanced by some [against Huawei]{.mark}, for example, to [be
disingenuous]{.mark}. [Given]{.mark} what we know of actual American
practices---including unregulated tech giants with self-serving agendas
(including selling access to malign and anti-American interests), as
well as [US governmental spying]{.mark} through US-tech based networks,
even on allies, and the fact that after 9/11 that the US government
could access private and academic networks held by American firms and
universities with little to no judicial oversight]{.underline}**---the
**[[blacklisting of Chinese firms because they "might" engage in similar
tactics]{.mark} at some point, [and to characterize this as defending
liberal values]{.mark} against communism, [is]{.mark} complete
[nonsense]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, as others have pointed out,
**[there are constructive ways for [Huawei]{.mark} to [comply with the
cybersecurity laws]{.mark} wherever they do business \[26\],
[and]{.mark} unlike many American firms, [there's no evidence]{.mark}
that [they haven't done so]{.mark}. This is why Mayer and I described
the continuing [US-led campaign]{.mark} [against Huawei]{.mark} as
[exemplify]{.mark}ing [Sino(techno)phobia]{.mark} and Digital
Orientalism \[45\].]{.underline}** I have not discussed whether there is
Chinese fear of Western technology, and how this relates to
Sino(techno)phobia. To be sure, the Chinese are wary of any technology
that compromises sovereignty and security. While the West and
particularly the US have increasingly flirted with the fantasy of
technological autarky, of decoupling from Chinese technology, the same
can be said about China seeking autonomy and independence. **[But it
should be noted that [in the US, it's common to cry loudly of potential
threats]{.mark}, while in China, it's generally taboo to do so unless
those threats can be countered effectively]{.underline}**. That said, we
should acknowledge the increasing trend of technology securitization and
strong fusions between civilian and military technology in both
countries and the mutual fear this creates. **[[Much is made about
China's intention of demonstrating]{.mark} the [superiority of its
system]{.mark} relative to Western forms of liberalism, with such
rhetoric peaking again with what some in the West view as Chinese
triumphalism associated with its successful efforts to contain the
outbreak (e.g., \[80\]). But [this overstates]{.mark} the [role of
ideology in policymaking]{.mark} and pits Marxism spuriously as the
central antagonist in this confrontation \[44\]. [Marxism]{.mark} did
[normalize technological development]{.mark} and the emergence of
China's technological society [as a]{.mark} material [means for
reestablishing sovereignty]{.mark} and security]{.underline}**. But
perhaps today's competition is really located in the extent to which
China as a technological society acknowledges itself for what it is and
then seeks a position of human advancement that transcends or evolves to
a higher stage of existence and well-being---as China claims per it
ambitions to establish itself as a 'fully modern socialist nation.'
**[Conversely, [the West]{.mark}, and more specifically the US, [seem
stuck in time]{.mark} or even regressing, [unable to accept]{.mark} or
manage [changes]{.mark} constructively, unable to normalize the growing
intersections and counterbalances that must exist [with]{.mark}in and
between governance, [technology]{.mark}, social progress and individual
actualization. Too often, [instead of looking inward and finding]{.mark}
the true source of its [problems]{.mark}, and further, how these
problems are not dissimilar from others elsewhere, the [US has
externalized them with Sino(techno)phobia]{.mark} and Digital
Orientalism.]{.underline}** Perhaps the difference between the two
countries is the extent to which they acknowledge and react to their own
totalitarian-oriented surveillance states. In general terms, **[Shoshana
Zuboff gets to this question in part in her book, The Age of
Surveillance Capitalism \[88\], where she asks whether we will be 'the
masters of information and machines or its slaves.' We should be
cautious when applying this thinking to China. Too often [Westerners
equate]{.mark} the [CPC as the inhuman monster wielding]{.mark} inhuman
[technology]{.mark}.]{.underline}** What if the opposite is true: what
is the **[[CPC is the human face that aims to]{.mark} be the
[master]{.mark} of [machines]{.mark} and information, and to do so as
much as possible for the greater good within a social and political
system they believe they were compelled to create in the first place in
order to survive the onslaught of technologically advanced imperial
nations? What if [this human face]{.mark} (or Facebook) [does not
exist]{.mark} at all [in the West]{.mark}, or only limitedly, incapable
of actually confronting or regulating various technological masters that
have become systemically entrenched and the pharmakon of contemporary
life---both the poison and the cure for so many Western
ills?]{.underline}**

### AT: Mainstream IR

#### The affirmative's assurances of "objective" and "scientifically-backed" IR theories mask the underlying orientalist narratives that spur realism as a justification for US hegemony and it's "colonial desire" of China.

**[[Mainstream IR]{.mark} scholarship, [under]{.mark} the [cloak of
objective]{.mark} scientific [knowledge production]{.mark}, thus
[reflects]{.mark} the identity and [interests of the West]{.mark},
specifically the AngloAmerican world, by encouraging its scholars to
exclude non-Western systems of thought and using its theoretical
perspectives [to justify]{.mark} and perpetuate [Western
hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}** (\[42, 95\]: 167--83). Our analysis of
the Self/Other relations in each [mainstream [IR]{.mark} perspective
[suggests]{.mark} that [realist, liberalist, and constructivist]{.mark}
perspectives [are 'problem-solving' approaches]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
opposed to critical approaches (\[18\]: 204--54). To paraphrase Cox's
\[18\] renowned statement --- 'Theory is always for someone and for some
purpose' --- **[mainstream IR theoretical perspectives are always for
great, hegemonic powers and for the purpose of securing an international
system designed for the security and interests of those great hegemonic
powers. [In i]{.mark}nternational [a]{.mark}ffairs, [the Self is the
hegemon]{.mark} (often the West), and [the Other is]{.mark} the
[subordinate]{.mark} (often the Rest). [The Self is]{.mark} the
[proactive]{.mark} subject, [and the Other is a]{.mark} [mere
object]{.mark} to be controlled by the Self for the Other's own good.
[The Other's subjectivity is often]{.mark} missing or
[ignored]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Normatively and meta-theoretically,
**[this way of thinking is tied to logocentrism, 'which at once
differentiates one term from another, prefers one to the other, and
arranges them hierarchically, displacing the subordinate term beyond the
boundary of what is significant and desirable in context']{.underline}**
(\[36\]: xvi). From Plato through to the present time, **[[logocentrism
has been]{.mark} the domi[nant mode of producing meaning in
West]{.mark}ern culture]{.underline}**. In the context of Jacques
Derrida, Delanty \[21\] says that **[[logocentrism is
ethnocentric]{.mark} [because it privileges Western thought over
all]{.mark} other forms of thought and makes Western reason the sole
criterion for 'correct and universal' knowledge]{.underline}**. It is
easily discernible that logocentrism is theoretically akin to Said's
\[93\] notion of Orientalism, which notices the Orient as the most
recurring image of the Other, the West's 'contrasting image, idea,
personality, and experience' that helps to define what the 'West' is. In
critical IR literature on China, Chengxin Pan's study on Western
representations of China's rise is particularly illuminating. In
Knowledge, Desire, and Power in Global Politics \[82\], Pan first
provocatively asserts that 'China watching rarely watches itself'. **[He
argues that [although it is]{.mark} commonly [held as 'objective
truth']{.mark}, [Western knowledge of China]{.mark}'s rise [is]{.mark}
in fact [less about 'China'; rather]{.mark}, it is [a reflection]{.mark}
of 'a certain [Western self-imagination]{.mark} and its quest for
certainty and identity']{.underline}** (\[82\]: viii). **[Pan then
persuasively demonstrates the ways in which two prominent Western
'paradigms' -- namely: [China the 'threat']{.mark} and China the
'opportunity' -- [have steered]{.mark} and shaped [Western
understandings of China]{.mark}, determining 'certain acceptable ways of
making sense of China and facilitate the production of knowledge along
those lines']{.underline}** (\[82\]: 22). **[To him, [these]{.mark} two
[paradigms are produced by]{.mark} a [longstanding 'colonial desire' of
the West]{.mark} towards China.]{.underline}** Whereas 'the 'China
threat' paradigm bears the stamp of fears, the 'China opportunity'
paradigm can be best seen as manifestations of modern fantasies'
(\[82\]: 16). In addition, the presumed superiority of the West over its
Others suggests that only one single (Western) path leads to the end
form of human civilisation or history \[31\], that is, the one
represented by Western civilisation. Western civilisation is thus
understood to be not only different from its Eastern counterpart, but
far superior to it. **[Western-centrism in this sense is prescriptively
built upon the assumption that the totality of Western culture is
universal. [External]{.mark} geographical or cultural
[differences]{.mark} thus [come to be represented as Others that could
constitute a threat to Western universality]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
such a Manichaean world of morality, th**[e Self and the Other are
essentially different, and the temptation is strong to translate
Self/Other into a logocentric good/evil binary framework that provides a
moral basis for conquest, conversion, and socialisation]{.underline}**.
IR **[[examples]{.mark} of this [are]{.mark} US President Ronald
[Regan's use of 'evil empire']{.mark} to describe the Soviet Union in
1983 [and]{.mark} US President George W. [Bush's]{.mark} 2002 State of
the Union [Address describing Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as the 'axis
of evil]{.mark}]{.underline}**.' Thus, the logic of conquest,
conversion, and socialisation when dealing with Others is often
justified by stealth in mainstream IR perspectives. **[[Realism]{.mark},
liberalism, and constructivism never provide value-free IR knowledge;
rather, they [are normative theories for the
hegemon]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Logocentrism and Orientalism have here
been shown to constitute the hidden normative underpinning of those
mainstream IR theoretical perspectives. As Pan \[81\] rightly noted, the
**[US perception of the Other (i.e., China) as a threat is closely
linked to how US policymakers see themselves 'as representatives of the
indispensable, security-conscious nation]{.underline}**.' By tracing
mainstream IR's understanding, explanation, and interpretation of its
practices, we have shown how logocentrism and Orientalism manifest
themselves in the discipline. Therefore, in the rest of this article, we
turn to a case study --- the rise of China --- to examine our
deliberation of Self-Other relations in world politics and test our
initial proposition about the mechanisms through which and the
conditions under which Self-Other relations function when theorising
about international relations.

### AT threats are real

#### Psychological studies have proven inherent biases within security studies that exaggerate Eastern threats in order to justify War on Terror-esque interventions to crush the Orientalist "threats" and sustain the liberal world order.

[2.2 Threats and Orientalism in Security Studies]{.underline} One of the
most known ideas about threats comes from securitization theory, coined
by Buzan, Weaver and de Wilde, which theorises how issues become
security threats, and connects that to political action. [[Something is
securitised if it "is presented]{.mark} [as]{.mark} an
[existential]{.mark} threat, requiring emergency measures and justifying
actions outside the normal bounds of political procedure" (Buzan, Wæver,
and Wilde 1998, 24). [If]{.mark} an issue is securitised, [it is
constructed as a threat]{.mark} through speech acts by an authority
figure and is accepted as such by the audience; [it does not need to be
a **'real'**]{.mark} **existential [threat]{.mark}** in a sense, [but it
needs to be presented]{.mark} and accepted by the audience [as
such]{.mark}.]{.underline} Another comprehension on the perception of
threats comes from Janice Gross Stein (2013) who connects the findings
of cognitive psychologists with the study of threat perception,
particularly the rationalist idea that inaccurate threat perceptions
come from noncredible signals which then result in war and armed
conflicts. [Building onto ideas by [Meyer]{.mark}, she looks at both the
individual, as well as at the state-level in her theoretical development
and connects emotions and pre-existing ideas with rational information
processing. She [argues]{.mark} that the [evidence shows]{.mark} the
[importance of existing beliefs when it comes to threat
perception]{.mark} as "people strongly prefer consistency, that they are
made uncomfortable by dissonant information, and that they consequently
deny or discount inconsistent information to preserve their beliefs"
(Stein 2013, 372). [Hence, **there exists**]{.mark} **a [bias]{.mark}**
[in how much]{.mark} importance and [trust]{.mark} the [subject put
in]{.mark} some [information versus other forms of information,
and]{.mark} how this [leads to]{.mark} **[incomplete generalisations
which impact leaders judgement]{.mark}** (Stein 2013,
365ff).]{.underline} Mitzen (2006) coined the concept of ontological
security, security of the self or identity security, and linked it to
the spacialisation of time. "Ontological security refers to the need to
experience oneself as a whole, continuous person in time --- as being
rather than constantly changing --- in order to realize a sense of
agency" (Mitzen 2006, 342). [Drawing on the work of Anthony Giddens and
Lisbeth Aggestam, Mitzen argues that **[ontological security]{.mark}**
can [serve as a motivation for]{.mark} actions, and fulfil both
individuals as well as [nation-states need for stability]{.mark} and
helps define the self through the action of others (Mitzen 2006, 344,
357). [This]{.mark} also [one of the **key** ideas in
**techno-Orientalism**]{.mark}.]{.underline} One example of how
Orientalism has been used in connection to security studies can be seen
in Patrick Porter's book Military Orientalism. [Porter (2013) argues
that the [Eastern way to make]{.mark} war [is **exotified**]{.mark} and
that the [differences between]{.mark} the [East and]{.mark} the [West
are **exaggerated through Orientalism**]{.mark} (Porter 2013, 18).
[Porter combines]{.mark} the concept of [Orientalism with]{.mark} the
military and connects the [West's fascination with]{.mark} so-called
**'[Eastern' ways of war]{.mark}** with its own identity
creation]{.underline}, building directly on Said's logic. [Another
study, by Hobson (2012), offers a theoretical orientalist critique of
the Eurocentric perspectives in [international theory]{.mark} which
[assume]{.mark} that [there is]{.mark} a [need for intervention
by]{.mark} the [West]{.mark} in the East, [to]{.mark} contain and
[secure a **liberal world order**]{.mark} with the West as the top form
of civilisation (Hobson 2012, 129). He particularly criticises
post-modern theorists like Foucault and Baudrillard for **ignoring
Eastern agency**, and argues that they are guilty of **exaggerating the
West's power and unity**, and thus "failing to recognize the interactive
relationship between East and West, precisely because of Said's
conception of Orientalism/Eurocentrism rests on the Self/Other
identity-formation process that Foucault first emphasized" (Hobson 2012,
133]{.underline}). Bassil (2019) looks at and criticises the orientalist
discourse in the West which concern the Islamic State, and the violence
the group have perpetrated, and how this discourse contributes to a
deeply racist and problematic narrative about the people in and from the
Orient as well as of the religion Islam. [[Another example of]{.mark}
how [Orientalist discourse]{.mark} has been studied [in security
studies]{.mark} [is]{.mark} Maryam Khalid's book Gender, Orientalism,
and [the 'War on Terror']{.mark} which looks at the presence of
**gendered orientalist ideas** in the [Bush]{.mark} regime's [creation
of]{.mark} the War on Terror, specifically on the construction of [Iraq
and Afghanistan as the evil enemy]{.mark}, and how that
[justified]{.mark} the U[.S. intervention]{.mark} in those countries.
She concludes that Orientalism is a gendered discourse which cement
representations as facts, and understanding that "uncovers a system of
representations that produces and renders intelligible specific
categories such as 'East', 'Arab', 'Muslim', 'West', 'Civilised', and
'barbaric', and organises them according to binary logics, and in
hierarchical ways" (Khalid 2017, 152). [She argues]{.mark} that the
['War on Terror' discourse]{.mark} created a link between the Taliban
and Saddam Hussein which [was built]{.mark} [on]{.mark} a gendered
[understanding of]{.mark} the **[Orientalist Other's desire and
nature]{.mark}**, which included a feminine characteristic like
irrationality and tied it to the Oriental masculinity. [These
ideas]{.mark} helped create [a narrative of]{.mark} how a [barbaric form
of masculinity was set]{.mark} out [to **destroy**]{.mark} **the
[civilised Western world]{.mark}** (Khalid 2017, 155).]{.underline}

#### Impossible for realism to explain every political action, the political myth is inherently layered and necessitates epistemological analysis.

**[When it comes to understanding the crucial political events of our
epoch]{.underline}**[, **[there is a temptation to believe that meaning
is intrinsic and \"facts speak for themselves]{.underline}**]{.mark}\"
(Jackson, 2005). **[[This]{.mark}, of course, [is never actually the
case]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In reality, **[[meaning is layered upon a
narrative]{.underline}]{.mark}** after the fact like Technicolor added
to a black and white film. The process **[of la[yering meaning over a
narrative is complex and conteste]{.mark}d;]{.underline}** **[it
[mythologizes the narrative]{.mark} [so that it holds shared
significance for a group]{.mark}. [This is the process of work on
political myth]{.mark}]{.underline}**; and it is ongoing because
**[significance is never agreed upon once and for all]{.underline}**.
Bottici and Challand (2006) defined **[political myth as \"[the
continual process of work on]{.mark} a common [narrative]{.mark} by
which the [members]{.mark} of a social group [can provide
significance]{.mark} to their political conditions and
experience]{.underline}**\" (p. 320). Political myth **[[operates within
all political cultures]{.underline}]{.mark}**, regardless of how
\"demythologized\" or \"enlightened\" a group may consider itself.
**[[Myth responds to the fundamental need to create significance in a
chaotic and perhaps indifferent world]{.underline}]{.mark}**; thus,
**[[all societies have a myth]{.mark}ical dimen sion,]{.underline}** but
what they differ in is the degree to which myth is exposed to critical
discussion (Bottici & Challand, 2006). **[[An understanding of political
myth can shed light on the]{.mark} [intersection of political
discourse]{.mark} and political practice [and provide insight into the
psychology of legitimization in]{.mark} political
[discourse.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Orientalism is not just a narrative, it is a political myth---Myths are particularly dangerous in its way to create power and damage from language alone

Joanne **Esch 10**\[Joanne Esch, Ph.D. candidate who specializes in
organizational communication and communication practices of law and
policy at the university of Boulder Colorado, \"Legitimizing the \"War
on Terror\": Political Myth in Official-Level Rhetoric on JSTOR\", June
2010, Political Psychology Vol. 31, No. 3, International Society of
Political Psychology,
https://www-jstor-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/stable/20721298?sid=primo,
1LEE\]

**[[Myth ought to be approached from a phenomenological
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}** that leaves aside the question of the
\"reality of myth\" and instead **[[focuses]{.mark} [on the
process]{.mark} through which a social group adapts and readapts a
common narrative]{.underline}** so that it **[l[ends significance to
their political conditions and experience]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Bottici, 2007). Thus, this study makes no attempt to determine the
extent to which mythical representations of the world actually reflect
the \"true nature\" of reality.

**[[Three key attributes]{.mark} distinguish a political myth from a
simple narrative]{.underline}**: First, a mythical narrative provides
significance. Second, it is shared by a group and (re)produced at
various levels. Third, it can come to affect the political conditions of
the group (Bottici, 2007).

**[[Significance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Myth is a product of the
endless human attempt to minimize chaos]{.underline}** and master the
unknown. While myth sometimes has religious roots and connotations,
**[it is not exclusively a religious phenomenon.]{.underline}** As
Bottici (2007), Cassirer (1973), and others have pointed out,
**[[myth]{.mark} [answers]{.mark} [a call for significance that goes
beyond the simplest form of meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}** (wherever
there is language there is meaning) but stops short of providing
ultimate meaning in matters of life and death (this is the realm of
religion). Blumenberg (1985) conceived of significance as a grounding
that draws events and narratives closer to the individual and renders
them less indifferent to him or her. Unlike science**[, myth [does not
simply describe the world]{.mark};]{.underline}** by providing
significance, **[it helps us [reduce the world\'s
complexity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Blumenberg (1985) has highlighted the
difference between making sense and making significance in order to
explain the functional difference between science and myth: science
explains phenomena and can be universal, while myth brings the phenomena
closer to us and is always particular. Bottici (2007) has summa rized
what I will call the \"proximization\" function of myth by explaining,
\"While something can have a meaning but I can still remain completely
indifferent to it, something that has significance is something that I
feel \'close\' to\" (p. 124). What is myth for one person may simply be
a story for another or even for the same person at a different point in
time.

**[[Work on Myth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The second aspect that
distinguishes myth from narrative is that **[[myth is
interrelational]{.underline}]{.mark}**\--it is borne within a web of
relationships in which **[it is [continually (re)produced,
(re)interpreted, and (re)transmitted]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Blumenberg
(1985) understood myth as work on myth\--that is, as **[a continual
process of reworking by narrators and perceivers]{.underline}** who can
scarcely be distinguished from one another**[. [Myths are not singular
entities]{.mark}]{.underline}** stated or written at one point in time;
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** rather, **[[living entities that always
relate to the present]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The process of work on
myth takes place at innumerable sites: art, speech, rituals, and social
practices being only a few examples (Bottici & Challand, 2006). Myth is
also condensational\--it can be compressed into symbols and words, and
these condensed fragments can then recall an entire body of work on a
given myth (Bottici & Challand, 2006). **[Cumulative exposure to the
work on myth thus allows it to frame our understanding of the world
without our consideration or even awareness.]{.underline}**
Additionally, as a consequence of the interrelational and ever evolving
nature of myth, there are often many variations of myth built around one
central mythical core. While this paper focuses on the utility of
(reproduc ing myth at the level of official rhetoric, it must be
understood that this is only one of many sites for work on myth.

[**[The Power of Myth.]{.underline}**]{.mark} The **[[third aspect of
the definition of political myth is that it addresses the political
conditions and experiences of a group]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Political
myths frame our perception of the world and shape how we feel about it;
consequently, **[they help determine how we act within it]{.underline}**
(Bottici & Challand, 2006). They s**[hape political practice by giving
language its reality-making effect]{.underline}**. Scholars such as
Jackson (2005) and Wilmer (2002) have pointed out that wars cannot be
fought without a widespread willingness in society, and social will
ingness requires a shared understanding of circumstances and
significance, which is constructed through language. Language and
practice are two sides of the same coin, and **[political [myth]{.mark}
[has]{.mark} [an exceptional ability to give power to
language]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

Iyengar\'s (1991) idea that **[[rhetoric \"frames\"
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}** so as to offer the addressee implicit
contexts for understanding information provides some insight into
myth\'s utility for policy legitimization. Frames reside in the types of
key words, metaphors, concepts, and symbols speakers choose to emphasize
in their narratives (Entman, 1993). Thus, the use of linguistic cues to
encourage addressees to perceive events through the lens of a particular
myth may be understood as a type of framing.**[3 Words may become
mythically encoded]{.underline}** and **[th[en serve as key words or
lexical triggers.]{.mark}]{.underline}** When used in rhetoric, these
words [a**[llow a myth to serve as an implicit frame of reference for
understanding the given narrative]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Thus**[, [myth
is subtle]{.mark} because it is condensable]{.underline}**. As Flood
(1996) explains,

Myths do not\... have to be recounted in extenso in order to function as
elements of political discourse. **[Myths can be evoked by
labels]{.underline}** (\"the Aryan myth!\"),
**[watchwords]{.underline}** and **[slogans]{.underline}** (\"Workers of
the world, unite!\"), metonymic **[allusions]{.underline}** (\"the
Vietnam syndrome\"), **[echoes]{.underline}** or **[quo
tations]{.underline}** (\"I cannot tell a lie\").. . \[E\]ven single
words such as \"Liberty,\" \"Free Enterprise,\" or \"Communism\" can
carry a range of associations with widely accepted, ideologically
slanted accounts of historical events, (p. 85)

For this reason**[, [language that carries mythical connotations gives
meaning to statements that goes beyond what is actually
said]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Such mythical connotations often
preclude certain responses.]{.underline}** For example, deeming someone
\"a Fascist\" renders the idea of negotiating with that person absurd
and irresponsible because the word is loaded with mythical associations
as broad as \"evil\" and as specific as \"the historical lesson of the
1938 Munich Agreement.\"**[4 [Language that contains condensed fragments
of myth can thus have powerful consequences for social processes and
structures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By influencing our perception,
cognition, and emotions, linguistic recollection of political myth can
deeply affect what we consider to be legitimate, making myth a pivotal
intersection of discourse and political practice. As Bottici and
Challand (2006) put it, \"a political myth is not simply a prophecy, but
it tends rather to become a self-fulfilling prophecy\" (p. 329).

#### The 1ac's fear politics endorses a process of othering resulting in constant hate crimes and aggression toward 'The Other'

**[[Fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** is arguably as old as life. It is deeply
ingrained in the living organisms that have survived extinction through
billions of years of evolution. Its roots are **[[deep in our]{.mark}
core psychological and biological [being]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and it
is one of our most intimate feelings. **[Danger and war]{.underline}**
are as old as human history, and so are **[politics and
religion.]{.underline}** Demagogues have always used fear for
intimidation of the subordinates or enemies, and shepherding the tribe
by the leaders. **[Fear is a very [strong tool]{.mark} that can blur
humans' logic and [change]{.mark} their
[behavior]{.mark}.]{.underline}** I am a psychiatrist and neuroscientist
specializing in fear and trauma, and I have some evidence-based thoughts
on how fear is abused in politics. We learn fear from tribe mates Like
other animals, we **[humans]{.underline}** can **[learn fear from
experience]{.underline}**, such as being attacked by a predator. We
**[also learn from observation]{.underline}**, such as witnessing a
predator attacking another human. **[And, we learn by
instructions]{.underline}**, such as being told there is a predator
nearby. Read news coverage based on evidence, not tweets Learning from
our conspecifics -- members of the same species -- is an evolutionary
advantage that has prevented us from repeating dangerous experiences of
other humans. **[We have a [tendency to trus]{.mark}t our]{.underline}**
tribe mates and **[[authorities, especially when it comes to
danger.]{.mark} It is adaptive]{.underline}**: Parents and wise old men
told us not to eat a special plant, or not to go to an area in the
woods, or we would be hurt. By trusting them, we would not die like a
great-grandfather who died eating that plant. This way we accumulated
knowledge. **[Tribalism has been an inherent part of the human
history]{.underline}**. There has always been competition between groups
of humans in different ways and with different faces, from brutal
wartime nationalism to a strong loyalty to a football team. **[Evidence
from cultural neuroscience shows that our brains even respond
differently at an unconscious level simply to the view of faces from
other races or cultures.]{.underline}** **[At a tribal level, people
are]{.underline}** more emotional and consequently **[less
logical]{.underline}**: Fans of both teams pray for their team to win,
hoping God will take sides in a game. On the other hand, **[we regress
to tribalism when afraid]{.underline}**. This is an evolutionary
advantage that would lead to the group cohesion and help us fight the
other tribes to survive. **[Tribalism is the biological
loophole]{.underline}** that many politicians have banked on for a long
time: **[tapping into our fears and tribal instincts]{.underline}**.
Some **[examples are [Nazism]{.mark}, the [K]{.mark}u [K]{.mark}lux
[K]{.mark}lan,]{.underline}** **[[religious w]{.mark}ars and the [Dark
Ages]{.mark}. The [typical pattern]{.mark} is to [give]{.mark} the

often]{.underline}**. It can be any real or imaginary difference:

Jews]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Christians, **[[Sikhs]{.mark}. The list
goes on and on. When [building]{.mark} tribal [boundaries between "us"
and "them,"]{.mark} some politicians have managed very well to [create
virtual groups of people that]{.mark} do not communicate and [hate
without]{.mark} even [knowing each other]{.mark}: This is the human
animal in action! [Fear is uninformed]{.mark}]{.underline}** During the
first year after my arrival in the U.S., one night I entered a public
parking lot to turn around. People were leaving a building in Orthodox
Jewish dress; it was a temple. For a short second, I noticed a subtle,
weird but familiar feeling: fear! I tried to trace the source of this
fear, and here it was: My hometown was almost all Muslims, and I never
met a Jew growing up. One day when I was a little child and we were
visiting a village, an old lady was telling a crazy story about how
Orthodox Jews steal Muslim kids and drink their blood! Having come from
a well-educated family that respects all religions, being an educated
doctor and having so many great Jewish friends, I felt embarrassed that
still the child within had taken that stupid and obviously false story a
bit seriously, only because that child had never met a Jew. This human
tendency is meat to the politicians who want to exploit fear: If you
grew up only around people who look like you, only listened to one media
outlet and heard from the old uncle that those who look or think
differently hate you and are dangerous, the inherent fear and hatred
toward those unseen people is an understandable (but flawed) result.
**[To win us, [politicians]{.mark}, sometimes with the media's help, do
their best to keep us separated, to [keep]{.mark} the real or [imaginary
"others"]{.mark} just a "concept." Because if we spend time with others,
talk to them and eat with them, we will learn that they are like us:
humans with all the strengths and weaknesses that we possess. Some are
strong, some are weak, some are funny, some are dumb, some are nice and
some not too nice.]{.underline}** Fear is illogical and often dumb Some
people are afraid of spiders, others of snakes or even cats and dogs.
Aris Suwanmalee/Shutterstock.com Very often my patients with phobias
start with: "I know it is stupid, but I am afraid of spiders." Or it may
be dogs or cats, or something else. And I always reply: "It is not
stupid, it is illogical." We humans have different functions in the
brain, and fear oftentimes bypasses logic. There are several reasons.
One is that logic is slow; fear is fast. In situations of danger, we
ought to be fast: First run or kill, then think. Politicians and the
media very often use fear to circumvent our logic. I always say the U.S.
media are disaster pornographers -- they work too much on triggering
their audiences' emotions. They are kind of political reality shows,
surprising to anyone from outside the U.S. When one person kills a few
others in a city of millions, which is of course a tragedy, major
networks' coverage could lead one to perceive the whole city is under
siege and unsafe. If one undocumented illegal immigrant murders a U.S.
citizen, some politicians use fear with the hope that few will ask:
"This is terrible, but how many people were murdered in this country by
U.S. citizens just today?" Or: "I know several murders happen every week
in this town, but why am I so scared now that this one is being
showcased by the media?" We do not ask these questions, because fear
bypasses logic. **[[Fear can turn violent]{.mark}]{.underline}** Toppled

response to fear is called the "fight or flight" response. That response
has helped us survive the predators and other tribes that have wanted to
kill us. But again, it is another loophole in our biology to be abused.
By scaring us, the demagogues **[[turn on our aggression toward "the

When it comes to abortion rights, **[the Democrats need to lean into the
politics of fear.]{.underline}** They face a base that feels betrayed
and a set of wealthy, moderate voters in purple states who may not
realize that their own rights are also on the line. **[Democrats need
both of these groups to stave off defeat in the fall, and [fear]{.mark}
can [drive them]{.mark} to the polls.]{.underline}** What should the
Democrats tell them to be afraid of? A national abortion ban. America
after the fall of Roe v. Wade might feel like were living in the
worst-case scenario, but anyone who values reproductive freedom has
reason to panic about what could happen if Republicans take back power
in Washington. G.O.P. Congress members have already introduced bills
that would criminalize abortion in various ways. They are only more
emboldened now. Last month, former Vice President Mike Pence called for
a national abortion ban. More to the point, Senator Mitch McConnell, the
minority leader, has called it possible. Recently, he hedged the
prediction by stating an obvious fact: Neither side on this issue has
had 60 votes to pass such a ban. Is that a phrase you feel comfortable
hanging your future on? Plenty of progressive **[[voters]{.mark} don't
need to be made aware of the danger. They [are]{.mark} already
[terrified for the future]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But everyone should
be, not just those who might want or need an abortion in the future. The
conservative legal theories (and the conservative jurists) that brought
down Roe threaten marriage equality, privacy in the bedroom, even
contraception. A law banning abortion by recognizing fetuses as humans
with constitutional rights could criminalize in vitro fertilization. The
life-or-death pregnancy scenarios now playing out in red states could be
repeated right next door, no matter where you live. To meet the urgency
of the moment and save their razor-thin and often nonexistent hold on
the Senate, **[Democrats must talk about that future]{.underline}**,
giving voters across the country, in every state, a reason to vote.
Lives are on the line. At the same time, Democratic leaders have to
understand that **[the politics of fear can run both
ways.]{.underline}** The End of Roe v. Wade Commentary by Times Opinion
writers and columnists on the Supreme Courts decision to end ??the
constitutional right to abortion. David N. Hackney, maternal-fetal
medicine specialist: The end of Roe is a tragedy for our patients, many
of whom will suffer and some of whom could very well die. Mara Gay: Sex
is fun. For the puritanical tyrants seeking to control our bodies, thats
a problem . Elizabeth Spiers: The notion that rich women will be fine,
regardless of what the law says, is probably comforting to some. But it
is simply not true . Katherine Stewart, writer : ??Breaking American
democracy isnt an unintended side effect of Christian nationalism. It is
the point of the project . **[[The party needs to scare voters and show
that they]{.mark}, too, [are]{.mark} scared: [scared of the voters
themselves.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Democratic politicians watched
Republicans roll back abortion rights for decades and when Roe fell,
they had no plan.]{.underline}** Now, they need to demonstrate that they
are willing to put themselves at the mercy of those they failed making
specific promises and letting the voters know that if they fail again,
it will be more than a fund-raising opportunity. It will be a reckoning.
Politicians have never shied away from making campaign promises, **[but
the Republicans are better at creating the circumstances for voters to
exact revenge.]{.underline}** Grover Norquists Taxpayer Protection
Pledge held sway over hundreds of Republican candidates for over a
decade. For the G.O.P., the pledge was a neat way to synchronize the
interests of the very rich and the defiant antigovernment streak of the
white middle class, and the key to making it work, for as long as it
has, has been simple: letting voters know they expect to be held
accountable. If an elected official bucks the tax pledge, voters have a
specific reason to send them home and the politician has no excuses. A
promise to protect abortion rights would not have the same kind of
moneyed network behind it that the tax pledge does. But it would carry
the same emotional and political weight. In the end, all politicians
have to answer for their records. Say that Democrats committed, for
once, to prioritizing action over whatever solution Washington considers
reasonable. Call it the Abortion Access Pledge and turn running against
the threat of a national abortion ban into a chance to run for
something, too. Don't quibble, don't be distracted by debates over
whether or when a ban will happen. Instead, decide on a handful of
action items around abortion access and get everyone who wants a vote or
a dollar to say it out loud: I will support abortion access in these
ways and if I don't follow through, you should kick me out. I am
honestly unsure if it matters what those action items are; I do know
Democrats will have to throw out any concern for the appearance of
moderation. Right now, all the ideas about bridging the gap to abortion
access sound extreme. But so did the tax pledge at one point. So did
overturning Roe v. Wade. Take allowing abortions on federal land . Biden
could declare the policy so. Candidates would only have to pledge to
support it. Yes, the policy would invoke an avalanche of untested legal
theories and complicated jurisdictional questions. But Democrats who
want to save the lives of those in need of an abortion cant fall back on
its complicated as an excuse to not even try. If you want something less
complicated something that would also help roll out abortions on federal
lands make a pledge not to vote for any appropriation bill that carries
the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions. On
its own, abolishing the Hyde Amendment would not greatly expand access
outside states where abortion is legal. But combined with abortion
access on federal property, the government could act even more directly
to help those seeking abortion care. Stonewalling Hyde-burdened budgets
could lead to a government shutdown, but if you think that ruins a
party's reputation forever, well, you are probably a current Democratic
office holder. **[Embracing a politics of fear on reproductive rights
unites two of the constituencies the Democrats need to edge out the
G.O.P. in key narrow races]{.underline}** (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,
Georgia). First, hammering home the danger of a national ban may
sufficiently alarm moderate voters in the suburbs, convincing them to
abandon Republicans. Second, addressing the widespread sense of betrayal
among progressive voters will help keep them activated. The threat of a
national abortion ban is also a national message. **[Democrats can make
it clear that the party can't risk a single loss, no matter how lopsided
the polls are. And then there is the simple truth underpinning this
entire strategy:]{.underline}** Protecting abortion rights is popular.
This plan where Democratic leaders take real political risks is untried.
But it's worth the gamble. **[[Bold action is the only way to assure
voters that they are prepared to do whatever it takes]{.mark} when other
rights are on the chopping block.]{.underline}** Most significantly,
**[prioritizing responsiveness to voters]{.underline}** would reset the
entire framework of Democratic campaigns. The only way this strategy
could truly backfire is if Democrats run on a promise and then break it,
again. And expect to be re-elected, again. Of course, that is what
Democrats are doing right now. Protect Roe was their rallying cry; it
turns out thats all it was. **[[Fear often divides, but it can also
unite. When you have a common threat, there is an opportunity for a
common mission.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This threat is no longer beyond
the horizon its at the door. Now, Democrats, decide on a mission.

### Borders

#### The nation state border is constructed on a eschatological imaginary that pulmugates in racialized ways of understanding U.S.-Asian relations as an ideological contagion

**Man 18** (Jessica Man \| Master of Arts degree in Asian American
Studies \| *"The Perfect Type of Industry": 2012 and Apocalyptic Visions
of the Asian Century* pg 26 \| DOA: 7/8/2022 \| SAoki)

Adam McKeown reminds us that the ways in which **[the Chinese Exclusion
Act]{.underline}** was enforced at the American border "**[did more than
just classify Chinese immigrants. It asserted a vision of properly
ordered global social relationships]{.underline}**, a vision that was
**[inseparable from the failures and contradictions inherent in its
enforcement]{.underline}**" (379-280). **[There is a wealth of
scholarship that addresses the imperial preoccupation with legislating
the border, linking it to both nationalist-statist anxieties about
maintaining the ethno-national hierarchies of empire as well as
anxieties about controlling subjugated bodies and legitimating colonial
relationships to land]{.underline}**. **[[Chinese
exclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which **[[provide]{.mark}d [the basis
for all subsequent iterations of racialized border
control]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[points to the conceptualization of
migrant labor [as]{.mark} [ideological contagion]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
All migrants are "carriers;" "illegal" migrants as early as the
Exclusion Act had not been subjected to the proper ritualized screening
that McKeown writes about. The inconsistencies inherent to border
policing despite several attempts at reform indicate that **[Exclusion
was]{.underline}** not only about the physical prevention of Chinese
entry, which it failed to do in the comprehensive manner pushed by labor
unions, but **[about the public ideological decontamination of the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. The concept of
**[[Yellow Peril]{.mark} not only [threatened the stability]{.mark} of
these "properly ordered global social relationships,"]{.underline}**
i.e. the economic and political ordering of immigrants and citizens
based on American ideas of trade, race, and disability, **[but
[with]{.mark} actual [total cultural and national
annihilation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Yellow Peril is]{.mark} not
only epistemological or metaphysical -- it [is an eschatological way of
understanding U.S.-China]{.mark} ([and]{.mark} more broadly [U.S.-Asian)
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With this framework, we can begin to
understand the Page and Exclusion Acts and the associated immigration
bans levied in the early 20th century as **[a state-sanctioned method of
staving off apocalypse and eschaton, a legitimate way of recognizing the
periodic and transitory nature of Empire]{.underline}**. VII. Dream
Interpretation -- Apocalypse, Eschaton, and Empire In order to
understand the relationship between state and apocalypse, we must first
define the terms "apocalypse," "eschaton," and "eschatology."
"Apocalypse" is commonly understood as a temporal mode that is focused
on the imminence of an ending -- to Empire, to global life, to
cosmology. I am making a distinction here between the popular and the
theological, scholastic definitions. The former conflates apocalypse and
eschaton into a commentary on imperial and colonial anxiety, while the
latter approaches apocalypse as a critical, fundamental, and radical
shift in epistemology where what is hidden is revealed, and eschaton as
the moment or period of obliteration where knowledge itself collapses.
"Apocalypse" is a term derived from the Greek apokalypsis, roughly
translating to "uncovering," but most famously taken to mean
"revelation," as in the biblical Revelation of John, sometimes called
the Apocalypse of John. The word cannot be separated from its
theological origins; Christianity is one of the fundamental traditions
of thought through which Western nations understand history, social
order, and futurity, and apocalypticism comes directly out of that
tradition. The secularized notion of apocalypse turns prophesy into
prediction, masking imperial Christian logics behind those of
capitalism, modernity, and the state. "Apocalypse," especially in its
theological sense, should not be used as a semantically-neutral stand-in
for just any religious conceptualization of the end of the world for
this exact reason. John's apocalypse, received on the island of Patmos,
is an extremely dense text, crowded with fantastic and terrifying
images, moving in and out of different modes of signification without
giving the reader a comprehensive cipher. Throughout the text, John
describes a vision of the destruction of the world, wars in spiritual
and physical realms, the subjugation and liberation of humanity, and the
dramatic culmination of Christian notions of spiritual warfare. Most
importantly, the text anticipates the thing which is to be revealed: the
total renewal and redemption of the spiritual and physical realms, and
the nature of the perfected body. John's vision is not only of the end
of the world but of how the cosmos will be reorganized into a new as a
temporal mode that is focused on the imminence of an ending -- to
Empire, to global life, to cosmology. I am making a distinction here
between the popular and the theological, scholastic definitions. The
former conflates apocalypse and eschaton into a commentary on imperial
and colonial anxiety, while the latter approaches apocalypse as a
critical, fundamental, and radical shift in epistemology where what is

where knowledge itself collapses. "Apocalypse" is a term derived from

revealed: the total renewal and redemption of the spiritual and physical
realms, and the nature of the perfected body. John's vision is not only
of the end of the world but of how the cosmos will be reorganized into a
new. In this way, the Exclusion Act, the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, and
other turn-of-the-century immigration acts can be understood to
constitute a state or state-sanctioned eschatology. **[[Protective and
nationalist]{.mark} [legislation]{.mark} is always [instated to narrow
down the possible futures of empire and empire's
end]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[If American triumphalism is a
belief in the inevitable dominance of U.S. government, culture, and ways
of life over those of other nations, it must be maintained and driven by
an eschatological imaginary that exposes weaknesses in the imperial
strategy and thinks about the ways]{.underline}** through which **[the
empire could be destroyed]{.underline}**. **[London's "Unparalleled
Invasion" provides an apocalypse that exposes the eschatological
nature]{.underline}** of the Exclusion Act and how it anticipated the
fundamental threat Chinese laborers posed to the American nationstate.
The Exclusion Act and all other anti-Asian immigration laws function on,
and are **[[justified through, an imagined future predicated on the
destructive power of Yellow Peril]{.underline}]{.mark}**, validating a
specific vision of eschaton and apocalyptically reframing the nature of
Asian immigration. Apocalypse necessarily deals with periodicity.
Christian theology recognizes several "marks" in its historical record:
pre- and post-lapsarian time, ante- and post-diluvian time, preand
post-messianic time, pre- and post-apocalyptic time, and so forth. It
also recognizes the nebulous and intractable nature of time -- Giorgio
Agamben notes in Infancy and History that Christianity "resolutely
separates time from the natural movement of the stars to make it an
essentially human, interior phenomenon" (95). The Second Epistle of
Peter corroborates this observation, famously stating that "with the
Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day"
(3:8, ESV). Eschatology therefore must be understood to extrapolate from
a specific system of periodizing or marking history, but purposefully
leave the actual span of the period it envelops unclear in order to
avoid foreclosing itself at a certain date**[. [In a statesanctioned
eschatology]{.mark}, the effect is to suspend, extend, and frame the
period of imperial life so that [the end state of totalized destruction
hangs ominously over the present moment, continually presenting a
justification for exclusion and border maintenance as nationalist
projects of conservation]{.mark}]{.underline}.**

### China

#### Digital Orientalism explains the acceleration of fears of China's rise and if it continues to dominate our epistemological thought then it could have apocalyptic consequences-surveillance states and justification of suppression

We introduce the concept of "**[[digital
orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**" to help **[[explain what is really
at stake in controversies over China's rapid
digitalisation.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In a special issue of the Journal of Chinese Political Science, we
write: "The increasingly apparent and uncomfortable development that
many instinctively deny is that **[[one of the key elements
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Sinological]{.mark}
**[[orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the notion **[that [China
would]{.mark} [become]{.mark} more like [the
West]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[has [become increasingly
true,]{.mark}]{.underline}** with the caveat that **[the
[West]{.mark}]{.underline}**, likewise through the same types of
technology, **[has [become]{.mark} increasingly [like
China]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

Anxieties have resurfaced in two key areas. First, **[[worries about the
"technological society" and its threat to values and
practices]{.underline}]{.mark}** considered culturally intrinsic **[[are
key concerns]{.mark} in both China and the West.]{.underline}**

These **[[fears have accelerated]{.mark} in the West with]{.underline}**
the unprecedented **[[rise]{.mark} [of]{.mark} platform
[companies]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- technology-enabled businesses that
create value by facilitating exchanges between two or more
interdependent groups -- **[[and state
surveillance]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

But **[with the [emergence of a Chinese tech state]{.mark} and
mushrooming Chinese platform companies]{.underline}**, and with China
drawing even with and perhaps overtaking the West in some technology
fields, these **[[fears have been reinforced.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Huawei and the double standards of the West

Second, **[[China's technological leapfrogging has produced
"Sinotechnophobia]{.underline}]{.mark}**". The **[[fear]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [Chinese]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}** has
diminished Western fears of Western tech in a manner that **[[recalls
the cold wa]{.mark}r]{.underline}**'s arms race ("we're bad, but they're
worse").

But **[[Sinotechnophobia could have apocalyptic
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**, either through self-destruction or
mutual destruction, on par with those described by Jairus Victor Grove
in Savage Ecology: War and Geopolitics at the End of the World**[[:
imagine unrestricted surveillance states justifying self-suppression in
the name of bolstering security against each
other]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with competing artificial intelligence
running algorithms that accelerate poor decision-making.

What **[[digital orientalism masks is the extent to which China
experiences many of the same problems and practices found in democratic
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Surveillance capitalism works
similarly everywhere and some misuse of AI and big data by US agencies
is on par with China and sometimes worse.

This convergence also causes discomfort in Beijing, which often trumpets
China's differences while struggling to discipline the '90s and 2000s
generations, which, having grown up in a market society with extremely
high levels of personal technology usage, have more in common with
American millennials than with their own parents.

How AI and quantum computing add to danger of US-China conflict

Whatever **[threats]{.underline}** Huawei poses for democratic politics,
it **[[distracts us from those posed]{.mark} [already by Western tech
giants]{.mark}]{.underline}** and algorithmic governance through an
almost complete erosion of privacy, **[[omnipresent
surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}** and valid worries that elections can
be hacked by foreign powers or purchased via social marketing using
targeted fake news.

In the Journal of Democracy, Larry Diamond describes [this]{.mark}
[as]{.mark} the "**[road to digital unfreedom"]{.underline}** and
"**[[postmodern]{.mark} [totalitarianism]{.mark}]{.underline}**". We add
that a self-defeating **[["us versus them" logic is merely picking your
poison.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Instead of focusing on the drawbacks of an individual company or
technology, we should acknowledge the broader reality: **[intensifying
global homogenisation, cyberwar, the dominance of platform companies,
inescapable surveillance capitalism, the impossibility of data privacy,
the normalisation of stealth mass-manipulation and nudging campaigns,
the experience of post-truth rationalities and the reduction of
individuals to constantly accessible screen-brain
interfacing.]{.underline}**

**[[Liberal societies don't need Chinese tech]{.mark} [to
destroy]{.mark} not just democratic processes but the very conditions of
democratic life and politics.]{.underline}** Yet, **[[by creating a
"dangerous other]{.underline}]{.mark}**" and foregrounding misleading
binaries, **[[digital orientalism keeps us from deliberating
socio-technical futures and the good society that we should
envision.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Only by recognising]{.mark} the convergence of [authoritarian
digitalisation]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [China, Europe and the US]{.mark}
[can we unchain our]{.mark} [imaginative]{.mark} [powers]{.mark} [as
digital citizens]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [find]{.mark} [a]{.mark} better
[way]{.mark} [forward]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Several [actors inflate]{.mark} the [China threat]{.mark} narrative
[in]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. This [includes]{.mark}
the [military industrial complex]{.mark}, attempting [to]{.mark}
[justify]{.mark} a [large D]{.mark}]{.underline}**epartment
[**[o]{.underline}**f]{.mark} **[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense
**[[budget]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Actors in this group are national
security elites, both within the Department **[as well as]{.underline}**
those **[companies providing defense-related services.]{.underline}**13
**[Politicians attempting to distract from domestic
issues]{.underline}** at home **[would also benefit from inflating the
China threat. There is evidence of electoral benefits for politicians in
discussing a threatening environment and increasing defense spending
during times of elections.]{.underline}**14 It has been noted that
elites "appear to have the motive, means, and opportunity to offer
greatly distorted national security narratives."15 **[Foreign countries
in the Pacific]{.underline}** who are **[concerned by China's
encroachment]{.underline}**, both economic and military, **[would also
inflate the China threat]{.underline}** as **[to encourage the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to
increase]{.underline}** its **[regional involvement]{.underline}**.
These **[countries, such as Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, the
Philippines, and Vietnam, frequently raise concerns about China's
activities in both international governing bodies as well as with
American policymakers as part of their diplomatic
agenda.]{.underline}**16 Finally, one could imagine how human and animal
rights and environmental groups opposed to China's policies would also
be located in this camp of building a negative narrative around China.
These groups could further anti-China messaging to inspire support and
enact change in policy towards China. **[While coming from quite
different perspectives, these disparate groups]{.underline}** comprise
an uncoordinated alliance that collectively forms an anti-China lobby.
Their **[actions, communications, and lobbying efforts in the domestic
environment paint an elevated threat from China. Diving]{.underline}** a
bit deeper **[into the military industrial complex, the elevation of
enemy connotations of threat and threat narratives coincide with its
desire for additional resource allocation to the defense industry. As
Kenneth [Mayer noted]{.mark},]{.underline}** the military's "budgetary
*raison d'être*" in the past was the Soviet Union.17 **[[If]{.mark} the
[essence of an industry is to protect against something

secure resources]{.mark}. The [creation of a narrative]{.mark}
highlighting the threat [would go a long way]{.mark} in making the
threat a reality [and securing additional resources]{.mark} to stem the
threat. [Creating a more threatening]{.mark} visage of [China would

**[Less-extreme]{.underline}** versions of these **[threat
perceptions]{.underline}** eschew any reference to China's political
system or ideology as a source of hostile Chinese behavior,
**[stress]{.underline}**ing instead **[the unavoidable dangers that
China]{.underline}** as a rising power **[poses to the U.S. as the
dominant state in a largely anarchic global system of states enjoying no
supreme enforcement or mediating power. Such dangers supposedly arise
from]{.underline}** the **[inevitable uncertainties each power has
regarding]{.underline}** the **[intentions of the other]{.underline}**,
the **[presumed steadfast desire of the dominant power to retain its
global power position and to protect]{.underline}** the central role of
**[its values and norms]{.underline}** within the global system, **[the
rising power's desire to alter many of those values and norms to better
reflect its interests, and its overall fear]{.underline}** that **[the
dominant power will increasingly act to constrain its
rise.]{.underline}**4 Yet despite the near-absence of a recognition of
domestic political or ideological factors, **[even this [structural
realist arg]{.mark}ument [assumes]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[[Beijing]{.mark}, as a [supposedly insecure but growing]{.mark}
power, is]{.underline}** inevitably **[[driven to undermine and weaken
the U.S.]{.mark} through all possible means to ensure its successful
rise to a dominant position in the global order. In this view, [although
Beijing might not be evil or ideologically hostile]{.mark}, the [threat
it poses]{.mark} is [still seen as extremely dire and inevitably
growing]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as long as China's economy continues to
grow robustly and uncertainty over China's ultimate goals continues to
exist. **[[Unsurprisingly]{.mark}, such [extreme threat perceptions have
generated equally extreme reactions]{.mark} among most U.S. political
leaders, pundits, and many analysts of i]{.underline}**nternational
**[r]{.underline}**elations. The **[[assumed scope and scale of]{.mark}
the Chinese [threat is seen]{.mark}]{.underline}** by these individuals
**[[to require]{.mark} a ["whole-of-society" response]{.mark}, designed
to "push back" against Chinese misbehavior]{.underline}** in a variety
of ways, **[[from applying tariffs and sanctions to correct China's
"predatory" and mercantilist economic and trade policies to building up
the U.S. military to deter China's aggressive military or paramilitary
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}**.5 **[In]{.underline}** virtually **[all
areas, zero-sum (i.e., I win, you lose) calls for "severe" competition,
pressure, punishment, confrontation, and wholesale or selective
decoupling of links with China seem to predominate, with relatively
little attention paid to developing specific, concrete ways to moderate
or bound the rivalry through various types of understandings or, even
less, mutual accommodation or collaboration.]{.underline}**6 In **[what
appears at first glance to be a significant qualification]{.underline}**
of such a response, the **[[Biden administration]{.underline}]{.mark}**
has **[[stated]{.underline}]{.mark}** that the U.S.
**[[relationship]{.mark} with China [will be "competitive when
it]{.mark} [should be, collaborative when it can be, and adversarial
when it must be.]{.mark}"]{.underline}**7 **[This implies]{.underline}**
that **[Washington's policy will include a wide range of approaches to
Beijing, at presumably robust levels across the board. But [the reality
has]{.mark} thus far been quite different. Although far less reckless
and ideological]{.underline}** toward Beijing **[than the Trump
administration, the Biden administration has clearly [indicated]{.mark}
that [its predecessor]{.mark} generally [correctly assessed]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** extreme, **[[existential threat posed by
China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As a result, the **[[overall]{.mark}
[framework]{.mark} of the Biden (and congressional) approach to China
[has continued to stress sharp, values-centered, and largely
punitive]{.mark} forms of [response]{.mark}]{.underline}** to Beijing's
rise and its influence. The **[apparent underlying
assumption]{.underline}** of this approach **[is that the threat China
poses is so enormous that attempts to reach anything more than narrow
understandings, or expand mutually beneficial forms of
collaboration]{.underline}** with Beijing, by and large **[serve to
divert attention away from the primary objective of "pushing back" in
every way possible ([Secretary of State]{.mark} Antony [Blinken]{.mark}
has [described]{.mark} the [threat]{.mark} as "[the greatest
geopolitical test of the 21st century]{.mark}.").]{.underline}**8 **[In
this assumption, constructive engagement has supposedly "failed," so why
continue it?]{.underline}** And **[reinforcing this prevailing
Washington viewpoint is]{.underline}** the notion that,
**[regardless]{.underline}** of **[how hostile or zero-sum the U.S.
approach]{.underline}** to Beijing **[might be, the Chinese will always
remain willing to cooperate meaningfully on some issues (such as climate
change) when it is in their interests to do so. All this clearly
indicates that certain]{.underline}** types of **[U.S. threat
perceptions have made Washington prone to extreme policy reactions in
response to various Chinese actions. And [those policies can]{.mark} of
course in turn [cause Beijing to react in]{.mark} various [ways]{.mark},
including what are [viewed as more]{.mark} (or less)
[threatening]{.mark} types of action.]{.underline}** The **[[possibility
of]{.mark} a [vicious cycle of worsening, inflated threats and
counterthreats emerging]{.mark}]{.underline}** from such a dynamic
**[[is obvious]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words, **[threat
inflation can significantly increase the possibility of an otherwise
entirely avoidable conflict]{.underline}** between the threatened nation
and the threatening nation. This suggests that **[holding an
[exaggerated threat perception of China can pose]{.mark} at least [as
much]{.mark} of a [danger to the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [as
underestimating it.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In addition to the dangerous
vicious cycle mentioned above, **[it can [produce wasteful and socially
disruptive policies by unnecessarily diverting resources into
unproductive areas such as excessive military buildups, and by
unnecessarily alarming]{.mark} or panicking [the citizenry]{.mark}. This
is particularly of concern in the military]{.underline}** arena,
**[where an inflated threat almost inevitably leads to excessive
commitments of financial, intellectual, and technological resources that
could be used elsewhere.]{.underline}**

#### Orientalism frames the PRC as an "Other" in need of reforms, forcing a sense of sameness upon to it in which Chinese culture is lost. This logic of sameness is at the roots of capitalism and colonialism and serves as a modern form of these ideological frameworks.

**Vukovich 11** \[Daniel F. Vukovich is currently an Associate Professor
at the University of Hong Kong., 11-21-2011, "China and Orientalism:

"China" and the new era In "Orientalism Now," the concluding chapter of
Edward Said\'s 1978 book, we are left with the **[migration of
orientalism from European empires and philology to the U.S. imperium and
the dominance of social scientific discourse.]{.underline}** This
project begins where Said left off. It argues that **[there is a new,
"[Sinological]{.mark}" form of [orientalism]{.mark} at work in the
world, one that [takes]{.mark} as its object an "[Other]{.mark}" that
has since the 1970s occupied an increasingly central place
[within]{.mark} the world system and Western intellectual-political
culture: the [P]{.mark}eople\'s [R]{.mark}epublic of
[C]{.mark}hina.]{.underline}** As with Said\'s formulation rooted in the
Middle East and South Asia, **[Sinological-[orientalism]{.mark} and its
production of a textual "China" helps [constitute]{.mark} the identity
or ["Self" of the West]{.mark}]{.underline}** (what Balibar aptly calls
the "Western-Christian-Democratic-Universalist identity") ("Difference"
30). **[The U.S.-West is what China is not, but which the latter will
become.]{.underline}** So, too, **[the [new orientalism]{.mark} is [part
of]{.mark} a [neo-colonial]{.mark} or imperialist [project]{.mark}: not
just the production of knowledge about an "area" but the would-be
management and administration of the area for economic, political, and
cultural-symbolic benefit.]{.underline}** But whereas orientalism in
Said turned upon a posited, essential difference between Orient and
Occident (as in Kipling\'s famous verse: "Oh, East is East, and West is
West, and never the twain shall meet"), **[the new form turns
upon]{.underline}** sameness or more specifically, upon
**[[China\'s]{.mark} becoming [sameness]{.mark}. China is seen as in a
process of haltingly but inevitably becoming-the-same as "us": open,
liberal, modern, free.]{.underline}** Put another way, **["China" is
understood as becoming generally equivalent to the West.]{.underline}**
What this **[reflects]{.underline}**, in part, **[is the]{.underline}**
by now familiar resurgence of **[modernization rhetoric under the cover
of "globalization" and the end-of-history thematic famously captured
by]{.underline}** Francis **[Fukuyama.]{.underline}** But that, in turn,
was triggered by the collapse of the former Soviet Union as well as by
the fateful deployment of the market mechanism and the logic of capital
within China. After a noble but brief interruption of the politics and
discourse of modernization by Chinese Maoism and by the long decade of
the 1960s and early 1970s, the former is back in charge not only of area
studies but of global intellectual-political culture. When one recalls
the **[Marxist cultural analysis of capital]{.underline}** as such,
namely as an **[historical force of abstraction that makes unlike things
alike on the basis of some third thing called the
value-form]{.underline}** (their "exchange value" or "general
equivalent"), **[the [relationship between]{.mark} this [orientalism
and]{.mark} global [capitalism]{.mark} appears in sharper relief.
Sinological-orientalism is in an important sense a
capital-logic]{.underline}**, just as **[historical capitalism betrays
an orientalist one.]{.underline}** As Said himself made clear (in at
least my reading of him), **[[orientalism and colonial
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}** may precede the rise of capitalism, but
in the modern era they **[[are hand in glove]{.mark}.]{.underline}** So,
too, for the present moment, whereby Western investment and
"con-strainment" strategies are often rationalized on the basis of these
being beneficial to the Chinese and their progression towards democracy
and human rights (whatever these mean), as well as helping "balance" and
protect the rest of Asia from China\'s rise. I further address the
relationship between orientalist and capital logics in a final chapter.
My argument is a totalizing, "functionalist" one about the integral
relationship between capitalism and orientalism. But then, so is the
thing. **[The historical conditions of possibility for a global
Sinological-orientalism are the momentous if not counter-revolutionary
changes within China itself]{.underline}**- its Dengist "era of reform
and opening up" dating from 1979 - and the West\'s economic, political,
and discursive responses to this subsequent rise to global
prominence**[. This paradoxical relationship is captured in the [logic
of becoming-sameness: China is]{.mark} still [not
"normal"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (and has been tragically different),
**[but is engaged in a "universal" process such that [it]{.mark} will,
and [must, become th]{.mark}e [same]{.mark} as "us."]{.underline}**
Whether it wants to or not. **[That is the present-future offered to
China within this discourse]{.underline}**, and - as anyone who watched
the 2008 Olympics opening ceremonies knows ("one world, one dream") - it
is also one **[taken up within China itself.]{.underline}** I turn to
the question of Occidentalism below, and at other times make reference
to Westernized/liberal views within China. But I only partially address
the **[internalization of orientalism within China and the current Party
state.]{.underline}** That is surely an important matter worthy of its
own book. But my focus here reflects in part my conviction that it is
**[the Western --- now fully global --- dimensions and roots of
[orientalism]{.mark} that are the main problem [underlying]{.mark} the
often dysfunctional, [neo-colonial relationship between China and the
West.]{.mark}]{.underline}** My concern is the production of knowledge
about the P.R.C. outside of China and the cultural, ideological, and
other politics that subtend this. One could write a different project
focused on the representation of China from within the mainland; this
would have to include indigenous constructions and essentializations of
China outside of, as well as prior to, foreign imperialism or
orientalism. But **[the impact in China of [modernimperialism]{.mark}
and "contact" remains decisive for all of us, and once we reach this era
we need necessarily engage the orientalist and post-colonial questions.
There will be no "new" Sinology until this conversation at least
begins.]{.underline}** As will quickly become clear, my analysis of
Sinological-orientalism abounds with gestures and full-on references to
what I take to be some of the complexities of Maoist and post-Mao China
in political, ideological/cultural, and other terms. Contra Said\'s own
practice in 1978, then, I do take it to be important to at least attempt
to argue for some of those complexities and "brute realities of the
Orient" (his words) that are occluded by the isolated details and
positional superiority of orientalism. His decision not to do so has
meant that his work there is often reductively appropriated by
**[cultural and postcolonial [studies]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[[reduce]{.mark} the problem of [orientalism]{.mark} to some basic
Freudian Othering process, the deployment of stereotypical images in
film, a simple self/other identity dynamic, and so forth.]{.underline}**
While all of these are part of orientalism, to be sure, **[the
[larger]{.mark} [problems]{.mark} and challenges [of
epistemology]{.mark}, political knowledge, [and]{.mark} the constitution
of [discourse]{.mark} were too often [obscured]{.mark} even within the
postcolonial field. [Positional superiority]{.mark} refers to that
tactic or de facto strategy by which [the object of study is kept in
place, never allowed to challenge]{.mark} let alone displace the
effectively a priori [assumptions]{.mark}, conclusions, [and]{.mark}
[discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}**: it places "the Westerner in a whole
series of possible relationships with the Orient without ever losing him
the upper hand" (Orientalism 7). **[It is]{.underline}** not just a
heuristic but **[the foundational rule of colonial discourse and
orientalism.]{.underline}**1 For our purposes this means that the
authority and a priori knowledge of the Sinologist-analyst-watcher
reigns supreme and untroubled. For all its detailed knowledge, then,
**[Sinological-orientalism works as a circular, self-enclosed
system.]{.underline}** It is also paradoxical in that what I am calling
its emphasis on **[[China\'s]{.mark} "becoming-sameness" is also [at
odds with]{.mark} this flexible [superiority]{.mark}, which is also to
say the ultimate [inferiority of]{.mark} the native, [Chinese
reality]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For all of these reasons, one must take
the risk of trying to argue for and signify these complexities,
counter-factuals, and counter-stories about the P.R.C. This is
surprisingly difficult to do, in part because **[the [language]{.mark}
we have to describe such things [fits not at all with the dominant,
Western]{.mark}, liberal humanist paradigm of the humanities and human
[sciences]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is, I believe, also Wang Hui\'s
problem in his brilliant and searching but difficult works on Chinese
histories and Western theory.2 My own emphases have been with the
political, Maoist past as well as its traces today, even after its
demonization at home and abroad. Others would certainly write all of
this differently, and it is again something worthy of book-length
treatment despite the professional risks involved (writing "positive"
scholarship about the Mao era). Some already have. In addition to others
cited in this study, Lin Chun\'s The Transformations of Chinese
Socialism is another case in point (albeit focused on the reform era).
But all of this work is of very recent vintage and remains marginal to
the overall China field. **[Sinological-[orientalism]{.mark} and its
basic logic can be [understood]{.mark} as a development [within]{.mark}
colonial discourse in the present, [postcolonial]{.mark} era of
intensive [globalization]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is as if what Dipesh
Chakrabarty memorably described as the "waiting room of history" --- or
the continual saying of "not yet" to the colonized who would be free -
has subtly but importantly shifted.3 The time is at hand. The denouement
has inched closer. The last real constraint remains **[the Party state
which will depart from the historical stage]{.underline}** with our
help. **[This marks a shift from the [essential difference between East
and West]{.mark} to their - [China\'s]{.mark} - general equivalence: a
[sameness structured by]{.mark} a [hierarchical difference]{.mark}. The
denigrating and condescending faith that they are, after all, becoming
the same as us (or should be made so) has become stronger and is no
longer simply the view of enlightened liberals]{.underline}** like J. S.
Mill. While a range of temporary - as opposed to essential - obstacles
can be summoned up to explain why **[China is not yet free and
normal]{.underline}**, the main and seemingly most fungible one remains
the Chinese Communist Party (state). **[Were it not for this
anachronistic, evil institution, the logic goes, China would and will be
becoming-the-same and joining the normal world.]{.underline}** A
Sinified, mainland Chinese path is more or less impossible, be it in the
Maoist attempt at alternative modernity (itself a Western/Marxist
hybrid) or in the various, nascent post-Mao efforts to reform and
develop a **[[Chinese state]{.mark} and society adequate to the
nation\'s various, complex challenges, and that [might catch up
to]{.mark} the heretofore largely unchecked, rapid, and dislocating
deployment of [capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### Chinese AI

#### The 1AC's depictions of the Chinese AI threat tie into an Orientalist narrative that technologically otherizes China as a challenge to Western techno-hegemony.

**[[Western perceptions of]{.mark} digital [innovation]{.mark} have long
[remained in thrall to]{.mark} East-[Asia]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Just
as Japan was seen as the world-leading innovator in micro-electronics
and computers during the 1980s, China is now widely considered to be
leading the development of artificial intelligence. **[[Western]{.mark}
news media, [policy]{.mark} and public opinion [perpetuate a sense that
"China Is Dominating A]{.mark}rtificial [I]{.mark}ntelligence" (Forbes
2018), "Will China Lead The World in AI by 2030?" (Nature 2019), "China
-- The First Artificial Intelligence Superpower" (Forbes 2021), and
variations thereof. The ways in which AI is discussed and imagined in
the [West]{.mark} therefore continues to [lean heavily on]{.mark} the
[notion that AI is]{.mark} being [done by]{.mark} the [Chinese in
different]{.mark}, more rapid and efficient
[ways]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Such discourses are not without substance.
China is certainly home to some of the world's most successful AI
companies, with the Chinese government promoting AI as a central tenet
of its strategies toward economic development and political stability
over the next 20 years. In contrast to the oscillation of Western
computer science between relatively bountiful 'AI springs' and fallow
'AI winters', Chinese AI is seen to be experiencing a prolonged AI 'heat
wave' -- bolstered by significant state involvement and support. Indeed,
the Chinese government support for AI has been described as a "real
existential threat to US technological leadership" (Chen 2019).
Nevertheless, **[these [discourses around AI are]{.mark} also
[underpinned by]{.mark} a continuation of '[techno-orientalist'
discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Roh et al. 2015) **[that has long
[influence]{.mark}d [Western thinking around emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies. [This frames Chinese society]{.mark} and culture
[in hyper-technological and]{.mark} distinctly '[othering']{.mark}
[terms]{.mark} -- what Huang (2020, p.59) describes as "a form of
accelerationism where China is unstoppable in its technological
development". Crucially, [while China is acknowledged to be
making]{.mark} great [strides in]{.mark} the development of
[emerging]{.mark} digital [tech]{.mark}nologies, [this is]{.mark} also
[framed in]{.mark} largely [pejorative terms]{.mark}. Indeed, current
[Western discourses around China and AI span]{.mark} a range of
[contradictory characteristics]{.mark} -- in one sense spanning what
Lawrence Lek (in Huang 2020) describes as the "exotic, bizarre, tacky,
and cheap", while also [seen as]{.mark} chillingly [authoritarian,
unethical and oppressive]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Common [tropes
around China's involvement in AI innovation]{.mark} throughout the
twenty-first century therefore repeated [return to notions of China as
a]{.mark} 'copy and [counterfeit' culture]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as
well as a place of mindless labour -- with people working hard in
high-tech factories without capacity for critical or original creative
thought. **[At the same time, [China is seen a place where]{.mark} the
state make extensive [use of]{.mark} [digital technology]{.mark} to
[enforce totalitarian control]{.mark}, while Chinese companies gain
unfair competitive advantage from the nation's fierce protection of its
internal market]{.underline}**. As Huang (2020, p.46) concludes:
**["[According to techno-orientalist stereotypes, China is home to
a]{.mark} generic communist [horde that threatens to]{.mark} imitate
(and potentially [steal]{.mark} and undermine) [Western
techno-hegemony]{.mark}".]{.underline}** Of key significance to our own
research on facial recognition technology, is how these views are being

echo]{.mark} the forms of cultural differentiation described by Edward

how perceptions of South and East Asia during the nineteenth and

### Chinese Cyber

#### Fears of Chinese cyber capabilities are rooted in orientalist tropes that pose it as a sneaky, backwards, thief unable to grasp international norms

**Ooi and D'arcangelis 17** (Su-Mei Ooi and Gwen D'Arcangelis, 2017,

)**//BRownRice**

China as thief: cyber battles The **[[construction of China as]{.mark}
potential enemy [Other]{.mark} takes on an additional hue when we look
at the [depictions]{.mark} [of]{.mark} China's [cyber]{.mark}
activities---China moves from cheat to]{.underline}** a more malicious
cousin, **[the thief]{.underline}**. The **[United States first focused
on issues of "[cyber warfare]{.mark}"]{.underline}** in the mid-2000s to
late 2000s, but at the time, the **[trope associated with China was not
necessarily that of thief.]{.underline}** In the mass news media, **[a
militaristic lens framed much of the discussion, [depicting China as a
rule breaker]{.mark} flouting international norms and thus [posing a
security threat]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For example, a Los Angeles Times
article highlighted that "China in the last year has developed ways to
infiltrate and manipulate computer networks around the world in what
U.S. defense officials conclude is a new and potentially dangerous
military capability, according to a Pentagon report" (Barnes, 2008).
**[China is even [placed in relation to al-Qaeda]{.mark}]{.underline}**:
"Cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage pose a greater potential danger to
U.S. national security than Al Qaeda and other militants that have
dominated America's global focus since Sept. 11, 2001, the nation's top
intelligence officials said Tuesday" (Dilanian, 2013). **[This
juxtaposition with al-Qaeda only served to [heighten]{.mark} the
[military valence of China's cyber activities]{.mark}, and a push to
prepare for such a threat]{.underline}**. Indeed, in the words of
Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL): "The threat, to be sure, is real---and, we
cannot allow ourselves to grow complacent ..." (Nelson 2008). Snowden's
revelations of US spying on China in June of 2013 drastically changed
the shape of the discussion however. Snowden demonstrated that the NSA
(1) had two data centers in China from which it had been inserting spy
software into vulnerable computers; (2) targeted the Chinese University
of Hong Kong, public officials, businesses, and students; (3) hacked
mobile phones; and (4) in 2009, hacked the Pacnet headquarters in Hong
Kong, which runs one of the biggest regional fibre-optic networks**[. In
response to Snowden's revelations, a spate of articles compared the
United States' and China's hacking, displaying a range of attitudes from
journalists---some espoused that both countries demonstrate equivalent
transgressive behavior, while others argued that China has crossed the
line into more aggressive hacking that goes beyond the United States'
more benign "preemptive" hacking.]{.underline}** The latter attitude
indicates the resilience of tropes of the Yellow and Red Perils, a China
whose inherent ideological and cultural differences with the West makes
it a threat. **[The different lenses through which journalists and
pundits viewed China's spying in comparison with that of the United
States [further invoke]{.mark} this [Orientalist
demarcation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. An article in The Washington Post
thus contrasts China's behavior against that of the United States, which
merely seeks "to **[examine huge amounts of communication metadata
around the world to look for trends]{.underline}**" and "**[to preempt
some threat against the U.S." [China's spying]{.mark} is
[described]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, **[[as "infiltrating]{.mark}
almost every powerful institution in [Washington]{.mark}, D.C.,"
"breaking into major news organizations," "stealing sensitive military
technology," and "stealing so much intellectual property that China's
hacking has been called the 'greatest transfer of wealth in
history'"]{.underline}** (Fisher, 2013). **[Drawing in particular on
incendiary words like "stealing" and "infiltrating," this article
[distinguishes China as a sneaky thief.]{.mark} US journalists and
pundits, in charging China with stealing economic resources, have
further [solidified]{.mark} the [demarcation]{.mark} of China [as an
inferior and dangerous Other.]{.mark}]{.underline}** A well-circulated
quote by national security pundit Adam Segal stated, "The **[problem is
we're not talking about the same things]{.underline}** ... **[We're
trying to make a distinction between cyber economic espionage and normal
political-military espionage. The Chinese don't make that same
distinction"]{.underline}** (Bengali & Dilanian, 2015). **[[By
portraying China as unable to grasp]{.mark} the fundamental distinction
between economics and national [security]{.mark}, Segal [suggests
China's thievery is]{.mark} connected to a more [fundamental character
flaw]{.mark}---China is [unable to grasp]{.mark} proper [civilized
norms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Similarly, US official response has been
that China's view of data collection as a sovereign right has rendered
them essentially different from the United States and by implication,
the civilized world. That Chinese governmental espionage involves the
collection of economic intelligence that is shared with Chinese
companies further departs from civilized norms. Michael Rogers, Director
of the National Security Agency thus explained that "they clearly don't
have the same lines in the sand, if you will, with that regard"
(Bennett, 2015). **[Historically, US [depictions of China as
uncivilized]{.mark} have [occurred whenever China]{.mark} has [gained
power]{.mark} or threatened US interests. The narrative of China as a
sort of child following in the United States' footsteps on the path to
modernity has proven exceedingly popular since World War II and frames
the US approach to China as a potential ally and resource who at the
same time may never be civilizable]{.underline}** (Kim, 2010; Vukovich,
2012). **[[In this Orientalist narrative, China's journey to
modernity]{.mark} is always [understood as]{.mark}]{.underline}**
precarious and, moreover, **[[subject to US vigilance]{.mark} as to
[whether it meets]{.mark} the [appropriate
benchmarks]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The title of an editorial in The
Washington Post epitomizes current iterations of this sentiment and the
ease with which Orientalist imagery can be invoked to portray China's
path to modernity as needing US guidance when China falls out of line:
"The US Needs to Tame the Cyber-Dragon: Stronger Measures are Need\[ed\]
to Block China's Economic Espionage \[emphasis mine\]" ("The U.S. Needs
to Tame," 2013). **[In reality, US vigilance can be attributed to the
concern since the end of the Cold War, that a "sleeping giant" able to
challenge US global hegemony is awakening]{.underline}** (Kim, 2010).
Thus, the cultural work done by portrayals of China as unable to adhere
to civilized norms serve to bolster the image of China as perpetually
unprepared to be a responsible member of the international community. In
fact, this narrative of China's thievery serves to persuade the American
public that China is a threat to the international community. One Wall
Street Journal journalist perfectly echoes this sentiment: A China that
leads the world in the theft of intellectual property, computer hacking
and resource nationalism will prove extremely destabilizing. If it
continues on this course, Beijing should not be surprised if other
countries begin to band together to collectively counter some of the
more harmful implications of China's rise. A better outcome for all will
be for China to embrace its responsibilities to help lead the world ...
(Metzl, 2011) This article, although hopeful that China may at some
future point become a responsible global actor, even leader, ultimately
reifies the notion that an increase in **[[China's]{.mark} global [power
is always suspect.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Cognitive biotech

#### The pursuit of human enhancement is a form of [masked orientalism]{.underline}. 

**Taillandier 21** (Apolline Taillandier, \""STARING INTO THE
SINGULARITY" AND OTHER POSTHUMAN TALES: TRANSHUMANIST STORIES OF FUTURE
CHANGE\", Wiley Online Library,

Accessed 7-19-2022)//ILake🪐

According to Bostrom and Yudkowsky, **[[superintelligent A]{.mark}I
promises to [change humanity\'s destiny]{.mark} in unprecedented ways,
yet this future would need to be actively shaped rather than passively
anticipated.]{.underline}** A key notion in this respect is that **[risk
preparedness requires unprecedented forms of human and social
engineering.]{.underline}** For instance, **[[Bostrom]{.mark} has
[suggested]{.mark} cognitive [enhancement]{.mark} as one way [to
maximize]{.mark} the likelihood of an AI
[transition]{.mark}]{.underline}** occurring at a manageable (that is,
secure) pace.62 As is rarely noted, **[the apparently radical
vision]{.underline}**s of Vinge and Kurzweil also **[entail elements of
continuity: intellectual property rights for the former, some form of
morality for the latter.]{.underline}** In Vinge\'s words, "the
post-Singularity world does fit with the larger tradition of change and
cooperation that started long ago (perhaps even before the rise of
biological life)"; this means that "**[much of what we value (knowledge,
memory, thought) need never be lost."63 As Bostrom and a group of AI
policy experts have argued, avoiding a disruptive AI scenario would
require specific forms of global political regulation]{.underline}**,
such as **[averting the threat of a technology race between competing
nation-states.]{.underline}**64 Thus, **[[although AI promises]{.mark}
to make an [unprecedented]{.mark} kind of [change]{.mark} in human
history, [it]{.mark} also [imbues]{.mark} the posthuman horizon with
what I have elsewhere referred to as a [conservative
inclination]{.mark}]{.underline}**; indeed, **[long-term
[dangers]{.mark} posed by AI [seem to justify]{.mark} urgent [calls for
risk mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline}** that link the preservation of
existing global orders with the furthering of humane values.65
**[Safeguarding the future of innovation is a matter of changing the
aims of AI from a scientific discipline concerned with problem-solving,
efficiency, and accuracy]{.underline}** "to a field concerned with
systems that are provably beneficial for humans."66 From this
perspective, the scalar future of superintelligence opens up new realms
of value and unprecedented possibilities for global coordination, the
exploration of which would be essential for safely developing posthuman
AI. PATHWAYS TO UNPRECEDENTED CHANGE As scholars have aptly noted,
**[[transhumanist futures]{.mark} profoundly [challenge]{.mark}
humanity\'s [role as]{.mark} the [central subject]{.mark} of
history]{.underline}**; at the same time, **[they do not appear to
destabilize Western modern history\'s universalizing
ambitions.]{.underline}**67 Simon has claimed that narratives of
developmental continuity leading from humanity to posthumanity must be
avoided. The challenge of making sense of the unprecedented is retaining
the emancipatory potential of Enlightenment horizons of collective
betterment and the critical power of postcolonial and feminist
perspectives. In this sense, transhumanism finds itself at odds with "a
global approach to politics without the myth of a global identity," such
as that which has been promoted by Dipesh Chakrabarty.68 **[At the same
time, [transhumanism turns technology into]{.mark} the main [agent of
change.]{.mark} By presenting "a better-than-human being that is also
other-than-human," transhumanist technological projects enact a vision
of posthumanity as "humanity\'s temporal other]{.underline}**" that
undermines the modern Western idea of history.69 In this respect,
**[transhumanism is best understood as part of a specific historical
moment]{.underline}**, one marked by the rise of an evental sense of
historicity. As this article demonstrates, however, transhumanism is
also a highly ambiguous idea---at least, it is in terms of how its
advocates have defined it. For instance, Bostrom has described
transhumanism as a gradual process of awakening to new realms of
experience and value. Defined in this way, **[transhumanism [aims to
update]{.mark} progressive [hopes]{.mark} in the light of new
technological possibilities.]{.underline}**70 According to Bostrom,
**[technologies of "[human enhancement]{.mark}" [are]{.mark} the
contemporary [forms of a]{.mark} modern "[quest to develop
further]{.mark}."]{.underline}**71 Yet many **[transhumanists have
[argued that]{.mark} [Western values of]{.mark} human [improvement
failed to be]{.mark} truly [universal]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For
instance, **[transhumanist futurist F. M. Esfandiary harshly
[criticized]{.mark} the romanticization of suffering and nature as a
flawed intellectual posture that often constitutes [a disguised form of
orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or what he called the "doomsday chic
of Western intellectuals."72 To point out precisely how it is that
transhumanist stories have only partly overcome universalist human
history, **[it is [necessary to]{.mark} [examine]{.mark} the forms of
[knowledge]{.mark} and identity [that would survive]{.mark} the
[transition]{.mark} to some unknown future.]{.underline}**
**[Transhumanists understand the human condition as a transitional
stage, so they believe that some of its qualities are meant to be
permanently overcome]{.underline}** whereas others need to be carefully
preserved. **[These three conceptualizations of the posthuman
future]{.underline}**---the Promethean, the spontaneous, and the
scalar---**[illustrate how transhumanist futures intertwine notions of
utopia, dystopia, progress, and radical change in different
ways.]{.underline}** **[The [posthuman]{.mark} is not conceived of as an
entirely new era, even if realizing immortality and superintelligence
would fundamentally alter the course of human history]{.underline}**.
Rather, as Bostrom has argued, **[transhumanism [represents]{.mark} the
[way toward]{.mark} a realm of [reality]{.mark}, experience, scientific
knowledge, and morality that is not yet accessible to
humans]{.underline}**.73 In this sense, transhumanism is best understood
as involving both continuous and discontinuous modes of historicity:
**[the posthuman future is [at]{.mark} once [an]{.mark} [unprecedented
future]{.mark} and a development from past [and present]{.mark} patterns
of [practices]{.mark}, values, and ideas.]{.underline}** This point is
evidenced by the three types of posthuman futures outlined above. In the
Promethean future, unprecedented change would be brought about by an
enlightened vanguard of individuals who are dedicated to expanding human
capacities through self-transforming technologies, ranging from
bodybuilding to psychoactive drugs. **[Continuity would be ensured by
conserving personal identity, which is variously located in genetic
material or in patterns of neuronal activity.]{.underline}** In the
spontaneous future, change would occur through the uncontrolled
emergence of new life forms. However, **[decentralized social
institutions would be sustained by shared norms of rationality and the
continuous evolution of scientific public culture.]{.underline}** In the
scalar future, change would depend on the rationalizing power of AI,
whereas continuity would result from the alignment of human values and
AI decisions. **[In the three cases, [historical change would
involve]{.mark} some form of [nonhuman agency]{.mark}; at the same time,
it would remain inscribed within the story of humanity.]{.underline}**
Whether they seek to preserve cryogenized bodies, to build a digital
archive "as big as the earth" (to borrow Theodor H. Nelson\'s phrase),
or to ensure that future generations actually come into existence with a
sense of what makes life worthwhile, most transhumanists are as
concerned with the past as they are with the future.74 In transhumanist
mailing lists and journals, special historical rubrics and calls to
personal archives have expressed a sense of historicity, which
transhumanists have understood as being manifested in the continuity of
their own enterprise and that of individual identity through time. For
this reason, posthuman futures have not altogether defied historical
understanding. This fact has influenced transhumanist practices: many
transhumanists believe that knowledge produced "with an eye toward
future users" (including those in the remote future)---cryogenic and
time capsules or digital archives, for instance---must be protected from
future decay and from unprecedented technological breakthroughs.75 Yet
many also believe that some form of identity and the conditions for
making sense of the world will remain essentially the same. In
transhumanism, visions of the truly other-than-human future usually
stand in opposition to a desirable, more humane future in which the
**[[development]{.mark} of benevolent AI converges with forms of human
enhancement or transformation.]{.underline}** For instance, **[the
roboticist Hans Moravec [pointed out]{.mark} that [conceiving of
intelligent machines a]{.mark}s humanity\'s "mind children" required
looking into "a future which, from our present vantage point, is best
described by the words '[postbiological']{.mark} or even
'supernatural.]{.underline}**' It is a world in which **[the human race
has been swept away by the tide of cultural change, usurped by its own
artificial progeny.]{.underline}**"76 At the same time, Moravec\'s
"transmigration" scenario offered a pathway to human survival in a
future in which "protein-based" intelligent life-forms would be
disadvantaged.**[77 In this and less uncanny scenarios of posthuman
future, the possibility of directing evolution or averting technological
catastrophe is understood as taking part in a broader historical
course]{.underline}**---be it genealogical (as in the case of the
Promethean future), evolutionary (as in the case of the spontaneous
future), or accelerationist (as in the case of the scalar future).

### COVID

#### Discourses of disease as security threats follow the trend of the racialization of disease, putting a target on Asian and Black people's backs

**Siu and Chun 20** (Lok Siu, Claire Chun, October 2020, **[Yellow
Peril]{.underline}** and Techno-orientalism **[in the Time of
Covid-19]{.underline}**: Racialized Contagion, Scientific Espionage, and
Techno-Economic Warfare, page 427-428)**//BRownRice**

**[The [Racialized Contagion]{.mark}]{.underline}** The **[recent
[exponential rise of anti-Asian violence]{.mark} in the United States
and [globally]{.mark} during the pandemic illustrates the [persistent
danger of racializing diseases]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Historians and
social critics have documented and **[traced the ways in which diseases
have been continually racialized by their association with particular
peoples in geographical regions.]{.underline}** Examples in recent
memory include **[[SARS]{.mark} [marked as Asian, MERS as Middle
Eastern, Ebola as African, and so on]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In regards
to this current pandemic, it might be useful to recall the
**[popularization of the "Chinese as contagion]{.underline}**" trope in
U.S. history, as its multiple afterlives continue to inform the public's
facile acceptance of the notion of Chinese as diseased bodies and
pathogenic carriers. The late **[[nineteenth century racialization
of]{.mark} the [smallpox]{.mark} outbreak]{.underline}** in San
Francisco serves as the antecedent to the current moment and illustrates
its **[relationship to the broader context of the [anti-Chinese
movement.]{.mark}]{.underline}** When the smallpox epidemic broke out in
San Francisco intermittently from 1868 through the 1880s, its origin was
presumptively traced to Chinatown. At the time, it was widely accepted
that epidemics were caused by environmental factors like polluted air,
contaminated water, and general bad hygiene and sanitation. **[Through
prevailing racist ideas of this period, [Chinatown]{.mark}'s crowded
streets, tight living quarters, and irregular layout were taken as
evidence in creating a "[laboratory of
infection]{.mark}."]{.underline}**17 According to Nayan Shah, public
health officials of the time helped construct Chinatown as a place
filled with "horrors of percolating waste, teeming bodies, and a
polluted atmosphere" and attributed these unsavory conditions to
"depraved" innate Chinese cultural behaviors and practices, ignoring the
economic factors that compel sharing of living quarters and the racist
state in not extending sanitation services to Chinatown.18 **[By linking
the environmental conditions of Chinatown with Chinese "primordial"
culture, [government officials]{.mark} came to [target]{.mark} the
[Chinese person]{.mark}]{.underline}** (the culturalbiological body)
**[[as the site of disease]{.mark} origin, contamination, and threat to
public health writ large.]{.underline}** Another study of public health
in Los Angeles offers an analogous scenario.19 **[The emergence of these
[public health discourses]{.mark} in the 1870s must be [situated in the
context of the anti-Chinese movement]{.mark}. As Chinese workers poured
into cities]{.underline}** like San Francisco and Los Angeles **[after
the completion of the railroad, they quickly became targets of
intensified prejudice and racial violence.]{.underline}** To the white
working class, these Chinese laborers were **[perceived not only as
economic threats to their livelihood; but, as [racialized discourses of
Chinese as disease carriers intensified]{.mark}]{.underline}**, they
were also feared and despised as a biomedical threat. Together, these
**[[yellow peril discourses molded perceptions of ethnic Chinese
as]{.mark} both [economic and biological threats]{.mark}, fueling the
anti-Chinese movement that eventually led to the successful legislation
of the Chinese Exclusion Act. This historical example shows how the
racialization of disease worked in tandem with racial capitalist logic
to animate anti-Chinese sentiment, violence, and legislation. The
current rise in anti-Asian violence is clearly spurred by President
Trump's persistent attacks against China along with his explicit
racialization of the virus.]{.underline}** Indeed, since the onset of
the pandemic, his administration has sought to blame China, whether it
is for hiding the seriousness of the outbreak in Wuhan, delaying
communication of the outbreak, or underreporting the number of deaths.
**[The deployment of the politics of blame seeks to displace the
pandemic-induced anger, anxiety, and rage onto China and, by extension,
onto the bodies of Chinese and Asian Americans. Moreover, the
[racialized terms]{.mark}, the "Chinese virus" and the "kung flu,"
[naturalizes the virus as being endemic to Chinese
bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, thereby **[[conjuring the phantasm
of]{.mark} the Chinese/[Asian contagion]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While
the ideational power of the Chinese/Asian contagion **[lies in its
construction of the Asian body as the vehicle and embodiment of the
virus, the deployment of blame against China/the Chinese for the spread
of the virus serves as the catalyst that directs anger and rage against
Chinese/Asian bodies.]{.underline}** However, to view current attacks
against Chinese/Asian Americans in the isolated context of the pandemic
risks the danger of interpreting this aggression "as exception."
Instead, drawing on the lessons of the late nineteenth century example,
we want to situate the rise of anti-Asian violence within the broader
context of the anti-China campaign.

In its third incarnation as cyber-Orientalism after traditional

that [info]{.mark}rmation [is]{.mark} now [produced]{.mark}, after being
first distributed through word of mouth]{.underline}**, then through the
radio during the world wars, then through the first televised conflicts

that]{.mark} Said's theatricality of the [Orient is fully
implemented]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as Lisa Nakamura noted in her 1995
essay "Race in/for Cyberspace: Identity Tourism and Racial Passing on
the Internet," using as her example the then-famous, and still online
today, cyberspace construct LambdaMOO ("Multi-UserDomain Object
Oriented"): **["Role-playing sites on the Internet...offer their
participants programming features such as the ability to physically
'set' one's gender, race and physical appearance, through which they
can, indeed are required to, project a version of the self which is
inherently theatrical."]{.underline}** (Nakamura 712) In an uncanny
description of how Orientalism may have been constructed, acted out, and
understood half a millennium ago, 7 Nakamura writes that in cyberspace's
online communities, **["\[t\]his type of [Orientalized theatricality is
a form of identity tourism]{.mark}; players who choose to perform this
type of racial play are almost always white, and the [appropriation of
stereotyped]{.mark}...figures allows them to indulge in a dream of
crossing over racial boundaries temporarily and
recreationally."]{.underline}** (Nakamura 714) **[This theatrical game
of "[identity tourism]{.mark}" barely [hides]{.mark} the fact, to
Nakamura, that it "represents a phantasmatic [imperial space]{.mark},
much like Kipling's AngloIndia, which supplies a stage upon which the
'grand dream of a successful quest' can be enacted."]{.underline}**
(Nakamura 714-15) A year later, Ziauddin Sardar's essay
"Alt.Civilizations.FAQ: **[[Cyberspace]{.mark} as [the darker side of
the West]{.mark}" firmly anchored America's history-long thirst for new
territorial grabs onto the new virtual realms of
cyberspace]{.underline}**, saying: "**[Beyond postmodernism's
subjugation of the realities, [modes of knowing and social being of
Other cultures, the West urgently needs new spaces to
conquer]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The moon and the inner planets are out
for the time being given the cost of colonizing them. The outer space is
a domain best left, for the time being, to Start Trek. **[For the
conquest to continue unabated, [new]{.mark} terrestrial
[territories]{.mark} have to be found; and where they don't actually
exist, they [must be created. Enter, cyberspace]{.mark}."]{.underline}**
(Sardar 734) **[The Internet]{.underline}**, originally a military
creation of the US Department of Defense in the 1960s, has
**[developed]{.underline}**, according to Sardar, **[as a "conscious
[reflection of]{.mark} the deepest [desires]{.mark}, aspirations,
experiential yearning and spiritual Angst [of West]{.mark}ern
man."]{.underline}** (Sardar 734) Cyberspace, however, is no mere stage
for the re-creation of the non-Western mirror image. As Sardar sharply
writes, **["[cyberspace]{.mark} not only kills history, it [kills
people]{.mark} too,"]{.underline}** (737) **[and it is in the
cyber-arena that mainly non-Western [populations are constantly
observed]{.mark} by drones piloted thousands of miles away by operators
alternating between playstation-like bouts of tracking, targeting, and
killing, and PTA sessions or family gatherings only a few minutes
later.]{.underline}** Drone operation terms, like \"bugsplat\" for
confirmed kills and \"squirters\" for 8 the luckier survivors running
away, are direct descendants of god\'s-eye games where the player reigns
supreme over the fate of her digital sim-creatures. This distance
killing is then relayed, through various channels (YouTube, TV,
Whatsapp, and other digital media) to a public, Western as well as
non-Western, thirsting to enter, voyeur-like, a cybernetic game where
digital circuits arouse the most basic instincts. The other side has
also provided, of course, its share of gruesome scenes for public
cyberspace consumption. **[[Cyber-Orientalism is]{.mark} also a more
insidious, more indirect [face of hegemony]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In
her 2012 essay "Digital Occupation: Gaza's High-Tech Enclosure," Helga
Tawil-Souri points out that Israel's disengagement from the Gaza Strip
in 2005 was only a physical one, leaving in its place a vastly more
complex arsenal of "frictionless high-technology mechanisms" affecting,
and in turn controlling, the Palestinian Authority's telecommunication
sector, resulting in what she calls the **["digital occupation" of
Gaza]{.underline}**, defined as the **["multifaceted process that
combines the territorial and economic dynamics of land and digital
enclosures."]{.underline}** (Tawil 31) **[Digital enclosures of
Tawil-Souri's kind in Gaza are closely related to [cybernetics]{.mark},
itself a transdisciplinary field involving mechanical, biological, and
social elements, an instrument [where the system being
analyzed]{.mark}---in this case [the Orient]{.mark}---[reacts to and
produces changes that can be measured as feedback that will trigger
changes in the system itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**, changes that can be
simulated, replicated, and therefore categorized. But the
**[[cyberPanopticon]{.underline}]{.mark}**, an infinitely more refined
concept than its original mechanico-architectural construct,
**[[contains]{.underline}]{.mark}** in itself, as in the Benthamian
model, **[the seeds of [opposite emancipatory
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, what one may call, in the context of
this paper, de Certeauan cyber-practices of everyday life. Michel de
Certeau's 1984 book explored ways in which Michel Foucault's
**[[Discipline and Punish model]{.mark} could be [circumvented]{.mark}
through everyday practices such as using ordinary language and walking
in the city.]{.underline}** The discursive re-mapping of the physical 9
city enables citizens to divert systems of control set up by power
centers. This becomes all the more relevant when one realizes that
**[cyberspace]{.underline}**, in its majority, **[is a giant exercise in
writing, whether in the programming code or the input and feedback from
users, and at the same time a virtual city, criss-crossed by data
information highways, communication hubs, and online
communities.]{.underline}** Cyberspace is the locus of practices of
everyday life par excellence, offering cybernauts possibilities of
digital subversion and invisibility undreamed of before. As early as
2000, Edmund Ghareeb assessed the role of the new media in the
information revolution in the Arab world, concluding that with the
internet, "in some ways far more powerful than any of the other
technologies...Web pages...appeal to some opposition groups seeking to
get their messages across." **[[Hacking]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
foreshadowed by de Certeau's bricolage nature of everyday practices,
**[[is]{.mark} to Ghareeb [the answer to]{.mark} the
[government]{.mark}al nature of [control]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whose
bureaucrats "are not always as versatile or as creative as computer
users." (Ghareeb 415) Likewise, Lawrence Pintak, in 2009, advanced the
idea that Arab journalists using the new technologies were equally
responsible for the emergence of a revolutionary Arab consciousness,
placing them "on the borderlands of Arab identity, shaping an emerging
'imagined' watan...that, in some ways, transcends the traditional lines
in the sand that define the nation-state." (Pintak 191) More recently,
after Snowden's revelation of the Prism surveillance program, ordinary
users and hackers put together a website called "Prism-break," with the
obvious play on the prism/prison near-homonymy, offering cybernauts
alternative operating systems and programs with which it is believed
they can escape the panoptical grasp of intrusive, mainly Western,
governments. **[It is in that same [cyber-arena]{.mark} that Arabs will
be able to [reshape]{.mark} the construction of the [Orient]{.mark}al in
counter-hegemonic ways of re-writing the self, [and precipitate]{.mark}
the [demise]{.mark} of the second stage of the development of
Orientalism, area studies.]{.underline}** When Said described 9-11 as
the "\[s\]pectacular horror...that struck New York...\[and\] ushered in
a new world of unseen, 10 unknown assailants, terror missions without
political message, senseless destruction," (Inadequate Banners, 2001) he
was perhaps unknowingly echoing Guy Debord's 1967 La Société du
spectacle, in which the French Marxist founder of the Situationist
International defined the spectacle as "the heir of all the weaknesses
of the Western philosophical project which was to understand activity,
dominated by the categories of seeing; indeed, it is based on the
incessant deployment of the precise technical rationality which grew out
of this thought. It does not realize philosophy, it philosophizes
reality. It is the concrete life of all which is degraded into a
speculative universe." (Debord, thesis 20) Combining area studies' focus
on analyzing the present socio-politico-cultural variables of, in this
context, **[the Orient, with the profound Angst born of a decidedly
hegemonic past, the spectacle of cyber-Orientalism is the present-day
technological marriage of bits of information with an imaginary
discourse of its nemesis, its double, its clone. [In the digital realm,
there are no originals]{.mark}, as Walter Benjamin presciently foresaw;
there are [only copies]{.mark}, and any hitherto assumed [superiority
vanishes]{.mark} as the two come face to face.]{.underline}** Jean
Baudrillard, in "Clone Story," masterfully problematizes the issue of
the double, which is "precisely not a prosthesis: it is an imaginary
figure, which, just like the soul, the shadow, the mirror image, haunts
the subject like his other, which makes it so that the subject is
simultaneously itself and never resembles itself again, which haunts the
subject like a subtle and always averted death. This is not always the
case, however: **[when the double materializes, when it becomes visible,
it [signifies imminent death]{.mark}."]{.underline}** (Baudrillard 95)
**[[A death of the image which originally represented nothing, and which
cyberOrientalism uncovers as different and deferred, where often
contradictory discourses overlap, traverse, and transect the digital
spaces.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Dickie Wallace, in 2008, submitted Sacha
Baron Cohen's film "Borat" to a close Baudrillardian reading, producing
a "hyperrealization" of Borat "with the Map of the European 'Other,'" in
fact mapping out "the traces of the 11 phantasmagoria of the Other out
of which Borat is formed...\[exploiting\] a Saidian discourse of this
Orientalized part of Europe, substituting the region's 'signs of the
real' for a 'real" that becomes 'Borat's Kazakhstan.'" (Wallace 36) What
Wallace did was to uncover Cohen's tongue-in-cheek mise-en-scène where
the everyday reality is mercilessly derealized into a nonsensical
discourse; Borat's representation of Kazakhstan "has replaced the real
Kazakhstan," (Wallace 38) effectively producing a simulacrum which has,
in Baudrillard's words, "no relation to any reality whatsoever."
(Baudrillard 6) What was predicted by the Frankfurt School, and
theorized by Guy Debord and other post-structuralist thinkers, found
itself suddenly realized, and vastly aggrandized and facilitated, by the
epochal changes facing humanity as it enters, every year more surely,
into the **[technologies of digital information, augmented reality,
cyber-surveillance and countersurveillance. From late medieval to
industrialized, from post-industrialized to informational, [Orientalism
is ready to be ushered into its third phase, that of
cyber-Orientalism.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Democracy

#### The affirmative's quest for democracy reinforces a dictatorship-democracy dichotomy that serves as an orientalist avatar of the differential degrees between the East and the West.

The notion of [[democracy is]{.mark} not only a category of analysis (a
Weberian ideal type). It works today largely as [an **identity marker
for the West**]{.mark}, the signifier of its very quintessence. As such,
[it]{.mark} establishes and [perpetuates the superiority complex
of]{.mark} the [West vis-à-vis "the Rest",]{.mark} democracy being held
as the universal model of the "end of history".7 Western
[democracies]{.mark} have thus unsurprisingly long been [annoyed at the
fact that China]{.mark} blatantly [refuses to "**transit" toward
democracy** in accordance with]{.mark} the **prophecy of
[democracy]{.mark}** as the end of history and the **West [as the
destiny of the world]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the face of the
emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Western democracies have repeatedly
asserted the superiority of their political regime---with, in the
background, the belief in a form of superior democratic rationality.
However, from March-April onwards, as Western democracies in turn came
to be seriously affected by the disease, this stance started to reveal
its illusory as well as deadly character. Does Democracy Protect Against
Disease? When the epidemic was announced, in France as in [many
[Western]{.mark} countries, the media [discourse]{.mark} immediately
engaged in a [denunc]{.mark}iation of the [Chinese political
system]{.mark}: editorials, op-eds, and broadcast or televised debates
condemned the death of Dr. Li Wenliang, considered a "martyr of the
coronavirus",8 [analysing how it revealed]{.mark} of the
"**[failure]{.mark}**" [of]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark} system,9
particularly of its "**[totalitarianism]{.mark}**".]{.underline}10
French media have not hesitated to attribute Dr. Li's death to his
treatment by Chinese authorities, writing at length about his
"imprisonment",11 or even, for some, going as far as to suggest his
murder by the Chinese authorities.12 In other words, the coronavirus was
framed less as an issue of public health than as a matter of foreign
policy/politics. By the end of January, the announcement of the lockdown
in China reinforced this reading even further: the lockdown was
presented as a totalitarian measure dictated by the profound nature of
the Chinese regime, rather than by the severity of the problem in
epidemiological terms. The decision to put tens of millions of people
under house arrest reinforced the feeling of radical alterity between
Europe and China: more than ever, it was out of the question to compare
the two entities. Meanwhile, the superiority of democracy was
energetically reaffirmed.13 Then, from March onwards, while the prospect
of confinement no longer appeared so "exotic/archaic" in Europe and as
Wuhan started to lift its lockdown, editorials and op-eds began to
question the ability of democracy to handle the crisis any better than
China had.14 The question was raised as to whether authoritarianism
might not ultimately be better able to respond to health crises,
although the answer remained invariably negative: no, of course not.15
[Finally, from early April onwards, when [China reported]{.mark} its
"[success" in eradicating the virus, West]{.mark}ern democracies imposed
quarantine measures---although European mortality rates quickly
escalated to higher numbers than in China. Since then, editorials and
op-eds have returned to the discourse of non-comparability,
[arguing]{.mark} that [Chinese numbers were fake]{.mark}, which was
[typical of]{.mark} Chinese "[propaganda]{.mark}",16 [itself a product
of China being a "**structurally deceitful
country**".]{.mark}]{.underline}17 [Thus, [it was argued]{.mark}, given
the lack of comparable data (statistics in democracies being assumed to
be honest and reliable), [the comparison between democracy and
dictatorship would be impossible]{.mark}---as well as being morally
unacceptable]{.underline}. Are Public Policies Comparable Only Among
Democracies? Not very many situations lend themselves to international
comparison better than the one arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic.
John Stuart Mill, one of the founders of qualitative comparison,
established in his System of Logic, published in 1843, a typology of the
comparative methodologies to isolate and test the variables of a given
phenomenon: the method of most similar cases producing differing
outcomes and the method of most different cases producing similar
outcomes.18 The China-France comparison seems a priori to be in the
matrix of the most different cases: for the same outcome, namely the
suppression of the virus, two different methods, one democratic, the
other authoritarian. Yet, the most similar cases comparison appears to
be a better fit: the two countries have used the same methods, namely
lockdown (confinement), but with dissimilar results. China aimed to
eradicate the virus, France to slow down its pace (the so-called
"flattening" of the curve). Of course, the lockdown was stricter in
China than in France, but progressively, with the use of drones and
methods of surveillance, this gap has reduced.19 In certain respects,
the French lockdown was both more stringent and more massive than the
one imposed in China: China confined only one province and a handful of
cities, a tiny part of its population, without declaring a state of
emergency, while Paris imposed a national lockdown on its 67 million
inhabitants and declared a state of emergency. In France, the media
pushed a narrative of blaming and shaming China, which in turn delayed
rather than prompted the reaction of the French government to take
public health measures against the coronavirus. The expected positive
effects of freedom of the press and transparency in terms of inducing
prompt government reaction to the crisis did not materialise. The
initial absence of reaction toward the virus contrasts with the
"overreaction" deployed against the H1N1 flu in 2009, which had a much
lower death rate than COVID-19 but was first declared in the United
States, another country considered to be part of the "club of liberal
Western democracies". So, why did Amartya Sen's theory, once
extrapolated to epidemics, not prove to be true in the case of COVID-19?
The Democracy-Dictatorship Binary: [An Orientalist Reading of
Comparative Politics In 1978, Edward Saïd, following Syed Hussein
Alatas,20 defined [Orientalism]{.mark} as an epistemic process at the
heart of the domination of the West, a process [built]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} a series of [essentialising stereotypes]{.mark}.21
[From]{.mark} an [Orientalist perspective]{.mark}, the [COVID-19]{.mark}
epidemic was [interpreted in]{.mark} the [West as]{.mark} the
dysfunctional, even well-deserved, **[offspring of Chinese
totalitarianism]{.mark}**, rather than as a public health event. Biases
and stereotypes against China, reactivated by the start of the epidemic,
are not only racist against Chinese people per se [but also reveal
deeper **stereotypes of authoritarian regimes, of which Beijing
is**]{.mark} **currently [the paradigmatic
case]{.mark}**.]{.underline}22 The origins of the massive media reaction
of blaming China can be traced back to the Orientalism of our categories
of thought and the categories we use in the social sciences. [Such
[Orientalism lies at]{.mark} the [heart of]{.mark} the genesis of the
discipline of [political science]{.mark}. It suffices to quote
Montesquieu, who was the first, in his Spirit of the Laws, to establish
despotism as the "natural" condition of the East, based on his readings
on Japan, China, Siam, and the Ottoman Empire.23 Next, in Montesquieu's
wake, John Stuart [Mill and]{.mark} Max [Weber associated
freedom]{.mark}, legality, and modernity distinctively and [exclusively
with the West]{.mark}]{.underline}.24 After the Second World War,
transitology, which borrows heavily from the theory of modernisation
derived from the Weberian thesis, became one of the pillars of the
discipline of comparative politics.25 [Non-Western countries were
intended to "transit" toward democracy. **[The dictatorship-democracy
dichotomy became the]{.mark} new semiotic avatar of the [differential
degrees of civilization between West and East]{.mark}**. [The central
question]{.mark}, formulated from the West, focused on how to "assist"
non-democratic countries to democratise, [reactivat]{.mark}ing the [myth
of]{.mark} the [civilising mission of]{.mark} the [West]{.mark}. From
the 1980s onwards, the social sciences were diversely affected by the
Saïd revolution. If Orientalism had a major impact on the discipline of
anthropology, it had a lesser impact on other social sciences. [In
political science]{.mark} and public law in particular, [Eurocentrism
was]{.mark} vigorously [denounced, but]{.mark} the **[comparison between
dictatorships and democracies]{.mark}** remained limited [to]{.mark} the
[emphasis]{.mark} of [their]{.mark} profound, [ontological
alterity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Orientalism diffused with more ease
within the interdisciplinary field of "area studies", a somewhat
marginalised field. If most of the "areas" forming the units of area
studies were to some degree homogeneous in religious or political
terms---real or fantasied26---this was not the case of Oriental Asia,
characterised by its extreme religious as well as political diversity.

### Drones

#### Drones are a tool of Orientalist discourse that shape Western anxieties projected into forms of necropolitical genocide and dehumanization

The drone programme and its practices: orientalism, biopolitics and
state terrorism

So far I have shown the discourses and tropes of modernity that
characterise the drone and its surveillance as a neutral and humane way
for finding and killing terrorists. In the second section, I
demonstrated that the assumptions of the mechanical drone's neutrality
and autonomy are overstated given that human beings still play a large
role in targeting. I undermined the rhetoric of objective targeting by
highlighting the **[[drone programme's colonial gaze and]{.mark} the
[Orientalism inherent to targeting and surveillance]{.mark}, which
[dehumanises]{.mark} Muslims and Arabs [and fuels enemy
creation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this section, I will show how **[the
drone programme operates as state terrorism]{.underline}**. In
continuity with the Bush administration before it, **[the Obama
administration framed its drone programme as
"self-defence,"]{.underline}** arguing that strikes precisely target
only those on a "kill list" (Obama 2013; Becker and Shane 2012). **[This
[shift from]{.mark} [punishment to more "humane" biopolitical forms of
warfare has been necessary to legitimise the violence of capitalist
democracies]{.mark} throughout modernity]{.underline}** (Kordela 2016;
Wall 2016). Since precision bombing is an exercise of sovereign power in
the sense that it involves deciding who will die and who shall be left
alone to live, **[the drone programme is a biopolitical form of warfare
used to protect the US population from the risk of
terrorism]{.underline}** (Kordela 2016; Allinson 2015; Wilcox 2015; Wall
2016). According to Foucault (2003), **[[the sovereign's
biopower]{.mark}, or right to put people to death so that others may
live, is [only legitimate insofar as it preserves (certain)
lives]{.mark} and can appear meaningful only if it succeeds in
presenting itself as necessary for the reproduction of
life]{.underline}** (Foucault 2003; Wilcox 2015; Kordela 2016).
Crucially, **[[biopower's right to kill finds its sole justification in
racism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Racism is a way of introducing "a break
into the domain of life that is under power's control: the break between
what must live and what must die" (Foucault 2003, 254). In the context
of the drone programme, **[[Orientalism forms the biopower]{.mark} which
justifies drone violence [and creates the critical break between what
must live and die]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} In Allinson's (2015)
biopolitical analysis of drone violence, she utilises Achille Mbembe's
"necropolitics", which "refers to the arrogation of, in Foucauldian
terms, the sovereign's command of death, but within the apparatuses of
surveillance, auditing, and management which characterize 'biopower'"
(2015, 114). Allinson argues that b**[y identifying racism as the
technology of power that unites the exercise of sovereign power with the
technologies of surveillance and auditing, "[the drone is]{.mark}
precisely [a tech]{.mark}nology [of the management]{.mark} of
populations: of the drawing of a 'caesura' [between worthy and unworthy
life]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (2015, 119). The drone is not an instrument
for making life live among those it surveys, but "to define who matters
and who does not, who is disposable and who is not" (Mbembe 2003, 27).
In colonial fashion, **[the drone's [surveillance is to identify
populations as less than life]{.mark}, or as dangerous life whose
extinguishing must be managed in order for valuable life to
flourish]{.underline}** (Allinson 2015). **[In order for the
drone]{.underline}** (via data mining and algorithms) and its operators
**[to distinguish between who lives and who dies, [the US
gov]{.mark}ernment and its intelligence agencies [rely upon an
Orientalist apparatus of knowledge which constructs Mid]{.mark}dle
[East]{.mark}ern males [as enemies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, the
**[drone programme's policies identify military-aged males in Pakistan,
Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and Somalia [as the category of unworthy life
and assimilate every decision to kill]{.mark} to the identification of
members of such a category]{.underline}** (Allinson 2015). These
populations of military-aged men, because they are represented as
"risks", can be "hunted" and "tracked" like prey via surveillance
because they are "savage" or "animal life" (Allinson 2015; Chamayou
2015). Although the term "terrorism" has not usually been applied to
state violence due to their presumed legitimate authority to wage
violence, theorists of critical terrorism studies have argued that
states can be terrorists as well (Blakeley and Raphael 2016; Heath-Kelly
2016; Jackson 2008; Grosscup 2006; Sluka 2000). They argue that states,
like non-state actors, also engage in terrorism -- violence directed
towards or threatened against civilians -- which is designed to instil
terror or intimidate the population of people as a means of preventing
or changing their political behaviour (Jackson 2008; Blakeley and
Raphael 2016). Blakeley and Raphael (2016) argue that **[state terrorism
can be understood in relation to foreign policy objectives, which can be
traced back to the objectives of the European colonial
era]{.underline}**. It is within this context that I analyse US
policies. In addition to drone "personality strikes" -- strikes that
target specific people as identified on a given "kill list" -- the drone
programme also engages in "signature strikes" or "crowd killings". These
strikes allow for drone operators to fire at militaryaged males
associated with suspicious activity even if their identities are
unknown. As I already argued, surveillance is limited in that there is
no visual difference between enemies and civilians and, for this reason,
**[[algorithms use surveillance feeds and data mining in order to find
targets]{.mark} based on their "suspicious activity" or
"movements"]{.underline}** (Chamayou 2015; Wilcox 2015; Amoore 2009;
Schuppli 2014; Aradau 2015). This concept is called "activity based
intelligence", and relies on an enemy's group membership, or social
network, and the number and frequency of contacts regardless of their
nature, in order to speculate whether someone is a terrorist suspect
(Chamayou 2015). A tactic such as this makes it likely that some will be
labelled guilty by association (Aradau 2015; Baggiarini 2015; Amoore
2009); as one drone officer affirms, "if we decide \[someone is\] a bad
person, the people with him are also bad" (Porter 2011, n.p.). Former
CIA Director Michael Hayden defended signature strikes to former
president Obama by stating that they could take out a lot more "bad
guys" by targeting groups instead of individuals (Klaidman 2012).
Another perceived benefit is that the more afraid militants are to
congregate, the harder it is for them to plot, plan or train for attacks
against the United States and its interests (Klaidman 2012). Contrary to
government assertions, **[most drone strikes are not actually targeting
those on the "kill list", but are targeting groups of males whose
identities are unknown]{.underline}** (Heller 2012; Shane 2015**[).
[This practice, based on]{.mark} prejudiced [racial profiling]{.mark},
demonstrates that the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[does not discriminate between civilians and suspected
militants]{.underline}**, and that **[it lumps them together due to
their coexistence in the same space]{.underline}**. Notably, by
targeting groups, the United States disrupts the social lives and
political activity of the rest of the population. For instance,
signature strikes have adverse implications for political and social
life because people in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of
Pakistan are tribal. For them, the most important social and legal
institution is the Jirga. In concrete terms, the Jirgas are vital group
discussions in which community problems are resolved by a
decision-making assembly of male elders (Cavallero, Sonnenberg, and
Knuckey 2012). However, because groups of military-aged males are likely
to be targeted by drones, the activity of coming together for such
communal decision-making is dangerous. The Living Under Drones report
reveals that civilians are perfectly cognisant of the erosion of Jirgas
due to "crowd killings" (2012). With the threat of signature strikes,
the United States has effectively limited movement and social life in
FATA through threat of bombardment. As Jan, a man who was left destitute
by a drone strike reveals: "... we saw funerals being attacked,
bakeries, mosques. It felt like the US is not leaving any part of
Waziris" life untouched. They had to destroy every segment of our life'
(quoted in Ackerman 2016, n.p.). In Yemen, others complain of similar
conditions. One man explains, "\[p\]eople were terrified. People are
afraid now to attend any large gathering -- weddings, funerals. Everyone
is just trying to survive" (quoted in Salama 2014, n.p.). Clearly,
signature strikes have disrupted the political, as well as the economic
and social spheres of civilian lives. The other controversial US policy
that targets civilians is "double taps". A double tap is a practice of
striking an already targeted site in relatively quick succession
(Cavallero, Sonnenberg, and Knuckey 2012). Living Under Drones reports
that there is significant evidence that the United States has repeatedly
engaged in this tactic (2012). Journalist Chris Woods (2013) explains
that secondary strikes have discouraged civilians from coming to one
another's rescue and have inhibited the provision of emergency medical
assistance from humanitarian workers. Living Under Drones states:
Crucially, the threat of the 'double tap' reportedly deters not only the
spontaneous instinct of neighbors and bystanders in the immediate
vicinity of strikes, but also professional humanitarian workers
providing emergency medical relief to the wounded (Cavallero,
Sonnenberg, and Knuckey 2012, 76). The double tap practice is designed
to be terroristic. For instance, Glenn Greenwald reports that a 2004 US
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Bulletin states: \[T\]errorists
may use secondary explosive devices to kill and injure emergency
personnel responding to an initial attack'. Such terror devices 'are
generally detonated less than one hour after initial attack, targeting
first responders as well as the general population. (cited in Greenwald
2012, n.p.) According to the standards set by the FBI then, the United
States is committing acts of terrorism. The report by Cavallero,
Sonnenberg, and Knuckey (2012) reveals that due to fear of being
attacked, emergency personnel now wait up to six hours to provide
medical relief. In addition to these practices, **[the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' **[use of the drone
programme]{.underline}** for assassinations, or summary executions,
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[a terrorist
tactic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Jeffrey Sluka explains (2000), Amnesty
International has identified the main forms of state terror as arbitrary
detention, unfair trial, torture and political murder or extrajudicial
execution. Begoña Aretxaga (2000) explains that the message summary
execution seeks to convey is one of impotence. The dead bodies spread
the message (among many) that resistance to the state's project is
futile and that the price for resistance is high. When those vaporised
by tactics of "signature strikes" and "double taps" are left in pieces,
we must speak of it as a form of terrorism because such practices are
intended to send the message that the United States is omnipotent,
omnipresent and utterly ruthless. We must also speak of terrorism
because **[[the necropolitical logic of these strikes homogenises
all]{.mark} males [in the terrorist "hot spots"]{.mark} the drone
surveys [as a population worthy of being put to death,]{.mark} thus
precluding discrimination]{.underline}**. Although it is militaryaged
males that are collectively designated to a category of inherently
dangerous people, **[there is nevertheless [a further assimilation and
stereotyping]{.mark} of all humans in sight of the drone to that
category [due to the necropolitical gaze]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- hence
signature strikes and other strikes that have attacked civilians at
weddings and funerals (Allinson 2015; Engelhardt 2013; Struck 2002).2 It
is this indiscriminate targeting of populations rendered suspicious and
disposable that leads the drone programme to operate as state terrorism.
As Blakeley and Afxentiou demonstrate in this special section, the use
of aerial bombing to terrorise the civilian population and make it
afraid to congregate does not present a novelty; British air power of
which the drone is a descendant, was a tool for terrorising and
controlling entire populations. An important continuity between historic
air power and drone warfare is that in both cases the violence of the
bombing is experienced by a population. Since **[[those under the
drone's gaze are not perceived as fully human due to
Orientalism]{.mark}, like natives in the colonies, they are not provided
noncombatant immunity despite the language of just war]{.underline}**.
Eurocentric -- and more specifically, United States -- narratives
concerning drone bombing also obfuscate what it means for civilians to
live under drones. For instance, film and media representations of drone
bombing limit their focus to armed drones or the pilots that control
them, leaving out the experiences of victims on the receiving end of
their violence (Gregory 2011; Stahl 2013). In this way, the audience is
allowed to sympathise with drone pilots and government officials who
allegedly only want to keep us safe from risky populations, but not with
the civilians who suffer our violence and terrorism. Their voices are
not worthy of circulation, despite the fact that they know much better
the violence inflicted by the drone programme. The aforementioned Living
Under Drones report reveals a disturbing reality for civilians in
northwest Pakistan. One thing the report reveals is that since drones
hover over their target areas persistently so as to provide an
"unblinking eye", those under them are acutely aware that their lives
and actions are being scrutinised (see also Acheson et al. 2017). The
report proclaims that the constant hovering of drones causes
psychological terror to those on the ground, thus drawing attention not
only to the deaths caused by drone bombing but also to other destructive
effects such as psychological terror, insomnia and the disruption of
social and political life. In Palestine, civilians cannot forget they
are occupied and under aggressive military surveillance either, because
as Palestinian Atef Abu Saif explains elsewhere, "\[t\]he drone keeps us
company all night long. Its whirring, whirring, whirring, whirring is
incessant -- as if it wants to remind us it's there, it's not going
anywhere. It hangs just a little way above our heads" (2014, 31).
Civilian testimony in Living Under Drones reveals the constant and
inescapable fear of being killed by a drone. According to the report
such all-pervasive fear has led people to sacrifice their education,
their social lives and their freedom in order to avoid becoming a
target. US drones have intimidated the population to the point that it
has changed people's habits and routines. As Safdar Dawar states: If I'm
shopping, I'm really careful and scared. If I'm standing on the road and
there is a car parked next to me, I never know if that is going to be
the target. Maybe they will target the car in front of me or behind me.
Even in mosques, if we're praying, we're worried that maybe one person
who is standing with us praying is wanted. So, wherever we are, we have
this fear of drones. (quoted in Cavallero, Sonnenberg, and Knuckey 2012,
98). As Dawar's statement demonstrates, there is no place he feels safe,
not even at a place of worship. To live under drones is thus to be made
to feel entirely vulnerable. As Gibson states, "... It's all
terrifyingly random. Suddenly and without warning, a missile launches
and obliterates everyone within a 16-yard radius" (2012, n.p.). These
people at the mercy of US pilots can do relatively little to assert
their innocence (Jalal, 2016). Civilians are not only afraid of being in
the vicinity of another target but also of being misconstrued as a
threat for targeting themselves. The fear is captured by Saif when, in
his book The Drone Eats with Me, he observes: I am surrounded by a
squadron of drones. I can't help but imagine that they have just one
plan: to kill me. If I run, I will look more like a reasonable target, a
dangerous threat in motion. ... He might suspect that I am trying to
avoid being seen, that I have something to hide. It is better to be
obvious, I realise, so I opt for my old tactic and walk straight down
the middle of the street. This way the drone operator sees me perfectly
clearly; he knows I have nothing to hide. (Saif 2014, 226). At the same
time that they themselves are threatened by lethal violence, people
under drones have to worry about not being perceived as threats, while
lacking the knowledge of what might or might not constitute them as
such. As a consequence, those under drones internalise being watched and
having their every action scrutinised and thus, by necessity, they alter
their behaviour. The failure of the drone programme to impose
surveillance solely on "terror suspects" and to distinguish between the
innocent and the guilty must be seen for what it is: a form of state
terrorism. The United States punishes civilians and suspects alike with
surveillance, group killings that assume guilt by association, and
through the targeting of houses, mosques and schools (Ross and Serle
2014; Reprieve 2013). The threat of hovering drones that has led people
to remain in their homes and stop socialising demonstrates that
surveillance is not benevolent, but rather a tool for control and
domination over populations, as Saif clearly intuits when he notes that
"\[t\]he occupation is now truly 21st century -- the best drone
technology in the world is being deployed up there, just to keep us
occupied" (2014, 149). No matter where drones are employed and by whom,
whether it is US drones in Pakistan (Living under drones 2012, Tahir
2016) or Israeli drones in Palestine (Saif 2014), their operation is
containment. Those who may regard the terror inflicted upon civilians by
drones as an unwanted side-effect of US policies should note that these
policies and the terror they inflict are no accident. As Jacob Levich
argues, ... \[T\]he US is consciously integrating the ruinous secondary
effects of drone warfare into its overall counterinsurgency (COIN)
strategy. Terrorism is a strategy to coerce people into withdrawing
support from the insurgents; this is typically accomplished through
assassinations, torture, surveillance, mass expulsions, \[and\] ruthless
displays of military force ... (Levich 2012, n.p.) Levich is correct in
stating that these are tactics of COIN, which focus not only on
defeating armed groups but also on controlling populations in which they
move and policing those populations for signs of "subversive" activity
(Blakeley and Raphael 2016; Khalili 2012). At the same time, Shaw and
Akhter (2012) and Chamayou (2015) argue that in Pakistan's FATA, the CIA
is actually engaged in counterterrorism, a subdivision of COIN, whereby
winning hearts and minds is irrelevant to the strategic aim and thus,
there is less care to avoid civilian casualties. Crucially, these COIN
practices of the drone programme are embodiments of social threats,
which is what terrorism aims to do. Lauren Wilcox (2015) and Levich
(2012) go even further to argue that the drone programme's violence is
akin to torture in that there is absolute non-reciprocity. The drone
programme maximises the vulnerability of civilians, with Levich arguing
that COIN inflicts pain on a whole community instead of only the
individual target, so that it can enforce popular consent in Pakistan
and other areas of resistance to US domination. Thus, **[[in colonial
fashion, US drone violence]{.mark} not only [dehumanises and
punishes]{.mark} whole populations [with]{.mark} absolute
[non-reciprocity]{.mark} but it also [makes life for]{.mark} these
already [vulnerable populations unliveable]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Expectedly, those living under drones have become aware of their
dehumanisation and that they are seen as potential threats. An art
installation in Pakistan entitled Not a Bug Splat (in reference to the
military slang for those killed by drones as "bug splats") placed a
large poster of an unnamed child who lost her parents and two younger
siblings on the ground in Waziristan to give a "human face" to victims,
so that they are not just "blobs" on a screen (Benedictus 2014, n.p.).
Artists hope the image "will create empathy and introspection amongst
drone operators, and will create dialogue amongst policy makers ..."
(Benedictus 2014, n.p.). Saif similarly wonders: Who will convince him
that the buildings he sees on his screen are not graphics, but homes
containing living rooms, and kitchens bathrooms and bedrooms; that there
are kids inside, fast asleep; that mobiles hang over their beds; that
teddy bears and toy dinosaurs lie on the floor; that posters line the
walls? (Saif 2014, 66). Here, Saif, like people in Pakistan, seeks to
humanise himself and his surroundings. **[Individuals under drones want
those watching them to not see them just as graphics or as Orientalist
constructions of "terrorists" due to their ethnicity and geographic
location, but as real people]{.underline}**, with real homes and real
lives. Their feelings of degradation are not imagined as the language,
policies and necropolitical logic of the drone programme demonstrate.
**[Civilian deaths]{.underline}** are not humanising; they **[are solely
referred to as "collateral damage,"]{.underline}** their lives **[turned
into mere statistical figures in order to create a language that can
make the drone programme discursively defendable]{.underline}**. As Saif
says: "Everything is turned into numbers. The stories are hidden,
disguised, lost behind these numbers. Human beings, souls, bodies -- are
all converted into numbers" (Saif 2014, 76). Meanwhile, when CIA
officials bombed an "al-Qaida compound" and killed two "Western"
hostages, their deaths received a rare personal apology from former
president Obama who went on television and said their names; they were
not turned into numbers (see Shane 2015; Ackerman 2015; Baker 2015).
Here we see biopolitics at work: **[Western casualties are people, their
deaths are "tragic"; their loved ones are given explanations and media
attention. Whereas when Muslim civilians are killed by drone strikes and
their families travel to meet Congress members, the latter fail to show
up to apologise or acknowledge their loss]{.underline}**, as was the
case for the Rehman family (Devereaux 2015, Grim and Linkins 2015;
Gusterson 2016; see also, Friedersdorf 2012; Engelhardt 2013). Ackerman
(2016) reports that after strikes people are left impoverished,
anguished and infuriated. Rafiq ur-Rehman who lost his mother states,
"\[i\]f America kills any westerner, one of their own, white people,
they apologize and compensate. But if it's Pakistanis like us, they
don't care. In my opinion, America treats us worse than animals" (quoted
in Ackerman 2016, n.p.). Jan, who was previously quoted, was struck by a
drone and feels the dead are the lucky ones since those maimed are left
to suffer in agony and poverty (Ackerman 2016). Anti-American sentiment
arises not only because survivors are livid at the injustice but also
because as Noor Behram, a photographer in Pakistan explains: **[[There
are just pieces of flesh lying around after a strike]{.mark}. So the
locals pick up the flesh and curse America. They say that America is
killing us inside our own country, inside our own homes]{.underline}**,
and only because we are Muslims. The youth in the area surrounding a
strike gets crazed. Hatred builds up inside those who have seen a drone
attack. (Shah and Beaumont 2011, n.p.). For parents who lose their
children and feel powerless and lacking in their ability to protect
them, resentment is understandable. This is also true for children left
without parents or other family members. **[The hatred of those impacted
by drone attacks is reasonable given that their loved ones' [deaths are
neither acknowledged, nor made grievable as a direct consequence of the
Orientalist language and attitudes that render their communities
subhuman]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The animosity that drone strikes
provoke has led some to call them counterproductive and as the new
recruiting tool of militants. In 2010, Faisal Shahzad, who tried to set
off a car bomb in Times Square, justified his targeting of civilians by
telling the judge "\[w\]hen the drones hit, they don't see children"
(Becker and Shane 2012). The testimonies of those under drones
demonstrate the disconnect between the experience of living under the
drone programme and government claims of "precise" drone targeting. The
government's language of precision that feeds the impression that the
drone programme -- and the drone in particular -- leads to more ethical
violence, obscures the terrorism the drone programme forces others to
live with. The **[[rhetoric of "humane" drone strikes elides]{.mark} the
[dehumanisation and racism]{.mark} which justifies the drone programme
and its indiscriminate strikes]{.underline}**. Those who seek to be
critical call drone strikes "assassinations" (Scahill and Greenwald
2014; Chamayou 2015; Barrinha and Mota 2017; Allinson 2015; Cockburn
2016), but such an analysis omits that most strikes are signature
strikes and that only the more infrequent personality strikes constitute
assassinations. Signature strikes and double taps cannot be
assassinations since they are not specific. Instead, they are nothing
but murder. They are simultaneously, a form of murder that works to
terrorise the surrounding population. It is important to make this
distinction because assassinations can be justified; consider Hitler,
for example (also see Aloyo 2013). Proponents and critics who claim that
the drone programme can be made legal and ethical with transparency,
accountability and amendments to US policies are also obscuring the
broader violent effects of drone bombing by giving the programme a veil
of legitimacy (Shane 2012; Bowden 2013; Mayer 2013; Braun and
Brunstetter 2013). Even if the policies of signature strikes and double
taps were discontinued (which is doubtful), the repressive and
terrorising component of surveillance would persist. The testimonies of
people in Palestine, Yemen and those in Pakistan, demonstrate that
terror effects are constitutive of what drones do, irrespective of the
intentions of those who use drones. Furthermore, **[[policy cannot purge
the Oriental attitudes that legitimise drone use]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and the killing of Muslims in the first place, and neither can
mechanical drones and their systems. While they can help provide more
objective information to personnel, **[they do not exist in a vacuum and
therefore do not escape the socio-political relations and cultural
knowledge that legitimate the drone programme's violence]{.underline}**.

### Hegemony

#### The 1ac's hegemonic discourses are consistent with orientalism -- the alt is a prerequisite to international relations

**Nayak and Malone 9**(Meghana V. Nayak and Christopher Malone, 2009,
American Orientalism and American Exceptionalism: A Critical Rethinking
of US Hegemony, page 256-257)**//BRownRice**

[American Orientalism: The Discourse on ''The West and the
Rest'']{.underline} Edward Said (1979) shatters the taken-for-granted
status of colonial and postcolonial knowledge about the developing world
with his analysis of Orientalism. As he notes, [[European]{.mark}
intellectual, artistic, archeological, and literary [examinations
o]{.mark}f---and claims about---the bodies and [borders conquered and
mapped, justified]{.mark} the necessity and endurance of
[colonial]{.mark} European [empires]{.mark}. Further, there is an
internal [consistency of]{.mark} the [Orientalist discourse]{.mark},
despite any lack of correspondence with a ''real'' Orient, in order to
[confer]{.mark} an objective and innocent status to the [knowledge
production]{.mark} that both prompted and [rationalized]{.mark} the
brutality of [imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Said 1979:5--7).
However, this does not mean that Orientalism is just a play of meanings
and ideas, for, as constructivist IR scholars argue, the more we act
toward an entity as if it has a particular representation or meaning,
the more that entity can take on that representation (Wendt 1992; Doty
1996). For example, [the more European colonialists perceived colonized
territories as incapable of self-governing, the more Europeans treated
the territories as in need of governing. Indeed, [Orientalism is a
''Western style for dominating]{.mark}, restructuring, and having
authority over [the Orient]{.mark}'']{.underline} (Said 1979:3), [acting
''dynamically along with [brute political, economic, and military
rationales'']{.mark}]{.underline} (Said 1979:12). Said (1979:12) [also
claims that Orientalism has much less to do with the ''Orient'' and much
more to do with the making of ''our'' world. [Knowledge claims about the
Other]{.mark}]{.underline} (the Orient⁄the East) [[actually cement the
way the Self]{.underline}]{.mark} (Europe ⁄the West[) [sees and
constructs itself. The ''Orient'']{.mark}]{.underline}---a mysterious,
erotic, dark, dangerous mass of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Arab, South
Asian, East Asian natives---[[is a]{.mark} deep and [recurring
image]{.mark} [in Western identitymaking]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
[[impact of]{.underline}]{.mark} Said's work, particularly
[[Orientalism, on critical IR is threefold]{.underline}]{.mark}. First,
it [creates space for critical IR scholars to examine representational
practices and international hierarchy in international
politics]{.underline}, in dialogue with scholars in other fields, such
as literary criticism, anthropology, postcolonial thought, feminist
studies, political geography, and others. Said's contrapuntal [[analyses
of]{.mark} culture, [colonial]{.mark} [discourses]{.mark}, nationalism,
power, and representational practices in his body of work opens the way
to [explore]{.mark} the nuances, contradictions, and shifting and hybrid
[contexts of Othering]{.mark}]{.underline} (Chowdhry 2007). The Other is
that through which the subject is represented as privileged and
superior, with the Other being devalued, feared, reviled, even desired,
in some way. The Other stands as a potential disruption of the Self, but
at the same time, as critical IR theorist Campbell (1998b) points out,
the Self cannot fully contain or ''resolve'' the anxiety over the
difference from or the encounter with the Other; without the production
of this anxiety, insecurity, and danger, statecraft and nationmaking
would have nothing against which to assert themselves. [Indeed, for the
West, the encounters of [slavery, colonialism, and genocide]{.mark} have
to be represented as [trysts with]{.mark} danger, [backwardness]{.mark},
and ever-threatening barbarism---anything but illegitimate violence---in
order [to naturalize Western superiority]{.mark}. Second, the various
debates about Said's work have inspired and [fortified critiques of
rationalist methodology of mainstream IR]{.mark} scholars [and]{.mark}
of [how]{.mark} their [ontological presumptions]{.mark} about and
methodological studies [of the ''West'' and the ''rest'' obscure more
than they explain]{.mark}]{.underline} (Allain 2004; Chowdhry 2007).
Third, the [**American** variant of Orientalism [allows for an analysis
of]{.mark} the [discursive deployments]{.mark} in which]{.underline} (1)
[the United States assumes and relies upon an ontological distinction
between the United States and Others]{.underline} (Weldes et al. 1999;
Richter-Montpetit 2007); (2) the United States [[employs]{.mark}
[authoritative epistemological claims]{.mark} and representations [about
Others']{.mark} bodies, habits, beliefs, feelings, and political
[sensibilities]{.mark}, thereby [justifying interventions]{.mark},
sanctions, and other actions within, across, and outside of its
borders]{.underline} (Persaud 2002); and (3) [US foreign policy relies
on a rationalist methodology consisting of finding ''evidence,'' such as
reports and fact-finding missions, of foregone conclusions about the
Other and the United States need to assert its position]{.underline}
(Tetreault 2006). [Research in this vein, both within and in
conversation with critical IR, has examined both the US relationship
with the Middle East since the 1940s7 as well as American aggressions
since the nineteenth century]{.underline} (Sadowski 1993; Ngai 2000;
Little 2002; Mamdani 2004; Khalidi 2005). [Orientalism, or at least the
controversies over its conclusions, has featured prominently in the
debates since 9 ⁄ 11 over whether Huntington was right about
Islam]{.underline} (Fox 2001; Abrahamian 2002; Elshtain 2004; Lewis
2004), and in claims that the United States is Othering Islam⁄Arabs with
disastrous results (Little 2002; Khalidi 2005; Alam 2007). Further, many
find that [an [understanding of Orientalism]{.mark} ''within'' the
United States]{.underline}, particularly toward Arab Muslim and South
Asian Americans, after 9 ⁄ 11, [[is crucial]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Hagopian 2004). Agathangelou and Ling's (2005) stinging critique of the
9 ⁄ 11 Commission Report's treatment of the Muslim Other [demonstrates
the overwhelming reasons why [we should understand]{.mark} the reasons
for and [consequences of constructing the]{.mark}
quintessential]{.underline} Muslim⁄Arab ⁄Middle Eastern [[Other]{.mark}
both within the United States and ''elsewhere.'']{.underline} With
Huntington's (2004) recent claims about the alleged threat of Mexican
immigration to the indubitably Christian and Anglo-Saxon America, it
also seems worthy to rethink how Othering works and against whom in
various historical periods. Some scholars trace American Orientalism to
the Spanish--American War, or use different regional examples such as
China, Japan, the Philippines, and Hawaii (Doty 1996; Klein 2003; Leong
2005). Campbell (1998a) points to the impoverishment of Western
political analysis of heterogeneous communities, particularly in the
international responses to and representations of violence in Bosnia. He
specifically notes that Europe and the United States intervened not to
''save'' Bosnia but rather to articulate Western nationalist imaginaries
to discipline and contain the ideal of multiculturalism.8 Doty's (2003)
recent work explores how the United States, the UK, and France use
immigrants as a site of Western statecraft and race-based order and
security. Not all of these authors explicitly reference
[Orientalism]{.underline}, but they [fit within scholarship that asks
the same kind of questions Said first posed in Orientalism and both
expanded upon and critiqued in his later work. We assert that a critical
interrogation of American Exceptionalism can enhance the extremely rich
field of inquiry discussed above. We turn next to an examination of th e
relationship between American Orientalism and American
Exceptionalism.]{.underline}

SAN FRANCISCO --- **[Imagine a futuristic city where robots prevail.
Since the advent of imperialism, this futuristic and otherly view has
often served as the popularized Western conception of Asia. This concept
is known as [Techno-Orientalism]{.mark}, a phenomenon that primarily
dominates discourse surrounding media portrayals of East
Asia.]{.underline}** According to journalist George Yang in Wired
Magazine, **[Techno-Orientalism, which [creates]{.mark} an [ideology
of]{.mark} the Asian ["Other," rests on]{.mark} Western [logic
of]{.mark} the [East as]{.mark} a [technological
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the world. With **[Beijing's
technological rise in an increasingly globalized world,
[Techno-Orientalist frameworks]{.mark} have now [become fundamental
to]{.mark} specifically [describing China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Plan A
Magazine's Lily Luo writes that the term "Techno-Orientalism" was
originally coined by Asian scholars like David Roh, Greta Niu and Betsy
Huang. **[These scholars perceived Techno-Orientalism as the projection
of historical Orientalism]{.underline}**, or what Khan Academy's Nancy
Demerdash describes as the "conception of an 'Orient' that was rooted in
incivility." **[Under the futuristic gaze of Techno-Orientalism, East
Asians are not only conceived of as a racialized source of fear, but
also a source of technological fear.]{.underline}** In other words,
**[the [technological advanc]{.mark}ements of East Asian countries were
[perceived as a threat]{.mark} to the global order. Today,
Techno-Orientalism is [most evident in]{.mark} the Western [media's
coverage]{.mark} of China]{.underline}**, which often reflects what Yang
describes as "Western anxieties about the East." "Chi**[na's dystopian
tech could be contagious,"]{.underline}** reads a 2018 headline from The
Atlantic**[. The word "contagious" implicitly projects the notion that
China's technology is somehow diseased]{.underline}**, **[[evoking
imagery of]{.mark} illness and a [plague]{.mark}]{.underline}** ---
**[racialized elements that Yang states were formerly attributed to
Chinese immigrants]{.underline}** building the United States's
Transcontinental Railroad back in the 19th century. The **[article goes
on to describe China's "social credit" system and its effects as a
method of "social control" with "teeth."]{.underline}** The **[element
of "teeth" [provokes]{.mark} a more [physical understanding of]{.mark}
China's [technological capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Instead of
directly analyzing the mechanics of the system, **[the article [employs
metaphors that conjure]{.mark} up negative [connotations of fear]{.mark}
and violence]{.underline}**. Another headline for a 2019 article in The
American Conservative demonstrates a similar concept: "George Orwell's
Dystopian Nightmare in China." The **[featured image displays a large
cartoon of Chinese President Xi Jinping looming over ordinary citizens
and handing them numbers intended to dictate their
identities.]{.underline}** The **[article cites the Orwellian vision of
the world]{.underline}** --- particularly Social Psychologist Erich
Fromm's afternote about the dangers of men becoming machines ---
**[implying that this is what China has become.]{.underline}** **[The
issue is not endemic to a few articles or a handful of media
organizations and publications.]{.underline}** In a 2018 op-ed in
Bloomberg, **[Cathy O'Neil argues that the United States must take an
active stand against the surveillance state with the headline: "Want to
See Your Dystopian Future? Look at China."]{.underline}** For **[The New
York Post]{.underline}**, a headline **[reads: "China's 'social credit'
system is a dystopian nightmare." This [angled coverage]{.mark} of
China,]{.underline}** unintentional or not, **[[falls prey to]{.mark} a
certain [dehumanizing rhetoric]{.mark} in which the [Chinese people are
viewed as]{.mark} constant [victims]{.mark} of a dystopian, futuristic
state]{.underline}**. In the process of shedding light on how China's
technological advancements may strip humanity away from Chinese
citizens, an important topic that deserves coverage and criticism,
**[Western media coverage paradoxically falls victim to the same trope:
[implying]{.mark} that Chinese people are [mindless]{.mark}
[robots]{.mark} at the mercy of a technological villain.]{.underline}**
It is necessary, though, to acknowledge that criticism of
Techno-Orientalist sentiments pervasive in Western media is not based on
the assumption that such articles are not credible. **[In fact, it is
because these [articles]{.mark} are so well-written and well-researched
on a topic that merits global attention that it [become]{.mark}s even
more [essential to understand]{.mark} how [racialized ideals]{.mark}
manifest in complex ways]{.underline}** within contemporary media
discourse --- even in the small ways, like headlines, images and
adjectives. **[This [problem becomes cyclical]{.mark}, especially
because so many articles cite the ideas mentioned by others. This may
explain how the media tends to exacerbate Sinophobia.]{.underline}**
Often, Western media's hegemonic mindset regarding Beijing prizes
competition over collaboration. This undermines a positive diplomatic
relationship between the United States and China and, more critically, a
nuanced American understanding of Chinese people, culture and values.
**[When evaluating how Techno-Orientalism has shaped internalized
conceptions of China, [it is critical to]{.mark} be rhetorically careful
and to distinguish between hard evidence and Western interpretations of
that evidence.]{.underline}** These **[interpretations appear to be
motivated by hegemonic fears of Asian countries achieving unprecedented
progress and subverting colonialist paradigms.]{.underline}**
Alternatively, these interpretations may be real fear rooted in the use
of technology to oppress certain liberties --- a genuine concern.
However, journalists must be careful in examining their assumptions and
biases. When writing about China, they should consider how certain
language may benefit discourse on the country or proliferate harmful
stereotypes. **[It may even be worth thinking about how the media can
provide a counternarrative to Techno-Orientalist ideologies. Instead of
characterizing China's technological rise as dangerous and
fear-mongering, journalists and media experts could explain the original
reasoning behind such technological policy measures.]{.underline}** The
Qiao Collective, for example, is an organization that is a staunch
defender of China against "Western aggression." **[While not without its
controversies and criticism, the volunteer-run media site features
articles intended to provide a more nuanced, humanizing perspective on

### Indo-Pak War

#### The 1ac's depiction of India and Pakistan as irrational actors ready to launch war at any moment follows the discursive trend of positing them as threats to solidify US hegemony

**Vaughan 13**(Tom Vaughan, 9/27/13, ASIAN FURY: GENDER, ORIENTALISM AND

**[A close [analysis of US]{.mark} foreign
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** texts **[[surrounding]{.mark} the
[India-Pakistan nuclear threat]{.mark}, sensitive to the effects of
administration change and 9/11 on US security discourses,
[reveals]{.mark} a complex [process of representation]{.mark} and
subject [positioning which changes over time]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Using the representational practices approach, I conclude that the
**[possibility of nuclear war between India and Pakistan is initially
[constructed as a]{.mark}]{.underline}**n urgent and direct
**[[threat]{.mark}, to]{.underline}** the countries themselves and to
**[US]{.underline}** nonproliferation interests. After 9/11 and during
of George W. Bush\'s two terms as US President, the condition of threat
is downplayed as **[India and Pakistan are [hailed into
compliant]{.mark}, controlled [positions]{.mark}, and the [focus]{.mark}
of US foreign policy in the region is [redirected towards]{.mark}
fighting [terrorism]{.mark}. Practices of]{.underline}** gendering and
**[[orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, are **[[present
in]{.mark} both [discourses]{.mark} and used to [represent]{.mark} the
[states]{.mark} concerned [in a way which preserves US
dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}** and masculinity. The dominant discourse
between the Pokhran and Chagai nuclear tests in 1998, and the end of the
Clinton administration and subsequently the 9/11 terrorist attacks, sees
the **[rise of an imminent and direct Indo-Pakistani nuclear threat.
[India and Pakistan]{.mark} are both [assigned]{.mark} roles
of]{.underline}** infanitlised, feminised, **[[oriental others, whose
irrationality,]{.mark} irresponsibility and lack of restraint [means
their possession of nuclear technology is a]{.mark} clear and present
[danger to]{.mark} international [security]{.mark}.]{.underline}** India
and Pakistan are simultaneously sites of US identity-building. **[Said
suggests that orientalism does not only denigrate the \'others\'; it
also [reinforces]{.mark} [Western dominance]{.mark} and identity by
creating a \'flexible positional superiority, which [puts the Westerner
in a whole series of relationships with the Orient]{.mark}
[without]{.mark} him ever [losing the]{.mark} relative [upper
hand\']{.mark}]{.underline}** (2003: 7). **[By constructing India and
Pakistan in such a manner, the [US justifies]{.mark} its own
intervention and [police-like behaviour]{.mark}, regulating interactions
between them and coercively imposing the NPT and sanctions which form a
US regime of control.]{.underline}** Until co-operation is achieved,
however, the **[[dominant discourse makes]{.mark} it [clear]{.mark} that
[India and Pakistan]{.mark} will [remain dangerous]{.mark}, if not
\'rogue\', pariah states.]{.underline}** The post-9/11 discourse,
studied up to the end of the second Bush administration, reconfigures
the US view of the proliferation terrain and casts India and Pakistan in
different, more complex subject roles than straightforward threats to
international security. Carranza notes that the 9/11 attacks had a
profound effect on US proliferation concerns, as focus shifted to
allowing \'good\' proliferation whilst preventing nuclear technology
being provided to terrorists (2006: 514). Concomitantly, the dominant
discourse which previously identified India and Pakistan as a threat
began to soften its tone towards the two proliferators. Before 9/11, the
US was able to reinforce its masculinity and dominance through the
enforcement of the Western nonproliferation regime. However, the
post-9/11 moment necessitated a \'hypermasculine\' project to \'save US
state identity\' (Nayak, 2006: 43), since attacks on US soil threatened
to topple the US\'s dominant status as a strong and inherently \'right\'
superpower. **[Nonproliferation efforts were no longer sufficient to
sustain this project, and so India and Pakistan [became discursively
co-opted into the \'war on terror\']{.mark} as subordinate US allies --
rather than [threats]{.mark} that [the US could]{.mark} police and
[neutralise to cement its dominant status.]{.mark} India and Pakistan
are still used to [reinforce]{.mark} a [hegemonic]{.mark} [US]{.mark}
masculinity, but represented as compliant allies instead of dangerous
and irresponsible proliferators. [Discursively infantilised as]{.mark}
irrational, [oriental others]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [pre-9/11]{.mark}
dominant discourse]{.underline}** (Nayak, 2006: 49), they are
**[[now]{.mark} regulated and [co-opted into]{.mark} the [Western bloc
of \'rational\']{.mark} and even \'democratic\' [\'allies\']{.mark} of
the US, [realigned in opposition to]{.mark} the new [oriental
\'others\']{.mark} of terrorist organisations and the states that
support them. The [discourse]{.mark} nonetheless [maintains India and
Pakistan\'s subordination to the US]{.mark} by qualifying their
newly-assigned masculinities with [orientalist assumptions about]{.mark}
their [nuclear status]{.mark} and emphasising their instrumentality in
US objectives against terrorism.]{.underline}** In many respects they
are represented similarly to colonial subjects. Although continually
feminised, orientalised and subordinated, India and Pakistan\'s nuclear
behaviour ceases to be constructed as a viable security threat to
regional, international and US security. My findings illustrate vividly
the fluid nature of discourse, and how seemingly fixed meanings and
statements of \'fact\' can evolve over time. The Foucauldian concept of
discourse holds that all knowledge is historically and culturally
specific, susceptible to change and \'radical breaks\' in history which
can drastically alter perceptions of fact (Hall, 1997: 47). For US
understandings of international relations and mainstream foreign policy
discourse, 9/11 was a radical break which altered the discursive
relationships between the US and other international subjects. At once,
the borders of the international security landscape were redrawn.
Fukuyama\'s (2003) proclamation that \'we may be witnessing \... the end
of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind\'s ideological
evolution and the universalisation of Western liberal democracy\' was
called into question. The reshuffle of nonproliferation discourse in the
wake of 9/11 demonstrates that seemingly fixed relationships and
political \'facts\' may be challenged, reshaped or nullified in any
number of ways.

aBStraCt This article considers how **[news stories about piracy off the
coast of Somalia reflect E. Said's concept of Orientalism, that is, [the
West representing the Rest in ways beneficial to the West]{.mark}.
Critical discourse analysis is applied to news stories from the
international BBC news website to reveal [strategies]{.mark} used to
[represent a non-western 'other' in need of control]{.mark} by a
successful West. [This legitimates the West's military presence]{.mark}
and actions whilst challenging BBC's claims of
objectivity.]{.underline}** An historical account of both Somalia and
piracy precede this analysis. The former illustrates how Somalia's
current 'failed state' status is in part due to foreign involvement
while the latter describes how this status has produced conditions
conducive to piracy. **[Actions by the West together with the BBC's
Orientalist perspective do little to relieve Somalia's hardship,
suffering and ending Somalia's multiple problems.]{.underline}**
IntroduCtIon **[[Orientalism]{.mark} is a concept that [sees the world
divided into]{.mark} two distinct and unequal parts: European and
non-European or ['the West and the Rest']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Hall
1992). Though a concept that has caused much controversy (Bozatzis 2009;
Young 2004), Orientalism has historical, political and analytical
relevance when considering texts about non-Europeans, or 'Orientals'.
According to E. Said (1979: 2--3), **[[Orientalism]{.mark} is an
academic area of study, a style of thought which [makes distinctions
between 'the Orient' and]{.mark} 'the [Occident']{.mark}. This
distinction is not arbitrary, but [linked to
power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Said (1979: 5) observes, KeyWordS

**[['The relationship]{.mark} between Occident and Orient [is]{.mark} a
relationship [of power]{.mark}, of [domination]{.mark}, of varying
degrees of a complex [hegemony'. Orientalism represents non-European
identity as an inferior 'other' compared to a]{.mark} more [superior
European identity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This distinction is part of an
Orientalist political view made by Europeans for the benefit of
Europeans (Said 1979: 7). But Said's Orientalist argument is not without
its critics. R. Young (2004: 177) claims to accept Orientalism is to
accept that **['each \[western\] writer is identified in turn as
complicit in the process of the [intellectual subordination of the East
to the West']{.mark}.]{.underline}** This would then exclude western
writers from more critical perspectives, such as Marxists. Despite these
worthy objec- tions, this article considers the core ideas of
Orientalism by asking how one **[[western media outlet]{.mark}, which
prides itself on values associated with objectiv- ity, represents Somali
piracy in ways that [contribute to]{.mark} relations of power and
[domination by western interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is done by
historically contextualizing Somalia and piracy. **[Critical discourse

website was chosen as a site of analysis due to its reach and its
reputation of being objective. BBC's news services operate the world's
widest-reaching international newsgathering network, communicating in 33
languages and claiming to have 230 million weekly users (Anon. 2012a).
Despite much discussion about a digital public sphere (see Dahlberg
2001), the BBC sees its online news service not as a distinct entity,
but as an inte- gral part of its multi-platform service, a 'supplement'
to its traditional serv- ices (Anon. 2012b). In fact, this
'supplementary' service is widely used, being the world's 47th most
visited and the most popular online news site in the United Kingdom. BBC
presents itself as objective. This is evident in the BBC's six public
purposes, the second part of 'bringing the UK to the world and the world
to the UK' being relevant to this study. According to its website, it
priori- tizes building global awareness and understanding of
international issues by its journalists who adhere to the values of
'accuracy, impartiality and inde- pendence' and 'providing reliable and
unbiased information of relevance, range and depth' (Anon. 2012a).
**[These are core values of [objectivity]{.mark} that is recognized as
[a]{.mark}n ideal or social [construct]{.mark} of western
journalism]{.underline}**, not practical journalism (Chalaby 1998: 130).
In fact, newsroom studies have revealed how **[[news is not objective,
ideology]{.mark} being [embedded in]{.mark} the very logic of news
production that includes source [choices]{.mark}, news selection and the
need to produce a steady and predictable supply of copy]{.underline}**
(Machin and Niblock 2006; Garcia Aviles and Leon 2002). This being the
case, one may expect many western sources describing events from a
western perspective on the BBC, questioning claims of objectivity. It is
on this ideological backdrop that CDA is applied. In CDA, linguistic and
grammatical choices in texts are analysed, allowing analysts to reveal
broader discourses that are drawn upon (Fairclough 2003;
JAMS_5.1_Way_19-33.indd 20 6/12/13 10:38:23 AM van Dijk 1993). **[CDA
aims to reveal what kinds of social relations of power,
[inequalities]{.mark} and interests [are]{.mark} perpetuated, generated
or [legitimated in texts]{.mark} both [explicitly and
implicitly]{.mark}]{.underline}** (van Dijk 1993). This article's
analysis focuses on how Somali pirates and western militaries are
represented. To do this, two analyses are performed. The first analysis
draws especially on T. van Leeuwen's (1995, 1996) approach to the way
'social actors' and their actions can be classified, categorized and
recontextualized. Here, basic lexi- cal choices such as namings are
considered as well as what is included and excluded, as these choices
may be politically or socially significant, **[suiting text producer's
interests and purposes]{.underline}** (Kress 1989). Questions such as
who does what to whom in sentences and where participants are posi-
tioned both in sentences and in more active or passive roles are
examined. How speech is recontextualized is analysed, relying both on C.
R. Caldas- Coulthard's (1994) analysis of sources and relevant aspects
of Appraisal Theory (White 2006). A second analysis considers specific
strategies identi- fied by H. Bishop and A. Jaworski (2003) that
represent pirates as a danger- ous 'other'. This CDA is supplemented by
an historical contextualization of events in Somalia and Somali piracy.
Scholars who use CDA highlight the importance of historically
contextualizing analysis (Richardson 2007; Fairclough 2003, 1995b; Wodak
2001a, 2001b; van Leeuwen and Wodak 1999; van Dijk 1993). R. Wodak's
(2001a, 2001b: 70) 'discourse-historical' approach to CDA enables
analysts to 'detect and depict the disfiguring of facts and realities'
by histori- cally contextualizing texts. This inter-disciplinary
approach contends that it is only through understanding the history of
Somalia and Somali piracy that the discourses news draw upon can be
understood. the data In this article CDA is carried out on news stories
from January 2008 until June 2010. It was at this time that Somali
waters became 'the world's worst piracy area' (Menkhaus 2009a: 22).
Although there are 212 stories listed on the BBC website under 'Somalia
Pirates' during this time, 100 stories were collected. Only stories that
reported on the activities of pirates and western militaries were
selected, exemplifying when Somali piracy became both sophisticated and
disruptive resulting in international military responses. In CDA,
**[discourse is thought of as 'a complex bundle of simultaneous and
sequential interrelated linguistic acts']{.underline}** (Wodak 2001a,
2001b: 66). Practitioners do not (and can not for practical reasons)
analyse in great detail every 'linguis- tic act', but select what they
believe are representative samples (see, for exam- ple, Bishop and
Jaworski 2003 or van Leeuwen and Wodak 1999). **[In this tradition, out
of the 100 stories, there is a close detailed analysis of eleven
stories. These were selected as it is believed they accurately reflect
the domi- nant discourses articulated throughout the news. Four of these
stories were selected to represent how pirates and non-pirating Somalis
as well as related social issues are represented within piracy stories.
To select these stories, two major social problems related to piracy,
namely 'dumping in Somalia' and 'illegal fishing in Somalia' were
entered into the website's search engine.]{.underline}** Only four
stories specifically about Somali piracy were produced and included. The
remaining seven stories were chosen to **[represent ongoing themes in
coverage such as the capturing of large vessels, pirates expanding their
reach, military concerns and successes.]{.underline}** Orientalism in

complex history of Somalia, but illus- trates the role **[foreign

and a pirate-friendly area.]{.underline}** Somalia has seen world and
regional interest throughout its recent history. In the late nineteenth
century, **[European powers began their scramble for

Referring to Ethiopian and British involvement in the political and
religious freedom of Somalia, Dervish leader Muhammad Abdullah Hassan
claimed they 'have destroyed our religion and made our children their
children' (Omondi 2010). Though critical of the British, Somalia had
relations with the Ottomans and the Germans. In 1920, with the collapse
of the Dervish state, it was turned into a British protectorate.
Thereafter until independence in 1960, Somalia was governed by either
the British or Italians as part of their geopolitical regional policies.
But independence did not mean an end to outside involvement. By the
mid-1960s, Somalia had formal military relations with the Soviet Union,
industrial funding from China and Italian support for its expatriates,
while the United States sent substantial military aid to Somalia's
hostile neighbour Ethiopia. In 1977 the Soviet Union transferred its
interests to Ethiopia and by 1980 Somalia had been transformed into a
western client with American weaponry and advisors. Since 1991, with the
fall of Major General Muhammad Siad Barre's govern- ment, Somalia has
been fighting internally though with outside influences. In 2002, a
temporary government was formed, but a lack of support by the inter-
national community including America, weakened its authority and
internal support (Raffaelli 2007). The Transnational Federal Government
(TFG) was established in 2004, being widely supported by the West. In
the 2000's, with a weak TFG, Ethiopian Troops with American backing were
responsible for driving out Islamist groups such as the Coalition of
Islamic Courts. Since January 2009, an African Union peace force has
been in Somalia. 2009 also saw a new transitional parliament and
president. Despite these latest moves, Al-Qaeda is providing advisors to
the Islamist militant group al-Shabab, while America, the United Nations
and other African and western countries are backing the TFG, including
supplying arms. But this intervention is not necessarily for altruistic
reasons. As K. Menkhaus (2009a) observes, 'Outside actors are working
hard to tip the scales in favour of their Somali allies', acting out of
self-interest (Raffaelli 2007). SomaLIa'S pIraCy StageS Historically,
Somali piracy has followed three stages (Laing 2010; Menkhaus 2009b;
Lennox 2008; Puchala 2005). The first begins with sporadic spates of
small scale attacks on vulnerable ships. In Somalia, this began in the
early 1990s when foreign fishing trawlers and those looking to cheaply
dispose of their hazardous waste took advantage of its rich and
unpatrolled waters (Laing 2010: 2; Menkhaus 2009b: 22; Lennox 2008: 8).
Angry fishermen armed themselves with rocket-propelled grenades and
assault rifles and began firing on foreign trawlers who responded
likewise. The second historical stage sees pirate activities increase to
the point where they effectively choke the flow of seaborne commerce.
Since 2005, the number of Somali pirate attacks has increased
dramatically, as has the size of vessels and ransoms, evolving into
international organized crime. These JAMS_5.1_Way_19-33.indd 22 6/12/13
10:38:24 AM attacks signal the sophistication of Somali piracy, using
spies in ports, mother ships, negotiators, spokespersons, accountants,
financiers, logistics coordi- nators, caterers, financing/ money
laundering networks and political power holders (Laing 2010; Lennox
2008; Middleton 2008). In response, the third historical stage is
'pirate organisations are smashed, strongholds are assaulted and reduced
and leaders are apprehended or killed' by powerful sea powers which form
pirate-hunting navies (Puchala 2005). In Somalia, this has taken the
form of Nato's Combined Task Force 150 launched in 2002, the EU's NAVFOR
launched in 2008, the US-led CTF151 and war ships from Russia, China,
Indonesia, India, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Turkey and
Saudi Arabia. Despite the impressive number of nations involved, this
response is tentative and reactive with approximately sixteen ships
patrolling an area two-thirds the size of Europe. Why pIraCy'S upSurge?
Scholars agree the root of the upsurge in Somali piracy is its lack of
govern- ance and a population with few sources of income (Carafano et
al. 2009; Moller 2009; Lennox 2008). Safe haven, opportunity and
economic hardship are needed for piracy to become as endemic as it has
(Moller 2009: 12; Lennox 2008: 2; Chalk 2008: 8; Puchala 2005: 6). This
describes Somalia's present condition. First, Somalia is a safe haven
for pirates. It has a mostly remote 2300 mile coastline, giving pirates
access to the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Indian Ocean and the
Seychelles. Their networks include the regional Puntland government,
clan leaders and al-Shabab (Carafano et al. 2009). R. Middleton (2008:
5) argues that, 'even if the higher eschelons of Somali government and
clan structure are not directly involved in organising piracy, they
probably do benefit'. Second, Somalia has ample opportunity for piracy.
The Gulf of Aden is one of the world's busiest waterways with
approximately 21,000 ships, or 7 per cent of global maritime commerce,
passing through it annually (Seibert 2009a; Carafano et al. 2009).
Furthermore, this traffic must slow down to file into the Gulf of Aden
'chokepoint', making illegal boarding simpler. No Somali navy or coast
guard aids in creating a busy, unruly sea route with 'no indigenous
deterent to piracy' (Lennox 2008: 4). Third, there is sufficient
evidence of economic hardship. In 2009, the UN sought £556 million for
Somali emergency humanitarian aid (Menkhaus 2009b: 24). Hardship has
been exacerbated since the early 1990s with foreign companies illegally
dumping a wide array of nuclear and hazardous wastes in Somali waters,
destroying the coastline that used to sustain thousands of people as a
source of food and livelihood (Lennox 2008; Menkhaus 2009b). These
activities are set to continue as it costs as little as £1.55 a tonne to
illegally dump in Somalia where the same costs £617.00 a tonne in Europe
(Carafano et al. 2009: 9). Foreign companies have also exacerbated
Somalia's plight by over- fishing, tempting Somali fishermen into
piracy. Its waters are some of the most abundant fishing grounds in the
world but are now being overfished by European, Asian and African
flagged ships (Middleton 2008). S. Coffen- Smout (1998) notes these have
no concern for bio-diversity inspired by short- term gain and profitable
catches. Pirates, being ex-fishermen and former coast guards, have very
few alternatives to making money other than turning to Orientalism in
online news 23 JAMS_5.1_Way_19-33.indd 23 6/12/13 10:38:24 AM Lyndon C.
S. Way 24 crime (Middleton 2008). Together, these three conditions
produce a situation in Somalia where piracy is rampant. Why a LaCK of
foreIgn mILItary SuCCeSS? There are several reasons for western
militaries' lack of success. First, capturing and putting pirates on
trial does not deter those who believe piracy's benefits outweigh its
risks (Middleton 2009: 2). Second, history reveals a reactive mili- tary
response is not enough. D. Puchala (2005: 13) observes that 'the
histori- cal fact is that pirates were suppressed when they were sought
out, hunted down and forcefully destroyed along with their strongholds
and sanctuaries'(emphasis in original). This is not on the remit of the
task forces that react to each attack. Third, there is much skepticism
about the true motives behind military interventions. B. Seibert
(2008:1) believes the EU has something to 'prove', the NAVFOR operation
being 'the first under the auspices of the European Union'. Menkhaus
(2009a: 9) notes: \[\...\] the robust \[international\] naval response
has more to do with navies seeking to use anti-piracy as a training
exercise, an opportunity to improve co-ordination with other navies, and
a justification for their own budgets at a time when naval operations
have been less central in the Global War on Terror. Fourth, there is a
general consensus that success against piracy is depend- ent on the
establishment of a functional government. As Seibert (2009a:1) observes,
'the eradication of piracy requires the re-establishment of a func-
tioning Somali state, reasserting control over its territory, including
its coastal areas'. anaLySIS News coverage was abundant, especially
during the second and third stages of Somali piracy when foreign
sea-borne transport was most affected. Stories did not cover issues
leading up to the piracy 'crisis', but recontextualized the almost daily
skirmishes between western militaries and pirates. This section examines
the lexical and grammatical strategies used in this coverage, revealing
how Orientalism is at play, despite BBC claims of objectivity. (A)
Exclusions Fairclough (2003: 149) notes that what is included and
excluded may be politi- cally or socially significant. Part of the
Orientalism articulated in the sample involves excluding social actors
and issues which either do not legitimize western militaries or
represent the West negatively. Very rarely are Somalis represented. Even
in the four stories about non- pirating Somalis and social issues, they
are only named twice and govern- ment officials three times. Excluding
non-pirating Somalis aids in creating a discourse of Somalia as a
distant 'other' in need of western military action. Almost excluded are
social issues related to piracy, namely illegal fishing, dumping and a
lack of government. References to these are scarce, averaging about one
sentence for each story. Consider: 1. War-torn Somalia has not had an
effective government since 1991. JAMS_5.1_Way_19-33.indd 24 6/12/13
10:38:24 AM 2. We need an effective coastguard to protect our fishermen
from illegal fishing, to prevent dumping of toxic materials in our
waters and fight shipping piracy. Van Leeuwen (1995: 99) notes that
abstractions lack detail of actions and involve 'texts mainly concerned
with legitimising and de-legitimising actions and reactions'. In excerpt
one, readers are informed that Somalia is in trou- ble, being 'war-torn'
and having no 'effective government'. However, this sentence (and story)
gives no detail as to the reasons for this condition, how it has come
about and how the West can help. Excerpt two demonstrates how even
sentences with more detail are abstract enough to cause confusion. Here,
illegal fishing, dumping and piracy are put in a list as part of a
request for a coastguard, not as the first two being partly responsible
for the third. All three acts are agentless nominalizations, that is, no
participant is named as respon- sible for the actions. Responsibility is
further obscured by almost excluding 'foreign' involvement in these
activities. Only once is 'illegal dumping' collo- cated with 'foreign'
in the sample and only once more in the same sentence. Though these
exclusions and abstractions create an awareness of a problem in Somalia,
they do not help in understanding reasons for piracy. Instead, by
creating an awareness of a problem, they aid in legitimizing a need for
outside help -- possibly from western militaries. (B) Namings Van
Leeuwen (1996: 48) observes that when social actors are not person- ally
named, readers are deprived of a 'point of identification' and thereby
'treated as distant "others" rather than as people "we" have to deal
with in our everyday lives'. With very few exceptions across the 100
stories, pirates are not named personally contributing to the idea of a
distant Somali pirate 'other'. As noted previously, this is likely a
result of newsroom practices such as source choices and availability,
though the result is noteworthy. This strat- egy is complemented by
naming pirates as groups such as 'pirates', 'the pirate group', 'those
groups', 'new pirate suspects', 'piracy' and 'pirate spokesmen'. This
strategy allows writers to homogenize all 'pirates' as the same, making
it easier to treat them as an enemy (van Leeuwen 1996: 48). On the
contrary, western militaries are personally named extensively, giving
readers 'a point of identification' and usually named with functional
honorifics connoting authority and respect (van Leeuwen 1996: 53--54).
Namings include 'Commander Simon Huntington, commanding officer of
Devonport-based HMS Chatham', 'Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US
Joint Chiefs of Staff', 'Lt Christensen', 'The British admiral in charge
of the EU naval force' and 'Rear Adm Peter Hudson'. These lexical
strategies offer points of identification, making it easier to
sympathize and respect these western military actors. Even impersonal
names of western militaries emphasize importance and legitimacy by
employing functional titles. 'The EU's naval force (Navfor)', 'a Royal
Marine team', 'the UK Foreign office', 'Royal Navy warship' as part of
'Nato anti-piracy operations' all connote importance. For example, by
naming a 'Royal Navy warship', importance is connoted. The lexica
'Royal' connotes both regal power, justice and legitimacy as well as
being from Britain with historical connotations of maritime might.
Together, these functional titles draw upon a discourse of Orientalism
by highlighting western militaries' importance and legitimacy.

10:38:24 AM Lyndon C. S. Way 26 (C) Activations, passivations and
prepositional phrases A number of grammatical strategies are also
employed which articulate Somali pirates as an 'other' in need of
successful western military intervention. One strategy is activating
western militaries with agency, that is, representing them doing
something to someone, which connote power (Fairclough 1995b: 110).
Consider: 3. The UK's Royal Navy shot dead two suspected pirates
attacking a Danish cargo-ship off the coast of Yemen. 4. A Royal Navy
warship on Nato anti-piracy operations has destroyed two pirate boats in
the Somali Basin, Nato has said. In excerpt three, the United Kingdom's
Royal Navy is activated with agency by being represented as shooting
'two suspected pirates' and 'destroying' two pirate boats in excerpt
four. This strategy is common throughout the sample, along with the
complementary strategy of emphasis through dominant begin- ning of
sentence position (van Dijk 1991: 216). For example, in excerpt three's
story, western militaries enjoy dominant sentence position five times,
while pirates are only in this position twice, despite the story
recontextualizing pirates capturing a ship. These two excerpts also
illustrate how pirates are passivated. To be passi- vated, or have
something happen to an actor, accentuates weakness and subjection to
others (Fairclough 2003: 150). Pirates are represented as such, being
'shot' in excerpt three and having their boats destroyed in excerpt
four. In this same story (excerpt four), pirates continue being
passivated, when Nato 'spotted a larger \[pirate\] vessel', Nato is
'monitoring the vessels' and Nato had 'disrupted a pirate attack group'.
These all draw on a discourse of weak pirates subjected to the actions
of a successful western military, legiti- mating their large budgets and
operations near Somalia. Representations of western militaries include
being activated without agency. These representations also draw upon
discourses of Orientalism, legitimating western actions. In one story,
NAVFOR is activated verbally five times in the story's first five
sentences and again within the reported speech 'Eunavfor is continuing
to monitor the situation'. Though this last activation does not supply
much information as to what NAVFOR is doing, to continue 'to monitor'
draws on a discourse of power and control, thereby legitimizing NAVFOR's
presence in Somali waters. To the contrary, aside from some titles,
pirate agency is all but absent. In fact, the only time pirates are
represented with agency is when their actions are negative or show
weakness. Consider: 5. Ten Somalis surrendered and the smaller boats
were destroyed. Here, pirates are activated, in dominant sentence
position. However, their weakness is emphasized by 'surrendering' above
and 'could not continue' and 'were left with only enough fuel \... to
return to Somalia' in other parts of this same story. T. A. Van Dijk
(1991: 216) observes that participants' actions can be 'played down'
when represented later in a sentence and/ or embedded in a prepositional
phrase or clause. He found this de-emphasizes negative acts of in-group
members like the police and positive acts by out-group members
JAMS_5.1_Way_19-33.indd 26 6/12/13 10:38:24 AM such as those from
minority groups. In our study, pirates are most commonly found in
prepositional phrases, thereby de-emphasizing their roles in Somali
waters. Consider: 6. Its \[NAVFOR\] statement says the ransom was
dropped to the pirates hold- ing the Saint James Park chemical tanker at
Somalia's port of Garacaad on Thursday. Here, pirates appear in
non-dominant middle of sentence position in the prepositional phrase 'to
the pirates', while NAVFOR is activated and empha- sized. This strategy
contributes to a discourse beneficial to western powers by
de-emphasizing pirates and their successes while emphasizing western
successes. This aids in legitimizing the vast amount of money and
resources spent by the West in military activities near Somalia. (D)
Sources Though source choices are much to do with journalistic routines,
they are ideological giving voice to some people instead of others
(White 2006: 58; Caldas-Coulthard 1994: 304). With very few exceptions
in the 100 stories, BBC uses almost exclusively western military
sources. For example, in a story which recontextualizes the capture of
the Sirius Star, there are only American and British sources, despite
the story being about a Saudi-owned oil tanker hijacked by Somali
pirates in the Indian ocean heading to the United States. British
involvement was confined to two Britons being captured. Using foreign
military sources gives legitimacy to them and their views
(Caldas-Coulthard 1994), allowing the story of Somali pirates to be told
from their point of view. Consider: 7. Commander Simon Huntington,
commanding officer of Devonport-based HMS Chatham, said he was
'extremely pleased' the warship had 'success- fully disrupted a pirate
attack group operating in the Somali Basin and prevented them from
mounting attacks against merchant shipping'. Here, the source is a
British commander. The direct quotes include lexical choices such as
'extremely pleased' and 'successfully' that emphasize Nato's success.
Grammatically, Nato is given agency twice, it 'disrupted a pirate attack
group' and 'prevented them from mounting attacks'. Again, these choices
within reported speech demonstrate how source choices contribute to
discourses compatible with the interests of western powers, that is
represent- ing a successful and necessary presence in Somali waters.
Another result of using western military sources is 'us' and 'them'
groups are created. Fairclough (2003: 149) identifies nouns and pronouns
such as, 'we' and 'they' that promote such divisions. Within reported
speech, pirates are named as 'they', 'them' and 'their' extensively.
Consider: 8. Once they get to a point where they can board, it becomes
very difficult to get them off, because, clearly, now they hold hostages
(emphasis added). 9. 'What we will do', he \[Rear Adm Peter Hudson\]
said, 'is use our intelli- gence assets, our maritime patrol aircraft,
the dialogue we have with the region \... as well as our partners \...
to make sure that we can concentrate \[our efforts\] \... in a \... more
sophisticated manner'. Orientalism in online news 27
JAMS_5.1_Way_19-33.indd 27 6/12/13 10:38:25 AM Lyndon C. S. Way 28 In
excerpt eight, **[pirates are [named as 'they' and 'them', contributing
to]{.mark} the idea of [an 'other' group]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This
idea is emphasized through overlexicalization, that is, appearing more
often than one would expect (Kress 1989). In excerpt nine, 'we' and
'our' are used three times each articulating an 'us' group of the UK
navy, readers and the navy's 'partners' which are mostly western powers.
There are alternative ways to writing these sentences that would have
done less to 'other' pirates. First, using names could give readers a
'point of iden- tification'. Second, if pirates were used as sources,
the third person pronouns would become the first person 'we' (seen in
excerpt nine), a more inclusive pronoun. Third, pirates could have been
functionalized such as 'the captain', or 'the pirate', reducing the idea
of a Somali 'other'. However, this distinction between 'us' the West and
'them' Somali pirates articulates a cornerstone of Orientalism,
distinguishing the West from the Rest. StrategIeS of 'otherIng' Bishop
and Jaworski (2003: 250) identify five strategies used by the British
press's coverage of the German England Euro 2000 football match that
'other' British football hooligans. These are 'de-authentication',
'pejoration', 'homog- enization', 'minoritization' and
'universalization'. Four of these strategies are used in Somali piracy
stories contributing to depictions of a **[[dangerous 'other']{.mark}
that [must be controlled by the West]{.mark}.]{.underline}** (i)
Pejoratıon Bishop and Jaworski (2003: 263) found the press used lexical
choices that high- lighted negative imagery of hooligans. This strategy
is employed by representing pirates as dangerous, greedy and uneducated.
In one story, a pirate is described as 'a sea-bandit' who telephones
from a 'notorious den'. These choices connote danger. Greed is connoted
through lexica which describe pirates as 'big-spending' owning 'two
lorries, a luxury car \... \[their\] own business' with an ambition to
'get a lot of money'. Greed is further emphasized with the lexica
'money' and 'cash' appearing six times in one story, another case of
overlex- icalization. Pirates are also represented as uneducated,
despite the expertise and skills involved in running large pirate
operations. Consider: 10. \... piracy has become a way of life for many
young Somali men, as they simply do not know any better. and Many young
men have no education and no understanding of the rule of law. Here,
pirates are activated negatively by 'not know\[ing\]' and 'have no
educa- tion' and 'understanding'. Though this may be true of many
pirates, the sophistication, expertise and complexity of operations
described by Middleton (2008: 6) are missing as a dominant discourse.
However, such representations serve the purpose of legitimizing military
force in order to control those who are greedy and 'simply do not know
any better'. (ii) Homogenization Bishop and Jaworski (2003: 263) found
that newspapers characterized hooli- gans as a distinct group with 'a
small, finite set of attributes'. Somali pirates are represented as
homogenized personally and socially. Consider: JAMS_5.1_Way_19-33.indd
28 6/12/13 10:38:25 AM 11. They promote the use of drugs -- chewing khat
\[a stimulant which keeps one alert\] and smoking hashish -- and
alcohol\[\...\]. 12. Most of them are aged between 20 and 35 years -- in
it for the money. 13. Once a pirate makes his fortune, he tends to take
on a second and third wife -- often very young women from poor nomadic
clans, who are renowned for their beauty.' In extracts 11 and 12,
pirates ('they' and 'most of them') are homogenized personally in terms
of drug and alcohol usage, age and motivation. In extract 13, successful
pirates are homogenized in terms of relations with women. It seems
questionable to apply such personal and social traits to all those
involved in Somali piracy considering the various backgrounds, tribal
affili- ations and expertise involved in pirate operations. Such
homogenization, however, does draw upon discourses of Orientalism that
represent the 'other' negatively, justifying the need for military
intervention. mInorItIzatIon and unIverzaLIzatIon Bishop and Jaworski
(2003: 266) found newspapers 'represent\[ed\] them \[hooligans\] as
highly visible but not representative of the nation (minoriti- sation),
on the one hand, and as potentially overcoming the entire nation
(universalization) on the other hand'. This apparent dichotomy is
evident when representing Somali pirates, though minoritization is far
less the case than universalization. The following is one of the few
examples of how pirates are treated as non-representative
(minioritization) of Somalians: 14. They \[pirates\] have made life more
expensive for ordinary people because they 'pump huge amounts of US
dollars' into the local economy \[\...\]. Here, 'ordinary people' are
identified distinct from pirates (they). This distinc- tion helps create
two groups in Somalia, one being pirates. Though a minority, pirates and
their activities are highly visible by making 'life more expensive for
ordinary people'. Despite this minoritization, the threat of piracy
globally is articulated far more commonly. Consider: 15. They now carry
AK-47s and use speedboats to rule the high seas of the world. 16. It has
been reported in the past that wealthy businessmen in Dubai were
financing the pirates. But the BBC's Somali Service says these days it
is the businessmen asking the pirates for loans. 17. 'They have money;
they have power and they are getting stronger by the day'. In these
extracts, a discourse of global impending threat or universalization is
articulated. In extract 15, this is explicitly articulated by pirates
'rul\[ing\] the high seas of the world'. Though this seems to go against
most of the sample which represents them as less powerful than foreign
militaries, it emphasizes the idea that pirates are a dangerous 'other',
a threat that needs controlling by western military actions. This
discourse is furthered in extracts 16 and 17. In extract 16, pirates'
financial universalization is represented. They not only finance
'wealthy businessmen', but these men are from 'Dubai', a country known
for its oil riches. Furthermore, by these men 'asking' pirates for
loans, a Orientalism in online news 29 JAMS_5.1_Way_19-33.indd 29
6/12/13 10:38:25 AM Lyndon C. S. Way 30 **[financial hierarchy is
represented with pirates controlling finances, accentuat- ing pirates'
financial power.]{.underline}** In extract 17, this is reinforced, along
with the idea of a growing threat by 'getting stronger by the day'.
Elsewhere in the sample, 'pirates are becoming more aggressive and
assertive', 'hundreds of armed men are coming to join the pirates' and
'pirate gangs in the Gulf of Aden are now multi-clan operations'. These
sentences emphasize the **[[immediacy of impending danger]{.mark} by
using the present continuous tense in 'are becom- ing' and 'are coming',
expressing the idea that something is happening now.]{.underline}** This
is further emphasized with the lexical choice 'now', presupposing that
multi-clan operations were not the case in the past.
**[[Representations]{.mark} like these contribute to a discourse of a
potential global pirate threat. This, of course, [contribute]{.mark}s
[to]{.mark} a discourse of a [dangerous 'other' that needs to be
suppressed by western military]{.mark} actions.]{.underline}**
ConCLuSIon **[[Orientalism divides the world into two unequal
parts.]{.mark} It is a political vision, a representation or simulacrum

(Said 1979: 166). **[It 'is [bound up with]{.mark} the disposition of
[power and powerlessness]{.mark} in each society']{.underline}** (Said
1979: 332). In the case of Somali piracy, we can see how
**[[rep]{.mark}resentation[s]{.mark} are [made by the West for the
West.]{.mark}]{.underline}** A large number of lexical and grammatical
strategies have been revealed that exclude Somalians and the many
challenges facing them. Instead, a danger- ous Somali pirate **[['other'
is]{.mark} represented, [an enemy which needs to be controlled and
conquered]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Likewise, a number of strategies have
been revealed that emphasize the positive role played by western
militaries, legitimizing their actions and presence in Somali waters.
These representations contribute to a discourse echoing **[Orientalism
where the 'Rest' are represented in ways bene- ficial to the
West.]{.underline}** By representing pirates negatively and western
militaries positively, the BBC legitimizes the West's self-interested
activities in Somali affairs. But these discourses run counter to Somali
interests. History has shown that foreign interests, influences and
interventions are partly responsible for Somalia's piracy and other
problems. What Somalia needs is establishing a function- ing Somali
government. As Middleton (2008: 12) observes, 'The most power- ful
weapon against piracy will be peace and opportunity in Somalia'. Despite
claims of objectivity and 'informing the world about the world', **[the
international BBC website perpetuates a type of [Orientalism]{.mark}
that irritates an already volatile and [dangerous]{.mark} situation to
the disadvantage of Somalia and Somalians.]{.underline}**

**[Once again, the Crazy Emperor of the Hermit Kingdom -- [No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea -- [is threatening]{.mark} [nuclear war]{.mark}. [Or so
the media would have us believe]{.mark}. The BBC and other news outlets
have taken to publishing maps with concentric rings donating the
speculative ranges of North Korea's creaky missile systems. One never
tested missile might possibly reach Alaska and do for Sarah Palin and
the polar bears. The basic [idea purveyed]{.mark} by the media and [by
US]{.mark} spokespersons [is that Oriental despotisms]{.mark} -[as Iran
and North Korea are]{.mark} regularly [portrayed]{.mark} --
[cannot]{.mark} possibly [be trusted with nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}. Accordingly, [US]{.mark} policy, to which the UN and
much of the world have subscribed, is that it [will "never accept" an
Iranian or North Korean bomb]{.mark}. While rational people would never
use a nuclear weapon except in circumstances in which it was rational to
do so, unbalanced, [crazy types might decide to unleash their]{.mark}
nuclear [arsenals]{.mark}, or turn them over to terrorists, or what not.
[It would seem]{.mark} that [only rational West]{.mark}ern nations like
the US [can be trusted with nukes]{.mark}. Images of Mad Mullahs and
Asiatic Despots aside, [there are obvious reasons why Iran and
No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea would [want nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}. Most significantly, a [nuclear weapon is]{.mark} a
[guarantee]{.mark} that [they will not suffer]{.mark} the [same fate
as]{.mark} [Iraq]{.mark} in 2003. One of the only times it is rational
and credible to make nuclear threats is in a situation of existential
crisis -- when regime survival is at stake. For this reason, no one
invades or pushes too far a power armed with nuclear weapons. Were Iran
or North Korea to use a nuclear weapon in any other circumstance, they
would face obliteration. Since nuclear weapons can be traced to their
origin, it would be suicidal for these countries to provide weapons to
terrorist groups. Such groups do not have a country to lose, unlike the
leaderships of Iran and North Korea. So [if Iran and No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea [turn out to have rational reasons for pursuing
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}, and are likely to be governed by the
same realities of nuclear deterrence that constrained the US and the
Soviet Union in the Cold War, [what about]{.mark} the [rationality of US
policy]{.mark}? For one, for the US to say it will "never accept" what
is already a reality is an absurdity: North Korea already has the bomb.
It must now be treated as a nuclear power. More broadly, the recent
history of [US foreign policy is not]{.mark} exactly [a testament to
rationality]{.mark}. In response to a terrorist attack which killed
nearly 3,000 of its citizens, the [US invaded two countries]{.mark},
[starting wars that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of
thousands]{.mark}. Ten years later, it has lost both of those wars and
broken its budget. Luckily, not every country that suffers from
terrorism reacts with such deadly and self-defeating spasms of revenge
and blood lust. [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [has]{.mark} in [living
memory suffered from]{.mark} the wanton [destructiveness of US
policy]{.mark}. This is a fact which must be remembered in the face of
media images of North Korea's supposedly irrational militarism and
aggressiveness. Over the three years of the Korean War, in the words of
General Curtis LeMay, the US Air Force "burned down every town in North
and South Korea". The US used 12,000 pound "Tarzan" bombs until there
were no more targets for them, in addition to thousands upon thousands
of bombing sorties. Thousand pound napalm bombs were dropped from B-29s
to "wipe out all life" in tactical localities. Towards the end of the
war, the US bombed North Korea's dams. One resulting flood "scooped
clean" 27 miles of river valley. Moreover, it is the [US]{.mark} which
has [made]{.mark} repeated [nuclear threats against No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea, despite the fact that North Korea has never posed a
serious threat to the US. The use of nuclear weapons was considered
several times during the Korean War, both tactical and strategic. In
April 1951, B-29s with nuclear weapons were deployed to Guam, ready for
use if China escalated its conventional involvement in the war. Later in
the war, lone B-29s simulated nuclear attack runs on Pyongyang. Over the
course of the war, a [million North Korean civilians were killed by
US]{.mark}, UN and South Korean forces. This history offers some
perspective on the recent crisis, which began not with North Korean
threats but with US and South Korean war games and manoeuvres. These
included practice sorties by two nuclear capable B-2 stealth bombers
sent over South Korea, loudly announced in the media so that the point
would not be lost on North Korea's leaders. North Korea responded with
bombast, including the incredible notion that it was preparing an
amphibious invasion of the US. Guam, still a base for US nuclear
bombers, was "threatened" by North Korea's jury-rigged missiles. In
turn, the US deployed its equally ineffective but much more expensive
THAAD missile defence system to Guam. [One wonders what is more
laughable: the idea]{.mark} that [North Korea could]{.mark} hit a speck
in the Pacific like [Guam]{.mark} or that the boondoggle offspring of
Ronald Reagan's Star Wars might actually work. What is not laughable is
the fact that it is the US which has a consistent pattern of threatening
the use -- including first use -- of nuclear weapons. No one is in doubt
that US nuclear weapons actually work, and the US remains the only power
ever to have used them in anger. Notably, it used them in a situation in
which it was itself no longer threatened. The [No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rean [bomb may be]{.mark} an [uncomfortable]{.mark} fact of
life. [But]{.mark} so too is the US bomb. And [none]{.mark} of us
[should make]{.mark} any easy [assumptions about]{.mark} the
[rationality of]{.mark} the leadership of [either country]{.mark},
however.]{.underline}**

### Middle East

#### **Views of the Middle East as a melting pot of conflict uphold orientalist views of the region as "Allah's Martyr" or the Western enemy that needs to be eradicated**

**Assayag 7**(Assayag, Jackie, 5-1-2007, \"East and West: orientalism,
war and the colonial present,\"
https://journals.openedition.org/etnografica/1943?lang=en)**//BRownRice**

The world does not exist to provide us with illustrations for our
theories. Conver­sely, our theories do not engender the world.
Nevertheless, intellectuals are more than ever fascinated by
"performatives" or "self-fulfilling prophecies". In fact, the debate on
the "clash of civilizations" introduced by the
**[[Orientalist]{.mark}]{.underline}** pro-sionist Bernard Lewis and
amplified by the conservative political scientist Samuel Huntington has
**[[transformed religious experiences into political categories]{.mark}
devoid of historicity or of contingency. [Consequently, this
dispute]{.mark} has [renewed]{.mark} mutatis mutandis the [imaginary
geographies of the Orient]{.mark}, which for that matter are more Middle
than Far Eastern.]{.underline}**1 **[Today, the executioner's crown, and
that of the victim and the martyr, incontestably goes to the Muslim. His
fiendish figure has taken the place of the diabolic figure of the
Communist, as enemy within and without.]{.underline}**2 It was because
the Soviets advocated Marxism that the Americans supported Islam, then
the Taliban (even if Islamism cannot be reduced to CIA manipulation, nor
"Talibanism" to an "instrumentalization" of the ISI, the Pakistani
intelligence agency).3 While the "reds" are on the way of extinction in
terms of threat, the "greens with beards" abound and wage war everywhere
in the world "in the service of Evil", as is emulously repeated. **[Even
though the "United States of Amnesia" did not invent this pattern of
discourse]{.underline}** -- France has done it beforehand -- their
**[ideologues and politicians have greatly contributed to its
dissemination by supporting radical Muslim movements, simple militants
or (more or less powerful) state representatives.]{.underline}** 4 This
is the thesis supported by Olivier Roy (2001) and Nilüfer Göle (2003).
6This metamorphosis of cold war enemies has been accompanied by a
transformation of the idea of war since the 1980s. **[While the monopoly
of states over high technologies of destruction has been established,
less complex technologies have seen an unbridled proliferation. The
[diffusion of the latter]{.mark} was even [encouraged by various
geopolitical]{.mark} and mercenary [interests]{.mark}, by virtue of the
complicity of private intermediaries or of state representatives who
[employ]{.mark} "revolutionaries" or finance "[terrorists]{.mark}". The
[individuals]{.mark} or groups [engaged in warlike activities in
Africa]{.mark}, or in certain regions of the [Middle East or
Asia]{.mark}, are no longer modern states, nor traditional regimes, but
are rather a [new breed of voluntary actors called "warlords]{.mark}".
These warlords are in fact the modern products of a configuration of
global and local forces.]{.underline}**4 Their proliferation has
**[entailed shifts between categories of war entrepreneurs, terrorists,
insurgents or those fighting for freedom and ethnic or national
liberation, thereby creating ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the
roles and aims of each. The simultaneous reconfiguration of terrorism as
a sole global force -- the [aforementioned "Muslim terrorism"]{.mark} --
has ultimately [subsumed]{.mark} all expressions of violence, protest
and vindictiveness [under]{.mark} the figure of [the
"Enemy".]{.mark}]{.underline}** This figure, reviled by the politicians
in the North, but frequently raised to a hero by a number of media in
the South, was conceived as a totality before being vanquished in the
interest of universalism incorporated in the American nation. **[This
focalization [gave rise to]{.mark} mirror-image effects: the [martyrs of
Allah]{.mark} henceforth assimilate the destruction of [the "Western
Enemy"]{.mark}]{.underline}** into its numerous impious avatars, the two
centres of which are the United States and Israel. 5 For further
consideration of this question one can refer to two articles by Jackie
Assayag (2002a, (\...) 7It seems **[clear today that the complicated
situations linked to war and terror in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir,
as well as in Palestine and Iraq, generate communitarian imaginations of
catastrophe that encourage political, mafia-like or eschatological
bricolages.]{.underline}** The scheming intricacies of the "crusade
against the axis of evil" provoke aggressive responses, political and
cultural, conducive to the extension of lawless zones and to the
political implementation of cruelty. **[All of them foster in the end an
economy of fear or of panic that redesigns the architectures of hate and
the perimeters of established knowledge and of powers, in the West as in
the East, in the North as in the South.]{.underline}**5 6 On the
dialectics of transparency and secret conspiracies in the new world
order, cf. the evocative (\...) 8The confrontation of geopolitical
cosmologies with the local conceptions of ordinary people in an
interconnected world largely influenced by mass media engenders a great
many rival intrigues. The proliferation of expositions fosters rumours
and the sense of humiliation, nourishes nostalgia as well as resentment,
foments fear of conspiracies and fuels the desire for revenge, when it
does not arouse mobilizing passions according to divergent, if not
contradictory, interests. **[The "[savage war of
peace"]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- the expression is from Rudyard Kipling
and refers to the **[[repression carried out in the colonies]{.mark} --
has [drawn]{.mark} the front [line in terms of]{.mark} ["civilization"
or "barbarism".]{.mark} Consequently, a multiplicity of actors endeavour
to redirect the flow of real or occult powers with a view to reviving
the war or establishing peace, as much in villages and neighbourhoods as
in the framework of regions and states, as well as in the midst of
transnational organizations, notwithstanding their penchant for
transparency.]{.underline}**6 7 The derealization is particularly
pronounced in Palestine, because one has been given to believe fo (\...)
9Above all, this horizon of expectation and desire in societies that are
more than ever inclined to paranoid crises, in both the South and the
North, fosters new connections and previously unknown fragmentations on
the basis of narratives that favour spatial and mental fictions
incorporating history -- teleology or eschatology. Far from bringing the
people of the world closer together, the aforementioned globalization
engenders "mutual exoticization" inside frontiers and beyond continents:
enemies within and without, stereotype against stereotype, reciprocal
allocation of hostile prejudices, in short, globalization of insecurity
and of fear (Assayag 2005). Thus the modern colonial imagination imposes
itself (on the basis of political economy), as the "great
\[ideological\] game" between the empires (Russian and British) was
orchestrated in the second half of the nineteenth century (Meyer and
Brysac 2002). **[The [colonial present]{.mark}, lying in ambush in minds
and clinging on to life, has clear territorial bearings: Afghanistan,
Iraq, Palestine; either so many political impasses that [illustrate
a]{.mark} "[besieged cartography]{.mark}", that is to say, an
ever-changing configuration of borders, or a production of topological
imaginations that are [both disputed and
derealizing.]{.mark}]{.underline}**7

promoted by the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, and taken up
by governments and media commentators in the United States and the
United Kingdom, was **[undermined by the]{.underline}** October 2018
**[killing of Jamal Khashoggi,]{.underline}** an exiled Saudi journalist
critical of the Crown Prince's rule. The Crown Prince himself likely
ordered the assassination (Barnes and Sanger, 2021). The dissonance
between the projected image of benign liberalisation and the silencing
of Khashoggi poses questions about the nature and role of the narrative
of Saudi 'reform' within Western public discourse, which this article
will attempt to shed light on. **[The narrative of the 'reforming'
monarch is [not new]{.mark}, and is [consistent with]{.mark} the
juxtaposed, binary caricatures of [Orientalist discourse, wherein the
West is]{.mark} cast as axiomatically progressive and [modern, in
contradistinction with an East mired in]{.mark} a [backwardness]{.mark}
determined by its culture and traditions. In this context, the
[purported Arab 'reformer']{.mark} is [presented as]{.mark} the [ideal
ally]{.mark} [of the progressive West]{.mark}, attempting to drag his
society up towards what are taken to be our own higher
standards.]{.underline}** As such, the 'reform' narrative serves **[two
important discursive functions. First, it [legitimises Western support
for authoritarian rul]{.mark}e with the implied but false promise that
the regime in question is working to achieve some form of meaningful and
transformative change.]{.underline}** Second, by moving the explanatory
focus for the persistence of authoritarianism away from the historic
collusion of governing elites in both the East and West, and firmly onto
the terrain of cultural difference, it **[serves to [reinforce]{.mark}
the [West's self-image as liberal and democratic]{.mark}, despite its
sustained support for authoritarian rule.]{.underline}** In fact,
**[Western support for Gulf monarchs]{.underline}**, once the latter are
cast as 'reforming', **[becomes proof,]{.underline}** rather than
disproof, **[of the [liberal nature of Western
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Authoritarianism is thus externalised as
an Arab trait, or problem, and a sense of Western innocence is
preserved. Crucially, **[[by legitimating Western
support]{.underline}]{.mark}** for these monarchies, **[this
[racialising discourse serves to facilitate the ongoing incorporation of
the Gulf region into global capitalism]{.mark} on terms favourable to
the interests of the Atlantic powers.]{.underline}** That is to say, the
**[process of [racialising the Gulf]{.mark} is a [constitutive element
of the capitalist relations between the region and the West.]{.mark} To
this extent, we are dealing here with an instance of 'racial
capitalism'.]{.underline}** This article will **[[critically analyse the
'reform' narrative]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the case of UK relations
**[[with Saudi Arabia]{.mark}]{.underline}** primarily, but also with
reference to Bahrain. These illustrative cases will be set within the
structural context of UK relations with the states of the Gulf
Cooperation Council ('GCC', comprising Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain,
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman). Notwithstanding the
heterogeneity across these six states, they constitute a coherent
geopolitical bloc from the point of view of UK foreign relations.
Maintaining support for monarchical rule in the GCC has long been a
policy of high strategic value to the British state and British
capitalism. The article begins by outlining the role that Britain has
played in sustaining authoritarian rule in the region. Noting the
contradiction between these practices and the political philosophy of
democratic liberalism in which the British political class is steeped,
it contends that, beyond the material self-interest of the British state
and British capitalism, we must look to the role of ideology and
discourse to gain a more complete understanding of how these
relationships are justified and thus rendered sustainable politically.
The article then draws on the concept of 'racial capitalism', noting how
**[[certain peoples have been racialised within western
discourse]{.mark} so as to justify integrating them into the global
capitalist system in a subordinate position]{.underline}**. It utilises
the concept of '**[[Orientalism']{.mark},]{.underline}** to
**[[examine]{.mark} the [specific processes]{.mark} of racialisation to
which this article pertains. The narrative of the 'reforming monarch'
emerges from Orientalist discourse,]{.underline}** and the article
discusses the nature and lineage of that narrative, and the ways it has
been employed in the UK-Gulf context. Particular attention is paid to
the emergence of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, and the utility of
the 'reform' narrative as a defence of continued British support for the
Saudi kingdom. Here, the treatment of women's rights within the
discourse provides an especially telling illustration of the dynamics in
play. The article concludes that **[racialising discourse is an
[important component of]{.mark} the [political
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}** of UK-GCC relations, shoring up and even
sharpening Britain's self-image as a liberal presence on the world
stage, obscuring its sustained commitment to authoritarian rule and
thereby facilitating the maintenance and renewal of the ties between
British and Gulf capitalism. These conclusions are reached through
analysis of contemporary texts which convey the British government's
narrative on UK-GCC relations. This analysis situates that narrative
within long-established discourses around relations between the West and
the Middle East, identifying familiar or adapted tropes and evaluating
the work they are doing at key moments. The analysed texts include
transcripts of parliamentary debates and select committee hearings, as
well as official statements by ministers. Particular attention is paid
to moments of scandal, crisis, or change, where the discourse has been
mobilised to justify UK support for monarchical rule. These moments
include the 2011 uprising in Bahrain, the mass execution carried out in
Saudi Arabia in January 2016, and the 2018 visit to the United Kingdom
of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.

### NATO

#### **US-NATO security cooperation is a further perpetuation of the western military-security state, resulting in relentless racialization of "The Orient"**

**Amin-Khan 12**(Tariq Amin-Khan, 2012 New Orientalism, Securitisation
and the Western Media's Incendiary Racism,

**[The [Long War]{.mark} may be a war [against militant
Islam]{.mark},]{.underline}** but it is also against those
Muslim-majority states that do not accept the empire's diktats. An
analysis of the rise of militant Islam is beyond the scope of this
paper, but it is important to note that militant Islamist and Salafist
groups have become a powerful social force in many Muslim-majority
states and have violently confronted the post-colonial state in pursuit
of their dogmatic and narrow doctrinaire ideas. However, the **[current
resistance of militant Islam [against the USA and]{.mark} its
[NATO]{.mark} allies [cannot be seen as anti-imperialist]{.mark}, as the
objective of anti-imperialism is the social and economic liberation of
imperialised society---this seems contrary to the goals of militant
Islam.]{.underline}**49 **[US and NATO military
commanders]{.underline}** have **[[used fear in trying to
defeat]{.underline}]{.mark}** militant
**[[Islamists]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Reliance on this tactic remains,
even though it has been **[unsuccessful in instilling
fear]{.underline}** among Afghani and Iraqi Islamists---**[despite their
[dehumanised and brutalised treatment]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The Iraqi
prisoners in Abu Ghraib were subjected to this inhuman treatment, which
still continues with some modification in Guantanamo Bay, while the
**[USA and NATO take no responsibility for the [deaths of
unarmed]{.mark} innocent [children, women and men]{.mark} by their
militaries or by pilotless aerial drone attacks]{.underline}** in
Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen, among other Muslim-majority states.
WikiLeaks' release of footage showing a US military helicopter
deliberately targeting two unarmed Iraqi journalists working for
Reuters, along with other men and two children, is a poignant reminder
of how little the lives of the orientalised are valued.50 Similarly,
**[[Western politicians]{.mark} and the media have also [used]{.mark}
[fear to justify]{.mark} the increased [suppression]{.mark} of due
process, introduction of anti-terror laws, and [heightened use of
surveillance]{.mark} and intimidation in their respective states. The
invocation of fear during the Long War parallels the recent cold war
history. The [USA]{.mark} used fear---of the 'red menace'---to
[construct]{.mark} the [security state]{.mark} through the enactment of
the 1947 National Security Act that also created the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA).]{.underline}** Likewise, the fear of the
'Muslim terrorist' in late 2001 led to the enactment of the Patriot Act
and the **[US security state [propelled]{.mark} the notion of
[securitisation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which was **[universalised
[beyond]{.mark}]{.underline}** the borders of the
**[[USA]{.underline}]{.mark}** to Canada, the rest of the **[[Western
states]{.underline}]{.mark}** and to key **[[client post-colonial
states]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in order to **[[launch the war on
terror]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, as noted earlier, the **[current
era of securitisation is at a [historically]{.mark} [unique
moment]{.mark}. While it may [incorporate]{.mark} some old [Orientalist
tropes,]{.mark} and some ideological and imperialist motives may be
similar to those of the cold war period security state, there is little
relationship to the latter.]{.underline}** During the Cold War's
post-McCarthy era although the **[US security state guided its
militarism, fed the arms race]{.underline}** by strengthening the
military-- industrial complex, and **[[presided
over]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[[imperialist expansionism for world
hegemony]{.mark},]{.underline}** Western societies actually became more
open. Due process was generally respected, movements for civil rights,
women's liberation, gay rights and democratic change generally
blossomed, and anti-democratic practices and the high-handedness of
Western political leaders were broadly challenged. In **[its current
specificity the security state and securitisation have been enormously
strengthened by the suppression of dissent and civil liberties with the
corresponding expansion of anti-democratic practices and intrusive
surveillance within Western states.]{.underline}** Simultaneously
**[[xenophobia]{.underline}]{.mark}** and societal/ anti-Muslim racism
have been **[[fuelled by the Western media's incendiary racism]{.mark}.
The [USA and]{.mark} its [NATO]{.mark} allies have [persistently
violated]{.mark} the [sovereignty of]{.mark} many
[Muslim]{.mark}-majority [states]{.mark} at will, through aerial drone
attacks, intrusive surveillance and military
occupation.]{.underline}**51 This focus on militarisation and
securitisation has also **[allowed]{.underline}** the field of
**[security studies to proliferate]{.underline}**. Scholars in this
field appear to be on a self-fulfilling mission of promoting
securitisation, given the number of journal articles that are silent on
the invasiveness of surveillance and the antidemocratic character of
security regimes. A recent book by Stuart Croft, however, was expected
to provide critical intervention on security issues and
securitisation.52 It turns out that, despite Croft's desire to broaden
the discussion of identities within particular time and space, he ends
up essentialising identity without analysing power or the role of
dominant identities. He also **[does not examine [imperialist domination
and racialisation]{.mark}]{.underline}**; in effect he
**[reinforces]{.underline}** securitisation as **[social constructions
rooted]{.underline}** immemorially **[in history,]{.underline}** which
he claims have a mutual impact on both the 'Self' and the 'Other' (p
92). **[To treat the securitiser and the securitised as coterminous and
to contend that they are mutually affected by security regimes means
that there is no analysis of power or understanding of powerlessness and
racialisation.]{.underline}** Similarly, to claim as Croft does, that
the 'securitisation of Islam is not a unique event' as it is just
another social reconstruction among hundreds in history, albeit of a
different 'Other' (p 259), is to be unmindful of the colonial legacy and
the consequences of current imperialist forays in Muslim-majority
states, as well as to ignore the deep racism and xenophobia prevalent in
Europe and North America. Croft's ahistoricist views on the subject
allow him to maintain that, just because Catholics suffered during the
formation of Britain and the Irish through British imperialism, and that
the Dutch, Germans and Jews were targeted in Britain, it is now the turn
of Muslims to also join the throngs of oppressed people (pp 39--44, 74,
259)--- which is indeed a very disturbing rationale for the prevalence
and intensification of xenophobic oppression and violence in society.
This enables him to conveniently opt out of interrogating
securitisation, a field in which he is completely invested. In effect,
Croft's approach '**[[normalises']{.mark} the [securitisation of the
'Other']{.mark} as an uneventful ahistorical phenomenon. And the most
that he can then do is to undertake a proper post-structuralist textual
analysis of xenophobic writings against Muslims and Islam by British
'public intellectuals', politicians and religious leaders, and compare
them to the atrocities against the Catholics and the Irish or the
ridiculing of the Dutch---to further reinforce his historicist
approach]{.underline}** (see chapters 1, 5 and conclusion). The effect
of such an undertaking, while it recognises that securitisation creates
xenophobic responses from the dominant community, is to **[make a
mockery of due process for the securitised and to remain [inattentive on
how]{.mark} their [rights are consistently trampled by]{.mark} the
coercive arm of the [Western state]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But Croft is
not interested in challenging the notion of securitisation at the level
of the state; rather, he seeks merely to move beyond the Copenhagen
School of security studies to offer a theory of securitisation that is
more encompassing of identities, time and space (see pp 77--91). In
other words, he wants theory to account for the role of influential
non-state actors, and media and cultural elites, as well as the military
and the police (which are really part of the state's coercive arm) in
shaping the securitisation regimes (pp 70--85). Croft's penchant for
conceiving the development of the securitisation process as outside the
state (through the actions of individuals) is so overwhelming that he
dwells at length in his text on the **[notion of 'ontological
security']{.underline}**---the idea that the nature of the security of
the self is effectively a 'relationship between identity, narrative and
security', which is 'achieved \[almost reflexively\] through the
creation of a series of relationships performed through everyday
routines and practices' (p 17). But the nature of this type of framing
completely omits the role of the state and focuses mainly on his notion
of 'ontological security', which becomes a coping mechanism for the
individual to deal with the 'benefit' or the fallout from
securitisation. This approach therefore permits Croft to treat the
'Self' and the 'Other' as coeval, and to exclude the security state and
its securitisation policy from a critical gaze. I have argued here that
securitisation is a historically specific process, a post-cold war
phenomenon that emerged as the US model of the security state was
universalised in the aftermath of the September 11 events, and the
paradigm was emulated by all Western, and some key client Muslimmajority
states. Furthermore, I have also tried to show that racialisation is
deeply embedded in, and a concomitant part of, securitisation through
discussions on the niqab, sports, terrorism suspects, and incendiary
racism. To ignore racialisation as a process of dehumanisation and to
treat it merely as a form of 'othering' (an oxymoron that inoculates the
dominant group from absorbing the suffering of the 'Other') authorises
writers like Croft and others in his field of security studies to focus
on deepening securitisation without really problematising the role of
the **[[Western]{.mark} nation-state]{.underline}** and the media in the
**[ongoing [subjugation]{.mark} and xenophobic treatment [of racialised
communities]{.mark}. In addition to the dehumanised treatment of the
Muslim and people who 'look like Muslims' in European and North American
societies and by the US and NATO militaries, [racialised immigrants and
Muslims]{.mark} are [made scapegoats]{.mark} for Europe's social ills,
and are even [blamed for]{.mark} the continent's economic
[woes]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Journalists and writers---Mark Steyn,
Barbara Amiel, Melanie Phillips and Robert Spencer---have referred to
the 'demographic threat' of Muslims overwhelming Europe and other
Western countries in apocalyptic terms, and have even developed a new
term for their characterisation: 'Eurabia'.53 **[Given this attitude,
and as long as some of the incendiary racist media coverage peddles
anti-immigrant and antiMuslim vilification and fables about 'Eurabia',
hatred and the new Orientalism will eat away at European and North
American societies in the Long War era.]{.underline}**

#### NATO expansion is fundamentally orientalist and serves to isolate the eastern "Other" in need of protection by mighty West

Abstract: This article examines how **[EU and [NATO enlargement is
framed by the dichotomy of Europe versus East]{.mark}ern Europe, and how
the enlargement process simultaneously transforms that
dichotomy.]{.underline}** I argue that **[the double [enlargement is
underpinned by]{.mark} a broadly [orientalist discourse that assumes
essential difference]{.mark} between Europe and Eastern Europe [and
frames difference]{.mark} from Western Europe [as a]{.mark} distance
from and a [lack of Europeanness]{.mark}.]{.underline}** I suggest that
in order to expose and undercut this reinscription of otherness,
**[research on East-Central Europe should engage with
[postcolonial]{.mark} [theory]{.mark} in a more direct and sustained
fashion.]{.underline}** Key words: European Union and NATO enlargement,
Europe, East-Central Europe, orientalism, East European studies,
geopolitics. I Introduction **[Accounts of European Union (EU) and NATO
enlargement reveal a double framing of East-Central Europe. On the one
hand, these enlargements are said to finally make Europe \'whole and
free\'.]{.underline}** Evocations of a uniting Europe and eroding
divisions abound in journalistic as well as academic writings about the
double enlargement. On the other hand, **[these]{.underline}** same
**[accounts betray a tacit distinction between Europe and Eastern
Europe.]{.underline}** Within this framework, some parts of Eastern
Europe - the **[EU accession countries - are]{.underline}** eagerly
**[striving to become fully European]{.underline}**, while other parts -
in particular **[Russia]{.underline}** - are deemed **[not yet
sufficiently European to be considered for a full membership in
Europe.]{.underline}** This article investigates that dual framing of
East-Central Europe as simultaneously in Europe and not yet European. It
examines the ways in which **[EU and [NATO
enlargement]{.mark}]{.underline}** - often explicitly or implicitly
folded together as the eastern expansion of Europe1 - **[are
[underpinned by]{.mark} an [opposition]{.mark} between Europe and
Eastern Europe]{.underline}**, while inciting a reconfiguration of that
opposition. My question is not what assumptions or claims about
East-Central Europe are correct, but how these assumptions enable and
constrain public and scholarly discussion about EU and NATO enlargement.
By examining how conceptions and demarcations of Europe and Europeanness
inform the discourse of the double enlargement, the article makes a
twofold contribution to political geography. First, **[while the
constitutive role of Eastern Europe in European identity construction is
well documented in historical research, I elucidate how the discourse of
Eastern Europe informs the present round of EU and NATO
enlargement.]{.underline}** I suggest that the **[double [enlargement is
underpinned by]{.mark} a broadly [orientalist discourse that]{.mark}
assumes essential difference between Europe and Eastern Europe and
[frames difference]{.mark} from Western Europe [as a]{.mark} distance
from and a [lack of Europeanness. Enlargement
reconfigures]{.mark}]{.underline}** the specific borders of Europe but
not the **[[underlying dichotomy]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Europe and
Eastern Europe. On the basis of this inscription of otherness, I explore
the possibilities of theorizing EU and NATO enlargements in terms of
postcoloniality. The term **[[\'postcoloniality\']{.mark} is used here
not in the sense of \'after\' coloniality but to [denote]{.mark} current
ongoing [practices of constituting East]{.mark}ern Europe [as not yet
European]{.mark}, and \'postcolonial theory\' thus refers to a set of
theoretical perspectives within which questions of constituting places
occupy a central position]{.underline}** (Sidaway, 2000: 591). An
engagement with **[postcolonial theory]{.underline}** would not fold
East-Central Europe into a generalized non-West, but **[enable us to
situate EU and NATO enlargement in the production of difference and
alterity hitherto highlighted in \'non-Western\'
contexts.]{.underline}** Secondly, the article outlines both the
internal consistencies within the discourse of Eastern Europe as well as
the fluidity and flexibility of that discourse. I argue that the concept
of Eastern Europe persists precisely because of this flexibility, which
makes it supremely convenient for both West and East European
constructions of Europe. While most analyses of the European idea focus
on how **[this idea]{.underline}** is produced in power centers, such as
Brussels or Washington, I focus on how it **[is maintained in Europe\'s
power margins.]{.underline}** Specifically, I explore how the
**[opposition of Europe and Eastern Europe is used by the accession
countries themselves, and I [link Western orientalization]{.mark} of the
accession countries [to]{.mark} these [countries\' othering of states
further \'East\'.]{.mark}]{.underline}** I thereby underscore that
**[the categories of [Europe and Eastern Europe are not monolithic,
but]{.mark} function as a series of Europes and Eastern Europes that fit
into and [reinforce the broader construction of
otherness]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The **[discourses of Europe and
Eastern Europe are neither simply imposed on the accession countries,
nor do they simply reflect an authentic East European view. Rather,
these [discourses are reproduced through]{.mark} the reverberation of
[othering]{.mark} practices between the West and the accession
countries. The argument will proceed by highlighting the persistent - if
implicit - categorization of Europe into a fully European core and the
not-yet-fully European Eastern Europe within the enlargement
discourse.]{.underline}** In particular, I point out how this discourse
construes the accession states as learners or adopters of European
norms. I then challenge the notion of the learning process by examining
the rhetorical strategies employed by Central European intellectuals of
statecraft to discursively locate their countries in Europe while
othering their Eastern neighbors, particularly Russia. In an attempt to
start conceptualizing these practices of othering, the article
subsequently explores the possibilities of using postcolonial theory to
gain fresh insights into the EU enlargement discourse. The conclusion
will highlight how my findings challenge the habitual ways of analyzing
East-Central Europe. 11 Still \'not well brought up\': EU and NATO
enlargement as a learning process The notion that Eastern Europe needs
advice from Europe predates the current round of EU enlargement. This
notion was invented in the eighteenth century, when Eastern Europe was
demarcated as being of Europe by geography but still in the process of
becoming European (Wolff, 1994: 7). **[[East]{.mark}ern Europe
[became]{.mark} one of the [generalized \'other]{.mark}s\' necessary for
Europe\'s self-image]{.underline}** (Neumann, 1999). Crucially, it
emerged not as irredeemably alien but as **[a halfway house between
Europe and Asia.]{.underline}** Eastern Europe was not simply backward,
but a learner, an experiment, and a testing ground, \'a gigantic
specimen to which the most advanced legal and administrative ideas could
be applied with a completeness impossible in western Europe\' (Neumann,
\'1999: 78). **[Voltaire and other enlightenment philosophers both
criticized Russian despotism and admired Catherine the Great\'s
\'Westernizing\' experiments.]{.underline}**2 This conception of
East-Central Europe has undergone a number of transformations, but its
premise of otherness has persisted. During the cold war, as the Soviet
bloc became a precondition for Western self-identity, the image of a
half-oriental Russia and helpless satellite states was condensed in
elite and popular discourses (Dalby, 1990; Pietz, 1988; 0 Tuathail and
Agnew, 1992; Sharp, 20O0).3 East European studies were deeply
ideological, closely linked to Western governmental and intelligence
circles, and insulated from theoretical debates in the social sciences
(Lieven, 2001: 2; Verdery, 1997). Roeder (1999: 743) remarks that: \'The
years prior to 1989 were the glory days for area specialists. **[The
Cold War gave our special knowledge unique value: [we knew the enemy and
it was \"ours\"]{.mark}. Central and eastern Europe was treated as a
uniform bloc, and much of the research on it was \"mere footnotes to
Sovietology\"\']{.underline}** (Garton Ash, 1989: 180). One could say
that much of **[East European studies at that time represented not an
engagement with but a [disengagement from]{.mark} the
[complexities]{.mark} of East-Central Europe in favor of [simple
binaries]{.mark} such as [West versus East]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In
the post-cold war era, **[this [disengagement]{.mark} has
[persisted]{.mark}, not simply as a waning legacy of an unfortunate
mistake, but [as a]{.mark}n unspoken [premise of]{.mark} EU and [NATO
enlargement]{.mark}. As the double enlargement is framed in terms of
teaching and learning community values and norms]{.underline}** (see
Schimmelfennig, 2000), **[the accession countries are tacitly demarcated
as not-yet-fully European]{.underline}** (for an expose, see Ilves,
1999; 2001). French President Jacques Chirac\'s remark that EU accession
countries displayed a \'not well brought up behavior\' (BBC News, 2003)
when their foreign policies differed from France is a good example of
this premise of alterity.i The 1999 expansion of NATO to include Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic did not as much undermine the Europe
versus Eastern Europe division as shift it further east. **[Some
commentators have claimed that [it]{.mark} even [accentuated \'the
growing chasm\']{.mark} between those states anointed as bona fide
Europeans, slated for fast-track incorporation [into Western]{.mark}
security and economic [structures, and]{.mark} \'the [others\']{.mark} -
relegated to the margins of Europe]{.underline}** (Bialasiewicz and
O\'Loughlin, 2002). Thus, **[even though EU and [NATO
enlargement]{.mark} processes have undermined the cold war era division
of Europe into two, they have simultaneously [fueled]{.mark} a threefold
[division]{.mark} of the continent into the European core, the Central
European applicants not yet fully European but in tune with the European
project, and an eastern periphery effectively excluded from
membership]{.underline}** (Agnew, 2001; Paasi, 2001). The image of a
single Europe has given way to a multitier patchwork Europe with varying
degrees of Europeanness and Eastness, yet **[[a generalized East]{.mark}
has remained a [defining characteristic of]{.mark} European [identity
construction]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Neumann, 1999). Area studies are
deeply implicated in the reproduction of Eastern Europe. Brubaker (1998:
281) notes that research on East-Central Europe still tends to be built
on a series of oppositions such as reason and passion, modern tolerance
and ancient hatreds, civic nationhood and ethnic nationalism. The
disengagement from the complex realities of East-Central Europe is still
tacitly justified by the need to struggle against communism, this time
against its legacies; and the segregation of East European studies from
critical social theory has persisted5 (Brubaker, 1998; Lieven, 2001: 4).
**[The comparison between Eastern Europe and the [West]{.mark} still
tends to turn into a comparison of the former with the latter, clearly
[ascribing \'normality\' to one side]{.mark} only, [against]{.mark}
which [the \'other\']{.mark} has to measure itself]{.underline}**
(Horschelmann, 2001: 986). **[The West is conceived as a model that the
EU accession countries]{.underline}** - framed as a blank sheet with no
(proper) institutions and laws - ought to follow (Cohen, 2001; Grabher
and Stark, 1996). In the early 1990s, East-Central Europe was indeed not
upgraded but \'downgraded\' in the scale of development. It was no
longer treated as a second world - antagonistic but capable of
industrial innovation - but as a variant of third world - and hence a
space under Western tutelage (Cohen, 2001; Wedel, 2001). Despite the
abundance of studies on East-Central Europe, relatively little has been
said on European representations of that region. Very few social
scientists have endeavored to trace Western (re)invention of Eastern
Europe engendered by postsocialist transformations and EU enlargement
(Bunzl, 2000: 76). It is readily acknowledged that Soviet influence was
a kind of colonialism, but there is much less willingness to examine
Western policies toward East-Central Europe in terms of postcoloniality.
Even after the disastrous results of Western economic aid campaigns to
East-Central Europe, transitology6 has displayed a \'spectacular
unwillingness\' to use transformations in East-Central Europe to examine
the familiar categories of Europe, market or democracy (Cohen, 2001:
267; Verdery, 1997; 2002). **[The reified [contrast]{.mark} of Eastern
and Western Europe, within which EU accession becomes a kind of
relocation from Europe\'s East to Europe proper, [has
perpetuated]{.mark} two seemingly [opposite]{.mark} types of
[accounts]{.mark} on East-Central Europe: one of linear transition to
the West and the other of \'old\' patterns of
geopolitics.]{.underline}** Both conceive the agency of the accession
countries in terms of following Europe or failing to do so, and both
pervade not only Western but also local accounts of East-Central Europe.
Importantly, much of social science in the accession countries also
operates with such naturalized concepts of the past and the future

VALERIA GURROLA WRITES -- **[Nuclear Orientalism deeply permeates US
media.]{.underline}** In December 2019, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un
warned the US of a "Christmas gift" dependent on the outcome of nuclear
negotiations with the Trump administration. Days after the announcement,
satellite images uncovered new activity at the previously dormant Sohae
Satellite Launching Station in North Korea. This active missile test
site is the same one that North Korea had dismantled nineteen months
earlier, in alignment with Chairman Kim's commitment to the UN Security
Council's mandate to denuclearize. The sudden announcement and
reassembly of the Sohae Station in December 2019 has caused US media to
speculate about what the 'gift' would entail, ranging from a nuclear
test to a missile test, or even... a vase? In the frenzy of
miscommunication, Twitter users jokingly shared biased tweets about the
supposed gift. One Tweet by the user \@JerMunji reads, "Well it was a
nice run being here. I enjoyed my time," speculating, obviously, that
the Hermit Kingdom would wage nuclear warfare against the US. But these
**[[reactions]{.mark} to North Korea]{.underline}**'s December 2019
announcement **[[reflect]{.underline}]{.mark}** the bias known as
**["[Nuclear Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**" against North Korea.
Nuclear Orientalism is the **[deeply ingrained
[notion]{.mark}]{.underline}**, held by the rest of the world, **[[that
non-Western countries cannot be trusted]{.mark} with nuclear
warheads.]{.underline}** This **[double-standard traces back to the
1970s, when]{.underline}** the United States, the Soviet Union, the
United Kingdom, France and China signed the **[Non-Proliferation
Treaty,]{.underline}** which granted the five of them the power to yield
nuclear warheads. What to make of this situation? For one thing, **[the
[US has]{.mark} an extensive [record of adding to]{.mark} nuclear
[tension]{.mark}]{.underline}** (and of course is the only nation to
exercise the atomic option in warfare.) The **[United States
has]{.underline}** an estimated total of **[5,800 nuclear
warheads]{.underline}**, whereas **[North Korea has]{.underline}** an
estimated total of just **[40. [North Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
then, **[[poses no real threat to nuclear warfare,
despite]{.underline}]{.mark}** what many American politicians and
nuclear pundits **[[fear]{.mark}. Instead, nuclear weapons
[provide]{.mark} countries such as [North Korea protection]{.mark} [from
US aggression. During the Korean War]{.mark}, the [US
transported]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark} to the Pacific Ocean so as
[to threaten surrounding countries]{.mark} from intervening in the war.
Although the US never acted on those threats, US B-29 bombers simulated
nuclear warfare against Korea. By the end of the war, an estimated [one
million North Koreans lost their lives due to US]{.mark} involvement.
Fear of a nuclear world war dramatically increased after]{.underline}**
President **[Trump]{.underline}**'s term in office, but these fears
reflected bias rather than shrewd political assessment. In truth, the
only way to move forward is to grant North Korea nuclear power rather
than force it to denuclearize. **[Clear-headed
[talks]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the topic of global denuclearization
**[[cannot begin without first discussing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and

### Russia

#### **The 1ac's fears of Russia are rooted in a history of the west's constant othering of Russia -- the alt is a prerequisite to break down the orientalist barriers between the status quo and truly understanding Russia** 

**Blachford 20**(Kevin Blachford, "Western orientalism and the threat
from Russia", Jun 30 2020, page 357-361)**//BRownRice**

**[Western orientalism and [russia]{.mark} Russia's invasion of Georgia,
annexation of Crimea and willingness to support Assad in Syria,
[challenged West]{.mark}ern presuppositions of the post-Cold War era.
The revival of [tension between NATO]{.mark} powers [and
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** has **[also [ended]{.mark}]{.underline}**
the post-Cold War **[[optimism]{.mark} that [Russia would
Westernize]{.mark}]{.underline}** and become a Western style liberal
democracy. The following, aims to provide a critical examination of the
discourse surrounding tensions with Russia. **[As Western analysts have
rushed to explain Russia's belligerence, there is a frequent recourse to
simplistic cultural explanations]{.underline}**. In looking to Russia's
foreign policy actions since the Georgian war of 2008**[, "many [Western
observers]{.mark}," have [concluded]{.mark}, "Russia and the [Russians
defy logic]{.mark}."]{.underline}** 52 **[The [failure to]{.mark}
adequately [engage with Russian politics]{.mark} and develop a deeper
understanding of Russian foreign policy [reflects a]{.mark} long [trend
of Western discourse]{.mark} to see Russia as defined by its geography
and culture.]{.underline}** It is the legacy of a Soviet and Tsarist
past which is used to understand Russia's actions today.53 Thomas Graham
even argued that Europe has a "Russia problem" stretching back 200 years
based on a cultural "values gap." 54 Graham further argued that
contemporary tensions could essentially be traced to the Tsarist
policies of the post-Napoleonic era. **[Explanations of Russian foreign
policy have often relied on a primordialist perspective to explain
Russia's actions. That only by looking long back into Russia's history
and national identity can we understand Russia's contemporary foreign
policy. To explain Russia's actions in the international sphere, Western
observes look to Russia's long history and expansive
geography]{.underline}**;55 **[but this primordial explanation is used
in a deterministic manner. Because of [Russia]{.mark}'s history and
geography it is [accused of]{.mark} following a recurring "pattern" of
[conflict with the West]{.mark}.]{.underline}**56 **[[Historical]{.mark}
and geopolitical [explanations]{.mark} are [not orientalist by
themselves]{.mark}, it is the [tendency to reduce these explanations to
a deterministic approach]{.mark} which [is orientalist.]{.mark} [Western
foreign policy]{.mark} then becomes [portrayed as rational]{.mark},
responding to incentives, while [Russia]{.mark} is [portrayed as]{.mark}
being guided by some historic impulse or flaw in its
culture.]{.underline}** The fighting in Ukraine and the annexation of
Crimea has been interpreted as a "frontal challenge to the post-Cold War
European regional order." 57 **[Russia's actions created surprise and
shock for analysts and policy makers alike, but there have been few
serious investigations into Russia's strategic decisions. Instead,
[Western]{.mark} public [discourse]{.mark} has [followed an orientalist
trend in blaming]{.mark} an irrational leadership and [its Eastern
culture]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The use of force by Russia is also seen
as uniquely linked to Putin's leadership. The Ukraine and Georgia crisis
is blamed on Putin's "unique response" 58 and Putin's "choice." 59
**[[There seems little attempt to explore]{.mark} either the workings of
the Russian leadership or to consider in more detail [why Russia chose
to intervene. Instead]{.mark}, there is a tendency to embrace simplistic
arguments [blaming Putin's]{.mark} "unconstrained, erratic
[adventurism]{.mark}."]{.underline}** 60 Western analysts argue Putin's
"surprise policy decisions," and his "rashness," "have astounded even
expert analysis." 61 What is significant about the attempts to blame
solely Putin is that he is seen as uniquely responsible. Putin as the
sole figure involved is then portrayed as an "ideologue" 62 and as a
"gambler." 63 **[His actions are not seen as the rational choice of a
leader responding to a realpolitik environment. However, counter
arguments have been made which show Russia's hybrid war in Ukraine was
not an irrational opportunistic gamble, but an attempt to coerce Kiev
into negotiations.64 But while such alternative explanations have been
discussed in academic publications they have not been widely covered
within the Western media. The Ukraine crisis has, however, been widely
covered in the media for its use of hybrid warfare. The surprise and
confusion these [events]{.mark} [created within Western]{.mark}
political [commentary]{.mark} was intertwined with an
[orientalist]{.mark} perspective that [sought to highlight Russia's
cultural differences to the West.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Hybrid warfare
has been described as a conflict between "East and West." 65 What is
significant in this portrayal is that Russia's hybrid warfare is then
viewed in omnipotent terms which exaggerates Russia's power and
ability.66 **[[West]{.mark}ern observers have long [demonize]{.mark}d
[East]{.mark}ern tactics in war [as irrational]{.mark}, deceptive and
underhanded.]{.underline}**67 In describing Russia's actions, **[Western
analysts repeat this formula by accusing Russia of using "shadowy
tactics"]{.underline}** 68 of being "sneaky" 69 and using tactics based
on "deceit." 70 Hybrid warfare is further interpreted with reference to
the Ancient Chinese strategist Sun Tzu.71 The reputation of Sun Tzu as
an Eastern general willing to use deception and secrecy to win battles
is then compared to Russia's own use of asymmetric warfare.72 But
crucially, this historical analogy devolves further into an orientalist
perspective when Russia is accused of being, not just a "sneaky"
Easterner, but by not playing by "the rules." 73 Russia's use of
asymmetric warfare is not interpreted as a rational response to material
or strategic constraints, but is blamed for being deceptive. The
significance of these critiques is that Russia is accused of not acting
in a manner acceptable to the West. Russia's hybrid war is understood as
breaking the rules and as Martin Zapfe argues, Russia "seems to have
rejected the established Western playbook." 74 **[It is the "strategic
culture" of Russia which is seen to be at fault in rejecting Western
ways of war.75 These [portrayals of a Russian East]{.mark} as enigmatic
and dangerous, [diverging from Western norms]{.mark} shows an
[orientalist]{.mark} perspective.]{.underline}**76 Looking to Sun Tzu in
order to understand contemporary military strategy can be illuminating.
But what makes these perspectives problematic is the way Russia is
viewed as acting in a way that the West would never contemplate. For
example, Russia is accused of being uniquely better suited to hybrid
warfare because of Putin's "central guiding authority." 77 This ignores
that the concept of hybrid warfare originated with the US78 and Western
uses of deception, covert tactics or proxy fighters becomes essentially
ignored. Rod Thornton argues further that, "the basic problem across the
board is that liberal democracies have an inherent distaste for
producing anything at the strategic level that resembles propaganda or
could be classed as psychological warfare." 79 **[The long US history of
propaganda and covert war in both the Cold War and the War on Terror is
therefore negated and exempt from consideration.]{.underline}** As Rory
Cormac and Richard Aldrich have argued, **[much of IR, "offers a
simplistic view of secrecy" and Western covert action by taking
"plausible deniability at face value."]{.underline}** 80 Attempts to
critically analyze Russia's use of asymmetric warfare have therefore
failed to fully engage with the West's own use of covert warfare.
**[[Russia]{.mark}'s actions are]{.underline}** no doubt **[[threatening
to the West]{.mark} and are problematic in raising tensions. But [in
adapting an orientalist perspective, Western discourse surrounding
Russia has limited our understandings of these conflicts.]{.mark} The US
and its allies routinely use covert action as part of the War on Terror
but Western war is still seen as fundamentally different to Russia's
Eastern way of warfare.]{.underline}** As Jonathan Caverley argues,
Russia has 4,000 troops involved in the Syrian "war," while the US has
had 10,000 personnel involved in Afghanistan 19 years after the invasion
and yet, this is not considered as a "war." 81 It is described as a NATO
support mission. Debates over the nuance of these definitions are not
meant to confuse our understandings of war, but can help to illustrate
our presuppositions. As this section has shown, Russia's actions in
Ukraine, Syria and Georgia have often been understood through cultural
explanations. There is a risk, however, of such cultural explanations
slipping into an essentialist and "ahistorical myth." 82 Conflicts are
not just about physical security, but raise existential questions in
relation to the self and the other. Narratives of conflict can also lead
to the reproduction of conflict as ontological security for one group
can lead to insecurity for another.83 The following section will
therefore examine how cultural explanations have led to an othering of
Russia as separate and distinct from an American led Western liberal
order. Western identity: Europe, Russia and orientalism Russia's
annexation of Crimea and intervention in Syria have considerably raised
tensions and security concerns for Europe and the Atlantic alliance.
Russia's belligerence toward the West also continues to pose a security
threat. Russia's aggressiveness challenges not just the Western
understanding of European security, but challenges Western ideas of
identity. As the following explores, in resorting to the use of force
and in challenging Western powers, Russia has created self-doubt in
Western narratives and the ontology of Western ideas about political
order. At the end of the Cold War, Russia and Europe sought to find new
ground for cooperation after decades of mutual distrust. The West sought
to consider the place of Russia within European society and political
order; and debate centered on the question of "is Russia a European
Power?" 84 In 1999, the European Union's common strategy toward Russia
made use of conciliatory language that emphasized the shared cultural
and ideational values between the two sides. The strategy declared that
"the European Union welcomes Russia's return to its rightful place in
the European family in a spirit of friendship, cooperation, fair
accommodation of interests and on the foundations of shared values
enshrined in the common heritage of European civilization." 85 Richard
Rosecrance captured the zeitgeist of the optimism when he argued that
"developed states are putting aside military, political and territorial
ambitions as they struggle not for cultural dominance but a greater
share of world output." 86 As Zbigniew Brzezinski also argued, Russia
had the opportunity to "join" into this "democratic community of
nations." 87 For liberal internationalist thinkers, the expansion of
Europe had a "desecuritizing effect," 88 which would inevitably expand
to one day include Russia. Such liberal internationalist arguments
believed in globalization as a homogenizing process. The expansion of
the European Union was represented as a distinctly European model of
progress, which rested on benign conduct, open borders, economic
interdependence and the rejection of military force. Liberal
internationalist scholars therefore see contemporary Russia as rejecting
this "distinctly European model of international conduct." 89 The
expansion of the EU as a civilian power was largely interpreted as
devoid of geopolitical or security significance. John Mearsheimer has
been one of the most vocal critics of these "liberal delusions" and
argues the West is to blame for provoking the Ukraine crisis.90 With the
return of tensions between NATO and Russia, critics now lament "Europe's
Shattered Dream of Order." 91 Such optimism always presumed that a
Russian democracy would ultimately show "acquiescence to American
foreign policy preferences." 92 The revival of tensions therefore
challenges this narrative. As Neumann argues, the post-Cold War era
believed in an idea of Russia "as a learner" of Western ideas.93
Implying that Russia would inevitably become more like the West.
Zbigniew Brzezinski argued that the "only path" was for "Russia, like
Ukraine," to "become a real democracy." 94 The former American
ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul asked "who lost Russia?" 95 Such a
question implied Russia is essentially a bad student that has not
learned the lessons of Western modernization and has become lost on the
path to Western modernity. The climate between Russia and the West has
now radically changed from the optimism of the immediate post-Cold War
era. Observers now conclude that the Euro-Atlantic community and Russia
seem to "live in different worlds." 96 Russia's development has not
followed the lines of **[Western liberal democracy and Russia's
willingness to use military force has created a stream of self-doubt and
questioning over Western narratives. [Russia]{.mark}'s use of force in
Georgia, Ukraine and Syria has [challenged Western narratives]{.mark}
and understandings of international order. This can be seen with the way
that the conflict in Syria raised many [difficult choices for]{.mark}
the [NATO]{.mark} alliance [in regards to]{.mark} ideational norms of
human [security]{.mark} and the responsibility to
protect.]{.underline}** President Obama called the use of chemical
weapons within Syria a "game-changer" and warned this would be a "red
line" that the US could not accept.97 But while the US refrained from a
full scale intervention, Western powers intervened through air strikes,
covert means and the sponsorship of local armed groups. As the
philosopher John Gray observes, for Western leaders ISIS could only be
destroyed if Syria was "reconstituted as a democratic polity under the
rule of "moderate forces." 98 Russia's intervention in support of Assad
changed the tide of the conflict and challenged Western ideas about
liberalism and order. Russia's "obstruction" of Western intervention99
has been interpreted as part of a "crisis" in the lack of American
leadership.100 Former Vice President Joe Biden called to "defend the
liberal international order" and he argued that resistance to liberal
internationalism and a desire for a return of spheres of interest was a
movement that "is principally led by Russia." 101 The Western liberal
international order is challenged by many structural and systemic
problems, but the resurgence of concerns surrounding Russia has created
a renewed sense of insecurity. This has led to an outpouring of
"nostalgia" 102 and questioning of are we now seeing "The End of Liberal
International Order?" 103 Hal Brands argues that the divisions between
Russia and the West are not just clashes over geopolitical influence,
but are about fundamentally different conceptions of "governance,
political values, even morality." 104 He further argues that the US
should engage in this ideological competition to defend a liberal order.
The vision of a liberal international order assumes a relative
homogeneity of the West that does not reflect reality. It also creates a
cultural divide between those considered seen as part of the "West" and
those considered as outside this order. **[Russia's failure to acquiesce
toward the policies of a self-identifying liberal democratic order are
therefore increasingly seen in civilizational terms in which Russian
culture has rejected the West. The [NATO]{.mark} alliance has [reacted
to tensions with Russia through]{.mark} a crisis of [ontological
insecurity]{.mark}, which has sought an "attempted restoration of a
known normative order for the North Atlantic alliance."]{.underline}**
105 **[This has involved shoring up alliance commitments and
[reestablishing NATO's ability to deter]{.mark} Russian power. For many
Western observers, Russia's intervention in Georgia was a precedent that
would encourage Russian aggression against post-Soviet and new NATO
states.]{.underline}**106 The annexation of Crimea and the use of hybrid
war was also seen as a particular threat to the Baltic states.
**[Analysts expected a "domino" like repetition of hybrid war being used
in the Baltics]{.underline}**107 **[and this allowed NATO to reinforce a
narrative of an Atlantic alliance built on Western liberal democratic
norms.]{.underline}** The significance of these developments are
reflected in the way that Russia and the NATO alliance are now seen as
radically different identities. This paper has so far argued that the
**[[West]{.mark} has sought to [otherize Russia]{.mark} through
endorsing a distinction between the liberal democratic West and a
non-Western "spoiler"]{.underline}** 108 **[which seeks to defy liberal
Western norms, as defined by Russia. Typologies of oriental and Western
act to categorize distinctions and shape identities.]{.underline}** As
Said argues, "the result is usually to polarize the distinction- the
**[oriental becomes more oriental, the Westerner more
Western."]{.underline}** 109 **[As the following section explores,
[Russia]{.mark} has equally [sought to shape an identity]{.mark} that is
[distinct]{.mark} and different [from]{.mark} the "Western" identity of
the US and its [NATO]{.mark} partners.]{.underline}**

**[[Russia has historically possessed a unique and ambivalent identity
located between the East and West]{.underline}]{.mark}**, having been
invaded by both European and Asian empires in previous centuries. Said
included Russia in Orientalism in his analysis of European countries and
their attitude toward the East, but did not note that **[[Russia is in
many respects the Orient within the Occident]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as
more than 75% of its territory as the largest nation in the world is
actually located in Asia while three quarters of its population live on
the European side. **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** may be partly
European, but it [**[is certainly not Western]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
Then again, Europe is not a continent unto itself but geographically
connected to Asia with the arbitrary division between them based on
cultural differences, not landmass, where Russia is an intermediate.
Expansionism under Peter the Great may have brought Western European
'cultural values' and modernization to Russia, but the majority of its
territory itself remains in Asia.

Even after the presumed end of the Cold War, **[[Russia has been
excluded from the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion and instead [joined
the]{.mark} Shanghai Cooperation Organization]{.underline}**
([SCO]{.mark}), while developing strong ties with China. As recently
disclosed documents from the National Security Archive prove, **[[NATO
has broken its promise]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** Mikhail Gorbachev during the George H.W.
Bush administration that [it **[not expand]{.underline}**]{.mark}
eastward following Germany's enrollment. It has since added 13 countries
since 1999, 10 of which were former Warsaw Pact states. **[[Russia's
alliance with]{.mark} [China]{.mark} [has been solidified precisely
because it is still not treated in the same regard]{.mark} as other
European nations]{.underline}** even after the adoption of a private
sector economy. In order to justify its continued armament and avoid
obsolescence**[, [NATO has manufactured an adversarial]{.mark}
[relationship with Moscow.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Contrary to the widespread perception of his rhetoric, in terms of
policy-making President Trump has been equally as hostile to Moscow as
his predecessors, if not more so in light of the U.S. withdrawal from
the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). What the usual
suspects behind the attempted soft-coup against him fail to understand
is that Trump's tact toward Putin is more likely an inverted version of
the 'only Nixon could go to China' strategy, an unexpected style of
diplomacy based on the pragmatic objective of containing Beijing by
dividing America's two primary foes. The liberals still in denial about
their election defeat continue to underestimate Trump, but the Chinese
are not fooled. The architect behind Nixon's détente with Mao, Henry
Kissinger, is even believed to have encouraged Trump to ease tensions
with Moscow in order to quarantine China and don't think they haven't
noticed. Ultimately, the divide between Trump and his enemies in the
establishment is really a disagreement over strategy in how to surround
China and prevent the inevitable downfall of the U.S. empire.

**[[The ongoing demonization of Moscow is ultimately about China as
well]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It was only a matter of time until the
uncertain allegations of election interference were also leveled against
Beijing without proof as a Joint Statement from the U.S. intelligence
agencies recently showed. Make no mistake --- **[[underneath the West's
Russophobia lies Sinophobia]{.underline}]{.mark}** and as Washington's
real geopolitical challenger, **[[China will]{.mark} in due course
[emerge]{.mark} [as]{.mark} [the preferred
bogeyman]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The bipartisan hawkishness has created
an environment where rapprochement and diplomacy of any kind is seen as
weakness and even a sign of treason, making the prospect of peace
seemingly impossible. As **[[China continues to grow,]{.mark} it will
[find itself more squarely in the crosshairs of
imperialism]{.mark},]{.underline}** regardless of whether Trump's
strategy to renew relations with Moscow against Beijing is successful.
Until then cooler heads at the highest levels of government must prevail
as they thankfully did at the height of the first Cold War for the sake
of peace between Russia, the U.S. and the entire world.

### Russia-China alliance

#### Their fears of a Russian-Chinese alliance are rooted in fears of cultural differences from Western identity, thus imposing westernism upon the rest of the world and increasing military tensions, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy

**[[Russia's ontological security rests on
promoting]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[cultural [differences to the

increasingly **[[looking]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the **[[East.
Tensions]{.mark} with the West have]{.underline}** also **[[pushed
Russia]{.mark} into a [closer]{.mark} alignment [with]{.mark} the
leadership of [China]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Joint military drills in
2018 have shown that, for Russia, the East provides challenges and
opportunities.119 Systemic theories of the balance of power might expect
Russia to join with the US in order to contain China.120 This has not
happened as systemic theorists would perhaps predict and instead,
**[[Russia]{.mark} is [increasing]{.mark} its promotion of a Eurasian
cultural [identity]{.mark} that is [separate from the

alone are not enough to explain the current tensions between Russia and
the NATO partners, **[[Russia's ontological security]{.mark} has become
[tied to]{.mark} the promotion of a [discourse]{.mark} in which,
cultural and civilizational differences are repeatedly [emphasized.

by]{.mark} the [securitization of Russia]{.mark}'s cultural identity and
"national memory."]{.underline}** 121 Sergey Lavrov has argued that
Russia's place as a Eurasian power can be traced to its history under
the Golden Horde in which the Rus "bent but did not break." He further
argued that the Mongol invasions of Russia "facilitated the emergence of
a new Russian ethnos." 122 Lavrov links this period of Russian history
to its contemporary importance in "asserting the independent role of the
Russian state in Eurasia." **[For Russia, [advocating]{.mark} a distinct
[non-Western identity]{.mark} is a way to [secure]{.mark} itself
[against perceived Western interference]{.mark}. But these patterns of
behavior also help to further and [deepen]{.mark} the security and
political [divides between NATO and Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
ontological insecurity of the West is therefore built on the West
constituting itself against Russia and vice versa, thereby, reproducing
"mutual insecurities" and reinstating "historical animosities" instead
of alleviating them.**[123 Viewing the security challenges of Russia and
NATO through the divides of distinct and separate civilizations helps to
securitize cultural identities and [increase military
tension.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Russian Hybrid Warfare

#### The 1AC's over-exaggeration of Russian hybrid warfare furthers an orientalist myth of the Russian threat that restricts our understanding of the Ukraine conflict and turns the case by perpetuating conflict.

[The fighting in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea has been
interpreted as a "frontal challenge to the post-Cold War European
regional order."]{.underline}57 Russia's actions created surprise and
shock for analysts and policy makers alike, but there have been few
serious investigations into Russia's strategic decisions. [Instead,
[Western]{.mark} public [discourse]{.mark} has [follow]{.mark}ed an
**[orientalist trend in blaming]{.mark} an [irrational
leadership]{.mark}** and its Eastern culture. The use of force by Russia
is also seen as uniquely linked to Putin's leadership. The
[Ukraine]{.mark} and Georgia crisis [is blamed on **Putin's "unique
response**]{.mark}**"58 and Putin's "choice**."59 [There s]{.mark}eems
little attempt to explore either the workings of the Russian leadership
or to [consider]{.mark} in more detail [why Russia chose to
intervene.]{.mark} Instead, there is a tendency to embrace **simplistic
arguments blaming Putin's** "unconstrained, erratic
adventurism."]{.underline}60 Western analysts argue Putin's "surprise
policy decisions," and his "rashness," "have astounded even expert
analysis."61 What is significant about the attempts to blame solely
Putin is that he is seen as uniquely responsible. Putin as the sole
figure involved is then portrayed as an "ideologue"62 and as a
"gambler."63 His actions are not seen as the rational choice of a leader
responding to a realpolitik environment. [However, counter arguments
have been made which show [Russia's hybrid war]{.mark} in Ukraine [was
**not an irrational**]{.mark} **opportunistic [gamble]{.mark}**[, but an
attempt to coerce Kiev into negotiations]{.mark}.64 But while such
[alternative explanations]{.mark} have been discussed in academic
publications they [have not been widely covered]{.mark} with[in]{.mark}
[the West]{.mark}ern media.]{.underline} [The [Ukraine]{.mark} crisis
[has]{.mark}, however, [been]{.mark} widely [covered]{.mark} in the
media [for]{.mark} its use of [hybrid warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
surprise and confusion these events created within [[Western]{.mark}
political [commentary was **intertwined**]{.mark} **with an [orientalist
perspective]{.mark}** that sought to highlight Russia's cultural
differences to the West. [Hybrid warfare has]{.mark} been
[described]{.mark} as [a]{.mark} [conflict between "East and
West]{.mark}."65 What is significant in this portrayal is that
**[Russia's hybrid warfare]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} then [viewed in
omnipotent terms which **exaggerates Russia's power and**]{.mark}
**ability**.]{.underline}66 Western observers have long demonized
Eastern tactics in war as irrational, deceptive and underhanded.67 [In
describing Russia's actions, [West]{.mark}ern analysts repeat this
formula by [accus]{.mark}ing [Russia of]{.mark} using "**[shadowy
tactics]{.mark}**"68 of being "sneaky"69 [and]{.mark} using tactics
based on "**[deceit]{.mark}**."70 [Hybrid warfare is]{.mark} further
[interpreted with reference to]{.mark} the Ancient Chinese strategist
[Sun Tzu]{.mark}.71 The reputation of Sun Tzu as an Eastern general
willing to use deception [and]{.mark} secrecy to win battles [is]{.mark}
then [compared to Russia's]{.mark} own [use of **asymmetric
warfare**]{.mark}.]{.underline}72 But crucially, this historical analogy
devolves further into an orientalist perspective when Russia is accused
of being, not just a "sneaky" Easterner, but by not playing by "the
rules."73 [[Russia's use of asymmetric warfare is not interpreted
as]{.mark} a [rational]{.mark} response to material or strategic
constraints, [but is blamed for being]{.mark} deceptive.]{.underline}
[The significance of these critiques is that Russia is accused of
[not]{.mark} acting in a manner [acceptable to the West]{.mark}.
Russia's hybrid war is understood as breaking the rules and as Martin
Zapfe argues, Russia "seems to have rejected the established Western
playbook."]{.underline}74 It is the "strategic culture" of Russia which
is seen to be at fault in rejecting Western ways of war.75 [These
[portrayals of]{.mark} a **[Russia]{.mark}n East [as enigmatic]{.mark}
and dangerous**, diverging from Western norms [show]{.mark}s [an
orientalist perspective]{.mark}.76 Looking to Sun Tzu in order to
understand contemporary military strategy can be
illuminating.]{.underline} But what makes these perspectives problematic
is the way Russia is viewed as acting in a way that the West would never
contemplate. [For example, [Russia is accused of being]{.mark}
**uniquely [better suited to hybrid warfare]{.mark}** because of Putin's
"central guiding authority.]{.underline}"77 [[This ignores that]{.mark}
the concept of [hybrid]{.mark} [warfare **originated with the
US**]{.mark}78 and Western uses of deception, covert tactics or proxy
fighters becomes essentially ignored. Rod Thornton argues further that,
"the basic problem across the board is that liberal democracies have an
inherent distaste for producing anything at the strategic level that
resembles propaganda or could be classed as psychological warfare."79
The long US history of propaganda and covert war in both the Cold War
and the War on Terror is therefore negated and exempt from
consideration.]{.underline} As Rory Cormac and Richard Aldrich have
argued, much of IR, "offers a simplistic view of secrecy" and Western
covert action by taking "plausible deniability at face value."80
Attempts to critically analyze Russia's use of asymmetric warfare have
therefore failed to fully engage with the West's own use of covert
warfare. Russia's actions are no doubt threatening to the West and are
problematic in raising tensions. [But [in adapting an orientalist
perspective, Western discourse]{.mark} surrounding Russia has
**[limit]{.mark}ed [our understanding]{.mark}s** [of]{.mark} these
[conflict]{.mark}s. The US and its allies routinely use covert action as
part of the [War on Terror]{.mark} but Western war [is]{.mark} still
[seen as]{.mark} fundamentally [different to Russia's]{.mark} Eastern
[way of warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Jonathan Caverley argues,
[Russia has 4,000 troops involved in the Syrian "war," while the US has
had 10,000 personnel involved in Afghanistan 19 years after the invasion
and yet, this is not considered as a "war."81 It is described as a
**NATO** support mission]{.underline}. Debates over the nuance of these
definitions are not meant to confuse our understandings of war, but can
help to illustrate our presuppositions. As this sec[tion has shown,
[Russia's actions in Ukraine]{.mark}, Syria and Georgia [have]{.mark}
often [been understood through]{.mark} cultural explanations. There is a
risk, however, of such cultural explanations slipping into an
[**essentialist and "ahistorical myth**.]{.mark}"82 Conflicts are not
just about physical security, but raise existential questions in
relation to the self and the other. **[Narratives of conflict]{.mark}**
can also [lead to]{.mark} the **[reproduction of conflict]{.mark}** as
ontological security for one group can lead to insecurity for
another.]{.underline}83 The following section will therefore examine how
cultural explanations have led to an othering of Russia as separate and
distinct from an American led Western liberal order.

### Russia-Ukraine

#### **The objectification of Ukraine as a "chess piece" in a game between the West and Russia plays into orientalist and colonialist thinking.** 

**Belafatti 14** (Fabio Belafatti, \"Orientalism reanimated: colonial
thinking in Western analysts' comments on Ukraine\", Euromaidan Press,
https://euromaidanpress.com/2014/10/27/western-commentators-should-rid-themselves-of-old-prejudices-dating-back-from-the-age-of-colonialism-before-commenting-on-eastern-european-affairs/,

Like all historical interpretations, Russia's reading of Ukraine's
history is based on a selection of facts and meanings that acquired a
precise function due to specific political priorities. **[Nobody should
be able to seriously argue that Crimea/Donbas/Ukraine/\[...\] should be
Russian because Russia sees it as part of its history]{.underline}**: in
order to do so, one has to first give for granted that Russia's
interpretation of history is for some reason intrinsically superior to
any other, which is of course nonsense. But that's not the end of it.
For pro-Russian commentators, the fact that Crimea was non-Russian for
thousands of years doesn't matter. What matters is that it was Russian
for less than two centuries -- which is nothing in historical
perspective. The Russian vision and experience of this territory-object
is automatically seen as more important, more "noble," and therefore
more significant than millennia of non-Russian history of the region.
The tragedies of other peoples -- which, incidentally, greatly
contributed to making this region more "Russian" -- become completely
irrelevant. All the rest, all the non-Russian peoples, occupy that
massive "neutral" space between Russia and "the West." **[All of [these
nations are]{.mark} of course [the result of a]{.mark} construction of
[historical]{.mark} [experience]{.mark}s and traditions.]{.underline}**
But this is exactly the point: **[these identities are as "artificial"
as the Russian one. And [there is no reason to]{.mark} believe that the
Russian identity should be [regard]{.mark}ed [as]{.mark} being on [a
different level]{.mark}]{.underline}**, ordained with some sort of
a-historical nobility. We (Western and Eastern Europeans alike) all come
from a process of creation of identity, and **[so does Russia: [its
perceptions]{.mark}, feelings and understanding of history [didn't
descend]{.mark} from heaven: [they]{.mark}
[developed]{.mark}]{.underline}** (or, more precisely, they were
developed) **[[as a result of]{.mark} precise [events]{.mark},
strategies [and agendas.]{.mark}]{.underline}** They don't deserve more
respect than any other. Unfortunately, **[pro-Russians bestow on them
nobility that they deny to any contending interpretation.]{.underline}**
The result is the nonchalant, "orientalist" use of the idea of "spheres
of influence," a concept that they would correctly reject in any other
case. Ignoring "the rest": old habits die hard **[[The practice of
denying]{.mark} the [dignity]{.mark} of active subjects of non-Russian
peoples of Eastern Europe [is a long story.]{.mark} We Western Europeans
regularly accept the idea that this part of the World falls within
Russia's "sphere"]{.underline}** or should just be Russian. **[[This
generates]{.mark} appalling [ideas that]{.mark} Russia is right in
interfering in Ukraine because it already "had to give up" the Baltic
States in the past and ["the West"]{.mark} really shouldn't "deprive" it
of other countries]{.underline}**, or that Ukraine is too important for
Russian national identity because of the Kyivan Rus, **[as if this was
enough to ignore the desires of the millions of people who had (and
have) to suffer to allow Russia to freely define its
identity.]{.underline}** For far too many Western experts what really
matters is the Russian feelings. **[[Everything
else]{.underline}]{.mark}**, what Ukrainians, Poles, Moldovans, Balts,
Georgians, Armenians may think, **[[is]{.mark} much [less]{.mark}
significant,]{.underline}** **[because it's just the feeling of
"others," subaltern subjects, unworthy of the dignity of actors, at best
reacting victims of an orientalist interpretation of history that
Westerners apply far too often to their Eastern European
neighbors.]{.underline}** The disproportionate attention for Russia's
feelings, the solidarity for the Russian "tragedy" of losing its empire
and the insensitivity to other peoples' priorities become possible only
if one places the Russian nation in a hierarchically superior position,
applying the orientalist misconception that only a former power can have
the dignity of an actor. **[European [colonialists saw the East as
a]{.mark} mere [object]{.mark} they could play with.]{.underline}**
Pro-Russian commentators **[see Eastern Europe in the same
way]{.underline}**: Russia can do as it pleases, for this is seen as
part of the natural geopolitical order. Eastern Europe as a dummy:
incapable of action? Pro-Russian commentators' orientalist thinking
emerges in the way they portray Ukraine as a country incapable of action
on its own initiative. They invariably see Eastern European countries as
objects manipulated by the West. This follows what was described above:
**[[if Russia is]{.mark} seen as [the only state worth]{.mark} of the
[dignity]{.mark} of "actor" and Eastern Europe as a passive,
hierarchically subordinated object, [it's]{.mark} then [inevitable
that]{.mark} any [independent a]{.mark}ction by any Eastern European
state [must be the result of]{.mark} a Wes[tern
interference]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Unsurprisingly, **[pro-Russian
commentators almost never speak in terms of "access of Eastern Europe
into NATO," but of "NATO/EU expansion in Eastern Europe." The "East" is
seen as a land of conquest]{.underline}** -- by nature subordinated to
Russia -- in which "the West" engages in dangerous games against its
"legitimate" owner. **[Local actors are insignificant]{.underline}**:
their role in the whole NATO/EU enlargement process is ignored.
**[Former communist countries are seen as victims of an inclusion in
Western security structures carried out against their will. [This
is]{.mark} of course [nonsense]{.mark}: the integration of Eastern
Europe in Euro-Atlantic security structures happened in two directions,
with a very intense activity from Eastern]{.underline}** actors that
Western actors have often found far too pressing. In pro-Russian
analyses, though, nothing of this appears: **[[Eastern European states
are denied]{.mark} the [dignity]{.mark} of actors in the process and the
very idea that tens of millions of people in the region may have wanted
at many points in history to change their alignment is ruled out
completely. This is not just post-Soviet nostalgic thinking: [it's
outright racism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** If Eastern Europe looks west,
**[this must be due to "Western interferences," "pressures," "NGOs" or
whatever scapegoat pro-Russians can come up with to make sense of
Russia's failures. There must be something "Western" in action that
"destabilizes the Eurasian space";]{.underline}** they refuse to accept
that there may be genuine local interests among Eastern European peoples
to realign their own countries and that, if anything, it's actually
Russia who should be held responsible for destabilizing the region with
its opposition to the desires of its former imperial subjects. It **[may
be interesting for pundits who talks about "the West destabilizing
Eastern Europe"]{.underline}** to think from this perspective for a
second and see if their position still holds. Eastern Europeans as
marionettes: are we not being racist? **[[This orientalist
approach]{.mark} leads to [deny the sincerity of]{.mark} any
[pro-Western protest]{.mark} in Eastern Europe.]{.underline}** No one
with a bit of knowledge of Eastern Europe could seriously think that
Brussels or Washington may really mobilize millions of people in
countries such as Ukraine. **[No matters how much support there can be
from "outside," it's internal factors that at the end of the day
mobilize people, especially when there's a risk of getting
killed]{.underline}**. It's absurd to think that someone would risk
getting shot just because a bureaucrat in Brussel told him to do so.
**[It is therefore racist to think that nobody east of the EU may want
an order of things in which Russia doesn't dominate, as if we
"Westerners" were the only ones worth of, or capable of fighting for,
things like rule of law, human rights and so on.]{.underline}** These
beliefs play a reassuring role for Russia itself: better to pretend that
Eastern Europe's inclusion in NATO/EU results from an anti-Russian
conspiracy rather than recognizing the failure of one's own model and
the fact that, simply put, numerous countries in Europe still fear
Russia's intentions. Why we should get rid of "Orientalism" **[[The main
victim]{.mark} of these stereotypes [is our ability to]{.mark} correctly
[understand Eastern Europe.]{.mark} Western influences cannot be
ignored, but it is deeply wrong to see the Ukrainian pro-democracy
movement as a detour from a supposedly "natural," inevitable order of
things]{.underline}** in which we don't even consider Ukrainians as
worth of dignity of active subjects and nation. **[The risk is to
[lose]{.mark} the [ability to understand]{.mark} the role of local
actors, [their choices and]{.mark} their [feelings]{.mark}. It's
fascinating to focus only on great powers' strategies, seeing Eastern
Europe as a chessboard over which two players face each
other.]{.underline}** However, no matter how enjoyable grand strategies
may be for pundits and general public alike, **[[Eastern Europe is not a
football pitch]{.mark} and we as Westerners should seriously stop
looking down at the small nations of Eastern Europe as a bunch of
subaltern realities,]{.underline}** while seeing Russia as the only
nation worth of consideration and dignity. Ridding ourselves of these
misconceptions should be the first, compulsory step for anyone who wants
to comment on Eastern European affairs. \[1\]Coming from a different
starting point, Anton Shekhovtsov has briefly argued along similar lines
in a very good article published while this contribution was undergoing
final revision. I am grateful to him for raising the topic and I hope my
contribution will add more to the debate. \[2\]To get an idea of how
absurdly simplistic and misleading this concept is, I suggest reading
the chapter about Ukraine in Timothy Snyder's The Reconstruction of
Nations.

### Security

#### Surveillance is a form of [power relations]{.underline} that allows Western domination over the Orient---it functions as a mode of representations that [legitimize violence]{.underline} 

**Anand 07**---Reader, IR, U Westminster. PhD, politics, Bristol
(Dibyesh, Western Colonial Representations of the Other,
http://staff.bath.ac.uk/ecsda/DAnandNPSArticleMar07.pdf,)//AN

Note -- epiphenomenal = a secondary question/phenomenon

Within the context of European imperialism, the issue of the
representation of natives was often considered as belonging to the realm
of scientific objective ethnography, journalistic commentaries, or
fiction.2 A clear boundary was said to exist between fiction and
non-fiction writing. It was presumed that, unlike fiction, non-fiction
writing such as literary and popular journalism, exploration and travel
writings, memoirs of colonial officials, and so on is unmediated by the
consciously aesthetic requirements of imaginative literature.3 Emphasis
was on the recording of observed facts. However, as argued by scholars
from fields as diverse as postcolonial studies,4 anthropology,5 and
international relations,6 such views are no longer tenable. Starting
with Said,7 the enterprise of [postcolonial theory has unpacked the
notion of neutral academic expertise and highlighted how
[Western]{.mark} knowledge and **[representations of the non-Western
world]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} neither innocent nor based on some
pre-existing "reality," but **[implicated in the West's will to
power]{.mark}**, and its imperial adventures]{.underline}. The image of
a scientific, apolitical, disinterested, knowledge-seeking "gentleman"
braving all odds to study non-Western cultures has been revealed as
hollow. For instance, Colin Mackenzie, the first surveyor general of
Madras in India, was clear about his necessary complicity in the brute
realities of colonial power. He conflated the role of the soldier and
the scientist and wrote: That science may derive assistance, and
knowledge be diffused, in the leisure moments of \[military\] camps and
voyages, is no new discovery; but . . . I am also desirous of proving
that, in the vacant moments of an Indian sojourn and campaign in
particular . . . such collected observations may be found useful, at
least in directing the observation of those more highly gifted to
matters of utility, if not to record facts of importance to philosophy
and science.8 The [mask of objectivity in the colonial discourse hid
relations of inequality and domination]{.underline}. Fiction as well as
non-fiction writings were permeated with various strategies of
representation. These were not epiphenomenal but central to the ways in
which the Other was sought to be known. What Rana Kabbani points out
about travel writing holds true for non-fictional writings in general:
during imperialism, it ultimately produced "a communal image of the
East," which "sustained a political structure and was sustained by it."9
Various [forms of representing the non-West]{.underline}---visual
(films, television, photographs, paintings, advertisements, and so on)
as well as textual (such as fiction, travelogue, journalism,
ethnography, and anthropology)---**[were closely linked to the
production of imperial encounters.]{.underline}** Asymmetry of
productive power is a common trait shared by these encounters. The
contemporary neocolonial world too "bears witness to the unequal and
uneven forces of cultural representation involved in the contest for
political and social within the modern world order."10 It is not only
the represented (here the colonized, the third world, the South) who are
subjects of and subjected to the process; even the representer (the
colonizer, the first world, the West) is constructed by representational
practices. This in no way implies similar experiences for the colonizer
and the colonized (the representer and the represented). It only
indicates that **[[though everyone is subjected to representational
practices]{.mark}, the [impact differs according to]{.mark} the existing
[power relations.]{.mark}]{.underline}** To illustrate this point, while
both the West and Tibetans are subjects of Exotica Tibet, and the latter
are not mere victims but exercise their agency through creative
negotiations, [the West does not have to construct its identity
according to the perception of Tibetans. Westerners exoticize Tibet, and
in turn, Tibetans exoticize the West.]{.underline} But [while Western
exoticization has a defining productive impact on Tibetan identity
discourse,11 the same cannot be said of Tibetan exoticization of the
West. This reflects the asymmetry in their power relations]{.underline}.
A concentration on Western representations does not deny the fact that
representational practices were prevalent in non-Western societies too.
In fact, historically, **[all cultures and civilizations have had their
own particular representational practices for perceiving those they
considered as Other]{.underline}**. [But]{.underline}--- and this is a
crucial qualification---[it was only with modern European imperialism
that the capacity to convert these representations into truth on a
systematic and mass scale emerged]{.underline}. What makes such
representational practices distinctly modern is their productive
capacity. Production of knowledge about the Other through
representations goes hand in hand with the construction, articulation,
and affirmation of differences between the Self and Other, which in turn
feeds into the identity politics amongst the representer as well as the
represented. Essentializing and Stereotyping the Other The [practices of
essentializing and stereotyping the Other underlie different strategies
of Western representations.]{.underline} Essentialism is the notion that
some core meaning or identity is determinate and not subject to
interpretation. Ronald Inden writes that essentialist ways of seeing
tend to ignore the "intricacies of agency" pertinent to the flux and
development of any social system.12 In colonial context, we find
essentialism in the reduction of the indigenous people to an "essential"
idea of what it means to be "native"---say, Africans as
singing--dancing--fighting, Chinese as duplicitous, Arabs as cruel and
oppressors of women, Tibetans as religious, and so on. Imperialism drew
its strength from representations of natives as quintessentially lazy,
ignorant, deceitful, passive, incapable of self-governing, and the
native rulers as corrupt and despotic. Therefore, it should come as no
surprise that the British officials involved during the 1903--1904
invasion of Tibet saw it as something welcomed by "ordinary" Tibetans
seeking deliverance from their Chinese and monastic overlords. Captain
Cecil Rawling in a military report in 1905 wrote: "It seems to be the
general wish of the inhabitants of that country (Tibet) that they should
come under British administration."13 Curiously, Alistair Lamb's own
assessment that "when dealing with the primitive peoples of Central
Asia, the problem often was not how to expand one's power but how to
prevent its indefinite expansion"14 too puts the onus of responsibility
for imperial expansion on the victims themselves[. [This is made
possible by]{.underline}]{.mark} [their essentialist representations as
requiring **[paternal imperialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}---a mix of iron
fist and velvet glove. A stereotype is a one-sided description of a
group/culture resulting from the collapsing of complex differences into
a simple "cardboard cut-out," seeing people as pre-set image and "more
of a formula than a human being."15 [It reduces people to a few simple
characteristics, which are then represented as fixed by nature.
"Stereotyping reduces, essentialises, naturalises and fixes
'difference]{.underline}.'"16 **[[Stereotypes function as a marker
between]{.mark} norm and deviancy, between ["us" and
"them."]{.mark}]{.underline}** As Said argues, [stereotypical [images of
the Orient]{.mark}'s separateness]{.underline}---"its eccentricity, its
backwardness, its silent indifference, its feminine penetrability, its
supine malleability"---[[have been part of Western]{.mark} discursive
[practices]{.mark} for a long time.]{.underline}17 Stereotyping
flourished to justify imperialism as a civilizing mission---the
restless, honest, active, exploratory, masculine, enlightened, modern
spirit of the "white man" stood in contrast to the laziness, deceit,
passivity, fatalism, femininity, backwardness, and traditional
spiritlessness of the natives. For example, Captain John Noel's films
Climbing Mount Everest (1922) and The Epic of Everest (1924) developed
the "contrast between the extroverted, aggressive, and manly British
climbers with the introverted, passive, and squalid but mystical
Tibetans."18 Stereotyping is a simplification not because it is a false
representation of a given reality but because it is an arrested, fixated
form of representation that denies the play of difference. Let me
illustrate this with an example from the story of the first two men to
reach Mount Everest---Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary. Reaching the
summit, Tenzing Norgay says he felt the warm presence of the mountain,
buried an offering to the gods, and said in prayer: "I am grateful,
Chomolungma"; Hillary took photographs to survey the area, urinated on
the summit, and later told one of the other climbers, George Lowe:
"Well, George, we knocked the bastard off."19 This difference in
attitude may be due to cultural factors. But to interpret humility as
passivity and fix the identity of Tenzing Norgay (read as representative
of sherpas and other natives) as essentially passive in contrast to
adventurous, scientific Hillary (read as white man) leads to a reified
and fixated form of representation (excluding those who do not "fit" in
the image). Stereotyping is not about expressing cultural difference,
but fixing it in a pre-given socio-cultural milieu with extreme power
differentials. [Stereotyping served imperialism at both representational
and psychic levels---supporting the idea of paternal domination and
acting as a kind of perceptual blinder protecting the colonizers from
discomforting consciousness of either poverty or guilt]{.underline}.20
It allowed the participants in the massacre of Tibetans at Guru (March
31, 1904) that took place during the British invasion of Tibet to blame
it on the "crass stupidity and childishness of the Tibetan general,"21
malevolent monks, superstitious Tibetan soldiers---everyone except
themselves. We must liberate the ordinary natives from their brutal
leaders---this sentiment can be seen in Colonel Francis Younghusband's
account of the 1903--1904 "expedition" to Tibet where after criticizing
Tibetans for being crafty, immoral, over-religious, dirty, and lazy, he
says "there are in them latent potentialities for good, which only await
the right touch to bring them into being."22 We may recall Napoleon's
proclamation in 1798 upon entering Egypt: "Peoples of Egypt, you will be
told that I have come to destroy your religion; do not believe it! Reply
that I have come to restore your rights, to punish the usurpers, and
that I respect more than the Mamluks God, His Prophet, and the Quran."23
Though in everyday conversation we tend to use stereotype only for
negative images, stereotyping has within it dualism and ambivalence.24
As Michael Hunt in his study of hierarchy of race and American foreign
policy points out, the [Americans created for "Orientals" two distinctly
different images: "a positive one, appropriate for happy times when
paternalism and benevolence were in season, and a negative one, suited
to those tense periods when abuse or aggrandizement became the order of
the day]{.underline}."25 While sometimes a positive stereotype may be
politically and socially helpful for a group, in the long run it reifies
and imprisons the represented subjects in their own arrested image. This
problem can be seen most clearly in the case of Tibetans who seem to be
prisoners of their stereotyped images. Alluding to the real effects of
the language of stereotype about Tibet, Donald Lopez points out that it
"not only creates knowledge about Tibet, in many ways it creates Tibet,
a Tibet that Tibetans in exile have come to appropriate and deploy in an
effort to gain both standing in exile and independence for their
country."26 However, these stereotypes legitimize only certain goals and
actions geared toward achieving them---the prevalent stereotypes paint
Tibetans mainly as passive victims requiring outside help. And this
outside support comes at a price. As Jamyang Norbu says, "however
hopeless their cause or marginal their survival, Tibetans are better off
living their own reality than being typecast in ethereal roles in the
fantasies of the West."27 Strategies of Representation In spite of
commonalities and consistencies, it is complexity, oppositionality, and
ambivalence that lie at the heart of Western colonial representations.
Imaginative practices through which the imperial West came to represent
the Other can be interrogated through the various strategies of
representation involved. [Though there was always a will to reify the
represented, this was undermined by the nature of representation---it
was not a singular act, but **one necessitating
repetition**.]{.underline} There always was a paradox in the Western
representations of other cultures---an unresolvable tension between
transparency and inscrutability, desire and disavowal, difference and
familiarity. Therefore Exotica Tibet is not a distinct phenomenon devoid
of contrariety; rather, it is defined by a "true complexio oppositorum,
a rich complexity of contradictions and oppositions."28 So near, yet so
far! As Slavoj Zizek puts it: The very inconsistency of this image of
Tibet, with its direct coincidence of opposites seems to bear witness to
its fantasmatic status. Tibetans are portrayed as people leading a
simple life of spiritual satisfaction, fully accepting their fate,
liberated from the excessive craving of theWestern subject who is always
searching for more, AND as a bunch of filthy, cheating, cruel, sexually
promiscuous primitives . . . The social order is presented as a model of
organic harmony, AND as the tyranny of the cruel corrupted theocracy
keeping ordinary people ignorant . . . 29 The following section of this
article identifies the most common discursive strategies marshalled in
the representation of the non-Western Other in the context of Western
imperialism and uses Exotica Tibet as the main empirical site of
investigation. Archive Archive is commonly understood as a place or
collection containing records, documents, photographs, film, or other
materials of historical interest. But archive can be taken to refer to a
repository of stored memories, information, myths, rumours, and
legends.30 [Encounter with the Other did not take place in a vacuum---it
was understood within pre-given images.]{.underline} What was knowable
then was shaped by imperial prerogatives as well as pre-existing
"knowledge." This included those found in classical writings, religious
and biblical sources, mythology, traveller's tales (which in any case
hardly differentiated between description and legend), and fictional
writings. These provided the cultural framework through which others
were seen, described and represented. Orientalism itself performed an
archival function---generalizations abounded as the attitude was "pick
an East, any East"31 and the story will be the same. As Said puts it:
"In a sense Orientalism was a library or archive of information commonly
and, in some of its aspects, unanimously held."32 In situations where
the culture was relatively unknown---like the Tibetan---hearsay,
legends, and fantasies performed an ever more important archival
function.33 Representers of Tibet especially before the 19th century
often drew upon these archives, supplementing the rare missionary and
travellers' accounts. Hugh Richardson's argument that the early
allusions of Westerners reveal little more than that the Tibetans had a
reputation in neighbouring countries for "strange ways and rare magical
powers"34 holds true even for the 20th century. Evaluation of Tibet and
its people was based on an archive that made very little distinction
between myths, legends, hearsay, and facts. Western writers constructed
"facts" not by referring to the place of Tibet but through repetition
and cross-reference. Gaze **[[Surveillance is a technique through
which]{.mark}, under an overpowering gaze, the [non Western subject is
rendered "a knowable, visible object of disciplinary
power."]{.mark}]{.underline}**35 [The gaze is not mere innocent
curiosity: "[to gaze implies more than to look at---it signifies a
psychological relationship of power]{.mark}, [in which the gazer is
superior to the object of the gaze]{.mark}."]{.underline}36 Through
observation, examination and interpretation objects are differentiated,
categorized, and identified, and made ready to be acted upon.
[Objectification]{.underline} (fixing its essence) [of the gazed goes
hand in hand with its subjectification---gaze and surveillance are
productive of identity of the gazed. [Surveillance as a strategy for
representing the Other and rendering it disciplined]{.mark} is
characterized [by]{.mark} the all-knowing gaze of a white "man," [the
colonial master]{.mark}, the West.]{.underline} It enables both the
visual possession of the body of the gazed and an interposition of
technique which safely conceals the body of the gazer.37
**[[Observations]{.mark} then [are presented as]{.mark} dispassionate,
[objective facts]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The gaze is
disembodied---statements are made as if there is no seer behind the
observations. This is not to say that non-Westerners are visually
impaired, powerless to gaze back at the West. But the [authority of
imperialism for a large part of the modern period ensured that mastery
and control remained a possession of Western "man."]{.underline} The
"monarch of all I survey" rhetorical gesture remained peculiar to the
West.38 Establishment of mastery through surveillance, gaze, and
observation were accompanied by consolidation of shades of political
dominance over the object of the gaze. Appropriation was done in the
name of scientific curiosity, ethnographic material gathering,
protection of simple masses from their own despotic rulers, or the
spread of progress. British colonial and military officials who went
inside Tibet often wrote their accounts as scientific exploration, or as
exciting adventure,39 or simply as "everyday" observation.40 Behind the
innocent sounding descriptions of travel like the "narrative of a plant
hunter's adventures and discoveries"41 lay the violence of imperialism.
Though their gaze might be considered as one of adventurer or romantic
in Europe, the effect on the natives was the same as some steely-eyed
militarist---the establishment and institutionalization of control
through political rule and knowledge formation. To know is a prelude to
possess, especially if there is a huge asymmetry of power. Such
asymmetry led to situations where it was perfectly acceptable for a
participant in the Tibet mission of 1903--1904 to say: "In fact the
visible riches and treasures of Lhasa fairly made our mouths water. The
Tibetans however would not sell, and to our honour be it said; although
Lhasa was a fair object to loot, and lay in our power, not a farthings
worth was forcibly \[author adds this word in pen in a typed text\]
taken from it."42 Securing priceless artefacts through coercion and
displaying them in the private and public collections in the West was an
essential feature of Western imperialism. Paradoxically[, the project of
rendering the Other knowable and the image of it as primitive and simple
went had in hand with recognition that there are elements of
inscrutability and mystery that eluded complete understanding of the
Other.]{.underline} While discussing his own failure to fathom the
unease of Phuntsog, a Tibetan who is seen no longer as "authentic"
native as he has learnt the language of the imperialist, Edmund Candler,
an early example of embedded reporter (a Daily Mail reporter
accompanying the British invasion of Tibet in 1903--1904), calls him a
"strange hybrid product of restless western energies, stirring and
muddying the shallows of the Eastern mind. Or are they depths? Who
knows? I know nothing, only that these men are inscrutable, and one
cannot see into their hearts."43 Frustrated with the inaccessibility,
invisibility and inscrutability of "the Orientals," Western desire
subjects them to a relentless investigation. Veil becomes a metaphor for
all that invites, titillates, and yet resists Western knowing. It is
"one of those tropes through which Western fantasies of penetration into
the mysteries of the Orient and access to the interiority of the other
are fantasmatically achieved."44 [[Surveillance]{.mark} and gaze
[facilitate]{.mark} other [representational strategies that fix the
Orient]{.mark}, the Other, particularly those that seek to classify,
differentiate [and provide identity to the Other]{.mark}]{.underline}
(and in turn to the Self). Differentiation--Classification
Differentiation and classification, two crucial factors in the formation
of the modern subject,45 are also evident in Western representations of
the Other. The ideational differentiation between the West and the Rest
underpins these representations. The need to articulate one's personal
and collective self in terms of identity comes from an internalization
of this principle of differentiation. [Classification occupies a central
place in any account of non-Western people. It polices discourses,
assigns positions, regulates groups, and enforces
boundaries]{.underline}.46 What Lobsang Rampa47 says about his own
treatment in the West reflects the dominant Western attitude toward the
exhibition of Oriental curiosities: "Unfortunately, western people
looked upon me as a curio, as a specimen who should be put in a cage and
shown off as a freak from the unknown. It made me wonder what would
happen to my old friends, the Yetis, if the westerners got hold of
them---as they are trying to do."48 Given the taxonomizing predilection
and conceit of Western imperialism, we can hardly disagree with Rampa's
conjecture about the fate of the yetis: "(If)Western Man had his way,
our poor old yetis would be captured, dissected, and preserved in
spirit."49 While some classifications may be essential for
understanding, often the classification of non-Western peoples went hand
in hand with the hierarchization and racialization of cultures.
[Classifying the Other as barbarian or savage validated its
dehumanization and was seen as justification for use of violence to
impose European norms]{.underline}.50 At the top were the white
Europeans and at the bottom were "primitive" Africans and aboriginal
populations in the "new world." Chinese, Arabs, Indians, and others
occupied different positions in the hierarchical table. The 19th and
20th century obsession with racializing culture can be seen in the case
of Tibetans too where different commentators sought to identify
characteristics of the Tibetan "race." A typical example was Graham
Sandberg who was unflattering in his comments about the "Tibetan race as
'a weak and cowardly people, their pusillanimity rendering them readily
submissive.'"51 [The fact that [racism has less to do with colour and
more to do with power relations]{.mark} becomes evident in the British
treatment of Irish as "coloured," as "white negroes,"]{.underline}52
during the 19th century. Captain William Frederick O'Connor's
observation at the start of the 20th century about Tibet is
illustrative: "Common people are cheerful, happy-go-lucky creatures,
absurdly like the Irish in their ways, and sometimes even in their
features."53 On the other hand, French traveller Alexandra David-Neel
finds that dobdobs, the Lhasa monk "police," looks like a "real
negro."54 Differentiation, classification and
[identification]{.underline}, when combined with racialization,
evolutionism and hierarchization, [lead to the debasement and negation
of most non-Western natives and idealization of some]{.underline}.

fleeing the tyranny of Assad\'s Russian-backed regime, **[made

comparable echoes]{.underline}]{.mark}** of despair **[[were
heard]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[with regards to the Armenian/Azerbaijani
battle over the Republic of Artsakh]{.underline}**, and while the
dispossession of Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah, Silwan and the other
areas of Israeli-occupied Jerusalem briefly lit up social media with
messages of global solidarity, **[[no comparable immediate international
action]{.mark}]{.underline}** or globally-led sanctions **[have been
offered as a sign of solidarity [to brown and black
bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}** facing political aggression or invasion.

**[[Sw]{.mark}eden, F[inland]{.mark} and Switzerland [did not consider

[interference]{.mark} and occupation.]{.underline}** FIFA has not placed
indefinite bans on other military aggressors and selectively chooses not
to fine footballers with European teams who have expressed solidarity
with Ukraine while those who do so for Palestine face penalties. Many
news outlets, including the BBC and CBS have featured commentators ---
including journalists and global leaders --- who have expressed their
**[[shock]{.mark} at the fact that]{.underline}** Ukrainians, who are
\"**[[relatively civilised, relatively
European]{.underline}]{.mark}**\", **[[are facing a
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}** that they seem to think **[should be
reserved only for those with melanated skin]{.underline}**. Along the
same lines, Georgian-**[Ukrainian politician]{.underline}** David
Sakvarelidze said that the s**[ituation in Ukraine made him
\"emotional\" because he is seeing \"people with blonde hair and blue
eyes being killed every day.]{.underline}**\" Western media platforms
all echo the same general sentiment: how could it be that people who
look European, and live in a Christian majority-country, are fleeing
their homes in 2022?

The **[same question did not seem to shake Europe to the same
degree]{.underline}** in the 1990s **[when]{.underline}** Bosnian
**[Muslims]{.underline}**, many with blonde hair and blue eyes, **[were
not granted]{.underline}** the same **[courtesy]{.underline}** because
of their religious background. Moreover, **[Ukrainian
Jews]{.underline}** were **[not granted this same courtesy of care
during the Holocaust]{.underline}**, and so on and so forth.

Instead of asking such questions, Global North leaders should ask
themselves why they believe that the [**[people of Asia, Africa, the
Arab world and Latin America]{.underline}**,]{.mark} as well as the
indigenous tribes of the Americas, should **[[alone experience the sum
of all suffering and injustice in the world]{.mark};]{.underline}** and
why they fail to recognise and take responsibility for the
centuries-long oppressive practices that elevated them to a global
political precipice at the expense of more than half the global
population of seven billion people. Why are Europeans --- White people
on whichever continent they have colonised --- entitled to an elite
brand of safety, security and humanity while the victims of their
foreign policies are doomed to live in a purgatory of poverty and social
inequity?

In short, **[the [level of selective solidarity with
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}**, one that **[is not afforded to other
vulnerable populations]{.underline}**, **[[should be the default
benchmark]{.mark} for global solidarity and action]{.underline}**.
People should not have to have blue eyes and blonde hair to receive our
sympathy and support. Yet, the **[[commentary]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that has been on full display since the start of the Russian invasion of
Ukraine **[[has demonstrated to us otherwise]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It
has proven that **[[Orientalism is alive and well]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and that **[the [rhetoric of dehumanisation and cultural
superiority]{.mark} that was set in motion with the Crusades is still
with us]{.underline}**, and is probably here to stay.

There are many lessons that can be learnt here, but the one major
takeaway as far as I am concerned is that if people of colour and
members of minority groups do not see their own liberation and standing
in solidarity with Ukraine as mutually exclusive phenomena, why are the
privileged leaders and citizens of the world\'s wealthiest and most
powerful countries so committed to nourishing this divide? Why are
**[brown and black Ukrainians]{.underline}**, visiting students or
refugees, being **[thrown off the trains evacuating the
country]{.underline}** whilst others with lighter skins are allowed to
flee to safety? It is high time that we all understand that **[[there is
no excuse fo]{.mark}r racism, [orientalism]{.mark} [or selective
solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}** when the planet is on fire; that
**[sooner or later we will have to contend with the rage of Mother
Nature in a warming world]{.underline}**; that **[climate change cares
not for skin colour or man-made wars.]{.underline}**

And **[[to be clear, I stand in solidarity with the people of
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}** just as I stand in solidarity with all
oppressed people. It is the only just, ethical and humanistic position
to take.

#### The 1AC's drive to protect Ukraine from "marauding Russians" is shaped by media that has been monopolized by Western powers in order to propagate Orientalist narratives that deny Russia agency, ignore the Western role in the Ukraine crisis, and turn the case by perpetuating conflict.

Russian invasion on Ukraine has evoked considerable outpouring of
compassion across the world. **[[Western media]{.mark} poignantly
portrayed the plight of Ukrainians and [glorified]{.mark} the
[resistance of]{.mark} the [Ukrainians in]{.mark} the [face of marauding
Russians]{.mark}. The [portrayal of Ukraine as]{.mark} an [western
country that has been pierced by]{.mark} the barbaric [assault
of]{.mark} the [Russia]{.mark}ns has [been a running thread in]{.mark}
the [media's framing of the war.]{.mark} The [portrayal is striking due
to]{.mark} considerable [orientalist overtones]{.mark} and racist
connotation. Besides, [attribution of]{.mark} relatively [more]{.mark}
[importance to Ukraine crisis]{.mark} while the other crisis was
conveniently overlooked-[raises]{.mark} the [question]{.mark} as [to
whether]{.mark} such [selective moral righteousness is indicative of
orientalist overtones]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Wars in the post-cold war
era are marked by a striking similarity ,due to the fact that **[media
has exerted considerable sway in interpreting the war and shaping the
dynamics of war]{.underline}**. **[[Media has legitimized]{.mark}
certain [war]{.mark}]{.underline}** while it mobilized public opinion
against others. In this era,the **[yardstick of legitimacy is bestowed
largely by the media]{.underline}**. The role of media in shaping war is
partly exercised by media's framing strategies. Media framing entails a
sociological and cognitive endeavor that interpret the events from a
particular viewpoint and furnishes convincing evidence by means of
news-stories to further reinforce the frame. The framing of war stems
from the stance of media towards a particular war or any political
event. **[The [framing strategy of media is]{.mark} particularly
[efficacious in shaping]{.mark} and influencing the [dynamics of]{.mark}
the [war-due to the fact that]{.mark} the [actual]{.mark} realm of
[warfare]{.mark} and the covert diplomatic maneuvers concerning war [is
undertaken in]{.mark} sheer [secrecy]{.mark} and always remains remote
from the public.]{.underline}** Hence, media provides avenues for
general mass to remain conversant of the realities of the war.
**[However, media is at liberty in portraying war by underscoring
certain frames to mobilize public opinions for that particular
perspective. As general people can't discriminate between true and
spurious portrayal ,the framing of war from biased viewpoint becomes
more convenient for the media. Hence, there is an inextricable
relationship between modern war and media, as media framing ultimately
justifies the war.]{.underline}** As the bulk of the media outlets with
a global reach emanates from western countries, **[the international
[media landscape is unduly skewed]{.mark} [towards]{.mark} the
[west]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This provide west with a leverage in
framing war from their vested vantage point**[. [This ensues]{.mark}
that [western]{.mark} country exerts a [monopoly over]{.mark} the
"[framing" international]{.mark} political [issues]{.mark}. Especially,
in the case of conflict, this framing endeavor appears far conducive for
these countries as it provides west with the power to legitimize and
delegitimize war in line with the interests of the western world. The
[blatant]{.mark} manifestation of [abuse of]{.mark} this [monopoly of
media is exhibited in]{.mark} the framing of the [Iraq war. In line
with]{.mark} the dominant [narrative of the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates which [stipulated]{.mark} that [Iraq possess WMD]{.mark}
and hence constitute grave menace to world security, [western media
are]{.mark} deplorably [complicit in legitimizing American war]{.mark}
effort and consequent destruction wrought by United States under the
pretext of securing civilians and restoring democracy.]{.underline}**
This event illustrates the reinforcing role that war plays in
legitimation of war. **[In terms of U.S. invasion of the Afghanistan in
2021 and concomitant toppling of Taliban, the media perpetuated the
prejudices about general Afghani people and amplified the threat posed
by Islamic terrorism.]{.underline}** This portrayal facilitated western
domination over the Afghanistan for two decades, as the phenomenon of
intervention has been conveniently transfigured into benign benevolence
aimed at ameliorating Afghanistan. **[Besides, western [intervention in
Libya or Syria]{.mark} ,all has [been portrayed]{.mark} from the lens of
western onus [in redressing]{.mark} the [miseries of people]{.mark} in
these countries. Moreover, [media]{.mark} legitimized and [reinforced
western war mission by]{.mark} trumping narratives and [sustaining
it]{.mark} .]{.underline}** While the act of war by any country is
deplorable to the conscientious people ,**[western media however reserve
the monopolistic right to labeling war as "Just" and "Unjust", in line
with the geopolitical interests of the western countries. [This
has]{.mark} [been accentuated by]{.mark} the western media [portrayal of
the Ukrainian crisis. The orientalist connotation]{.mark} in the war
[evident]{.mark} even [on]{.mark} [the eve of the war]{.mark}, [as
Russian security concern had been spurned]{.mark} and [NATO]{.mark} had
only amplified its security by intruding in close proximity to
Russia.]{.underline}** This is sheer manifestation of callousness as it
is understandable that U.S. would not brook such hostile maneuverings
against U.S. in its close contiguity, a fact which perhaps been
concretized in the proverbial Monroe Doctrine. **[Moreover, [the fact
that]{.mark} only [western security concern is legitimate and Russia's
security]{.mark} concern [represents aggression from]{.mark} the part of
[Russia, is]{.mark} a notion that is [emblematic of]{.mark} the
[orientalist disposition]{.mark} of the west, whereby west and other are
gauged with different yardstick and [Others are not entitled to]{.mark}
the [privilege of having "security]{.mark}" at all, let alone concern
about security. Moreover, the west had been utterly callous and
disrespectful about the sensitivities of Russia ,and this belligerence
from [West has stoked consternation in Russia and precipitated]{.mark}
the outbreak of [war]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### US-China Trade

#### Discussions of US-China trade relationships are impossible to separate from Yellow Peril tropes, depicting those that refuse to conform to the capitalist market as security threats

**Ooi and D'arcangelis 17**(Su-Mei Ooi and Gwen D'Arcangelis, 2017,

China as cheat: currency squabbles The **[merchandise [trade
deficit]{.mark} that the [US maintains with
China]{.mark}]{.underline}**---which grew to a total of US\$365.7
billion in 2015 before falling to US\$308.9 billion in 2017---has been a
**[long-standing issue of [concern for]{.mark} the [United
States]{.mark}]{.underline}** (United States Census Bureau, 2016, 2017).
The trade deficit is **[often attributed to unfair trade practices and
the artificial [undervaluation of China]{.mark}'s
currency]{.underline}**. The United States has registered numerous trade
disputes with China over the years via the World Trade Organization
(WTO) dispute settlement mechanism with success**[. Up to 2010, China
has, moreover, kept its national currency undervalued to drive
exports.]{.underline}** This **[dimension of US--China trade relations
is of interest here because China]{.underline}** has, since 2005,
**[adopted a more flexible exchange rate regime and gradually revalued
the yuan]{.underline}**---not least because of political pressure from
the United States. Indeed, in May 2015, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) stated that the Chinese yuan was no longer undervalued (The Wall
Street Journal, 2015). The Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
estimated that the yuan had, in fact, been most recently overvalued
about 32% compared to its trading partners, and the most expensive among
60 countries (Forbes, 2015). **[[US political rhetoric]{.mark} has so
far been out of step with these changes and has [failed to explain the
reasons for which previous motivations to undervalue the yuan no longer
hold]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In a charged exchange between candidate
Mitt Romney and President Obama in the 2012 presidential debate, for
example, the former accused the latter for failing to call out China as
cheat: **["China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and
years ... and the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a
currency manipulator, but refuses to do so"]{.underline}** (Paletta &
Davis, 2012a). Romney went on to build on this image of China to shore
up his credentials: "On day one, I will **[[label China a currency
manipulator]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which will allow me as president to
be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they
are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers" (Paletta & Davis,
2012b). At the time, the yuan had already increased by 11% since 2008.
**[The [trope of China as cheat]{.mark} can be read in light of
[historical constructions of China as the Yellow Peril,]{.mark} a notion
that continues to [shape depictions of the Chinese as]{.mark} cunning,
sneaky, and [immoral in US political rhetoric]{.mark}
today.]{.underline}** These stereotypes **[emerged in the late 1880s to
[fuel antiChinese sentiment]{.mark},]{.underline}** when United
Statesians responded to the influx of Chinese labor and settlement as a
threat to White wages, White social dominance, and family structure.
**[These depictions helped to justify harsh immigration laws barring
Chinese settlement. In the current context, depictions of China
[reinvoke]{.mark} this older [Orientalist trope]{.mark} to paint not
only a similarly suspicious figure but also a tenuous economic partner
with the potential to [turn into]{.mark} the [Red Peril that refuses to
abide by]{.mark} the rules of the [capitalist
market]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This was again perceptible when the yuan
was devalued by 2.3% to bring it more in line with a market-determined
rate in the Fall of 2015 (US Treasury, Oct 2015). That markets and
politicians are sensitized to the slightest downward movement in China's
currency value was underlined by the agitation with which Congressional
representatives reacted to the devaluation of the yuan. The US Treasury,
which played a key role in pressuring China for a market-determined
currency, was cautious in its initial response; however, Congressional
critics such as Senator Charles Schumer (NY-D) went on the record saying
that this move was indicative of China's attempt to "double down" on
currency manipulation and that the yuan "should be barred from
consideration as a global reserve currency by the IMF" unless China
"stops artificially devaluing" it. Indeed, he is quoted as saying that
**["China has rigged the rules" for years in "play\[ing\] games with its
currency"]{.underline}** (Bradsher, 2015). Furthermore, Republican
Senator Rob Portman said that the **[devaluation was yet another "harsh
reminder" that China "refuses to play by the rules"]{.underline}**
(Portman, 2015). Republican Senator Lindsey Graham joined the chorus by
stating that "today's provocative act by the Chinese government to lower
the value of the yuan is just the latest in a long history of cheating"
(Graham, 2015). The timing of the 2015 devaluation of the yuan did
palpably advantage China at a time when exports were slowing, but there
remains a discrepancy between the depiction of China as cheat and the
complex economic reality of today. As growth rates slow and capital
outflow takes place, undervaluing the yuan is no longer in China's best
interest. In the longer term, **[China is also likely to avoid a policy
of undervaluation as it attempts to rebalance the economy toward
domesticdriven growth, as a stronger Chinese yuan increases the
purchasing power of its population.]{.underline}** Importantly, its (now
successful) bid to have the IMF recognize the yuan as an official
reserve currency on par with the US Dollar, Euro, British Pound, and
Japanese Yen constrains significant devaluations. In this regard,
pro-business newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal have gone some
way in providing the counterweight to the image of China as currency
manipulator through more objective economic analysis. Yet, conclusions
such as "China likely isn't regressing" suggests that only tentative
conclusions are drawn about China's ability to conform to fair rules of
play ("China's Currency Policies Win Cautious Praise Abroad," 2015).
**[While some journalists have underlined the economic interdependence
between the United States and China]{.underline}** (Mallaby, 2005;
"Paulson's China Victory" 2006) **[and pointed out that China has become
a "punching bag" since the 2012 partisan presidential electoral
politics]{.underline}** (Paletta & Davis, 2012a), **[space has also been
given to presidential hopefuls to perpetuate the image of China as cheat
by framing the yuan's recent downward slide as "foreign currency
cheating"]{.underline}** (Trump, 2016). **[The [long-standing
Orientalist narrative]{.mark} of China's cheating behavior, its
destabilizing effect on the global rules of the liberal trade regime and
the [negative impact on US corporate interests]{.mark} and job security,
remains ea[sy to invoke after being the predominant theme in US public
discourse on US--China economic relations.]{.mark} This narrative helps
to bridge the gap between reality and fiction and turns an economic
partner into an enemy. [Enemy-making]{.mark} in the economic realm is
particularly [problematic]{.mark}]{.underline}**, moreover, because
polls indicate that the US public tends to pay significant attention to
the **[economic relationship with China precisely because it most
directly affects them.]{.underline}** Gallup's 2014 annual world affairs
poll indicated that more Americans perceive China as an economic threat
than a military one, unsurprising since China's impact on the US job
market feels more immediate to Americans than military developments in
Asia (see Figure 1).

#### Wilderson's theorization of antiblackness is too totalizing and forces Asians into violent spheres of whiteness cementing them as junior partners to whiteness which precludes alternative strategies of navigating racialized power structures -- takes out their solvency

**Gotby 16** (Alva Gotby, "Body, Geography, Exteriority : Race and
spatiality in the writings of Denise Ferreira da Silva" 2016) mahintha

This problem also indicates a broader issue, which is that
**[[Wilderson's account absolutises]{.mark} the [exclusion of black
people]{.mark} - an "ontological" exclusion that is detached from actual
historical processes yet in some sense seems to depend on those
processes.]{.underline}** But what is political ontology? Here, I think
it can most usefully be described as the naturalisation of certain
relations of power, through various institutions and processes. However,
**[[Wilderson suggests]{.mark} that [groups]{.mark} can be [banished
from]{.mark} those "[ontological" relations]{.mark} altogether ([while
simultaneously arguing]{.mark} that [blackness is determined by
gratuitous violence, thus ignoring]{.mark} the [fact that this violence
is]{.mark} a form of [relation]{.mark}), [and that ontology]{.mark},
once it is instituted, [operates on]{.mark} a [level]{.mark} that is
[detached from material and historical processes]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
This political ontology thus becomes next to impossible to change,
because once instituted by a historical process, it becomes almost
dehistorical. While I agree that it is difficult to overstate the
importance of race for the constitution of the modern world, I think
**[th[is absolutising of antiblackness]{.mark} might serve to
[renaturalise it as]{.mark} an [totalised and unchanging condition, thus
ignoring]{.mark} the [multitude of strategies through which racial power
operates]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[Wilderson explicitly states
that he is not interested in how raciality came to be, but rather wants
to describe it as an ontological paradigm of power.]{.underline}**82 For
Ferreira da Silva on the other hand, **[the "how" of race cannot be
neatly separated out from the "what" of race.83]{.underline}** Thus, we
must look at the processes of knowing that instituted the racial -
rather than an absolute ontology of race as exclusion, Ferreira da Silva
proposes an ontoepistemology of racial difference. As I have shown, she
criticises the use of exclusion as a model for understanding race. Much
of that criticism does not apply to Wilderson's theory - for example, he
does not presuppose a prepolitical subject beyond the mechanism of
exclusion. Rather, he suggests that blackness is a form of
desubjectivation.84 He also does not naturalise racial bodily traits as
the explanation for exclusion, as he uses Hortense Spillers' concept of
flesh to describe racial embodiment. Flesh, in Spillers' terminology, is
a politically produced being, not a natural minimal level of life.85
However, **[I find [Wilderson's account limiting because]{.mark} it
[tends towards]{.mark} doing one thing that Ferreira da Silva puts under
the label "the [logics of exclusion]{.mark}," namely [to create]{.mark}
an almost [entirely negative statement of]{.mark} the [being of]{.mark}
(certain) [racialised people]{.mark}. In [his insistence on black people
as]{.mark} the [only group which is completely excluded from
humanity]{.mark}, he [lumps Asian and Arab people together with white
people in]{.mark} the [category of masters, providing very little
justification for doing so]{.mark}.]{.underline}**86 **[Thus, one
racialised group is placed in total negativity, while other non-white
groups are fully included in the sphere of the human. [He]{.mark} does
[place Native Americans in]{.mark} a [liminal position]{.mark}, half-
way between the human and the antihuman, life and death. [This]{.mark}
move [strikes me as]{.mark} rather [U.S.- centric, and Wilderson tends
to waver on the spatial extension of this racial ontology]{.mark}
-]{.underline}** does it apply to North America or the whole world?
Moreover, **[[to place Asians and Arabs solidly within the sphere of
humanity]{.mark}, while blacks are completely excluded, [obscures
how]{.mark} the [racial produces degrees of differentiation]{.mark}.
With Sylvia Wynter, we might consider raciality as gradual deviation
from the purported norm of Man, rather than as the total
nonrelationality of one racial group from others.]{.underline}**87 With
Ferreira da Silva, we might say that racial bodies are ordered on a
scale of transparency/affectability, where blackness occupies the
position unsublatable affectability, the body so close to dying that it
can never be represented as subjectivity unmediated by death.
**[[Wilderson's account does not give]{.mark} a very [clear
account]{.mark} as [to why white capacity is dependent on black
incapacity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Instead he merely states that it is
so, thus **[not explaining how whiteness is constituted.]{.underline}**
While Ferreira da Silva and Wilderson share a commitment to what I would
call the radical exteriority of the racialised subject, in the sense
that it is a subject that cannot be included into humanity and
universality, Ferreira da Silva's account provides us with a key to how
this mechanism of exteriority work. Because her account does not rely on
the pure negativity of the racialised other, she can state that what has
been positioned as exterior is the affectable subject. Again,
**[exteriority is different from exclusion because it does not
necessarily connote negativity, or being deprived of
something]{.underline}**.

#### Vote neg for transnational Asian-Black solidarity\-\--only through rejecting totalizing forms of theorization and US-centric epistemologies can we enable intersectional critique that allows for collective survival 

**Liu 20** (Wen Liu \| "Internationalism Beyond the "Yellow Peril": On
the Possibility of Transnational Asian American Solidarity" \| DOI:
10.5070/T8112050102 \| DOA: 7/17/2022 \| SAoki)

However, the point of **[[Asian--Black solidarity is neither
recentering]{.mark} Asian American [experiences in the struggle toward
police abolition nor placing racism against Black and Asian American
communities in the same comparative framework]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[These approaches would minimize Black people's repression by the
carceral state and fall into the unproductive logic of an "Oppression
Olympics."]{.underline}** The 1960s slogan that some Asian Americans
have repopularized---"Yellow Peril Supports Black Power"---in order to
support the current movement2 has stirred up debates relating to Asian
Americans' relationship to the ongoing Black struggles. While it
highlights the historically bounded fate and formation of the Asian
American and Black Power movements,3 it should also remind us that the
1960s **[[Asian--Black solidarit]{.mark}y was [made possible by the
antiimperialist]{.mark} [positions of anti-Vietnam war and the
decolonial movements in the global South]{.mark}. The [Orientalist
depiction of Asian nationals as "foreign enemies"]{.mark} during World
War II [constituted the "perpetual foreigner" status of Asian American
subjects, thus]{.mark} [demanding]{.mark} an Asian American [critique of
racial exclusion and the US empire]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other
words, the demand for racial inclusion and equality as the basis of
Asian--Black solidarity without problematizing the transnational reach
of US imperialism is not only anachronistic but also counterproductive.
As Minju Bae and Mark Tseng-Putterman articulate, **[[the interconnected
events of Orientalist racialization of the Asian body as virally
contagious and BLM's uprisings against policing "require an analysis
that sutures the discourses of antiblackness and Orientalism,]{.mark}
not [as]{.mark} equivalent but [constitutive components of global racial
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**,"4 rather than flattening the
differences of white supremacist operations under the US nation-state.
In the midst of a global pandemic and social upheavals, how will
transnational Asian--Black solidarity take shape? Currently living in
Taipei, Taiwan, I am involved in an emergent circle of diasporic Asian
radicals who write and organize around the vibrant left-leaning
movements in Taiwan and Hong Kong and seek to build international
solidarity based on a critique of both US and Chinese imperialism.
**[This new activist milieu that has been described as "transnationally
Asian"]{.underline}**5 **[[not only rejects]{.mark} Asian American
[assimilationist politics]{.mark} and the narrow focus of liberal
international politics around democracy and human rights, [but]{.mark}
also [actively seeks cross-national and]{.mark} cross-[racial points
of]{.mark} racial [encounters and challenges the]{.mark} orthodox
Western leftist takes on social movements that often defer to a
[reductionist binarism of "capitalism versus
communism."]{.mark}]{.underline}** For example, a Hong Kong activist was
excluded from participating in a BLM solidarity event hosted by the
Sunrise Movement, an American youth--led climate organization, due to
some US leftists' Twitter commentaries that misrepresented Hong Kong's
protests against Beijing's increasingly harsh conditions of
authoritarian control as being funded by the US military. Writers from
Lausan, a leftist Hong Kong press, have condemned such
mischaracterization of Hong Kong's ongoing mass movement as merely
manipulated by US imperialism and, instead, insisted on the importance
of building alliances between Hong Kong's struggle against
authoritarianism and BLM's vision of police abolition.6 From this single
case, one can understand that **[[building transnational
solidarity]{.mark} is complex and arduous work, both conceptually and
practically. It [requires us to maneuver from one ideological trap to
another across geopolitical contexts and locally specific historical
conditions]{.mark}. While transnational iteration is emancipatory and
necessary to achieve a genuine form of Asian--Black solidarity, [it must
be built on a bidirectional and bifocal analysis instead of merely
relying on the US-centric epistemology]{.mark} of what constitutes
leftist politics]{.underline}**. By seeking transnationalism from the
West toward the non-West and not vice versa, it's easy to fall into the
logic of Western "China apologists" or neo-Cold War logic, dismissing
the interasian conflicts that also have global ramifications. To put it
in another way, as China criminalizes Hong Kong's fight for fundamental
democratic rights and implements mass arrests of young activists under
the National Security Laws,7 **[a progressive Asian American politics
must not only be focused on racial relations domestically but challenge
multiple forms of Empire beyond the borders of the US]{.underline}**.
Only through this multidimensional transnational praxis can we begin to
see the underlying mechanisms that allow BLM activists from Minneapolis
to Seattle to adopt Hong Kong protesters' strategies against the police.
8 These possibilities for alliance among "transnationally Asian"
activists include protesters in Hong Kong and the US using umbrellas and
tennis rackets to protect themselves from tear gas, the joint coalition
between Taiwanese indigenous organizations and Black Lives Matter Taiwan
calling out racism,9 and Singaporeans debating whether to topple their
colonial monuments.10 Our current shared struggles against the rapid
right-wing turn of global hegemonies do not draw lines between the
simple binaries of "East vs. West," "white vs. Black," or
"authoritarianism vs. democracy," but underscore the interconnected
fights against the militarized police state, neoliberal capitalist
order, Han supremacy, and the continued impacts of Euro-American
coloniality. **[The "yellow peril" may have been a useful metaphor
describing the shared racialization of the Asian body against white
supremacy and US imperialism; the politics of internationalism in the
present conditions requires a much more nuanced analysis of
interregional geopolitics across the transpacific. [The possibility of
transnational Asian American solidarity must be situated beyond the
framework of "one united race against one
empire."]{.mark}]{.underline}** Indeed, the fastgrowing infection and
mortality rates of Covid-19 show that the virus cannot be simply
contained by national borders, and **[[our racial critique must]{.mark}
also [be extended]{.mark} [transnationally]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When
a disease is racialized, **[it not only exposes the racial inequalities
built in the global public health infrastructures but also how
mechanisms of national security require the domination of subjects who
are deemed to be "outsiders."]{.underline}** **[Rather than falling into
a nationalistic blame game based on the Cold War logic---choosing sides
between one empire (the US) and another (China)]{.underline}**---the
pandemic requires us to engage in the racial justice and antinativist
struggles in our different localities as well as **[[hold one another's
movements accountable to an internationalist vision of collective
survival]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### Baudrillard

#### Baudrillard's analysis of simulation is Orientalist -- creates hierarchal structure that reproduces violence

**Almond 7** (Ian, literary scholar and writer, Professor of World
Literature at Georgetown University, Published in 2007 by I.B.Tauris &
Co. Ltd, "THE NEW ORIENTALISTS: Postmodern representations of Islam from
Foucault to Baudrillard") RR Jr

The passage is remarkable for a number of points. First of all**[, we in
the West are hampered by truth. Here [Baudrillard]{.mark}, bringing in
both Nietzsche and Derrida, seems to [link]{.mark} the [history
of]{.mark} mimesis, of [truth and representation, in the West with a
certain naïveté]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This naïveté, it seems, is
ultimately logocentric -- the delusion of correspondence theory, still
nurtured by modernity, that an image must necessarily correspond to
'something' on the other side of it. **[[Arabs]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(and, oddly enough, Romanians -- not for the first time does the Islamic
East and the Soviet/Orthodox East become united in common opposition to
Protestant capitalism) **[[possess]{.mark} a [cynicism]{.mark} which
enables them to [see truth as purely functional, rather than
representational]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Of course, **[the unpleasant
[implication]{.mark} of the passage [is that lies are second-nature to
the Arab]{.mark} mind]{.underline}** -- **[unhampered]{.underline}** 170
\| Islam, 'theory' and Europe **[by the burden of sincerity, enlightened
as to the [real nature of 'unconditional simulacra']{.mark}, the
irrelevance of the signifier to the signified, the [Arab sees no
distinction between truth and lies]{.mark}, between fact and fiction,
between the genuine and the fake]{.underline}**. Although **[this idea
is [reminiscent of]{.mark} a common [Western conviction of nihilism in
the Oriental mind]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- the secret maxim of
Nietzsche's Assassins ('Nothing is true. Everything is Allowed') --
**[[Baudrillard]{.mark}]{.underline}** provides a surprisingly original
justification for **[this cliché by an [appeal to]{.mark} the
iconoclast/[Islamic prohibition of the image]{.mark}, a historical
reference he has already made use of elsewhere]{.underline}** (see
Baudrillard's belief that the Iconoclast's 'rage to destroy images arose
precisely because they sensed this omnipotence of simulacra').14 Because
**[Muslims and iconoclasts]{.underline}** already believe
**[[images]{.mark} to be [haram]{.mark} or unclean, they have [no moral
reservations about misusing them]{.mark} in order to obtain what they
desire.]{.underline}** Hence the West's naïveté which rises from its
idolatry of the image, its over-sanctification of a non-existent truth,
its deluded belief in the image's divine referent. **[[Baudrillard's
Arabs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the passage suggests, **[[manipulate
images]{.mark} with [greater]{.mark} dexterity [than]{.mark} their
[Western counterparts]{.mark} because they know them to be nothing more
than idols, false gods, empty signs]{.underline}**. For all its Islamic
stereotypes and Oriental clichés, the most positive gesture towards
Islam in Baudrillard's text lies in his straightforward recognition of
the 'Enlightenment Fundamentalist' (p. 80), an acknowledgement which,
while omitting to exempt Islam from the charge of fundamentalism, sees
standard 'rational' objections to it as groundless, dogmatic and equally
dangerous: 'We do not practise hard, fundamentalist traditionalism, we
practise soft, subtle and shameful democratic traditionalism by
consensus. **[However, consensual traditionalism]{.underline}** (that of
the Enlightenment, the Rights of Man, the Left in power, the repentant
intellectual and sentimental humanism) **[is every bit as fierce as that
of any tribal religion or primitive society' (]{.underline}**p. 79).
**[If Islam is an honest, open, unashamed fundamentalism, the beliefs
one could almost redefine here as '[Western traditionalism']{.mark} are
more [hypocritical]{.mark}, forever pretending to be something they are
not, forever claiming their opposites (superstition, religion,
tribalism) to be radically different from themselves. This denial of the
Enlightenment's universal exclusiveness and moral/ontological
superiority over the superstitions and tribalisms it tries to denounce
is a gesture we have seen in all the thinkers examined in this book --
an unconscious sympathy with Islam as an unjustly defamed primitivism,
an impatience with modernity's self-denial and 200-year-old ignorance of
what it really is]{.underline}**.

### Fem

#### Modern feminist movements follow the trend of western othering and constantly exclude "The Orient" making the patriarchy inevitable -- the alt is a prerequisite to their method -- otherwise they solidify hegemonic discourses that continue to oppress all women, "Other" or not

to be [absent from]{.mark} the analysis of white middle-class feminists
who dominate the [mainstream discourses on]{.mark} the issue of
[gender]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This situation is especially true with
respect to discussions of Third World women. Increasingly, white-middle

relationship to their men with that of women in 'primitive' societies
has become common, especially in the United States. **[Nader argues that
the comparison has been more implicit than explicit but the comparison
always assumes the experience of women in Western countries as the self
and that of women in the Third World as the Other.]{.underline}** As
Said points out, **[Orientalism is a discourse that Orientalizes the
Orient for the purpose of Occidental consumption.]{.underline}**19
Mohanty argues that liberal feminism produces colonial knowledge systems
when referring to the 'thirdworld,' which is comprised of a monolithic
category.20 **[It is through the discourse that [creates the Third World
woman that the First World is brought out as privileged and
singular.]{.mark} But [the West is dominated as much by patriarchy in
ideology and government as is the East.]{.mark} The dominant ideology is
[preserved in the West]{.mark} by avoiding any criticism of the way
immigrant, non-white, and economically disadvantaged women are treated;
their lack of status vis-a\`-vis the sources of power and their lack of
access to economic resources strengthens the hegemony. [This 'ignorance'
is at the heart of the problem with liberal feminist]{.mark} analysis,
and in many respects it is a continuation of the imperial
era.]{.underline}**21 According to Trinh and Mohanty, in their critique
of liberal feminist imperialism, '**[feminist opportunists seem to speak
to the third world through a shared vocabulary which insists: They
cannot represent themselves; they must be represented]{.underline}**.'22
**[Women of color and other feminists have been criticizing liberal
feminism for more than a decade, and we now have a large body of
literature about the problems of Oriental feminism.]{.underline}**23
**[The growing critique of Orientalist feminism has been prompted by its
alarming impact and its popular appeal in North America. [Orientalist
feminism]{.mark} is [popularized]{.mark} through novels and films, and
it has become a 'boom industry' that has [created huge problems for
Muslims]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 'True' accounts, such as the book and
movie Not without My Daughter, helped to incite racist, anti-Muslim and
anti-Iranian feelings across Europe and North America;24 in the
aftermath of 11 September, this genre has gathered a new momentum.
During the colonial period, the colonizers believed they were bringing
civilization to the Orient. Now President Bush wants to bring democracy
to the same region, and with the same methods of the past: war and
occupation. Of course, Bush also wants to protect civilization from
barbaric terrorists, so there is a war on terror in tandem with a drive
to export democracy. And what better way to earn the necessary public
support for these colonial campaigns than by going back to the proven
colonial strategy of focusing on the Muslim world's treatment of women?
**[The most effective propagandists for this effort, however, are not
government employees but rather 'independent', self-proclaimed feminists
whose personal experiences with the situation of women under Islam
impart an aura of authenticity to their portrayals of the primitive and
misogynist nature of the religion.]{.underline}** It is in this sense
that we need to examine the books by Brooks and Nafisi, both of which
have reached large audiences.

### PoMo/Foucault

#### Postmodern and Foucauldian depictions of an dominant and evil West repressing a passive and weak East only furthers Eurofetishism and establishing a perpetual Otherization of the Eastern countries.

These problems of [hyper-elitism, hyper-structuralism and Eurocentrism/
[**Eurofetishism** are]{.mark} also [found in]{.mark} much **of
[postmodern theory]{.mark}, the effect of which is to write out of the
script of world politics the contributions of subaltern and non-Western
agents.6 Here, [the tendency is to exaggerate]{.mark} the pow[er of the
West to]{.mark} contain and [repress the East]{.mark}, [with the
latter]{.mark} all too often [appearing as]{.mark} a mere [passive
object of the former]{.mark}.**]{.underline} And it is of course deeply
ironic that **[postmodernists such as [Baudrillard]{.mark}, Lyotard,
Mouffe, Deleuze [and Foucault]{.mark} have tended to [reify]{.mark} the
[West as]{.mark} a [self-contained entity while failing to
recognize]{.mark} the interactive [relationship between East and
West]{.mark}, precisely because Said's conception of
Orientalism/Eurocentrism rests on the Self/Other identity-formation
process that Foucault first emphasized.]{.underline}** Indeed, it is
noteworthy that **[[Said]{.mark} later [criticized Foucault for
ignoring]{.mark} the [role of Eastern]{.mark} [resistance]{.mark} in the
making of global politics]{.underline}** (Said 1994: 29--30, 335--6).
Accordingly, **[Thompson's critique of Althusserianism can be applied to
much of [postmodernism]{.mark} and Gramscianism insofar as they [not
infrequently constitute]{.mark} a '[structuralism of
stasis']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Thompson 1995: 6), **[thereby [returning
us to]{.mark} the problem of [Eurofetishism]{.mark} once more. A [recent
thrust of CIRT]{.mark} has seen the emergence of an everyday life
approach, which [draws]{.mark} much of its inspiration [from]{.mark}
Michel [Foucault's]{.mark} (1980) concept of
[governmentality]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as well as from the Marxist
scholar Henri Lefebvre (1976). Three key critical IR theorists of note
here are Paul Langley (2008), Matt Davies (2005) and Matthew Paterson
(2007). As I have argued in detail elsewhere, this approach focuses on a
'logic of discipline' (Hobson and Seabrooke 2009). **[Here, the aim is
to reveal how structures of power discipline, and are translated into,
the practices of everyday life in order to denaturalize that which
appears as natural and as 'common-sense']{.underline}**. Thus Langley,
for example, shows how the transformation of pensions from 'defined
benefits' to 'defined contributions' has transformed the practices of
everyday life. **[In this case, [while the individual perceives himself
to be a 'free investing subject']{.mark} who engages in financial
self-discipline in order to accumulate long-term savings for his future
pension, [such a predisposition internalizes]{.mark} the [repressive
neoliberal politics and the]{.mark} idiom of the '[ownership
society']{.mark}]{.underline}** that was fi rst proclaimed by Margaret
Thatcher. Similarly, Matthew Paterson (2007) critically interrogates the
idea of the car as enhancing individual autonomy, arguing that the
expansion of the carowning public leads not to greater freedom but to
greater environmental damage and ultimately to exacerbated levels of
global injustice. My problem is not with what has been done -- for these
approaches undoubtedly produce all manner of excellent insights -- but
**[with that which has not been considered. Such approaches take the
initial fi rst step of critique but do not fully follow through by
revealing modes of subaltern agency in the making, not only of everyday
life but also of the West and of world politics. The bigger point here
is that [much of CIRT's]{.mark} critical [modus operandi is to
reveal]{.mark} [structures of power]{.mark}, withthis being seen as an
inherently emancipatory (intellectual) praxis.]{.underline}** In his
interview in this volume, Robert Cox echoes this tendency when he argues
that critical theory's prime purpose is to critique existing power
structures in order to open up an emancipatory space (this volume, 20).
**[My purpose is by no means to undermine the importance of this move
but rather to argue that [we need to go one step further]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} follow through on this by [consider]{.mark}ing [how]{.mark}
subaltern and everyday [actors exercise agency]{.mark} in the making of
their own lives, as well as those of others around and beyond them. For
it seems to me that [failure to do so leads back into]{.mark} the
hyper-elitist, hyper-structuralist and [Eurofetishist traps]{.mark} [of
rendering]{.mark} subaltern and [Eastern agents]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
in the phraseology of Thompson, as but 'mere träger or vectors \[ie.,
**[[passive victims]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] of ulterior structural
determinations' (Thompson 1995: 2--3). **[[The route]{.mark} out of this
cul de sac, then, [requires revealing]{.mark} the bottom-up [Eastern
agential practices]{.mark} [that also shape the West]{.mark} and world
politics.]{.underline}**

## Impact

### Framing

#### **Utilitarianism is trapped in self-referential ethics -- justifies white supremacy**

**Velasquez et al 12** \[Manuel Velasquez, Claire Andre Thomas Shanks
Michael J. Meyer, Charles J. Dirksen Professor of Management at Santa
Clara University , Applied Ethics Associate Director at Santa Clara
University , Senior Associate Dean of Arts and Sciences at Santa Clara
University, Professor of Philosophy at Santa Clara University ,
<http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/decision/calculating.html>, 2012\]

**[While utilitarianism is]{.underline}** currently a very
**[popular]{.underline}** ethical theory, **[there are some difficulties
in relying on it as a sole method for moral
decision-making]{.underline}**. First, **[the utilitarian calculation
requires that we assign values to the benefits and harms resulting from
our actions and compare them with the benefits and harms that might
result from other actions]{.underline}**. **[But [it\'s]{.mark} often
difficult, if not [impossible]{.mark}, [to measure and compare]{.mark}
the [values of certain benefits and costs]{.mark}. How do we go about
assigning a value to life or to art? And how do we go about comparing
the value of money with, for example, the value of life, the value of
time, or the value of human dignity]{.underline}**? Moreover, can we
ever be really certain about all of the consequences of our actions?
**[Our ability to measure and to predict the benefits and harms
resulting from a course of action or a moral rule is
dubious]{.underline}**, to say the least. **[Perhaps [the greatest
difficulty]{.mark} with utilitarianism [is that it fails to take into
account]{.mark} considerations of [justice]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We
can imagine instances where a certain course of action would produce
great benefits for society, but they would be clearly unjust. During the
apartheid regime in South Africa in the last century, South African
whites, for example, sometimes claimed that all South
Africans---including blacks---were better off under white rule. These
whites claimed that in those African nations that have traded a
whites-only government for a black or mixed one, social conditions have
rapidly deteriorated. Civil wars, economic decline, famine, and unrest,
they predicted, will be the result of allowing the black majority of
South Africa to run the government. **[If such a prediction were
true---and the end of [apartheid has shown]{.mark} that the [prediction
was false]{.mark}---then the [white government]{.mark} of South Africa
[would have been morally justified by utilitarianism]{.mark}, in spite
of its injustice. If our moral decisions are to take into account
considerations of justice, then apparently utilitarianism cannot be the
sole principle guiding our decisions. It can, however, play a role in
these decisions. The principle of [util]{.mark}itarianism invites us to
consider the immediate and the less immediate consequences of our
actions.]{.underline}** Given its insistence on summing the benefits and
harms of all people, **[utilitarianism [asks us to look beyond
self-interest]{.mark} to consider impartially the interests of all
persons affected by our actions]{.underline}**. As John Stuart Mill once
wrote: The happiness which forms the utilitarian standard of what is
right in conduct, is not\...(one\'s) own happiness, but that of all
concerned. As between his own happiness and that of others,
**[utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a
disinterested and benevolent spectator. In an era today that some have
characterized as \"the age of self-interest,\" utilitarianism is a
powerful reminder that [morality calls us to look beyond the
self]{.mark} to the good of all]{.underline}**.

#### Err on the side of probability to check psychological bias toward long improbable internal link chains

**[The [conjunction fallacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** similarly **[[applies
to futurological forecasts]{.mark}. Two independent sets of professional
analysts]{.underline}** at the Second International Congress on
Forecasting **[were asked to rate]{.underline}**, respectively, **[the
probability of "A complete suspension of diplomatic relations between
the USA and the Soviet Union, sometime in 1983" or "A Russian invasion
of Poland, and a complete suspension of diplomatic relations between the
USA and the Soviet Union, sometime in 1983." The second set of analysts
responded with significantly higher probabilities (Tversky and Kahneman
1983). In Johnson et al. (1993),]{.underline}** MBA students at Wharton
were scheduled to travel to Bangkok as part of their degree program.
**[Several groups of students were asked how much they were willing to
pay for terrorism insurance. One group]{.underline}** of subjects **[was
asked how much they were willing to pay for terrorism insurance covering
the flight from Thailand to the US. A second group of subjects was asked
how much they were willing to pay for terrorism insurance covering the
round-trip flight. A third group was asked how much they were willing to
pay for terrorism insurance that covered the complete trip to Thailand.
These three groups responded]{.underline}** with average willingness
**[to pay]{.underline}** of **[\$17.19, \$13.90, and \$7.44
respectively. [According to probability theory, adding]{.mark}
additional [detail]{.mark} onto a story [must render the story less
probable]{.mark}. It is less probable that Linda is a feminist bank
teller than that she is a bank teller, since all feminist bank tellers
are necessarily bank tellers. [Yet human psychology]{.mark} seems to
[follow the rule that adding]{.mark} an additional [detail]{.mark} can
[make the story more plausible]{.mark}.]{.underline}** People might pay
more for international diplomacy intended to prevent nanotechnological
warfare by China, than for an engineering project to defend against
nanotechnological attack from any source. The second threat scenario is
less vivid and alarming, but the defense is more useful because it is
more vague. More valuable still would be strategies which make humanity
harder to extinguish without being specific to nanotechnologic
threats---such as colonizing space, or see Yudkowsky (2008) on AI.
**[Security [expert]{.mark}]{.underline}** Bruce **[Schneier
[observed]{.mark}]{.underline}** [(]{.mark}both before and after the
2005 hurricane in New Orleans) **[that the U.S. government was guarding
specific domestic targets against "movie-plot scenarios" of terrorism,
at the cost of taking away resources from emergency-response
capabilities that could respond to any disaster (Schneier 2005). Overly
[detailed reassurances]{.mark} can also [create false perceptions of
safety: "X is not an existential risk]{.mark} and you don't need to
worry about it, [because A, B, C, D, and E";]{.mark} where the failure
of any one of propositions A, B, C, D, or E [potentially extinguishes
the human species.]{.mark}]{.underline}** "We don't need to worry about
nanotechnologic war, because a UN commission will initially develop the
technology and prevent its proliferation until such time as an active
shield is developed, capable of defending against all accidental and
malicious outbreaks that contemporary nanotechnology is capable of
producing, and this condition will persist indefinitely." **[Vivid,
[specific scenarios]{.mark} can [inflate our probability estimates of
security,]{.mark} as well as [misdirecting defensive investments
into]{.mark} needlessly narrow or implausibly [detailed risk
scenarios.]{.mark}]{.underline}** More generally, **[[people tend to
overestimate conjunctive probabilities]{.mark} and underestimate
disjunctive probabilities (Tversky and Kahneman 1974).]{.underline}**
That is, **[people tend to overestimate the probability that, e.g.,
seven event+s of 90% probability will all occur. Conversely, people tend
to [underestimate]{.mark} the [probability that at least one of seven
events of 10% probability will occur]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Someone
judging whether to, e.g., incorporate a new startup, must evaluate the
probability that many individual events will all go right (there will be
sufficient funding, competent employees, customers will want the
product) while also considering the likelihood that at least one
critical failure will occur (the bank refuses a loan, the biggest
project fails, the lead scientist dies). This may help explain why only
44% of entrepreneurial ventures 2 survive after 4 years (Knaup 2005).
Dawes (1988, 133) observes: "In their summations lawyers avoid arguing
from disjunctions ('either this or that or the other could have
occurred, all of which would lead to the same conclusion') in favor of
conjunctions. **[Rationally, of course, [disjunctions are much more
probable]{.mark}]{.underline}** than are conjunctions." The scenario of
humanity going extinct in the next century is a disjunctive event. It
could happen as a result of any of the existential risks we already know
about---or some other cause which none of us foresaw. Yet for a
futurist, disjunctions make for an awkward and unpoetic-sounding
prophecy.

### Undesirable Brownness

#### American Orientalism has become a double-edged sword---racialization has created "undesirable brownness" and "desirable brownness"---those who are undesirable have become "the terrorist," subjugated by the violence of surveillance, while those who are "desirable" have become an image of America's model minority and the exotic "East"

One day in early October 2001, three weeks after the Al Qaeda attacks on
the World Trade Center and Pentagon, Ansar Mahmood was out delivering
pizzas in the town where he lived and worked in the Hudson River Valley,
north of New York City. Mahmood was a green-card-holding immigrant from
Pakistan. He had recently written to his sister back home about how
beautiful the valley was, and he wanted to send her a picture. That day,
as the sun began to set, he pulled over at a scenic spot and asked two
men who were nearby to take a picture of him against the backdrop of the
serene river and colorful fall foliage. In an interview with author and
activist Irum Shiekh, Mahmood remembered receiving a call from his boss
soon afterward; police were at the pizzeria and wanted to speak to him.
Unknown to Mahmood, the area where he had earlier taken a photo was
close to a water treatment plant. Someone had called the police to
report that a suspicious-looking man had been there, taking photos of
the plant. Mahmood would spend most of the next three and a half years
incarcerated in detention centers with other South Asian and Muslim men,
and in and out of courts fighting for his release. While authorities
found no evidence to support terrorism charges against Mahmood, they
prosecuted him for helping two friends from Pakistan, who---again,
unknown to him---had stayed in the United States after their visas
expired. Ansar Mahmood was one of countless Sikh, Muslim, and
"Muslim-looking" immigrants and citizens who bore the weight of the
backlash that unfolded across the United States following the 9/11
attacks. In schools, Muslim and South Asian American children and youth
were harassed and bullied. The [[FBI]{.underline}]{.mark} and local
police [[agencies put]{.mark} an unknown number of [Muslim Americans
under surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[monitoring]{.mark}
email and phone [communications and]{.mark} social media activity, and
[infiltrated Muslim]{.mark} communities and [places of
worship]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thousands of men and women who were deemed
"suspicious" by authorities or citizens or who were found to have minor
immigration infractions were arrested, detained, and deported.
[Others]{.underline}, such as Balbir Singh Sodhi, Waqar Hasan, Vasudev
Patel, and Sukhvir Singh [were murdered by self-styled "patriots" in the
gas stations or convenience stores where they worked.]{.underline} In
the American media, images of Muslim terrorists---including,
increasingly, men and women from Pakistan---multiplied: in Hollywood
films, on television, on the news, in popular video games, and in the
rhetoric of anti-Muslim commentators and politicians. In March 2004, as
Ansar Mahmood sat in a federal penitentiary in upstate New York awaiting
"deportation for life" back to Pakistan, Newsweek published an article
entitled "American Masala." The piece was prompted by the arrival of
Andrew Lloyd Webber's lavish, Bollywood-inspired musical Bombay Dreams
on Broadway. Newsweek declared that "\[t\]he timing couldn't be better,"
asserting that the musical, "which tells the story of a young man from
the slums who rises to film stardom," was "an apt metaphor for the
growing visibility of a new generation of South Asians in the United
States . . . who are making their mark everywhere from Hollywood to Wall
Street." The [[article]{.mark} cited South Asian American
bankers]{.underline}, politicians, CEOs and entertainment executives,
alongside authors, actors, and film directors. [It [pointed to the high
profile of South Asians in]{.mark} Silicon Valley and the most [elite
U.S. colleges]{.mark} and universities[, and noted that the]{.mark}
median [income of an Indian American family was 65 percent above
the]{.mark} national [average]{.mark}.]{.underline} While briefly
acknowledging that this did not tell the entire South Asian American
story, the [[article was upbeat as it pointed to "chai at
Starbucks]{.mark},"]{.underline} Punjabi bhangra music on HBO's The
Sopranos, South Asian fashions "at Barney's in Beverley Hills," and
"yoga studios on every corner." A week later, Time Out New York
published a first-of-its-kind South Asian-themed special issue, also
prompted by the opening of Bombay Dreams. Time Out presented a larger
and more varied group of South Asian American musicians, artists, and
writers than Newsweek and explicitly mentioned the post--9/11 backlash
that some members of the community were experiencing. Still, the
[glitter and [excitement of Bollywood seemed to overwhelm the issue's
portrait of "South Asian New York."]{.mark}]{.underline} The colorful
cover of Time Out featured Bombay Dreams' two female leads in bouffant
hairdos, bindis, and flapper-style mini dresses next to the bold
heading: "Spice Girls." The contrast was stark. [[One group of South
Asians had become objects of fear]{.underline}]{.mark} and derision and
targets of immigration enforcement and extra-legal violence. [[Another
group]{.mark} of South Asians [was being heralded for]{.mark} their
social[, economic]{.mark}, and cultural [contributions]{.mark} to the
United States]{.underline}. The aftermath of 9/11 had brought into
relief a deep set of divisions within the South Asian American
community. In some ways, these years called into question the very
utility of "South Asian" as an identity marking the common experiences
of Americans with roots in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri
Lanka­. These were nations that shared colonial histories as different
parts of British India and Ceylon, but they were now divided by
military, religious, and ethnic conflicts on the subcontinent, and their
diasporic communities had significantly different levels of power,
income, and influence in the United States. Initially, [South Asian
Americans of every class, nationality, and religious background seemed
to share equally the fears and dangers of the post--9/11 backlash---of
government profiling and individual acts of violence.]{.underline} This
is a moment historian Vijay Prashad has recently described as "the day
our probation ended." But by 2004, [divisions began to
emerge]{.underline}---between Indians on one side and Pakistanis and
Bangladeshis on the other; Hindus on one side and Muslims and Sikhs on
the other; established, middle- and upper-class immigrants on one side
and recent, working-class immigrants on the other. These divides
occurred in part because some South Asians actively sought to
distinguish and distance themselves from others. But at a deeper level,
the divisions were the result of U.S. government policies that singled
out specific South Asian groups (such as the NSEERS program, which
required the registration of male noncitizens from Pakistan, Bangladesh,
and Afghanistan), and by the onslaught of media that demonized men with
beards and turbans and women with hijabs. By the time Bombay Dreams
opened, the complexities that lay beneath the surface of "South Asian"
identity were flattened into a powerful binary; **[[South Asian
Americans were either model minorities or national
threats.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But this was not merely a post--9/11
phenomenon. In fact, [[the division between the feared and the
desired]{.mark}, the denigrated and the celebrated, [has been a defining
feature of]{.mark} South Asian [racialization]{.mark} in the United
States for over one hundred years.]{.underline} Since the late
nineteenth century when travelers and migrants first began arriving in
significant numbers from British India, [Americans have imagined South
Asians simultaneously as exotic and barbaric, as magical and menacing,
as beneficial and perilous.]{.underline} And for decades, federal
immigration laws and popular culture have worked together to make these
distinctions, to distinguish desirable from undesirable South Asians.
The negative impact of these distinctions is not shared evenly. Today,
such differentiations have their greatest effect on those who are
already most vulnerable---most surveilled and policed---in our
communities: the poor and the working class, recent and undocumented
immigrants, women with dependent immigration status, Muslim and Sikh
women and men. In the thirteen years since 9/11, xenophobia,
Islamophobia, and acts of anti-South Asian, anti-Sikh, and anti-Muslim
violence have remained consistently high, and they show little sign of
abating. Given such stakes, it is important that we understand the
longer history of denigration and celebration---of phobias and
philias---that has defined the experiences of South Asians in the United
States. Fear and Exclusion On an early September night in 1907, fifteen
hundred white lumber mill workers set off on a rampage against Indian
immigrants in the coastal town of Bellingham, Washington. The Indians,
also mill workers, were predominantly from Punjab; most were turbaned
Sikh men. The rioters saw the Indians as aliens, outsiders, and racial
inferiors who were taking away American jobs, jobs that should go to
white men. As they made their way across Bellingham, the mob, according
to historian Joan Jensen, swept down to the waterfront . . . where many
of the Indians lived. Battering down the doors, the mob . . . pocketed
money and jewelry, and dragged Indians from their beds . . . Those who
did not move fast enough were beaten . . . Fifty men stormed the
surrounding mills, pulled Indians from their bunks and began to burn the
bunkhouses. By the end of the night, [two hundred Indian
men]{.underline}, beaten and bruised, [had been rounded up like cattle
into Bellingham's City Hall]{.underline}. Over the next days, most of
the Indians chose to leave Bellingham, and the United States, in search
of work in British Columbia. Local [white residents cheered as their
train rolled out of the station.]{.underline} It is not well known among
Americans today that immigrants from British colonial "India"---that is,
from present-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh---were entering the
United States alongside the Irish, Italians, Greeks, Germans, Poles,
Russians, and other Europeans during the "golden age" of immigration
between the 1890s and 1920s. It is also not well known that, though
their numbers were small, these Indian or "Hindu" migrants ("Hindu"
being a racial term applied to all South Asians) figured prominently in
the public outcry for restrictions on immigration. [Members and
supporters of the West Coast-based Asiatic Exclusion League were the
first to promote the idea that a nefarious horde of "Hindus" was about
to swamp the United States.]{.underline} But [their discourse became
national in scope]{.underline}, and came to include claims that
thousands of Indian and Chinese seamen (the former, primarily Muslims
from present-day Bangladesh) were jumping ship, smuggling drugs, and
engaging in human trafficking through northeastern ports. In the opening
decades of the twentieth century, in newspapers, public speeches, and
congressional testimony, Indian immigrants were portrayed as a looming
threat to the United States. Alongside other Asian laborers, Indians
were viewed in much the same way that immigrants from Mexico, Central
America, Haiti, and elsewhere south of the U.S. border have been in
recent years. At the same time, as historian Seema Sohi has argued,
Indians occupied a unique place in the broader anti-Asian rhetoric of
the early twentieth century. Because Indian nationalist exiles had been
using what they believed to be the safety of U.S. soil to plan and
coordinate anti-colonial activities against the British, they became a
focus of the state's broad efforts to quell political radicalism in the
1910s. While West Coast labor leaders warned of a "Tide of Turbans"
sweeping in from the Pacific to take away American workers' jobs,
congressional advocates for exclusion warned that Indian immigrants were
promoting subversion, Bolshevism, and anarchism, and were a threat to
national security. In 1917 British, Canadian, and U.S. officials
collaborated to round up dozens of Indian men for conspiring to smuggle
arms through the United States to overthrow British rule on the
subcontinent. Their San Francisco trial was not only front-page news
across the country but became the most expensive federal trial up to
that point in American history. The anti-Indian agitation that began
with the 1907 Bellingham riots came to a kind of culmination by 1917. In
early February---a month before the first arrests in the "Hindu-German
Conspiracy" case---Congress passed a sweeping Immigration Act. The Act
capped off thirty-five years of increasingly restrictive anti-Asian
immigration laws that had begun with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.
The 1917 law's key provision broadened the scope of exclusion; it
prohibited all labor immigration from what it defined as the "Asiatic
Barred Zone," a huge swath of territory that stretched from Afghanistan
and the eastern Arabian peninsula in the West to China and the Southeast
Asian archipelago in the East. While immigration had become more and
more difficult for Indian workers in preceding years, crossing the U.S.
border was now a criminal act. Indians who were already in the country
faced other restrictions: laws forbidding them from owning property and,
in 1923, a Supreme Court decision that rendered them ineligible from
becoming U.S. citizens. The early twentieth century is often trumpeted
as the moment in which the United States truly became a "nation of
immigrants." For the vast majority of people from what is now known as
South Asia, it was the moment in which the United States became a nation
of immigrant exclusion. "Incredible India" [What is striking about the
events described above is that they unfolded amid]{.underline} [what was
also the first widespread American fashion for goods, entertainment, and
spirituality from India and **"the Orient**."]{.underline} In recent
years, scholars such as Kristin Hoganson, Holly Edwards, and John K.W.
Tchen have given us a rich portrait of this era. Throughout the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, [[Orientalist ideas about a
mysterious]{.mark}, mystical, and alluring [East]{.mark}---ideas for the
most part rooted in the art, literature, and material spoils of European
colonial encounters---[had traveled across the Atlantic]{.mark},
circulating among the United States' political, economic, and cultural
elites]{.underline}. Following their counterparts in London and Paris,
the upper classes of New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago
outfitted their homes with porcelain from China and Japan; textiles,
embroidery, and brass work from India; and rugs from Afghanistan,
Central Asia, and the Middle East. Then, in the latter half of the
nineteenth century, ["Oriental goods"]{.underline} and the ideas,
images, and desires they evoked, [spread across class lines and to every
corner of the country.]{.underline} The United States was rapidly
transforming into a nation of factories and department stores, of
consumerism and entertainment spectacles. Working- and middle-class
Americans not only had more disposable income than ever before, but, in
the words of cultural historian William Leach, they were now surrounded
by "a new powerful universe of consumer enticements." [There was
something about Western fantasies of India and "the East" that thrived
in this new mass consumer culture]{.underline}. American marketers could
use ideas and images of "India"---largely blurred together with the
Middle East and North Africa---to make their goods and entertainments
more alluring. Consuming goods, reading stories, watching performances,
and witnessing "natives" from "the East" gave ordinary Americans access
to something that was simultaneously exotic and sophisticated. Silks,
perfumes, rugs, and hookahs, along with yoga, mystic philosophies, and
tales of far off colonies, deserts, and jungles, all connected Americans
to a world they imagined as adventurous, magical, spiritual, free from
constraints, and ripe with possibility for refashioning themselves and
their relation to the world. At the same time, it cannot have been a
coincidence that Americans were drawn to the British colonial experience
in India at this very moment---when, after completing its colonial
expansion across North America and taking control of new territories in
the Spanish American War, the United States had become a rising global
power in its own right. There was, in other words, [something else
significant about the idea of "India."]{.underline} [Britain's rule over
India---and all the goods, images, and "knowledge" it
implied---symbolized imperial power itself.]{.underline} For Americans,
to own the goods and consume the stories associated with British
colonial rule on the subcontinent gave them a sense of their own
increasing imperial knowledge and power. At the turn of the twentieth
century, "India" seemed to be everywhere in U.S. consumer culture. [[One
of the earliest Orientalist fantasy]{.mark} images [to enter into
America]{.mark}n mass culture [was that of a maharajah]{.mark}, sultan,
[or]{.mark} amir smoking a hookah, surrounded by dancing [harem
girls]{.mark}]{.underline}. Earlier in the nineteenth century, this
image had been the subject of British, French, and American Orientalist
paintings. By the turn of the twentieth century, scenes of Oriental
harems and palaces turned up in advertisements, on picture postcards,
and on the covers of Tin Pan Alley sheet music. The sexualized figure of
the Eastern dancing girl appeared in spaces of high and low culture
alike. The dancer "Little Egypt" became a national sensation after
performing at the Chicago World's Fair. Isadora Duncan performed her
adaptation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam barefoot and in flowing robes
for the elite women of Newport, Rhode Island. Ruth St. Denis danced in
Indian "nautch" style, in a sari and gold jewelry on a Broadway stage,
while "Oriental dancers" of various backgrounds performed in the
nation's brothels and burlesques. In the meantime, in what Edwards has
described as "the most sustained campaign to capitalize on oriental
motifs," American tobacco companies made the imagery of harems, hookahs,
and palaces central to the marketing of a wide range of their products:
Mecca, Camel, Fatima, Omar, and Mogul cigarettes, Hindoo pipe tobacco,
Royal Bengal cigars. One 1915 advertisement for Mogul Cigarettes showed
the silhouette of a cigarette-smoking, turbaned Mughal emperor, reposing
on a pillow under the Saracen arches of his palace as he watches a
curvaceous dancing girl; nearby, two musicians play, an attendant waves
a fan above him, a servant approaches with a steaming teapot (drawn to
evoke Aladdin's magic lamp), and a male guard stands by, wielding a
scimitar-shaped sword. The popularity of such imagery among American men
suggests a kind of imperial envy; a fantasy in which they could step
into the imagined world of the British empire, supplant the maharajahs
and amirs of that world, and take possession of their riches as well as
their sexually adventurous, compliant young "nautch girls." The same
fantasy world connected American women to a different sexual imaginary[.
Middle-class white women encountered notions of Oriental princes,
palaces, and harems in the rapidly expanding realm of popular fashion
and home décor.]{.underline} As elite suffragists challenged political
exclusion and the varied confines and restrictions of Victorian
womanhood, U.S. women's magazines and department stores marketed---and
middle-class women increasingly bought---the ornate flowing silks and
cottons, perfumes and interior furnishings associated with "nautch"
dancers, harem "maidens" and their imagined worlds. As Hoganson, Gina
Marchetti and others have argued, wearing and displaying Eastern
fabrics, jewelry, and decorative items became ways for the American "new
woman" to stake a claim to independence, sophistication, and ultimately,
a liberated, post-Victorian sexuality. If turn-of-the-century Americans
were drawn to the sensuality of the harem, they were equally drawn to
the spirituality of yoga and Hindu philosophy. The most prominent
emissaries of Hindu thought from this period were the Vedantist Swamis
Vivekananda and Abhedananda, whose lectures in the United States were
widely covered in the press as they themselves filled public halls from
New York to San Francisco. Today the Vedantists are most well-remembered
for the following they developed among urban elites, but Vedantism
perhaps had its greatest impact in other social realms. In 1898 a local
Nebraskan paper that printed one of Abhedananda's lectures described him
as a bearer of ancient occult powers and presented his lecture as a rare
revelation of the "secrets" and "marvelous psychic powers" of "Hindu
sages." It was in this vein---as a corpus of ancient Hindu secrets that
promised self-improvement, self-empowerment, and occult power---that
Vedantism spread widely across the U.S. popular consciousness. This was
in no small measure due to the efforts of William Walker Atkinson, a
former lawyer from Chicago who founded a mail-order book business, the
Yogi Publication Society. Under a series of "Indian" pseudonyms---Yogi
Ramacharaka, Swami Panchadasi, Swami Bhakta Vishita---Atkinson wrote and
sold an astonishing number of books on "Yogi Science" and "Oriental
Occultism." Atkinson appears to have operated like a one-man production
line, taking the books and lectures of the Vedantists, reworking them to
appeal to the desires and sensibilities of the American mass market, and
then branding them with "East Indian" names for authenticity. In this
process, Atkinson often turned Vedantist ideas on their heads,
presenting them as principles for achieving the most worldly of goals.
In one text, for example, Atkinson (as Ramacharaka) explains a key idea
of karma yoga---selfless work toward the betterment of the world---by
citing an American "captain of industry" who declared "I cannot help but
feeling . . . that the things I do are done for some other people,
possibly the race . . . I get no special pleasure from my money,
although I feel a keen interest in the game of making it." Atkinson's
approach provided a blueprint for any number of Americans, up to the New
Age and yoga entrepreneurs of the present day, who have sold South Asian
philosophical and religious ideas as avenues to individual power and
success. In this sense, Atkinson differed little from the American
tobacco companies of his era---he too turned notions of an exotic "East"
into profit in the West. It was through circuses and exhibitions,
however, that fantasies of India appear to have reached the widest
audience and reaped the greatest returns. In many ways, "Oriental"
empires in the Western imagination---with their lavish displays of
wealth and color, their air of the magical and the mystical---were
tailor-made for turn-of-the-century American showmen, who sought to draw
in audiences and outdo competitors with their offerings of dazzle,
wonder, and pageantry. Between the 1890s and 1910s, Indian and
"Oriental" themes, stories, and visual tableaux multiplied across the
many forms of American mass entertainment, from New Orleans' Mardi Gras
parades, to Coney Island, to Barnum & Bailey's circuses and the Wild
West shows of Buffalo and Pawnee Bill. According to curator and
historian Jennifer Lemmer Posey, during this era American circuses began
to open each performance by staging a large-scale themed procession.
These spectacles often centered on the world's great empires, and
"Oriental" and British colonial themes became some of the most common.
Barnum & Bailey staged Oriental India in 1896, The Mahdi, or for the
Victoria Cross in 1897, and The Wizard Prince of Arabia, an "Indo-Arabic
Spectacle," in 1914. The poster for the latter was bright and lavish,
featuring elephants, camels, musicians, dancing women, and bearded,
turbaned men stretching to the horizon. Bold headlines promised
audiences "1250 Actors and Actresses, 300 Dancing Girls . . . and 250
Singers in Weird Oriental Choruses." Audiences in every corner of the
United States were drawn to such spectacles; for most Americans, these
were probably the most immediate encounters with "India" and "Indians"
that they had ever had. Desirable and Undesirable Brownness Between 1904
and 1917, [[while]{.mark} working-class and expatriate [Indians were
targeted in acts of xenophobic violence]{.mark}]{.underline}, denounced
as economic and political threats and marked for exclusion, [white
[Americans continued to fantasize about exotic "India,"]{.mark} which
provided a seemingly endless supply of material for
consumption.]{.underline} However, then as now, [xenophobia and
Indophilia were not simply contradictory attitudes that played out in
two separate social spheres---that is, South Asians were not simply
denigrated in political debates over immigration restriction while they
were simultaneously celebrated in popular culture.]{.underline} Instead,
**[[each sphere generated its own set of distinctions between who was
desirable and who was not,]{.mark} and each set of distinctions
reinforced the other.]{.underline}** The anti-Asian immigration laws of
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are commonly known as
"exclusion acts" and the years that they were in effect as the
"exclusion era." However, the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, the 1885 Alien
Contract Labor Law, and the 1917 Immigration Act were never
straightforward acts of Asian exclusion, nor was the 1965 Hart-Cellar
Immigration Act---the law that is credited with ending the exclusion
era---an act that fully "opened the door" to Asian immigration. All four
of these Acts---in effect and in intent---helped define who within Asian
populations was welcome and who was not. In crafting the restrictions of
the 1882, 1885, and 1917 Acts, U.S. lawmakers delineated specific
categories of Asians who were, in fact, legally permitted to enter the
United States, to be educated here, and to work. These "provisos" that
were tacked onto the exclusion laws, in different combinations and at
different times, permitted entry of: merchants, students, the servants
of traveling royalty and foreign government officials, "professional
actors, artists, lecturers, or singers," workers with specialized skills
not available in the United States, "government officers, ministers . .
. missionaries, lawyers, physicians, chemists, civil engineers, . . .
authors," as well as nurses and "persons belonging to any recognized
learned profession." Although the number of South Asian immigrants
entering under these exemptions was small, the so-called exclusion laws
introduced a logic that certain South Asians were admissible---or
desirable---because of their class, education, and profession. This was
ultimately the logic enshrined in the "occupational preferences"
provisions of the 1965 Immigration Act; the legislation brought
thousands of South Asian doctors, engineers, and other professionals to
the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, while keeping working-class
migration to a minimum. In mass culture, [[distinctions between the
desirable and undesirable South Asian]{.mark} largely [came in the form
of specific "positive" and "negative"
**representations**]{.mark}**;**]{.underline} if the prince or swami was
an object of fascination and even admiration, the laborer, servant or
"lascar" seaman was an object of ridicule (a heavily accented,
solicitous buffoon) or inspired suspicion and fear. These images were
plentiful, for example, in turn-of-the-century news stories describing
the Muslim ship workers from the subcontinent who were a growing
presence in U.S. ports. A 1910 article in the Los Angeles Times was
typical; the writer described the ship's Punjabi engine crew as "both
striking and mysterious. They \[have\] hooked noses and piercing black
eyes that seem to stab you to the backbone when they turn to look you
over." In other media, including adventure stories in popular magazines
and early silent films, the same maharajahs and amirs whose images were
used to sell tobacco were presented as villainous enslavers of white
women, while the same Oriental dancing girls who were objects of desire
for American men were portrayed as devious and ready to ensnare them.
The fact that such [racial representations could be slippery,
contradictory, and malleable is perhaps unsurprising.]{.underline} But
the images of East Indians that circulated in turn-of-the-century mass
culture set up another, more significant distinction---not between the
(desirable) wise swami and the (undesirable) malicious lascar, but
between the (desirable) imaginary Indian and the (undesirable) Indian
immigrant. To put it differently: in the realm of culture, Indians were
desirable to the extent that they lived up to American expectations of
India. The fantasies became the standard up to which real people were
held. Dance historian Priya Srinivasan provides a case in point in her
account of the first performance by a troupe of actual Indian "nautch"
dancers in New York City. Before the troupe arrived in 1880, any number
of images of Eastern dancing girls had been produced by Western writers,
painters, performers, and advertisers---usually slim, fair-skinned women
in sheer, flowing fabrics. When American audiences were faced with the
difference between these imagined "Oriental maidens" and real Indian
women performing on a New York stage, the Indian women were swiftly
denigrated and dismissed. "\[A\]udiences were shocked by the color of
the dancers' skin," and disappointed by their "lack of eroticism." One
reviewer described the troupe's dances as "exceedingly grotesque," while
another asserted that "the order of intellectual development to which
they belong is apparently not high." Acceptability Politics As
Srinivasan argues, [[American Orientalism is]{.mark} too often [seen as
a "positive" set of ideas about "the East]{.mark}"]{.underline} that,
while shallow and stereotypical, does little damage beyond justifying
Western appropriation of Eastern "cultures." White Americans' embrace of
yoga, bindis, belly dancing, and henna "tattoos," or their celebration
of immigrant "success" (praising South Asians for being naturally smart,
spiritual, or hard-working) is seen, in other words, as a kind of
"benign" racism[[. But Orientalism is a double-edged set of
ideas]{.mark}, standards, and expectations. In the realms of both
immigration law and popular culture, [the desired and the denigrated
have **always been inextricably linked**]{.mark}; they are defined in
relation to one another, with a line drawn between them.]{.underline} If
South Asian Americans cannot prove that we belong on one side of the
line, then we fall on the other. Today, "desirable" South Asian
Americans are defined in much the same way as they were at the turn of
the twentieth century. Those who are most celebrated (in mainstream
venues as well as community-based media) look almost identical to those
who were singled out for admission to the United States a century ago
when the majority was excluded: the "actors, artists, lecturers,
singers, lawyers, physicians, civil engineers, authors" who were allowed
entry by the "provisos" of the 1917 Asiatic Barred Zone Act. At the same
time, South Asians who can provide white Americans with access to the
East of their imaginings---the self-help gurus who bestow ancient
wisdom, the chefs who reveal the secrets of spice, the performers who
give their audiences a taste of the exotic, or the ethnic organizations
whose colorful yearly parades add to the multicultural mix of
America---are lauded, too. In many ways, [today's ["undesirable]{.mark}"
South Asians [are]{.mark} also [defined in terms]{.mark} similar to
those [of]{.mark} a hundred years ago.]{.underline} [Like Ansar
Mahmood]{.underline} and the workers of Bellingham, those who bore the
brunt of special registrations, [[FBI raids]{.mark}, detentions, [and
deportations]{.mark} in the years since 9/11, [and]{.mark} those most
targeted in acts of [xenophobic violence]{.mark}, have been recent
working-class immigrants]{.underline}---taxi drivers, convenience store
clerks, shop workers, gas station attendants---and those who displayed
outward markers of their ethnicity and faith. What we now know as the
"Islamophobia industry"---the commentators, politicians, church and
white supremacist groups, and the [think tanks and policy organizations
that produce a constant flow of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant
rhetoric---functions much as the Asiatic Exclusion League once
did]{.underline}; [they trade in the same sorts of fear-mongering and
violence.]{.underline} Yet, we live in a different time. The United
States no longer receives its notions about South Asia and "the East"
second-hand from imperial Britain. The [[**U**.S. military is engaged in
its own imperial pursuits stretching from Iraq and Yemen]{.mark} to
Afghanistan and Pakistan]{.underline}, [while record numbers of
Americans travel to India and Nepal each year as spiritual and
"wellness" tourists.]{.underline} These entanglements supply Americans
with a steady stream of images of a simultaneously threatening and
exotic twenty-first century "Orient." At home, [the [power]{.mark} and
resources [of anti-Muslim]{.mark} and anti-immigrant [groups]{.mark}
[continue to grow,]{.mark} [as does the consumption of "Eastern"
cultural commodities]{.mark} by average Americans.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, South Asian, Arab, and immigrant Muslim Americans now number
in the millions in this country, and as wars and other conflicts rage in
our countries of origin, we face the fallout on our doorsteps. [Since
9/11,]{.underline} in other words, the dividing [line between the
celebrated and the denigrated has sharpened, and the stakes of being on
one side or the other, heightened.]{.underline} But South Asian American
history shows us that it is not enough merely to prove that we belong on
the "acceptable" side of the dividing line. Such an approach does
nothing more than strengthen the racial ideas that have defined and
limited us as a group since the early 1900s. [If we value justice more
than mere assimilation, we must join the growing number of immigrant
rights, African American, Sikh, and Muslim American activists and
critics, who are no longer focused on moving our communities from
unacceptable to acceptable, but are instead challenging the terms of our
acceptability.]{.underline}

### Islamophobia

#### Orientalism has a clear relationship with Islamophobia

**Beck et al. 17** \[Elizabeth Beck is a professor in the School of
Social Work at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies., 4-1-2017,

2017 - Issue 2\]//AA

The Runnymede Trust (1997) defines **[[Islamophobia]{.mark} as
"unfounded hostility towards Muslims, and therefore fear or [dislike
of]{.mark} all or most [Muslims]{.mark}."]{.underline}** Because our
discussion centers on anti-Arab and anti-Muslim oppression, it is
important to note that neither do all Arabs identify as Muslims, nor are
the majority of Muslims Arab. Our use of the terms Muslim, Arab, and
individuals of Arab descent includes people who claim these identities,
as well as those who are marked as such. Singh (2016) uses the term
apparently Muslim to explain the ways in which brown skin and other
markers are used to categorize and oppress individuals who may be from a
variety of backgrounds. We further note that **[Islamophobia is used to
describe a form of [racism]{.mark} that [lumps together disparate
peoples. Orientalism]{.mark} and Orientalist views [underlie]{.mark} the
production, reproduction, and acceptability of
[Islamophobia]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Orientalism is the mechanism
that [supports]{.mark} unfounded [hostilities]{.mark} toward people
holding or perceived as holding Arab and/or Muslim identities, and it is
used to describe a form of racism.]{.underline}** We use the term in
both instances, in much the same way that people use bigotry as both one
of the mechanisms that support racism and as a form of racism. We focus
on Arab Orientalism, which includes people from countries in the
southern end of the Levant and the eastern end of the Maghreb. Like
other authors who explore gendered Orientalism, we also include
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran in our discussions. When exploring
stereotypical or Orientalist images, we use the signifiers **[Arab,
Muslim, and brown.]{.underline}** These signifiers **[emphasize the
conflated nature of racial and religious constructs within Orientalism.
We use brown to highlight the ways in which [Islam]{.mark} has been
[racialized by the West]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We use the ideas
associated with whiteness, for example, "an ideology blinding people to
a silent and invisible mainstream benchmark" (Baltra-Ulloa, 2013, p. 94)
to explore Orientalism within in the context of hegemony and cultural
dominance (e.g., White/Western/Christian/hetero-normative).

#### Orientalism and Islamophobia cause oppression, furthers the War on Terror, and legitimizes violence against women

**Beck et al. 17** \[Elizabeth Beck is a professor in the School of
Social Work at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies., 4-1-2017,

**[Harmful consequences of Orientalism and Islamophobia]{.underline}**
As is the case for any form of racism, **[there are transnational and
national [consequences for oppressed]{.mark} individuals and
groups.]{.underline}** In order to support a larger framing of
Islamophobia, we provide macro examples that comport with social work's
support of social justice and Mukherjee and Chowdhury's (2014) call for
international social work that understands the dynamics of imperialism.
A number of Arab, Arab-American, Muslim, queer, cultural, and
postcolonial scholars argue that **[gendered [Orientalist]{.mark} visual
[rep]{.mark}resentation[s]{.mark} of the Eastern Other have been
deployed to [further]{.mark} the [war on terror]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(see, for example, Abdulhadi, Alsultany, & Naber, 2011; Abu-Lughod,
2013; Naber, 2012; Stabile & Kumar, 2005). The authors note, for
example, how prolific and sensationalized images of repressed women in
burqas provided additional liberal support to a controversial war in
Afghanistan. For example, in the 18 months following September 11th,
there was a six-fold increase in the number of newspaper articles
focusing on women in Afghanistan (Stabile & Kumar, 2005), including
descriptions of burqas as body bags and trash bags. Abu-Lughod (2013)
and Naber (2012) argue that **[the [West's]{.mark} support of
[dictatorship]{.mark}, globalization, occupation, war, and drone
strikes, all of which are associated with the war on terror, have
[devastating effects on indigenous
pop]{.mark}ulation[s.]{.mark}]{.underline}** However, the above
circumstances and events, as Abu Lughod and Naber point out, are glossed
over. Thus **[the dominate vision of horrific events in the Middle East
is limited to [violence against women]{.mark}, which both
[absolves]{.mark} the [West of]{.mark} its [violent acts]{.mark} and
keeps attention from the devastating effects of dictatorship,
globalization, occupation, war, poverty, and drone
strikes.]{.underline}** Scholars further discuss the way in which
**[[West]{.mark}ern interventions [delegitimize]{.mark} local and
indigenous feminist and governmental [responses to violence and
oppression.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Abu-Lughod (2013) provides an example
as she argues that the process of court reform in Pakistan lost momentum
and strength when problems, rather than progress, were highlighted in
Western media. Kahf (2011) argues that **[the exaggerated nature of the
Pity Committee leads to an exaggerated response in which gender
oppression is denied by defenders of Islam.]{.underline}** According to
Kahf (2011), **[Orientalism creates the conditions in which authentic
conversation cannot materialize, therefore eluding "genuine complex
analysis of gender relations in the world of Islam"]{.underline}** (p.
121) **[by its [exaggerated]{.mark} description of [violence against
women.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Naber (2012) similarly found, in her
research with Arab American youth, that **[Orientalism makes it very
difficult for Arabs in the United States to talk openly about and
address sexism and homophobia within their own communities because of
fears related to reinforcing Orientalist views.]{.underline}** She
additionally argues that **[attributing violence against Arab women by
Arab men exclusively to culture erases the role of colonization,
imperialism, compulsive heterosexuality, and global support of
patriarchy in the lives of Arabs, Arab Americans, and
Muslims]{.underline}** (Naber, 2012). This narrow discourse can also
lend itself to **[[internalized oppression]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which
is of critical importance to human service workers. A number of Muslim,
Arab, and Arab American feminists and LBGTQ scholars and activists
discuss the ways in which the **[[West's defining of the East's problems
takes attention from their]{.mark} own work in the areas of activism,
[scholarship]{.mark}, and reform.]{.underline}** Specifically, when
individuals working in these spheres must take time from their agendas
to respond to erroneous or exaggerated claims about Islam (Jarmakani,
2010; Naber, 2012). Of interest to social workers in the West is the way
in which **[[a hyper-emphasis on gender-based violence in the East
diminishes the reality of violence and discrimination in the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline}** For example, the 1,000 or
so women who are killed under the pretext of "honor" in Pakistan often
receive more attention than the 1,500 killed in "crimes of passion" in
the United States (Charania, 2014). While **[the [West
attributes]{.mark} honor [crimes to]{.mark} such factors as the
patriarchy of [Islam]{.mark}, the attendant subordination of women, and
a culture of [violence]{.mark}, similar factors are [not]{.mark} always
equally [embraced in]{.mark} the West's [narrative]{.mark} about its own
violence against women, despite its known ubiquitous
nature.]{.underline}**

### Racist

#### Orientalist discourse serves to subjugate "The Other" to endless racialized violence for the sustenance of whiteness

The affective power of the images, however, is not secured by what they
simply wish to signify, but rather, in how they accomplish it. In the
Western imagination, they cannot be conceived in any other way than
being manufactured. Yet, the boundary between what these photographs
denote and connote is seemingly rendered impossible to maintain or
grasp. Their imaginary force works by a monstrous transgressive
immediacy which threatens to short-circuit the ordered Manichean
representational schema of the "West and the Rest. " Islamic culture, as
the absolute Other of the West, has been unleashed ---and Islamaphobia
rationalized**[. The original [suspicion of racialized Others as
a]{.mark}n external [threat to]{.mark} security and culture of [the
West]{.mark} [materializes]{.mark} into a paranoid reality. The
[threat]{.mark} has [transmuted]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, and it
is **[now as much from within than without: Al-Qaeda really are
everywhere, and unstoppable because of their haunting
omnipresence.]{.underline}** Bush 's twin declarations of the "**[war
against terror]{.underline}**ism " and the "**[axis of
evil]{.underline}** " not only seek to **[[reassert]{.mark} an
[imperialist hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}** through an incredulous
bifurcation of global political relations, they also **[express the
[dread of]{.mark} contagion in the fear of [losing control]{.mark}
.]{.underline}** The Islamicized representations of the West described
above are not the hybrid cosmopolitanism envisaged by the political
imaginary of a liberal multiculturalism. **[The [identity and
superiority of the West]{.mark} has traditionally been [discursively
produced by Orientalist systems of representation]{.mark} [based on
maintaining a rigid]{.mark} and absolute [difference against its "Other.
"]{.mark}]{.underline}** However, Edward Said alludes to an ambivalence
in the **[[Western]{.mark} fascination and [fear of the Other]{.mark}
that lies [at the heart of]{.mark} the [discourse of Orientalism.
If,]{.mark}]{.underline}** following Said, the
**[[representations]{.mark} of the East (as despotic, barbaric, exotic,
sensuous, spiritual . . .) are actually disavowed Western projections on
to the Other, what happens when this material, imaginary, and
representational boundary appears to breakdown and
implode?]{.underline}** Our contention is that **[contemporary
Orientalism is figured on a boundary in jeopardy of being unable to
maintain its own apparatus of power. This is not to say that Orientalism
's disciplinary capacity has been diminished. As a matter of fact, the
[Western]{.mark} multicultural [desire for otherness]{.mark} is a motor
force [to a deterritorializing capitalism]{.mark} in the new globalizing
Empire]{.underline}** (Hardt and Negri 2000). Nevertheless**[, [as the
consumption of otherness accelerates]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the
fractured global economy of racialized bodies, information, media,
fashion, ethnic cuisine, and displaced labor, **[[Orientalism]{.mark}'s
ability to regulate and objectify the Other has [become increasingly
vexatious.]{.mark} Contemporary Orientalism is confronted, infiltrated,
and defied by its own abjured structure of exclusion. Considered as a
historically specific [racializing regime of power]{.mark}--- knowledge
fixated on difference, [Orientalism]{.mark} has been, par excellence, a
[cultural racism]{.mark}. Perhaps this accounts for why the
[relationship between Orientalism and Whiteness]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(as an exnominated racial category) has been
**[[underplayed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this article, we wish to
explore how a **[contemporary Orientalism]{.underline}**, as inscribed
in cosmopolitan culture, **[is intimately [tied to]{.mark} the
production of a [paranoid white subjectivity]{.mark}. The political
necessity of "[making whiteness strange]{.mark}" in order [to divest its
power]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Dyer 1997) **[is [not]{.mark}, however,
the [key concern]{.mark} here, as [identifying white paranoia does
not]{.mark} necessarily [undo]{.mark} its agency or
[violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Our intention is to
**[[interrogate]{.mark} a contemporary [politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(pathology) **[[of a self-fashioning Whiteness]{.mark},]{.underline}**
whose empty universality as the measure of humanity is unraveling in the
age of Empire. **[Orientalism Now]{.underline}** . . . **[Empire
establishes no territorial centre of power and does not rely on fixed
boundaries or barriers. It is a decentred and deterritorializing
apparatus of rule that progressively incorporates the entire global
realm within its open, expanding frontiers.]{.underline}** Empire
manages hybrid identities, flexible hierarchies, and plural exchanges
through modulating networks of command (Hardt and Negri 2000: xiii). In
their sweeping account of the emergence of a new post-imperialist
political constitution of world order, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri
insist that fixed boundaries and limits are no longer the defining
features of an "inclusive" Empire. **[On the contrary, mobile borders
and the multiplicity of difference, labor, and commodities are the drive
and desire of Empire. The authors announce that a new operation of power
and rule has emerged---a global postmodern sovereignty---which thrives
on "differential hierarchies" and "hybrid fragmented subjectivities."
They contrast this with the essentializing power of imperialism, in its
will to [manage]{.mark} the [Other through colonial terror and
domination]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The **["crisis of
modernity"]{.underline}** has been most **[acutely expressed in the
invariable exigency of a Manichean division between an emergent Europe
and its abject Other.]{.underline}** That which is **[excluded and
negated gives birth to a positive identity for the European
colonizer]{.underline}** (Said 1978). Said has cogently argued that the
inverted absolute difference of the Other is essential for the
possibility and maintenance of a superior Occident. **[The requisite
Other is then not what is merely excluded, but has to be acknowledged at
the same time.]{.underline}** Hardt and Negri take this up when they
highlight that the **[dialectical recognition of otherness is an
"intimate" kind of estrangement for the colonizer.]{.underline}** They
write: Knowing, seeing, and even touching the colonized is essential,
even if this knowledge and contact take place only on the plane of
representation . . . **[This intimacy in no way blurs the division
between the two identities in struggle, but only makes more important
that the boundaries and purity of identities be policed]{.underline}**
(Hardt and Negri 2000: 127). **[It was Frantz
[Fanon]{.mark}]{.underline}** (1986) **[who clearly
[demonstrated]{.mark} that the [policing of]{.mark} the [racial/cultural
boundary]{.mark} was a profound [site of anxiety for]{.mark} the [white
European]{.mark}. In reality, its transgression (and violent
consequences for the Other) has been the norm rather than the exception.
But it is the ineluctable necessity of upholding and sustaining the
besieged boundary of absolute difference that produces such
dread.]{.underline}** Why else, as Homi Bhabha (1994: 77) contends, are
"the **[same old stories of Negro's animality]{.underline}**, the
Coolie's inscrutability . . . told (compulsively) again and afresh . .
."? **[In their exposition of Empire, Hardt and Negri read postcolonial
theory as importantly deconstructing and challenging essentialist racial
binaries of modernity. Yet they accuse theorists such as Bhabha and Said
as operating with an anachronistic dialectical notion of colonial power
that can only seek to displace a binaristic hierarchy, by the
postcolonial incantation of hybridity and difference. The failure to
fully grasp the new modality of a decentered and deterritorializing
global power, results in postcolonial theory marking the shift towards
Empire, rather than being able to challenge its extant form of
rule]{.underline}**. This is not the place to challenge Hardt and
Negri's rather reductive reading of what they characterize as
"post-colonial theory." However, their project compels us to consider
how Orientalism operates in the age of Empire. Even though
**[[Orientalism's]{.mark} bifurcating [racialized
structure]{.mark}]{.underline}** (inside/ outside) **[appears to be [at
odds with]{.mark} the [subsumption of difference in Empire]{.mark}, what
unites the discourses of Orientalism and Empire is the interest in
(cultural) difference.]{.underline}** "**[Real
subsumption]{.underline}**," according to Hardt and Negri, has no
"outside" for the expansion of capitalism. It does not exclusively lead
to the exclusion or obliteration of difference; rather, it can
equivocally produce differential hierarchies and hybrid subjectivities
in the incorporation of all forms of life. These authors argue that the
racism of Empire is a cultural (or imperial) neo-racism of segregation,
which primarily integrates others (differences are ordered and
controlled). It is distinguished from the colonial racism of division
and hierarchy, which takes place across the racial boundary of
Self/Other (differences are excluded and negated). Following Deleuze and
Guattari, they contend that cultural racism needs to be conceived as a
"strategy of differential inclusion," as opposed to the absolute
exclusion of the Other. White supremacy functions . . . through engaging
alterity and then subordinating differences according to degrees of
deviance from whiteness. This has nothing to do with the hatred and fear
of the strange, unknown Other. It is a hatred born in proximity and
elaborated through degrees of difference of the neighbor. . .
Subordination is enacted in regimes of everyday practices that are more
mobile and flexible but that create racial hierarchies that are
nonetheless stable and brutal (Hardt and Negri 2000: 194). While these
authors properly maintain that a contemporary racism "rests on the play
of differences" instead of a Manichean bio-racial divide, Policar (1990:
100) reminds us that the two formulations "easily flow into each other
and so that they cannot be found in a pure state." The issue is not just
one of historical specificity, as the **[practice of [Western
racism]{.mark} has been [irrevocably imbricated with
culture]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see Young 1995). To highlight, contra
Hardt and Negri, that **[[Orientalist discourses]{.mark} have
[embodied]{.mark} both [colonial and cultural
racisms]{.mark}]{.underline}** is an obvious but **[necessary point to
make.]{.underline}** Arguably, **[the marking of "cultural"
otherness]{.underline}** has been the **[cardinal [differentialist
racializing operation of Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Said
observed a shift in the regime of colonial power during the nineteenth
century which "**[turned the Orient from an alien into colonial
space]{.underline}**" (1978: 211). This materialization of power over
the "Orient" attempted to penetrate its "cultural, temporal, and
geographical distance . . . expressed in metaphors of depth, secrecy and
sexual promise . . . the 'veils of an Eastern bride' or 'the inscrutable
Orient'\..." (Said 1978: 222). The **[closing down of distance between
the West and its Other in the actual encounter with the spaces and
bodies of the "Orient" did not result in existing boundaries melting
away.]{.underline}** **[Colonial governmentality]{.underline}** was
onerously **[preoccupied with maintaining a racial and cultural divide.
For the colonizer, the ambivalent coupling between racism and sexualized
desire for the Other was undoubtedly the most destabilizing and perverse
to police. And the popular colonial tales of Westerners "going native"
or insane in exotic foreign lands were thinly disguised warnings for not
getting too close to the Other.]{.underline}** As Deborah Root notes,
the **[[exoticism of the Other]{.mark} has worked]{.underline}**: . . .
**[by [generating]{.mark} excitement and [delirium]{.mark} precisely
[from the viewer's ambivalent relationship to difference]{.mark},
qualities that in one context are classified as negative---[such as
violence]{.mark}---can with the proper distance produce delight, desire,
and of course, the edge of danger and ambiguity that supplies an added
frisson]{.underline}** (1995: 34).

#### **Westerncentric political discourses engage in a process of constant othering, where "The Other" is always depicted as subhuman and subjected to endless violence -- turns case**

**Garcia 19**(Paola Garcia, Sep 22, 2019, \"On Orientalism and the
Dehumanization of the Other,\" Inside Arabia,
https://insidearabia.com/on-orientalism-and-the-dehumanization-of-the-other/)**//BRownRice**

**[The [dehumanization of the "Other"]{.mark} is at the core of most of
humanity's tragedies]{.underline}**. It is **[[responsible for all
manner of violence]{.mark},]{.underline}** whether physical, spiritual,
or intellectual. Nationalism necessarily places one's culture as
superior to all others, making that which is culturally different
inferior and less human, rendering it at worst inert material to be
subjugated for one's benefit and at best a mere source of entertainment.
We live in a time plagued by these issues. **[We are encountering
[terrifying ideologies and politics]{.mark} that are [racist to their
core]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We are dealing with the resurgence of
fascism, neo-Nazism, white supremacism, institutionally endorsed racial,
sexual and gender discrimination, walls, apartheids, anti-immigrant
laws, and it goes on and on. **[These [catastrophes]{.mark} all [stem
from "othering,"]{.mark} that is, from thinking that those who are
different from us are inferior and threatening by
default.]{.underline}** **[Behind the othering lens, there is little
room to acknowledge the humanity inherent in every single culture and
individual.]{.underline}** The Quran fittingly states, "We have . . .
made you into nations and tribes, so that you might come to know one
another."\[2\] Citing scripture carries the risk of being perceived as
irrational and unaware of what is appropriate in intellectual discourse.
However, if we disregard the source and focus on the idea itself, we
will find it extremely pertinent to the discussion. The notion of
knowing one another is crucial because it implies a relationship of
equals. It assumes the existence of a common denominator between them:
humanity. This understanding appears, regrettably, to be lacking in
today's world. In Timothy Mitchell's excellent book, Colonizing Egypt,
**[we learn that "We" have been attempting to know not each other, but
the "Other," the lesser object of our exploitative designs. This "We"
can stand for any individual, discipline, institution or nation that
systematically [views cultures other than its own as inferior
and]{.mark} often, even [subhuman]{.mark}, a view which nationalism
tends to produce and promote]{.underline}**. In the United States, we
presently have a president who unapologetically brags about his racist
views and boasts about the supposed inferiority of cultures different
from his own. This tragically deranged man has fought and continues to
fight tooth and nail to have these chauvinistic views implemented as the
laws of our land: travel bans for Muslims, a wall to keep "threatening
intruders" away, racial slurs turned into political slogans, immigrants
in cages, children dying in detention centers, away from their parents,
etc. The appalling examples abound. **[[In the Trump era,
xenophobia]{.mark}, narcissism, and anger have become [normalized
and]{.mark} even [glorified]{.mark}, seen as an effective means to make
our country "great."]{.underline}** In the Trump era, xenophobia,
narcissism, and anger have become normalized and even glorified, seen as
an effective means to make our country "great." The situation is
heartbreaking, and only by reflecting and fixing our hearts about how
each of us sees "others" can we begin to veer from the destructive path
we are on. Professor Edward Said 1935 2003 Professor Edward Said
(1935-2003) This type of bigotry has its counterpart in the intellectual
world. As Edward Said articulately explains in Identity, Authority and
Freedom: "**[If the authority granted our own culture carries with it
the authority to perpetuate cultural hostility, then a true academic
freedom is very much at risk, having as it were conceded that
intellectual discourse must worship at the altar of national identity
and thereby denigrate or diminish others]{.underline}**."\[3\] Said, who
had several conflicting identities, including Palestinian, American, and
academic, asserted that he found it impossible to identify with the
"triumphalism of one identity because the loss and deprivation of the
others are so much more urgent." Similarly, citing Said, Nora Akawi
explains that **["'[to make the practice of intellectual discourse
dependent on conformity to a predetermined political ideology']{.mark}
or predetermined canon of learning, western or other . . . '[is to
nullify intellect altogether]{.mark}.'"]{.underline}**\[4\] **[And this
is what has happened in much of our learning about "other" cultures,
learning which [promotes]{.mark} the [views]{.mark} [that lead to
today's devastating politics]{.mark}. "We" have "triumphed" in defining
"our" culture as superior and this gives "us" the right to look down at
whatever "we" want, in whatever form "we" want and for whatever purpose
"we" deem worthy. This triumph has come at a great loss.]{.underline}**
The price of excluding all the others is actual poverty of the spirit,
allowing us to keep only "dust", projections, and imaginings that stand
in for reality. The price of excluding all the others is actual poverty
of the spirit, allowing us to keep only "dust"\[5\], projections, and
imaginings that stand in for reality: "'Think of it no more!' wrote
Nerval to Théophile Gautier, of the Cairo they had dreamed of
describing. That Cairo lies beneath the ashes and dirt, . . . dust-laden
and dumb.' Nothing encountered in those Oriental streets quite matched
up to the reality they had seen represented in Paris. Not even the cafés
looked genuine. 'I really wanted to set the scene for you here', Nerval
explained, in an attempt to describe the typical Cairene street, 'but .
. . it is only in Paris that one finds cafés so Oriental.\[6\]'" The
reality for these "travelers" was the French representation of the
"Orient." Anything else, was unacceptable. The Orient itself, in this
case, Cairo, appeared to them completely chaotic, incomprehensible,
disappointing. The "Orient" they found existed outside of their "world
of exhibition," lacked "genuine" cafes, and was empty of most of what
they expected to encounter. The "Orient" Europe had produced was a much
better "Orient" than the one inhabited by other (lesser) types of human
beings. They desperately wanted foreign countries to mirror the "Orient"
they had brought with them. But, to their disillusionment, this foreign,
non-European "Orient" would reflect everything but the image embedded in
their imagination. This foreign "Orient" seemed to have nothing to do
with their manageable, easily representable, homegrown "Orient." Later,
colonialists attempted to force and forge their "Orient" into being, in
the European mold of "order" and "progress" that, in their view, should
reign globally. The alleged preeminence of western culture and
Euro-American supremacism are promoted and exported all over the globe,
unconsciously accepted by many everywhere as the truth. **[Although most
cultures have engaged in some form of othering throughout history, in
western modernity and post-modernity, [othering]{.mark} has been [taken
to an unprecedented level,]{.mark} with the most [atrocious
consequences: genocides, apartheids]{.mark}, all forms of
[colonialism]{.mark}, the [destruction of]{.mark} native peoples and
[cultures]{.mark}, atomic [bombs]{.mark}, nuclear [weapons, etc.]{.mark}
The [alleged preeminence of western]{.mark} culture and Euro-American
[supremacism]{.mark} are promoted and [exported all over the
globe]{.mark}, unconsciously accepted by many everywhere as the truth.
It takes, however, little awareness to realize that these supposedly
superior cultures are built, to a lesser or greater degree, primarily on
the edifice of an overarching underlying value: pure material progress
at the expense of ethics and human values. In other words, the chief
value of our time and culture is the worship of material wealth above
all else. This "theology of progress" makes us believe that unbounded
economic and material prosperity is the ultimate aspiration of human
beings, and what will make one "happy."]{.underline}** This "theology of
progress" makes us believe that unbounded economic and material
prosperity is the ultimate aspiration of human beings, and what will
make one "happy." In reality, it leaves people spiritually bankrupt,
mentally and emotionally sick, willing to do pretty much anything,
including poison their own people (the food industry/medical industry
mafias), for profit. These are values that come directly from our
western liberalism and monstrous form of capitalism and which, sadly,
most of the world is striving to adopt. It is, therefore, **[worth
approaching the issue of "[Orientalism]{.mark}" as just [another
expression of "Othering]{.mark}," a toxic and [inhumane
perspective]{.mark} on the differences that in actuality make our
society a vibrant and powerful melting pot. For without the mosaic of
races, cultures, languages and heritage, [society will]{.mark} wither
and [die. Diversity is]{.mark} the mother of creativity and expansion,
it is [to be valued]{.mark} and encouraged. The mark of a great society
is its ability to embrace others, cultivate their uniqueness, and mold
their contributions into a sacred wholeness. The "others" are Us, the
separation is but an illusion.]{.underline}**

### R/C of everything!

#### Othering as a process undergirds every conflict -- O/W and turns the aff

**Powell 14**(John A. Powell, November 2014 \"The Problem of Othering:
Towards Inclusiveness and Belonging,\" Othering and Belonging,
http://www.otheringandbelonging.org/the-problem-of-othering/)**//BRownRice**

**[The problem of the twenty-first century is the problem of
"othering."]{.underline}** In a world beset by seemingly intractable and
overwhelming challenges, **[virtually [every global]{.mark}, national,
and regional [conflict]{.mark} is wrapped within or [organized around
one]{.mark} or more dimension of [group-based difference. Othering
undergirds territorial disputes]{.mark}, sectarian violence, [military
conflict]{.mark}, the spread of [disease, hunger and food insecurity,
and even climate change.]{.mark}1]{.underline}** In a remarkably candid
and wide-ranging recently published interview, US president Barack Obama
cited tribalism and atavism as a source of much conflict in the world.2
In his view, **[many of the stresses of
[globalization]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the "collision of cultures
brought on by the Internet and social media," and "scarcities," some of
which will be exacerbated by climate change and population growth,
**[[lead to]{.mark} a "[default position]{.mark}" to organize by
"tribe---us/them, a [hostility toward the]{.mark} unfamiliar or
[unknown]{.mark}," and to "push back against those who are
different."]{.underline}** To see the extent to which group-based
differences shape contemporary global conflicts, consider a few less
prominent examples from recent headlines: **[[Violence erupted]{.mark}
between the ethnically Burmese Buddhist majority and the Muslim ethnic
minority Rohingyas in Myanmar in 2012. Since then, [hundreds of
thousands]{.mark} of Rohingyas have been [driven from their
homes]{.mark} and denied full citizenship rights, despite having lived
in Myanmar for centuries.3 In June 2015, President Obama called upon
Myanmar to end discrimination against the Rohingyas.4 In early April
2016, violence erupted in Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly ethnically
Armenian enclave in southwestern Azerbaijan, where over sixty people
were killed and dozens more remain missing. The Armenian population is
Christian in the predominantly Muslim country and favors secession and
reuniting with bordering Armenia.]{.underline}** In the fall of 2015,
the Turkish government ordered a military attack on separatist Kurds in
southern Turkey, and subsequently instituted a curfew in
Kurdish-majority towns.5 Turkey waged military campaigns against Kurds
in Syria and northern Iraq, and is afraid that Kurdish rebels are intent
on carving out a Kurd nation-state out of the territory of all three
states. **[[Group-based identities]{.mark} are [central to]{.mark} each
of these [conflicts]{.mark}, but in ways that [elude simplistic
explanations]{.mark}. It is not just religion or ethnicity alone that
explains each conflict but often the overlay of multiple identities with
specific cultural, geographic, and political histories and grievances
that may be rekindled under certain conditions.]{.underline}**6 In June
2015, a white supremacist walked into a black church in Charleston,
South Carolina, during a prayer meeting and shot and killed nine African
Americans congregants, including the pastor.7 The incident prompted deep
soul-searching in this former confederate state, which ultimately led to
the removal of the historical confederate battle flag from flying atop
the state's capital building upon discovering that the shooter had
symbolically wrapped himself in that flag.8 The incident was a painful
reminder of how bitterly contested the history of race and the legacy of
Civil War and the failed secessionist cause remains. **[[Recent
terrorist attacks]{.mark} in Paris and Brussels also [prompted
soul-searching]{.mark} among publics in Western Europe,
[regarding]{.mark} the [lack of cultural and geographic integration of
ethnic]{.mark} and racial immigrant [groups]{.mark} (many of whom hail
from former European colonies) [and]{.mark} the [persistence of
discrimination]{.mark}.]{.underline}**9 As one resident of a French
banlieue put it, "You do everything for France, to be accepted, but you
feel you're not welcome."10 **[These ethnically identifiable enclaves, a
[product of]{.mark} urban policy and [discrimination]{.mark} as much as
housing choice, are a [source of alienation]{.mark} and were the site of
riots in 2005.]{.underline}**11 In an interview shortly after the Paris
attacks, in which he refused to use the term "Islamaphobia," French
prime minister Manuel Valls explained that "\[i\]t's difficult to
construct a single term that captures the variegated expressions of a
broad prejudice."12This article proposes the term "othering" as an
answer to Valls's challenge. **["[Othering]{.mark}" is a term that not
only [encompasses]{.mark} the many [expressions of prejudice]{.mark} on
the basis of group identities, but we argue that it [provides a
clarifying]{.mark} [frame]{.mark} that [reveals]{.mark} a set of common
processes and conditions that propagate [group-based inequality and
marginality]{.mark}. Although particular expressions of othering, such
as [racism]{.mark} or [ethnocentrism]{.mark}, are often well recognized
and richly studied, this broader phenomenon is inadequately recognized
as such.]{.underline}** "Othering" is a term that not only encompasses
the many expressions of prejudice on the basis of group identities, but
we argue that it provides a clarifying frame that reveals a set of
common processes and conditions that propagate group-based inequality
and marginality. We define "othering" as a **[set of dynamics,
processes, and structures that [engender marginality]{.mark} and
[persistent inequality]{.mark} across any of the full range of human
differences based on group identities.]{.underline}**13 **[[Dimensions
of othering include]{.mark}, but are not limited to, [religion, sex,
race, ethnicity]{.mark}, socioeconomic status ([class]{.mark}),
[disability, sexual orientation, and skin tone.]{.mark} Although the
axes of difference that undergird these expressions of othering vary
considerably and are deeply contextual, they contain a similar set of
underlying dynamics.]{.underline}** In this article, we are primarily
concerned with group-based othering. Othering and marginality can
**[occur on a group basis or at the individual level. We have all likely
experienced the discomfort of being some place or with people where we
did not feel that we belong. For many of us, this feeling is transitory
and relatively harmless, such as the discomfort of entering into a
conversation in which we are not well versed or the embarrassment
arising from being dressed inappropriately for a place or occasion. In
this article, our focus is expressions of othering that are more
enduring and systematically expressed on the basis of group-based
identities or membership.]{.underline}** "Othering" is a broadly
inclusive conceptual framework that **[[captures]{.mark} expressions of
[prejudice]{.mark} and behaviors such as [atavism and tribalism]{.mark},
but it is also a term that points toward deeper processes at work, only
some of which are captured by those terms. It is not uncommon, for
example, to hear commentators refer to Islamaphobia or ethnocentrism as
"racism," although religion and ethnicity are not racial
categories.]{.underline}**14 Similarly, antigay and lesbian marriage
laws or exclusionary gender norms are expressions of othering, yet those
who suffer under them are not defined by ancestry, nationality,
religion, or tribe. The fact that so many leaders and writers fumble
when describing these expressions of prejudice while grasping for
imprecise analogies underscores the lack of a readily accessible term or
frame that reflects the full set of intended meanings. "Othering" is a
broadly inclusive term, but sharp enough to point toward a deeper set of
dynamics, suggesting something fundamental or essential about the nature
of group-based exclusion. Similarly, the term "belonging" connotes
something fundamental about how groups are positioned within society, as
well as how they are perceived and regarded. It reflects an objective
position of power and resources as well as the intersubjective nature of
group-based identities. **[The [language of Othering]{.mark} and
Belonging does more than [capture]{.mark} and describe processes and
forces that undergird group-based [marginalization]{.mark} and
inequality. Othering and Belonging is a pithy and accessible framework
by which we might more productively discuss and develop a range of
inclusive responses to group-based marginalization and
inequality.]{.underline}** Without purporting to offer comprehensive or
exhaustive analysis, this article investigates the forces that
contribute to othering and interventions that might mitigate some of the
excesses. First, we explore conditions under which processes of othering
seem to arise and in which specific group-based identities become
socially significant. Second, we begin to illuminate the critical forces
that structure othering in the world and by which categorical boundaries
and meanings emerge and become institutionally embedded. Finally, we
turn toward solutions. We will examine a spectrum of responses to
othering and critique many of them as well-intended failures.

Said\'s point - ignored by Chen and others - is **[not that the [Eastern
"others"]{.mark} are [incapable of "othering"]{.mark} or imagining their
colonizers.]{.underline}** (This was clear even to the old colonists
themselves.) **[But there simply is [no]{.mark} institutionalized
discourse and global, [organized]{.mark} power/knowledge formation
called [Occidentalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We are not likely to see
S.O.A.S. morph into S.O.O.A.S. - the School of Oriental and Occidental
and African Studies. Nor will we see Qinghua offering courses in
Occidental Studies. Said argued that **[there is an [unequal]{.mark}
[distribution of power]{.mark} - in terms of knowledge as much as
capital and realpolitik - between the Occident and the Orient, or the
core and its peripheries.]{.underline}** He sought, in short, to produce
a **[recognition that [colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}** (the
historical world system) **[also [has to do with unequal
knowledge]{.mark}-production and [distribution]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Or as Timothy Brennan has put it, the "actual conditions of knowledge"
in the world are "nothing like \[a\] perfect see saw."42 This point is
lost, however, in many critiques - inversions - of orientalism. Thus
Edward Graham, writing some years before Chen et al., would claim that
orientalism only partly applies to studies of China, because Said\'s
approach "can as logically be taken to Chinese views of the non-Chinese
world" (41). Chen expertly analyzes post-Mao poetry and drama and the
various **[imaginings of the ["Occident"]{.mark} that Chinese writers
and artists, full of cultural capital, [deploy against]{.mark} the
[state]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And as Chen aptly notes, the Dengist (and
later) **[[state]{.mark} can be seen to have its own, "official"
[occidentalist complex]{.mark}]{.underline}** (now sitting awkwardly
beside a neo-Confucian one). We can add that **[the [catch-up
mentality]{.mark} -which [presupposes]{.mark} material and [cultural
backwardness]{.mark} - stems not only from the May 4 era but also from
the 1980s up to the present; it [continues]{.mark} its second life after
dying a first death in the confident, radical, and embargoed [Maoist
years]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But it is difficult to see how
contemporary Chinese Occidentalism stands as a disproof of Said\'s
argument about the material and worldly phenomenon of orientalism. Do
they not confirm the power of orientalism and the history of Western
colonialism by showing the fetishistic but real existence of
orientalism\'s indispensible flip-side? **[Occidentalism is not the
equivalent of orientalism, for the reasons of power and
institutionalization.]{.underline}** It is only notions of "level
playing fields" and the "free marketplace of ideas" that can make it
seem so. As Said insisted, **[[orientalism is not merely an idea. The
production of knowledge]{.mark} is itself a material, institutional, and
global affair that [is bound up with]{.mark} not only [educational
institutions]{.mark}, but [capitalism and]{.mark}, thus,
[colonialism]{.mark} and empire. Orientalism and Occidentalism are two
halves of a whole that do not add up.]{.underline}** In addition to
Occidentalism\'s resurgence there is another development that seemingly
calls into question the relevance of orientalism now. This is that **[it
is often]{.underline}** ethnically and even mainland-born **[Chinese
intellectuals who are the purveyors of what I have been calling
Sinological-orientalism.]{.underline}** Examples of work from the former
group would have to include Hong Kong scholar Rey Chow\'s corpus in
cultural studies, widely influential in the U.S. But it must be said
that her work on mainland China has often been conventionally
tendentious vis-à-vis the P.R.C. (demonizing "Maoists' in China and in
American English departments, reproducing Cold War accounts of
totalitarianism, and so forth).43 **[Examples of the more recent group
of "representative Chinese" are numerous]{.underline}**, but one can
certainly index a scholar like Pei Minxin who, like many of the Western
experts I examine in Chapter 2, consistently argues along universalist
lines for the necessity of a bourgeois civil society for the
forward-development of China.44 At any rate, **[this demographic
development marks the passage of time - and progress -from an older,
more unambiguously colonial era of globalization and
Sinology.]{.underline}** But does it call into question the "model" of
Said\'s book? For an overly historicist reading it may appear so.
**[[Orientalism is a white man\'s burden and the dominated do not have
permission to narrate.]{.mark} We seem to have moved from this situation
where "they must be represented" to one in which they, the Other, are
doing it themselves.]{.underline}** But this begs a number of questions
as to what is being represented, i.e. the actual knowledge that is being
produced as well as where it hails from (its genesis, as opposed to
origin). **[There is also the Marxist [question about]{.mark} such
[knowledge production: in whose interest is it]{.mark}
conducted?]{.underline}** This suggests continuities within
**[Sinological-orientalism: the discourse of lack and China\'s tortuous
path to normalcy, the Cold-War-meets-oriental-despotism dynamic, and so
on.]{.underline}** Moreover, **[given the [American]{.mark}
provenance/[dominance]{.mark} of postwar China studies as well as
cultural globalization since the early 1980s, Sinological-orientalism
[represents]{.mark} the [triumph of]{.mark} one ["Occidental'
educational system]{.mark} as much as anything else. Sinification at the
level of skin color only takes one so far.]{.underline}** It must also
be said that Chen\'s **[[Occidentalism]{.mark} is overdetermined
by]{.underline}** the same **[[anti-communist and anti-state]{.mark}
agenda]{.underline}** as Zhang\'s. **[[Chinese fetishizations of the
Occident are]{.mark} to be valued precisely because they are somehow
[used against the Party-state]{.mark}, a symbolic subversion of
authoritarianism.]{.underline}** The logic here is a direct legacy of
the Cold War**[: [if a]{.mark} text [or figure "dissents"]{.mark} from
the regime at hand, [it is]{.mark} therefore "[good]{.mark}," of
aesthetic value, and certainly worth writing about. Anti-official
[Occidentalism]{.mark} is subversive and resistant simply because it [is
anti-Party-state]{.mark}, and [the latter is]{.mark} monolithically [bad
and illegitimate]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is, in short,
characteristic area studies discourse and also of a piece with standard
1980s Chinese liberalism. What such occidentalist intellectuals are
dissenting from, and in the name of what, are questions that go begging.
No justification of this "obviousness" is necessary. The fact that a
stridently elitist, liberal text like the documentary series He Shang -
**[Chen\'s key example of "counter-discursive" Occidentalism - can be
filled with the most dubious valorizations of Western colonialism and
racist notions about the Chinese peasant mentality, is
insignificant.]{.underline}** Thus passages like the following from
Zhang Gang and Su Xiaokang\'s script pass unmarked by Chen: In the vast,
backwards rural areas, there are common problems in the peasant makeup
\[suzhi or "quality"\] such as a weak spirit of enterprise, a very low
ability to accept risk, a deep psychology of dependency and a strong
sense of passive acceptance of fate. (Su 169) While such learned
statements seek to diagnose the "feudal" mentality of the peasants and
the "Chinese national character," **[they are nothing but the type of
sanctioned discourse that the revolution had to overcome and that has
known a new lease on life ever since the great reversal.]{.underline}**
**[Outside of the a priori belief that the [Communist government is an
unmitigated evil]{.mark} whose dissolution is to be desired by all
right-thinking liberal democrats, it is hard to understand why this type
of anti-peasant Occidental cosmopolitanism is to be
valued.]{.underline}** But it does make the case for **[understanding
[Occidentalism]{.mark} not as a "counter-discourse" but as [an
internalized orientalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Or call it both if you
like, but hold on to the basic contradiction that **[the "counter"
aspects may be anti-Party but are also thoroughly
reactionary.]{.underline}** Elite occidentalist liberals may have
permission to narrate, but questions about the class and political
content of their discourse go begging. So, too, does
**[[Occidentalism\'s]{.mark} genesis and [location]{.mark}
[within]{.mark} the global, [uneven production of
knowledge]{.mark}.]{.underline}**45

### Root Cause -- Russia War

#### The Otherization of Russia as an Eastern and irrational actor is the root cause of geopolitical tensions and conflict.

Edward Said's seminal study, Orientalism,19 provided an account of how
**[Western cultural identity is shaped, formed and defined through
comparison and contrast to an Eastern orient.]{.underline}** For Said,
the orient has helped to define Europe (or the West) as its contrasting
image, idea, personality \[and\] experience."20 Said's groundbreaking
study showed the West's ideological suppositions in viewing the orient.
Although originally developed from the colonial era, orientalism
illustrates how the West defines itself and its view of others.
Orientalism is a view based on an "imaginative geography" and can be
used to understand how the West portrays the East.21 **[[Orientalism
provides a framework to]{.mark} understand cultural constructs and
[purport]{.mark}ed [differences]{.mark}.22 In this case, the following
study looks to the othering of Russia as an Eastern power. [Western
portrayals of]{.mark} the [East have shaped]{.mark} identities and
culture, but "crucially, it is not the actual, geographic East and West
(wherever located) that is at issue" it is the [portrayal of]{.mark}
distinctive and [opposing cultures]{.mark}]{.underline}**.23 Russian
imperial expansion in the 19th century, has itself, often been a source
of orientalism within the work of Russian geographers, and
anthropologists, coming into contact with people in Central Asia.24
**[However, in contemporary politics, [Russia is increasingly described
in orientalist terms]{.mark} that helps to otherize Russia as a
distinctive culture [that differs to a liberal]{.mark} democratic
[West]{.mark}. The following section argues that it is cultural
[differences that are seen]{.mark} to [be]{.mark} a [primary cause of
geopolitical tensions]{.mark}. [Geopolitical tensions]{.mark} between
Russia and the West are commonly understood in cultural terms. This
[go]{.mark}es [beyond]{.mark} an examination of [differing national
interests, to]{.mark} become [an ideological divide]{.mark} between a
liberal democratic West and an irrational Russian East. The Cold War
[confrontation between]{.mark} the [Soviet Union and]{.mark} the [U.S.
was often expressed in ideological terms. Russia was portrayed]{.mark}
in the Cold War [as]{.mark} an [oriental enemy]{.mark} based on godless
communism [against America's]{.mark} liberal [democracy]{.mark}.25 What
is significant about the portrayal of the opposing sides in the Cold War
is that [cultural explanations]{.mark} were [used to explain state
behavior]{.mark}. The Soviet Union was seen as an irrational enemy that
was more likely to use nuclear weapons.26 The Cold War conflict was also
viewed as an "irreconcilable struggle between two fundamentally
different value systems." American culture was celebrated for its
embracing of personal freedom, while the [Soviets were understood as an
oppressive empire]{.mark}.27 Since the end of the Cold War, the West has
assumed that tensions would disappear and Russia would become more
"Western." [Russia's actions in Ukraine]{.mark} and Crimea have [led
to]{.mark} the [revival of tensions]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} crucially,
[Russian culture is]{.mark} again [seen to be a major cause for
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The fall of the Berlin Wall led the
West to assume that "as Russia became more prosperous it would become
more like other European countries."28 The post-Cold War era saw an
ideological wave of support for a Fukuyama-esque future in which Western
style liberal democracy would spread inexorably across the globe.
Underpinning these views was an ideological belief in the evolution of
progress and a triumphalist understanding of Western modernity.29
**[Liberal [scholars in IR]{.mark} have continued to claim that "there
is ultimately one path to modernity."30 This ideological
[understand]{.mark}ing of politics in evolutionary terms views an
American West and a [l]{.mark}iberal [i]{.mark}nternational
[o]{.mark}rder [as]{.mark} the [highest form of modernity. Russia's own
interests]{.mark} and understandings of political order [can]{.mark}
therefore [be dismissed because of "Russian
backwardness]{.mark}."]{.underline}**31 The triumphalist post-Cold War
mood led liberal scholars of IR to argue that the West and Europe was in
a fundamental new era. The EU was celebrated for achieving a Kantian
Peace,32 having created a new approach to international politics through
acting as a "civilian"33 and "normative" power.34 Conflict and war
within Europe was believed to have been all but essentially eradicated.
The political order of European security based on international
institutions and collaboration was celebrated for creating a Europe
"whole, free and at peace."35 Some scholars even went so far as to
claiming Europe had moved into a new historical era through creating
"post-Clausewitzian political cultures" that openly questioned "the
utility of force."36 Russia's own willingness to use force in defence of
its national interests has therefore caused disbelief amongst elites
within Europe. **[Russia's actions in Ukraine and Crimea caught European
elites by "surprise"37 and led to criticisms of Western elites being
caught "napping."38 The end of the Cold War created a Western ideology,
which believed in a "prolonged sense of inevitability about Russia
rejoining the West."39 Russia's use of force in defence of its interests
led one observer to declare the West is "discovering that Russia's
understanding of events, its discourse, methods and calculus of risk
differ from its own."40 The annexation of Crimea appeared to show that
Western triumphalism had misunderstood Russian culture and identity,
that the West had simply "got Russia wrong."41 Russia's annexation of
Crimea and its involvement in the politics of Ukraine has been explained
largely through a cultural lens. According to Mark Galeotti, [Russia
believes]{.mark} that [it]{.mark} is fighting a "political" war and
"[faces an existential]{.mark} cultural" [threat from the
"West]{.mark}."42 [In]{.mark} trying to understand the
[Ukrain]{.mark}ian crisis, [Russia's use of hybrid warfare]{.mark} is
explained as [originat]{.mark}ing [from]{.mark} a particular
"[ideological vision]{.mark} and political ambition"43 and from the
"worldview" of Russian elites and society.44 Russia's actions in Ukraine
are also attributed to the way the Russia's leadership "look at the
world."45 Anatol Lieven argues that overused analogies comparing
Russia's actions to Nazi Germany also imply that Russia's leadership is
a "force of absolute evil, drawing on deeply rooted, malevolent elements
of Russian culture."46 [It is]{.mark} the "[culture" of Russian
society]{.mark} and its elites [that is]{.mark} uniquely [blamed for
"the return of geopolitic]{.mark}s" to Europe.47 [Analysts]{.mark} have
rushed to also [explain]{.mark} these [tensions]{.mark} as a new
"East-West" confrontation48 [in which Russia's non-Western
culture]{.mark} has [exacerbated]{.mark} the [divide between NATO and
Russia]{.mark}. This [East-West divide continues]{.mark} an [orientalist
tendency with]{.mark}in [Western security debates.]{.mark} The idea of a
"West at war with an East conceived as radically other is pervasive and
longstanding" within political discourse.]{.underline}**49 The War on
Terror is just one recent example of a long propensity within Western
security discourse to fall into an orientalist perspective. But it is
during conflict and warfare that an orientalist perspectives frame an
"us" versus "them." Political discussions on the War on Terror often
portrayed a "law abiding, Christian and Western civilization" as
threatened by an irrational Eastern enemy that was "ever-resistant to
modernity."50 **[In trying to explain the return of geopolitical
competition to Europe, [there is an orientalist tendency to see Western
states as acting rationally]{.mark}, responding to incentives; [while
Russia]{.mark}n foreign policy [is shaped by]{.mark} a [resistance to
modernity]{.mark} and the Russian culture of its elites, or by a
primordial instinct traced to its national character and the weight of
its history]{.underline}**.51 As the following section explores, Western
political discourse toward Russia is often framed through this
orientalist lens.

### T/C -- US-Russia War

#### The affirmative's Russo-Orientalist justifications for hostile, anti-Russia military operations guarantee nuclear war and extinction by further entrenching hostilities and divisions between the West and the Russian "Other".

[The arguments made against Russia are often weak or hypocritical, and
[U.S.]{.mark} commentators [still]{.mark} [subscribe to]{.mark} a
"**[Russo-Orientalism]{.mark}**" [that views the country as a]{.mark}
mysterious **[dangerous Other]{.mark}**. I believe we should be speaking
not so much about East and West as about deep psychological phenomena
like life and death drives.]{.underline} There are cultures where the
death drive is stronger: just think of the Aztecs. Of course, such
cultures can possess great aesthetic value and may have their heroic
aspects. But the history of the twentieth century provides very strong
evidence that this instinct is dominant in Russia as in few other
countries. --- Igor Pomerantsev Russia is not a country that wants
stability. Russia is a country that is interested in chaos. It created
chaos in Ukraine. Who are Russia's friends? It backed Assad! --- Anne
Applebaum [It is a question that the West has habitually pondered ever
since the October Revolution of 1917: what to do about
Russia?]{.underline} In particular---and to frame the issue in
contemporary terms---[should the West maintain, or even escalate, its
current aggressive posture towards Russia? Or should it be seeking
political, economic, and military détente?]{.underline} Elementary moral
and logical reasoning would seem to suggest that it choose the latter
option. After all, [[it is **indisputable** that]{.mark} the **[West's
adoption of a]{.mark}n increasingly [hostile attitude]{.mark}** [towards
the most]{.mark} heavily [nuclear-armed state]{.mark} on Earth
[increases]{.mark} the [likelihood of]{.mark} a full-blown **[nuclear
war]{.mark}** between East and West---a war which, according to a recent
Princeton University study, would kill 34 million people within just its
first few hours, [and]{.mark} which many experts believe would likely
result in the **[extinction]{.mark} of the human species**.]{.underline}
Indeed, in an ominous recent statement, [the Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists remarked upon how the recent increase in tensions has led
"governments in the United States, Russia, and other countries \[to\]
appear to consider nuclear weapons more-and-more usable, increasing the
risks of their actual use]{.underline}"---which, in turn, is a key
reason why their vaunted "Doomsday Clock" is currently set at 100
seconds to midnight, "[the **most dangerous situation that humanity has
ever faced**."]{.underline} Nevertheless, [polling data suggests that
[there is significant support]{.mark} among citizens [of
**West**]{.mark}**ern societies [to pursue]{.mark} the
[escalation]{.mark} option**.]{.underline} A recent Pew poll has
indicated that Western Europeans' attitudes towards Russia are
increasingly bleak: citizens of both Western European nuclear
powers---the United Kingdom and France---now have less favorable
opinions of Russia today than they had in the early 2010s (in the U.K.'s
case, significantly less favorable). Even more ominously, a Gallup poll
published earlier this month noted that [[Americans' image of Russia has
hit a "historic low,"]{.mark} with 77% of U.S. citizens having a
"very/mostly unfavorable" view of the country, while another poll has
found that a third of Americans now identify Russia as the United
States' "chief enemy."]{.underline} (Incidentally, the feeling is
mutual: a recent Russian poll has found that almost half of all Russians
regard the U.S. as their greatest enemy.) Though it is, perhaps,
tempting to dismiss such results as the product of irrational fears
stoked by Western countries' politicians and media systems, [there is,
at the very least, some evidence to suggest that some Western citizens
are being persuaded to support a more aggressive posture towards Russia
on the basis of rational argumentation.]{.underline} One such piece of
evidence are the results of a recent debate at the Oxford
Union---arguably the world's most prestigious debating society---in
which the motion "This House Believes the West Treats Russia Unfairly"
ended up being defeated. But an even better, and more immediately
quantifiable, piece of evidence is the results of a "Munk Debate"---a
semi-annual series of debates named after its main sponsor, Canadian
businessman Peter Munk -- which took place in Toronto, Canada, on the
10th of April, 2015. The resolution to be discussed was: "Be it
resolved, the West should engage not isolate Russia." Arguing for the
resolution were the Russian-French-American journalist Vladimir Pozner
and the late American scholar of Russian studies Stephen F. Cohen;
arguing against it were the former Russian chess world champion Garry
Kasparov and the historian and journalist Anne Applebaum. Before the
evening's debate, the audience members were polled: 58% said they
supported the resolution, while 42% said they were against it. At the
end of the debate, the numbers had shifted dramatically: a majority
(52%) now claimed to be against the resolution, and only 48% claimed to
be in favor of it. In other words, Applebaum and Kasparov had apparently
succeeded in persuading (at least) 10% of the audience to change their
minds and, in doing so, had emphatically won the debate. Anyone
interested in understanding the reasons for the growing Western
antagonism towards Russia should be interested in the question: how did
Applebaum and Kasparov win? Moreover, were the reasons they gave for
"isolating" Russia rational ones? And more specifically, did they
clearly and carefully explain how the supposed benefits of adopting a
more confrontational approach towards Russia would outweigh the cost of
increasing the likelihood of mass nuclear annihilation and potential
human extinction? As the reader may determine for themselves at their
own leisure, the reasons for Applebaum and Kasparov's success were, at
the very least, not purely due to inherent rationality of their
respective arguments. For instance, audience perceptions were almost
certainly influenced by the fact that, at one point in the debate,
Pozner embarrassingly forgot the dates when several Central and Eastern
European countries became members of NATO (he initially claimed that
Poland and a "unified Czechoslovakia" joined in 1991, when in fact
Poland and Czech Republic joined in 1999, and Slovakia only in 2004),
and then, rather bizarrely, claimed that this didn't matter because he
was interested in "facts" rather than "dates"). Moreover, Kasparov's
apparent (and, to my mind, inexplicable) ability to make the audience
laugh also likely contributed to his debate team's eventual
triumph---though his overall contribution to his team's performance is
uncertain, given his boorish behavior all evening and the manifest
absurdity of some of his arguments, for instance, his suggestion that
Ukraine should be provided with nuclear weapons so as to deter a Russian
invasion ("Ukraine \[used to have\] the third largest nuclear arsenal in
the world. \[...\] If some of these warheads were aimed at Moscow today,
Putin would never have crossed the Ukrainian border.") Indisputably,
however, the main reason for the winning team's success was the
performance of Anne Applebaum. Not only did she prove adept at providing
classic debate "zingers" and ad hominem attacks (e.g., claiming, without
evidence, that Cohen harbored "repressed nostalgia" for the Soviet
regime), but her speeches and responses routinely received the loudest
applause of the night. But what actual arguments did Applebaum make?
These can, I think, be fairly neatly separated into four distinct
categories. (Unless otherwise stated, the following quotes are drawn
from a lightly-edited transcript of the debate published as the 2016
book, Should the West Engage Putin's Russia? The Munk Debates.) Economic
--- Russia is "one of the most unequal countries in the world" --
indeed, according to Applebaum, it is essentially a "feudal empire" in
which the "political rulers \[are\] literally the country's owners."
Moreover, Russian political and economic elites "badly need to keep the
international financial system safe for \[their\] corrupt money"; in
particular, their "ample use of tax havens" is a "disaster for ordinary
Russians" as it deprives the Russian government of vital tax revenue.
Thus, Applebaum claimed, "we need to get Russian money out of the
Western financial system." Political --- Russia uses its vast energy
resources and infrastructure to "blackmail and bully its neighbors,"
particularly those in Eastern and Central Europe. Furthermore, Russia
has "invested heavily in anti-European, anti-transatlantic, and even
fascist political movements all across Europe" (e.g., a Russian bank
reportedly lent 9 million euros to far-right French Presidential
candidate Marine Le Pen during her campaign). Thus, Applebaum concluded,
"we need to get Russian money out of European politics." Media ---
Russia "has invested massively in an enormous system of disinformation",
including "web sites, 'fake' think tanks \[and\] a vast army of Internet
trolls," which are "designed to create chaos and confusion" in the West.
Thus, Applebaum claimed that the West must "work harder to identify
Russian lies and get them out of our media." Military --- Russian
President Vladimir Putin has tried over the last couple of decades to
create in Ukraine "a copycat, colonial version of the political system
he invented in Russia." This, in turn, primarily explains why the
Ukrainian "Maidan Revolution" of 2014, and subsequent war with Russia
and Russian annexation of Crimea, took place. Thus, Applebaum ominously
suggested, the West needs "to make Putin pay a high price for invading a
neighbor \[i.e. Ukraine\] so he doesn't invade another one." Presumably,
were Applebaum to make the same argument today, she would also cite as
supporting evidence: (i) Russian hackers' alleged interference in the
2016 US presidential election, and (ii) Russia's military---and
subsequent credible allegations of war crimes---on behalf of the Assad
government in Syria in late 2015. (Indeed, in more recent articles
Applebaum has excoriated Russia on both of these grounds.) In short:
Russia is bad. Moreover---at least on the charitable version of this
argument---Russia is so bad that we in the West are morally compelled to
adopt a more openly confrontational posture towards it, even if this
means escalating the risk of nuclear apocalypse and concomitant human
extinction. (Interestingly, and somewhat relatedly, Applebaum is someone
who appears to be curiously unperturbed by the prospects of nuclear war;
indeed, she once even suggested that Western leaders "might occasionally
have to drop a mention of NATO's nuclear weapons into the conversation"
with Russian leaders---that is, verbally threaten Russia with the
prospect of a nuclear first strike.) [Undoubtedly, [there are some
elements of truth to Applebaum's argument]{.mark}. After all, [Russia
is]{.mark} a highly [unequal country]{.mark}---by some measures, the
world's most unequal country---in which those with economic and
financial power wield a highly disproportionate amount of political
influence.]{.underline} It is also a country that suffers enormously
from various kinds of corruption, and in which members of the political
and economic elite are routinely able to funnel their money out of the
country via the Western financial system. [Furthermore, it is a country
which has invested heavily in media organizations designed to promote
its own interests and point of view. And [it]{.mark} is also a country
that, unquestionably, [has violated Ukraine's]{.mark} territorial
[sovereignty]{.mark}, both through its military support of pro-Russian
proxy forces in the country's east and by its annexation of
Crimea]{.underline} (the latter of which was declared to "have no
validity" by the UN General Assembly). Nevertheless, [[the fact]{.mark}
that [Applebaum appeals to some]{.mark} **true [facts does not mean
that]{.mark} her [argument is good]{.mark}**. Indeed, upon reflection,
it becomes clear that [there are]{.mark} at least three [significant
problems with it]{.mark}.]{.underline} Firstly, [there is nothing
distinctively Russian about much of the behavior that Applebaum
criticizes]{.underline}. Why, specifically, should we as Western
citizens attempt to get Russian money or Russian lies out of Western
finance or politics---as opposed to money or lies in general?
Presumably, Applebaum would respond to this point by claiming that
Russian money and lies are particularly nefarious, but that other
sources of money and lies are not. Indeed, in a pre-debate interview
[[Applebaum]{.mark} appeared to go even further, and [suggested]{.mark}
that [Russian influ]{.mark}ence in general---which would include,
apparently, cultural influence---is especially pernicious, and [should
be **eradicated from Western society**]{.mark} ("I think we really need
to think about getting Russian influence out of our societies"). But,
even [putting aside this claim's]{.mark} apparent
**[xenophobia]{.mark}**]{.underline} (could the same be said about,
e.g., Mexican influence?), [[Applebaum]{.mark} [does not provide any
reason]{.mark} to think [that "Russia]{.mark}n influence" [is especially
pernicious]{.mark}---at least, compared to (e.g.) Chinese, or Israeli,
or Saudi influence---and nor, for that matter, does she explain how one
could attempt to eliminate "Russian lies" from Western media in a manner
compatible with the "Western value" of freedom of speech. Secondly, [if
the]{.mark} main [goal is to stop Russia from engaging]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the [above-mentioned behavior]{.mark}, [it is]{.mark}, at
best, [unclear why isolating Russia offers a]{.mark} more effective
[means of achieving this goal]{.mark} than engaging with
it.]{.underline} In particular, if the goal is to, say, stop Russian
oligarchs laundering their money through Western banks, it surely stands
to reason that this would best be achieved by allowing or even
encouraging Russian financial investigators and litigators to work in
cooperation with Western ones. After all, money laundering and the use
of tax havens are widespread practices among members of the global
economic and political elite---indeed, they are, by their very nature,
global problems. [Isolating one country as a means of solving them would
appear to be not only unhelpful, but actively counter-productive in the
achievement of this goal.]{.underline} The third and most obvious
problem with Applebaum's argument, however, is the blatant hypocrisy.
After all, the country of which Applebaum is a citizen, namely [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [is also]{.mark} a **[highly
unequal]{.mark} society** (by some measures, even more unequal than
Russia), in which the rich routinely engage in tax evasion and
avoidance, often through the use of tax havens; [it]{.mark} also
[uses]{.mark} its [energy resources to bully]{.mark} Central and Eastern
[European nations]{.mark}, for instance by pressuring Europe to buy
American as opposed to Russian natural gas; it also funds media outlets
that promote its interests and points of view; [it]{.mark} also
(routinely) [**violates the sovereignty** of nation]{.mark}
[s]{.mark}tates (either directly or by supporting proxy military
forces); [and]{.mark} it also routinely **[interferes in other
countries']{.mark} media and [electoral processes]{.mark}** (including
Russia's).]{.underline} All of which raises the obvious question---one
which remained curiously unasked by Pozner and Cohen during the debate:
[[if Russia's]{.mark} nefarious [behavior constitutes a]{.mark}
sufficient [reason to]{.mark} try [to isolate it]{.mark}, why
[shouldn't]{.mark} the rest of [the world adopt a]{.mark} similarly
[hostile attitude towards the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates?]{.underline} Usually, this is the point in the
conversation at which [Applebaum, as well as other writers and thinkers
who are in favor of the West adopting a more confrontational approach
towards Russia, would bring out a key weapon in their rhetorical
arsenal: namely, the accusation of whataboutism]{.underline}---a notion
which, according to The Guardian's former Moscow correspondent Luke
Harding, is "practically a national ideology" in Russia. Indeed, in her
new book, Twilight of Democracy, [Applebaum lambasts whataboutism not
just for "mirror\[ing\] Putin's own propaganda," but also because "it is
an argument for moral equivalence, an argument that undermines faith,
hope, and the belief that we can live up to the language of our
Constitution."]{.underline} Whataboutism, then, is clearly supposed to
be bad. But what, exactly, is it? According to Merriam-Webster's
dictionary definition, whataboutism "is a rhetorical device that
involves accusing others of offenses as a way of deflecting attention
from one's own deeds." It is also, we are told, a "logical fallacy,
because whether or not the original accuser is likewise guilty of an
offense has no bearing on the truth of the value of the original
accusation." [So construed, whataboutism certainly is a logical fallacy:
if person A accuses person B of nefarious deeds, B's reverse-accusation
of A's hypocrisy does not, by itself, refute A's original
accusation.]{.underline} (If I accuse you of stealing my wallet, your
counterclaim that I stole your phone, even if true, doesn't thereby mean
that you didn't steal my wallet.) The problem, however, [is that in the
context under discussion---namely, the validity of arguments to the
effect that the West should attempt to isolate Russia---it is
**inapplicable**]{.underline}. Recall Applebaum's central claim: it is
because Russia has committed various moral and legal crimes that the
West should attempt to isolate it. The counterclaim being made here is
not the blanket denial that Russia has committed (many of) these crimes;
rather, it is the claim that, [if the mere committal of such crimes
constitutes a sufficient reason for a country's isolation, then the
United States should be isolated as well. In other words, the
counterclaim being made here is not the logical fallacy of
"whataboutism," but rather a simple, manifestly logical application of
reductio ad absurdum.]{.underline} This fact can be further brought into
focus by imagining the reverse scenario, in which hawkish,
"anti-American" Russian intellectuals argue for Russia's adoption of a
more hostile posture towards the United States[. In support of their
view, such people might mention, for instance, the U.S.'s history of
genocide, slavery, colonialism, and racism; its recent (and
not-so-recent) destructive **military interventions**; its use of
**drone strikes**; its enormous current levels of inequality; its
enforcement of brutal and illegal sanctions against sovereign nations;
its banking system's overwhelming responsibility for the 2008
**financial crisis**; its aggressive pursuit of novel **nuclear weapon
technologies**; its imposition of disastrous "shock therapy" economic
policies around the world (including in Russia); its **expansion of
NATO, a hostile military alliance**, right up to Russia's borders,
despite multiple promises to the contrary; its interference in other
country's elections (including, again, in Russia); its prosecution of
whistleblowers; and its support for its dictators and oppressive regimes
around the world.]{.underline} Now imagine if, in response to such
accusations, the Applebaums of this world responded by alluding to the
fact that Russia, too, is hardly an innocent player on the global stage,
and that it, too, is guilty of many (though not all) of the crimes it
accuses the U.S. of committing. In such an instance, would it be
legitimate for the Russian hawks to accuse Applebaum & co. of
"whataboutism," and of thereby committing a logical fallacy? Or would,
rather, Applebaum & co. simply be pointing out the hypocrisy of their
interlocutors, as a straightforward means of demonstrating the absurdity
of their professed viewpoint? [Indeed, the term "whataboutism," at least
insofar as the term is actually used, does not typically refer to
logical fallacies of the kind spelled out above. Instead, it is more
often part of a broader rhetorical technique used predominantly by
Western intellectuals to deflect, or even silence, charges of hypocrisy
when they, or other intellectuals, criticize foreign adversaries,
including (but not limited to) Russia.]{.underline} Here, for example,
is Applebaum herself, in Twilight of Democracy, castigating (then-) U.S.
President Donald Trump for allegedly employing the tactic: In a 2017
interview with Bill O'Reilly of Fox News, \[former President Donald
Trump\] expressed his admiration for Vladimir Putin, the Russian
dictator, using a classic form of "whataboutism". "But he's a killer,"
said O'Reilly. "There are a lot of killers. You think our country is so
innocent?" \[...\] This way of speaking -- "Putin is a killer, but so
are we all" -- mirrors Putin's own propaganda, which often states, in so
many words, "Okay, Russia is corrupt, but so is everyone else." Pace
Applebaum, this is not a "classic form of 'whataboutism,'" at least
according to the dictionary definition of the term quoted above. After
all, Trump is not disagreeing with O'Reilly's assertion that Putin is a
"killer"; indeed, if anything, he is fully agreeing with it. (In the
original video, Trump visibly nods in agreement when O'Reilly claims
that Putin is a "killer"; moreover, as the quote above attests,
Applebaum herself construes Trump as agreeing that Putin is a "killer.")
He is, therefore, emphatically not attempting to refute the truth of his
interlocutor's original assertion. Furthermore, nor is he even the
person being accused. He is merely pointing out the incontestable fact
that the United States---the country of which himself and O'Reilly are
citizens, and of which Trump himself was the then-elected leader---also
bears responsibility for killing people. But in what meaningful sense,
then, is this an instance of whataboutism, let alone a "a classic form"
of it? When did simply recognizing your own country's crimes become a
logical fallacy? (In fact, the context of the interview makes it
plausible to think that Trump was, in fact, also employing a reductio ad
absurdum-type argument here. Just prior to O'Reilly's claim that Putin
is "a killer," Trump was discussing the prospects of Russia and the US
forming a partnership to defeat ISIS and "Islamic terrorism all over the
world." Thus, Trump might, not entirely unreasonably, be construed as
implicitly arguing as follows: "If being a 'killer' disqualifies one
from forming a partnership to defeat ISIS or terrorism, then we --
namely, the United States -- are also thus disqualified. But this is
crazy. So, Putin's being a killer shouldn't disqualify him from
partnering with us to defeat ISIS.") So far, [there does not in fact
appear to be any good reason whatsoever for the citizens---and, by
extension, the governments---of Western countries not to seek better
relations with Russia. Arguments which purport to establish that the
West should maintain, or even escalate, current tensions with Russia
either have little to do with Russia specifically]{.underline} (e.g.,
the use of tax havens by Russian oligarchs, when in fact such practices
are widespread amongst members of the political and financial elite in
many countries) [or are deeply hypocritical, insofar as many of the
crimes that Russia is accused of have also been committed, sometimes in
much worse form, by the West.]{.underline} (Indeed, by parity of
reasoning, such Western crimes could just as easily be appealed to by
Russian intellectuals as a means of justifying their more aggressive
posture towards the West.) [Moreover, the argumentative ploy often used
as a means of deflecting the charge of hypocrisy---namely, the appeal to
whataboutism---is, in fact, a rhetorically pernicious term of art, for
it allows Western intellectuals to repeatedly denounce (often real)
Russian crimes, whilst simultaneously rhetorically protecting themselves
or their own countries from the charge of hypocrisy.]{.underline} ("We
are accusing you; and any attempt from you to criticize us is not just
playing into Putin's hands, but is, in addition, logically fallacious.")
[In short, the **[arguments]{.mark}** not only [do not come]{.mark}
anywhere [near passing the]{.mark} almost impassably [high bar of
**justifying**]{.mark} increasing the [likelihood of **nuclear
apocalypse**]{.mark}, but they [are **logically worthless**]{.mark} in
their own right.]{.underline} [[There is]{.mark}, however, [**one final
element** of Western discourse about Russia that]{.mark} should be
discussed here; one which, indeed, likely [needs to be
eliminated]{.mark} in order [for]{.mark} concerned [Westerners
to]{.mark} be able to effectively engage their fellow citizens and
governments into [adopting a **less hostile posture** towards
Russia]{.mark}. Moreover, [it]{.mark} is an element that, I think,
[plays a **crucial**---**albeit often unnoticed**]{.mark}---[role in
providing legitimacy to]{.mark} many of the arguments often made by
[those]{.mark}, like Applebaum, [who seek to further]{.mark} **entrench
division and [hostility]{.mark}** between Russia and the West. [This
is]{.mark}, for want of a better word, [the **Russo-Orientalist nature**
of]{.mark} much of the [discourse]{.mark} itself.
**[Russo-Orientalism]{.mark}**, in short, [is]{.mark} a certain way of
[thinking]{.mark} or talking [about Russia]{.mark}, according to which
it is viewed [as a monolithic, radically different]{.mark},
(semi-)[mysterious and dangerous entity which is]{.mark}, above all,
**[hostile to the West]{.mark}**. Moreover, in analogy with
**"classical" Orientalism** in Edward Said's sense, Russo-[Orientalism
plays a crucial role in **legitimizing contemporary**]{.mark} **Western
[policies towards Russia]{.mark}**. That is, it is [because Russia is
perceived as]{.mark} semi-**mysterious, hostile, and fund[amentally
"Other"]{.mark}** [to the West]{.mark} which explains why [we]{.mark},
too, [are encouraged to adopt]{.mark}---and, indeed, often find it easy
to accept adopting---[a]{.mark}n **openly [confrontational
attitude]{.mark} [towards it.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

**[early practices established high expectations of state aggression

(Gilmore 2002, 20) These **[[logics are reformulated]{.mark} and

exploitation, and the redistribution of wealth reproduce and sustain
white supremacy. **[The [U.S. settler state internalizes]{.mark} a
"[righteous violence" predicated on]{.mark} an expanding "[quest for
total security]{.mark}" [that has come to characterize domestic and
foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Hixson 2013, 198). Although there
are myriad ways to explore the interrelations between state-sanctioned
violence and militarism, we find the connections between domestic
policing and the U.S. military-industrial complex to be particularly
illustrative. Kraska and Cubellis (1997) noted that there is a long
history of collusion between the military and police departments in the
United States and the military paradigm is an important organizing
principle within the development of modern policing practices,
organization, and tactics (e.g., Bittner 1970; Manning 1977; Enloe 1980;
A. Hall and Coyne 2012). These practices took on added significance
during the latter half of the twentieth century as U.S. cities faced
increased pressure to "get tough on crime" and as local police
departments developed specially trained tactical teams, commonly
referred to as Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams (Kraska and
Cubellis 1997). The interactions between the military and domestic
police practices intensified yet again during the "war on drugs" and in
a post--11 September 2001 world where domestic terror concerns have
fueled the explosive growth of military and police cooperation (A. Hall
and Coyne 2012). Although ostensibly unconnected to questions of race
and economic inequality, militarism is fundamentally linked to
structural violences of poverty and social difference (Loyd 2009, 2014),
and **[[the pursuit of total security connects settler state militarism

protection of the nation-state, the [policing]{.mark} of its borders and

stand in the way of the settler state]{.mark} and]{.underline}**, more
often than not, **[culminates in national campaigns against those beyond
the scope of U.S. settler state justice]{.underline}**. The
indiscriminate killing associated with this kind of violence is easily
dismissed as an unfortunate consequence of war (Hixson 2013). U.S.
interventionism relies on a "defensive solidarity \... built on the
institution of slavery and the racialization of Blackness" that
reaffirms white supremacist cultural identity by managing both internal
and external threats (Loyd 2009, 406). These practices continue even
after the settler state has displaced and "removed" native peoples who
had previously occupied the land, creating political landscapes with an
aggressive propensity for violence (Veracini 2010). **[This

past, settler practices are central to the continued development and
futurity of the United States. **[[A settler colonial perspective

engagements]{.underline}** (Hixson 2013). As Blackhawk and Apache
helicopters swoop and attack and Tomahawk cruise missiles explode, and
as U.S. Special Forces head into "Indian country" to search and destroy
the enemy, the ramifications and taken for granted sensibilities of
settler geographies become all too clear (Hixson 2013, 198). Hixson
(2013) further clarified, "**[[American]{.mark} [settler colonialism is

### De-sinologizaton

#### The alternative is de-sinologization, involving recognizing the existing consequences of current academia and viewing Sinologism as alienated knowledge and understand its subconscious contamination and distortion. Only then can humans reflect upon their flawed epistemologies and reorient their understanding towards mutual respect and equality to the previously isolated "Other".

**[Conclusion A theory of self-­ conscious reflection [Sinologism as
alienated knowledge]{.mark} All human knowledge is, to varying degrees,
conjectural or hypothetical in nature, and is produced by the creative
imagination of human beings who encounter certain needs that have arisen
in specific historical and cultural settings. This is the funda - mental
reason why I deem knowledge about [China]{.mark} and
[scholarship]{.mark} in China-- West studies as intellectual
commodities. As intellectual products created by the human imagination,
they are invariably [subjective]{.mark} in nature. The
[subjectivity]{.mark} of Sinologism was [intensified after China was
brought into]{.mark} the global system of [capitalism]{.mark} in modern
times. The [commodification]{.mark} of knowledge [has caused China
knowledge to deviate]{.mark} considerably from its original purposes.
Nevertheless, [scholars]{.mark} in the field do [not
self-conscious]{.mark}ly realize the subjectivity of their scholarship.
[This gives rise to sinologization.]{.mark} As intellectual commodities,
both Sinologism and sinologization are derivatives of Sinology, and
neither of them is Sinology per se. Rather, [they are alienations of
Sinology]{.mark}, China knowledge, [and knowledge production]{.mark}.
For this reason, [Sinologism should be redefined as alienated]{.mark}
knowledge in general and alienation of Si]{.underline}**nology and
China-- West studies in particular. In what way is **[Sinologism an
alienation of knowledge? "Alienation," according to Raymond Williams, is
"one of the most difficult words in the language," and has multiple
denotations and connotations. In intellectual thought,
[alienation]{.mark} in its general sense [refers to]{.mark} a process
whereby "man is seen as cut off, [estranged from]{.mark} his own
[original nature]{.mark}"]{.underline}** **[1 and "the world man has
made confronts him as stranger and enemy, having power over him who has
transferred his power to it." 2 My redefinition of Sinologism as
alienated knowledge takes the line of thought developed by Hegel,
Feuerbach, and Marx. In Hegel's theory of alienated culture, human
beings created a culture through their activities, but the created
[culture]{.mark} becomes an alien force that [confronts them]{.mark}. 3
In Feuerbach's theory of alienated religion, 4 human beings create the
idea of God, which becomes an alien [force]{.mark} that makes them
worship it, thereby [controlling them]{.mark}. Influenced by Hegel's and
Feuerbach's theories, Marx posits his theory of alienated labor: \[M\]an
creates himself by creating his world, but in class-­ [society is
alienated]{.mark} from this essential nature by specific forms of
alienation in the division of labour, private property and the
capitalist mode of production in which the worker loses both the product
of his labour and his sense of his own productive activity, following
the expropriation of both by capital. 5 In the Economic and
Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 , Marx elaborates on what is not
alienation and how alienation comes into being as a result of private
labor and capitalist mode of commodity production: Let us review the
various factors as seen in our supposition: My work would be a free
manifestation of life , hence an enjoyment of life . Presupposing
private property, my work is an alienation of life , for I work in order
to live , in order to obtain for myself the means of life. My work is
not my life. 6 In Hegel, Feuerbach, and Marx, alienation is essentially
self-­ alienation, and [to be alienated is to be separated from one's own
nature]{.mark} and one's work. In fundamental ways my conception of
Sinologism as an alienated intellectual product is related to Marx's
idea of alienated labor and commodity fetish. In labor, the original
objective of work is to create products that satisfy human needs so that
human beings can lead a more fulfilled life. But [because of the
capitalist]{.mark} mode of [production]{.mark}, which aims at making
profits as its sole goal, the original [human purpose is
forgotten]{.mark} and the created product becomes something which no one
except the market has control over. In a similar way, Sinology and China
studies originally aim at producing scholarship and knowledge on China
for information and education. But due to various forces, political,
ideological, ethnic, and aca - demic, knowledge and [scholarship on
China]{.mark} become intellectual commodities that [deviate]{.mark}
substantially [from]{.mark} the [original purpose]{.mark}, which is [to
inform]{.mark} and educate people [about China]{.mark} and Chinese
[culture]{.mark}. And the [knowledge]{.mark} and scholarship pro - duced
frequently [contradict]{.mark} and compromise the producer's [original
intentions]{.mark}. Marx views the appearance of alienation [as a result
of capitalism]{.mark}. In my view it is not by sheer coincidence that
Sinology began to deviate from its original aim at producing knowledge,
and embarked on its way to Sinologism, at approx - imately the same time
as the capitalist mode of production sought to expand the world market
and to turn everything into commodities. According to Marx, alienation
can be overcome by restoring the truly human relationship to the labor
process; with employment as a way people can express their human nature
and as a way they can fulfil their human potential. In a similar vein
Sinologism as an alienated form of Sinology and China-- West studies is
endowed with the great [potential to restore China knowledge production
and scholarship to a healthy state of true]{.mark} knowledge and
[scholarship]{.mark}. My inquiry into Sinologism is basically a cultural
critique that deals with alienated knowledge of China-- West studies.
Just as Hegel, Feuerbach, and Marx have shown that the history of human
culture is explicitly marked by alienation, and alienation is largely
unconscious in nature, [the inner logic of Sinologism is]{.mark} largely
[unconscious]{.mark} in two fundamental ways. First, [the
problem]{.mark}atic of Sinologism [is beyond]{.mark} our [conscious
awareness. Few]{.mark} scholars engaged in sinologistic practices [are
aware of]{.mark} the fact that they come under the sway of an
[unconscious]{.mark} motivating [force that controls]{.mark} the
[epistemology]{.mark} and methodology of their scholarship. Second,
[even though we are consciously aware of its presence in the various
problematic manifestations, for various reasons]{.mark} (ethnic,
political, and academic) [we]{.mark} tend to [ignore]{.mark} them
[or]{.mark} consciously [deny them, because no one would admit that he
or she is engaged in epistemological and methodological colonization in
terms of Western-centric cultural theories and models.]{.mark} What is
paradoxical is that oftentimes, misperception, misconception, and
misrepresentation in China--West [studies]{.mark} are self-consciously
[made without]{.mark} the scholars' [awareness of their biases,
prejudices, and false consciousnesses]{.mark}. I have provided ample
analyses of such cases. In this sense, the inner logic of
[Sinologism]{.mark}, which is a form of cultural unconscious,
[is]{.mark} both [conscious and unconscious]{.mark}. It is con - scious
in its manifestations, but unconscious in its motivations. Like a
psycho - logical complex, it is essentially a compromise formation
incorporating conflicting and contradictory motives, desires, causes,
rationales, and goals. It is relatively easy to repudiate its
manifestations, but hard to get at its root causes. As alienated
knowledge, [Sinologism]{.mark} poses an obstacle to scientific,
objective, and reliable knowledge and scholarship in China-- West
studies, and [hinders healthy and meaningful exchanges and
dialogues]{.mark} in cross-­ cultural studies. We must go beyond it. But
how? [Sinologism operates on]{.mark} an inner logic, which is the
[cultural unconscious]{.mark}. As unconscious can be made conscious by
special procedures, [the most effective way to deal with the problem is
to adopt]{.mark} a strategy similar to [psychoanalytic procedures that
are based on the rationale of making one aware of unconscious
desires]{.mark} and fears, phobias and anxieties, depressions and
compulsions. The foregoing chapters have been preoccupied precisely with
this central objective. The analyses have mainly focused on how to
recognize the inner logic as well as criticize the dazzling
manifestations of Sinologism in a variety of scholarly fields. In this
concluding part, I wish to make some further reflections on Sinologism
and offer some thoughts on where studies of Sinologism should be heading
and how we can turn alienated symptoms of Sinologism into healthy
creative energies in knowledge production. Making the unconscious
culture conscious Sinologism is, in the final analysis, an unconscious
culture operating on the logic of a cultural unconscious that alienates
the production of knowledge and scholarship. To de-alienate Sinologism I
think [we need]{.mark}, first of all, to start a process of
[de-sinologization and de-ideologization, and engage in critical
reflections on how to make the cultural unconscious conscious and how to
turn Sinologism from a deconstructive theory to a constructive theory of
academic criticism.]{.mark} To accomplish de-sinologization, [the first
move is to]{.mark} adequately [recognize the consequences of
sinologization]{.mark}. I have discussed the various phenomena of
sinolo - gization in a previous chapter, but did not define the concept
in rigorous terms. Now, in this concluding section, I will attempt to
provide a clear definition. Sinologization is an undeclared but tacitly
administered institiutionalization of the ways of [observing China from
the perspective of Western epistemology that refuses]{.mark}, or is
reluctant, [to view China on its own terms]{.mark}, and of doing
scholarship on Chinese materials and producing knowledge on Chinese
civilization in terms of [Western methodology]{.mark} that tends to
[disregard the real conditions of China and reduce the complexity
of]{.mark} Chinese [civilization into simplistic patterns]{.mark} of
development modeled on those of the West. [Sinologization has serious
consequences]{.mark} in almost every aspect of Chinese culture and
society. I have dealt with a broad spectrum of them in earlier chapters
and do not need to tackle them further. As a scholar of literature and
culture, my study is mainly concerned with Sinologism in the domains of
literature, language, thought, and other areas of human science. [Since
the logic of Sinologism is a cultural unconscious that has penetrated
deeply into people's minds, it exists in practically all areas of
scholarly research and knowledge production.]{.mark} Hence, future
studies of Sinologism ought to extend to other fields of social and
natural sciences. The manifestations of Sinologism in those fields have
scarcely been touched. Inquiries into those areas will surely produce
new findings and insights that will give us inspiration to go beyond
Sinologism. [De-sinologization is to self-consciously
de-institutionalize the sinologistic ways of observing China]{.mark} and
doing scholarship on Chinese materials. It involves two major aspects:
one pertaining to Chinese scholars, the other relating to non-­ Chinese
scholars. De-­ sinologization for Chinese scholars is to be aware of the
drawbacks and shortcomings of sinologistic ways of doing scholarship, to
recognize the limits and limitations of Western concepts and
conceptualizations, to overcome a blind faith in the effi - cacy of
Western theories, and to self-­ consciously reject the intellectual habit
of doing scholarship in terms of the culture-­ specific models and
methodologies of the West. In the final analysis [it is a process of
intellectual emancipation of a mind shackled by Western
perception]{.mark}, conception, [and generalization]{.mark}, a spiritual
restoration of the faith in one's own abilities and creative power, and
a resuscitation of one's zeal for original creation. De-­ sinologization
for non-­ Chinese scholars is to have a [clear awareness of]{.mark} the
[inevitable subjectivity]{.mark} of one's per - spective of observing
China, to be on guard against doing Chinese scholarship on Western
terms, [and]{.mark} to strive to [produce knowledge]{.mark} and
scholarship [on China in as objective and scientific a manner as
possible.]{.mark} People may say that my idea of [depoliticization of
knowledge]{.mark} is an illusion. After all, Terry Eagleton, Frederic
Jamesson, and many other theorists have con - vincingly argued that all
criticism is political criticism and that [all knowledge is
ideologically laden]{.mark}. 7 Does this mean that it is impractical to
call for apolitical ways of knowledge production about China? I don't
think so. On the contrary, I believe that precisely because of the
pervasiveness of political influences, [depoliticization of knowledge
production is]{.mark} highly [necessary]{.mark} for objective ways of
doing scholarship on China. To a great extent the success of
de-sinologization depends on depoliticization of knowledge and
scholarship. [The fundamental issue that differentiates my conception of
Sinologism from Orientalism and Occidentalism is a drive at
depoliticization]{.mark} of scholarship and knowledge production.
Although it is not entirely possible to separate politics from
scholarship, [we should strive for disinterested production of
scholarship]{.mark}, and set as an ideal the practice of striving for
knowledge production [for knowledge's sake]{.mark}, not alienated
knowledge at the service of any ideological agenda. It is likely we
cannot completely cleanse scholarship of political influence, but [we
should]{.mark} do as much as possible to strive to [depoliticize]{.mark}
scholarship [and advocate]{.mark} scholarship for scholarship's sake. A
practical way to come close to the idea would be a hermeneutic approach
to knowledge production and scholarship, based on the recognition that
[China]{.mark} is a great book that requires repeated reading and [fresh
interpretation]{.mark}. Whither Sinologism? Sinologism is largely a new
conceptual category. Its studies have not yet formed a complete system.
With the tentative exploration in this inquiry, where should our future
exploration of Sinologism lead us? By way of conclusion I will offer
some further reflections. First and foremost, [we should]{.mark}
continue to [explore]{.mark} the rise, origin, [historical
evolution]{.mark}, characteristic feature, present-­ day condition and
inner logic, and extend that exploration beyond the fields of the
humanities and social sciences. The current study has its focus on
language, literature, thought, and culture. Future [inquiries should be
broadened]{.mark} to include the diverse fields of politics, economics,
diplomacy, medicine, society, technology, and natural sciences, and
other areas directly related to China knowledge production and
cross-cultural studies. Second, studies of Sinologism should not be
limited to goals that set out to expose biases and prejudices against
China, correct errors and misrepresentations concerning Chinese
civilization, and dispute misperceptions and misinterpretations of
Chinese materials: although all these objectives are legitimate in the
process of analysis. A significant direction [we should]{.mark} take is
to [get behind]{.mark} and beneath [all]{.mark} the identified
[problems]{.mark} in order [to uncover]{.mark} the [motivations]{.mark},
mental frameworks, [attitudes, and rationales]{.mark} for all those
phenomena. In other words, a more [important objective is to discover
the inner logic responsible for the problems arising in scholarship on
China--West studies.]{.mark} In conceptual terms, the fundamental goal
should be to [discover the epistemological and methodological sources
of]{.mark} the dazzling [phenomena under]{.mark} the rubric
"[Sinologism]{.mark}." Third, [we should raise]{.mark} people's
[awareness]{.mark} of the pitfalls of sinologistic knowledge production,
and show its grave consequences in the context of globaliza - tion,
which, among other things, includes obstructing cross-cultural exchanges
[and]{.mark} causing epistemic inertia and the atrophy of the original
creativity of non-­ Western peoples. Sinologism should contribute to the
clarification of scholarly issues in the application of Said's theory of
Orientalism to Sinology and China-- West studies. Last, but not least,
as it is preoccupied with knowledge and scholarship, critiques of
Sinologism should offer a new paradigm in China-- West studies. It
should compel us to [reflect]{.mark} on the status quo, problems, and
[future improvement in China knowledge production]{.mark} in the
worldwide context of globalization. Specifically, Sinologism should
engage in reflections on the existing paradigms and approaches
constructed on Western-­ centric theories and teleology of scientism, and
initiate a viable shift in the existing paradigm of China studies from
Western-­ centric models and pseudo-­ scientific teleology to genuinely
scientific ways of knowledge production about China. [The]{.mark}
ultimate [aim]{.mark} for studies of Sinologism [is to encourage and
promote the production of objective knowledge about China]{.mark}, [free
from bias]{.mark}, prejudice, subjective attitudes, and political
interference of any kind. This last aim may seem rather utopian, given
the widely accepted view that knowledge is constructed and truth, even
in natural sciences, is not free from subjectivity. Nevertheless, I wish
to insist that even though there is no absolutely objective knowledge,
it is always a sublime endeavor to strive to make our produced knowledge
as free of subjectivity as possible. In the non-­ academic dimension,
[Sinologism]{.mark} is an intellectual commodity, created by a diverse
array of people including Westerners, Chinese, and others, to meet the
demand for Chinese knowledge by different countries and regions of the
world. Just as a commodity [requires modification]{.mark} and
improvement in content, form, quality and packaging in response to
market needs, Sinologism as an intellectual commodity [changes in
accordance with the demand for China knowledge]{.mark} in different
historical periods and by different geographical areas. In one
historical period, it took on a romantic picture of Khan's empire
described by Marco Polo; in another historical period, it is represented
as the ideal state ruled by philosopher-­ kings in Leibniz's and
Voltaire's accounts; in still another historical period, it was bleakly
presented as a fossilized civilization like a mummy; in modern times, it
assumed the scary image of Red China with the menacing power of the
Yellow Peril in history. Recently, against the backdrop of an economic
boom and impressive industrial achievement, there have appeared two
opposite images of China: a blindly optimistic view that predicts the
twenty-­ first century to be China's century; another pessimistic view
that forewarns of the imminent implosion of the Chinese economy and the
collapse of its government. Although its packaging constantly changes,
the invariable constant in Sinologism is the inner logic that operates
at its core: the unconscious logic of Western-centric intellectual
consumerism. How can we get out of the prevalent intellectual
consumerism? I have redefined Sinologism as an alienation of Sinology
and knowledge production. This redefinition contains insights for going
out of Sinologism as alienated intellec - tual commodity and for
restoring the original purpose and function of Sinology and knowledge.
But how can we overcome alienation in Sinologism? A viable way out of
Sinologism is to get off the beaten track of sinologistic thinking and
engage in epistemic and methodological reflections on how to approach
China-- West studies from a genuinely academic perspective. As a
critical theory Sinolo - gism inevitably overlaps with Orientalism and
postcolonialism, but, as I have already discussed in this study, it has
some distinctive differences. Orientalism has its strengths in
critiquing Western imperialism and colonialism, but it has little to say
about the role of colonized people in the creation of Orientalism.
Postcolonialism has made up for some of its inadequacies, but it remains
an ideology-­ dominant political criticism. In my view the theory of
Sinologism should not become a theory of ideological criticism, but
should strive to be a theory of critical reflection on how to do
scholarship and how to produce knowledge in ways relatively free from
the interferences of politics and ideology. For example, through
critical analysis of the problems in produced knowledge about China
since Marco Polo's times, and the problematic views, attitudes, and
evaluations of Chinese civilization by the Chinese themselves, Chinese
and Western scholars engaged in China-- West studies might self-­
consciously conduct reflections on the guiding principles,
methodologies, conceptual paradigms, and research outcomes as part of
their efforts to locate more scientific, objective, and fair ways of
doing China scholarship. In so doing they may find inspiration and
insight for decolo - nizing, depoliticizing, and de-­ ideologizing
Chinese scholarship. A theory of self-­ conscious reflection The ideology
of Sinologism has obstructed Chinese and Western scholars in their
perception and representation of China. It has in turn blurred Western
and non-­ Western people's own vision and understanding of their own
cultures, because a true understanding of one's own culture requires the
mirror image of another culture. Consequently there is an urgent need
for self-­ conscious reflec - tion on the part of both Westerners and
non-­ Westerners alike. There is also a pressing need for the Chinese to
understand their own culture. As Sinologism has penetrated almost all
strata of Chinese academia and all aspects of Chinese social life, it
has become an obstacle to the healthy development of Chinese society.
The inundation of Western ideas and scholarship into China in the 1970s
during the initial stage of Reform and Openness made it possible for
Chinese academia to emancipate its mind, but it has also intensified the
cultural uncon - scious centering on intellectual colonization, and
strengthened the epistemological and methodological inertia of the
Chinese mind and caused the atrophy of scholarly creativity and
originality. It has become the consensus that the presentday prosperity
of Chinese scholarship is based on introduction, imitation, repro­
duction and duplication. Numerous scholars deplore the low degrees of
originality and creativity in Chinese academia. Almost all academic
fields are content with low-­ level duplication of Western academic
achievements. This is especially so in the social sciences and
humanities. To introduce popular Western theories into China has become
an assuredly successful way to fame and honor in Chinese humanities and
social sciences. The appearance of a new Chinese coinage, shanzhai 8
(literally, a fortified mountain village, figuratively, copy,
counterfeit, fake, duplicate, copycat, etc.) vividly reflects the
scholarly status quo and a social mentality, which shows little interest
in original creation but is only content with copycatting. It has
confirmed from the linguistic per - spective my identified problems of
epistemic and methodological inertia, which is also endemic in the
fields of natural sciences and technology. If a field of science and
technology can rely on Western expertise, Chinese scholars seldom
produce original work and achievements. Only in those areas where
Western expertise is not available, Chinese scholars have produced
original and creative work. Chinese society has a strong predilection
for the Nobel Prizes, but it can be safely said that so long as the
mentality of Sinologism is not eliminated, Chinese science and
technology have no hope of reaching the height worthy of a Nobel Prize,
because sinologistic thinking is the natural enemy to originality.
Chinese academia is in need of a second mental emancipation since the
beginning of Reform and Openness. The critical theory of Sinologism and
its paradigm of reflection may contribute to this second emancipation.
From another perspective, Sinologism has hampered fruitful dialogues
between China and West in particular and the cultural exchanges between
different cultures in general. Sinologization is even more devastating
for other third-­ world cultures, as it is capable of causing epistemic
inertia and atrophy of original creativity of non-Western countries and
peoples. In the worldwide context, the critical theory of Sinologism may
contribute to the global enterprise of intellectual and mental
de-colonization. It may help people of Third World countries become
aware of grave consequences of "spiritual colonization" and "self-­
colonization," overcome intellectual and academic inertia, and produce
original and creative work in academic as well as in cultural domains.
Ultimately, it may help overcome alienations of Sinology, China
knowledge, and knowledge production in cross-cultural studies. The core
of Sinologism in China-- West studies and cross-­ cultural studies is the
cultural unconscious arising from the false consciousness of ethnic,
national, inter-­ national, inter-­ cultural differences, and ideological
programming. In his study of the political unconscious, Jameson argues
that "the neo-­ Freudian nos - talgia for some ultimate moment of cure ,
in which the dynamics of the unconscious proper rise to the light of day
and of consciousness and are somehow 'integrated' in an active lucidity
about ourselves and the determinations of our desires and our behavior"
is a "myth," and "the Marxian ideological analysis: namely, the vision
of a moment in which the individual subject would be somehow fully
conscious of his or her determination by class and would be able to
square the circle of ideological conditioning by sheer lucidity and the
taking of thought," a "mirage." 9 I accept the ever-­ presence of
politics in all discourses, but I do not subscribe to the idea that
there is no disinterested approach to the production of knowledge and
scholarship. Here, I will analyze a case to show why I think this is so.
In her influential article, "Can the Subaltern Speak?" Spivak expresses
a concern over "the possibility that the intellectual is complicit in
the persistent constitution of the Other as the Self's shadow." 10 She
cites the British outlawing of sati , the Hindu practice of sacrificing
a widow by burning her on her husband's funeral pyre as an example.
While the British intervention was for the most admirable humanitarian
reasons, the act serves to reinforce the perception of the difference
between British "civilization" and Indian "barbarism," thereby
justifying the British colonial rule and Kipling's famous (or notorious)
saying that it is "the white man's burden" to civilize the colonized
peoples. As Hindu culture was written out of law, going underground due
to the British intervention in colonial history, Spivak worries lest
present-­ day intellectuals may commit similar acts of condescension to
those of the British colonists when they represent the oppressed. I wish
to relate this to a similar historical practice in China. Foot-­ binding
was a tortuous custom imposed on Chinese girls in pre-­ modern times by
the male-­ dominated patriarchal society. It was finally abolished as a
result of the concerted efforts of Chinese and Western missionaries. The
anti foot-­ binding campaigns were initiated by the Chinese, but were
inspired by Western ideas, and Western missionaries played a significant
role in it. Western missionaries supported the campaign because they
considered foot-­ binding as running counter to Christian beliefs.
Although their position was colored considerably by Western-­ centric
beliefs, because the missionaries did not view the practice as a case
that demonstrated Western cultural superiority over Chinese cultural
inferiority, their intervention was seldom, if ever, viewed in the same
light as that for the British abolition of sati . The British
humanitarian intervention was accompa - nied by negative reactions,
precisely because the British colonialists made use of their
humanitarian acts to strengthen their political control of India. If the
British had not contaminated their intervention with political motives,
the abolition of sati would have been a most praiseworthy act. Recently
a friend of mine who has read my articles on Sinologism published in
Chinese journals, had an extended conversation with me. He found no
problem with my analyses of Sinologism, but took issue with my advocacy
of depoliticization and de-­ ideologization of scholarship and knowledge.
He posed this question: how can you engage in a disinterested scholarly
study of issues that are by nature and function, ideologies? As an
example, he cited Marxism in China. My answer is: it is true that
Marxism is an ideology and a reigning ide - ology in China, but it does
not mean that one cannot study it from an apolitical and non-­
ideological perspective. I agree that there is no absolutely ideology-­
free scholarship, but there is relatively [disinterested
scholarship]{.mark}. In Edward Said's rebuttal of the attacks on his
Orientalism , he repudiates Bernard Lewis's charge of "a violation of
the very idea of disinterested scholarship." 11 I have demonstrated in
Chapter 2 that though he and Lewis argue from diametrically political
positions, both of them in effect agree on one thing: there is
disinterested scholarship. 12 I, too, firmly believe that there is
disinterested scholarship and there are relatively neutral, objective,
and bias-­ free approaches to knowledge production. My whole study has
shown that Sinologism is an unconscious culture with the logic of a
cultural unconscious. As the cultural unconscious is deeply hidden in
China-- West studies, Sinologism will not be a short-­ lived phenomenon.
[Recognition]{.mark} of its logic and rationale [will be the first
step]{.mark} to going beyond it, but its ultimate [disappearance will
rest upon the emergence of a truly human]{.mark}, rather than
ethno-centric, [mentality, based on the understanding of different
cultures in terms of our common humanity and a bias-free
reverence]{.mark} for facts, truths, intellectual equality and
integrity. Once freed from the unconscious logic of Sinolo - gism,
cross-­ cultural studies will no longer rely on Western theories as
universal paradigms, but use them as reference frameworks to study the
historical conditions ­ of non-Western cultures and societies, and there
will appear truly s cientific and objective approaches to non-­ Western
materials, resulting in bias-­ free knowledge about non-­ Western
cultures. In the field of China--West studies, so long as we become
fully conscious of the logic of Sinologism and guard against its
appearance in knowledge and scholarship, [we will]{.mark} eventually be
able to [usher in a "golden age"]{.mark} when knowledge about China and
other cultures is pursued for its own sake, free from the interference
of the political ideologies of colonialism, Western-centrism,
ethno-centrism, and other political and ideological agendas. And there
will appear genuine understanding and appreciation of traditions and
cultures other than one's own, which will facilitate the
[fostering]{.mark} of [peace and harmony]{.mark} in the world and
contribute to the healthy development of globalization. Conceived and
pursued for this ultimate goal, the conception of [Sinologism is]{.mark}
not [a theory of]{.mark} ideological critique but a critical theory of
[self-conscious reflection.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Alt -- Epistemological Shift

Far from being an expert in China or East Asia, 16 I read Peters'
article through my own work that, in part, centers on critical
theories/pedagogies, and comparative and international education (CIE).
[[Through critical pedagogical lenses]{.underline}]{.mark}, I see
Peters' overall argument as [calling for [**(re-)reading** the politics
of]{.mark} the **'[threat']{.mark}**[, question]{.mark}ing [if it
emerges from]{.mark} [(neo)coloniality and epistemologies of the
North]{.mark}.]{.underline} Peters details a [[histography of
sociopolitical]{.mark} [delegitimization on]{.mark} how non-western
[othering has encouraged]{.mark} Western assimilation and the [need to
disrupt the politics of Western supremacy. **Comparative work is
essential** here]{.mark}]{.underline}, but comparative fields inherently
form contested terrains. CIE work becomes problematic when
non-contextually positioning one educational system as 'best' for all
others to blindly assimilate to. Opposingly, critical CIE is crucial for
better understanding the commonalities and differences between
educational systems to allow for true contextual lending and borrowing.
Two important notations need to be given. First, critically reading the
world is largely comparing what we 'know' with new knowledges, so such
comparative problematizing the self's ingenuous knowledges is also
needed beyond the professionalized CIE field. This includes critically
reading our own comparisons guided by Western benchmarking. Second,
'education' here is beyond schooling to include non-formal and informal
models (e.g. public pedagogy through Hastie's comparisons with Nazism).
Largely avoiding giving explicit self-analysis, [[Peters calls]{.mark}
on readers [to reflect upon what]{.mark} [needs to be **(un)learned**
from hidden curricula of Western supremacy]{.mark}. I read
[Peters]{.mark}' article through the lenses of Said's (1979) Orientalism
and Boaventura de Sousa Santos (2016, 2018) [calls to **counter
epistemologies** of the North's dominance and **resulting
oppressions**]{.mark}. As such, Peters critiques [West]{.mark}ern
policymaking to thwart 'threats' of [los]{.mark}ing [global hegemony
through de-Orientalization and dethroning epistemologies of the
North]{.mark}.]{.underline} I see two [[conundrums]{.mark} which [are
difficult but not impossible to overcome through teaching for critical
literacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} First, [such [reflectivity is
meaningless]{.mark} and without transformative praxis if
[epistemological dominance is not]{.mark} critically
[problematized]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hidden curricula of untethered
Western supremacy without contextuality that Peters argues hardens the
difficulty of its disruption, but also amplifies its necessity. [For
example, this coincides with my article on being a self-defined Freirean
scholar in China in which I problematize both Western-centric rubrics of
'quality' academics and how, ironically, [Western]{.mark}
[academics]{.mark} too-often [do not **critically compare themselves**
within their self-legitimized rubrics]{.mark}]{.underline} (see
Misiaszek, 2018). The second conundrum I see is the perceived 'threat'
of a global paradigm shift of epistemologies of the North eastward and
thus Orientalism is disrupted, not by ceasing epistemological dominance
but rather shifting them eastward. [Two issues come to mind here. One is
de Sousa Santos' framing the grounding of epistemologies of the North
with **coloniality, patriarchy, and capitalism**. Peters argues China's
lack of histories of being the colonizer and China is 'becom\[ing\] a
vast and encompassing global capitalist power' but not the Western
perception of a 'capitalism and liberal democracy \[a\]s a holy
combination'.]{.underline} [Second, [epistemologies of the South should
not replace Northern epistemological dominance, but rather]{.mark} exist
to [**counter them for teaching**,]{.mark} learning and decision-making
through ecologies of knowing (Santos, 2018). Without question, [global
**epistemological shifts will occur**, but their]{.mark} processes and
emergent [outcomes should be read]{.mark} as
[possibilities]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than fatalistically
determined already. Not writing in a fatalistic manner, [[Peters'
leaves]{.mark} open the [possibilities for]{.mark} these upcoming shifts
by [learning from]{.mark} the [politics of supremacy]{.mark} and
dominance [to **avoid global oppressions** and **planetary
unsustainability**]{.mark} from continuing/reoccurring. Unfortunately,
if we learn or not is questionable.]{.underline}

#### Vote neg to have the dragon of Yellow Peril emerge from its lair of the American psyche and bring about the death of America

CHINESE AMERICA AND THE YELLOW PERIL: WHAT IS TO BE DONE?

In the last year of the nineteenth century, Theodore Roosevelt wrote to
Spring Rice, a British diplomat, boasting, \"Together . . . the two
branches of the Anglo-Saxon race . . . can whip the world.\"302 A few
years later, he was not that sure. And neither were the U.S. presidents
who came after him. For the next one hundred years first China, then
Japan, then China again would rise up in America\'s public consciousness
as a threat to the West in general and the United States in particular.
**[[In each era of]{.mark} this [yellow peril mystique Americans of
Asian heritage]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whether immigrant aliens or
native-born citizens, **[would [suffer outrages]{.mark} directed
[against]{.mark} their character, culture, opportunities,
and]{.underline}**, often enough, **[[their very
lives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Whether cast as members of a \"race,\"
a \"civilization,\" or a \"culture,\" [Asian Americans are treated as
bearers of virtually ineradicable traits that]{.mark}, are at least
implicitly [assumed to be \"inherited]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}** Thus,
Professor Huntington asserts that civilizational \"differences are the
products of centuries\"303 and that cultural differences are \"far more
fundamental than differences among political ideologies and political
regimes.\"304 For Huntington, as Robert G. Lee has pointed out in his
thoroughgoing critique of the \"clash of civilizations\" thesis,305
**[[Asian Americans]{.mark}, together with all those representatives of
other non-western civilizations residing in America, [are imagined to
threaten the U.S. with \"de-Westernization]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}**
This is a fate so terrible, Huntington-sounding very much like Homer
Lea - warns, that **[\"[if Americans cease to adhere to their liberal
democratic]{.mark} and European-rooted political [ideology, the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[as we
have known it [will cease to exist]{.mark} and will follow the other
ideologically defined superpower \[the Soviet Union\] on the ash heap of
history.\"]{.underline}**306 However, **[[it is the Asian American
victims of individuals]{.mark} and groups that have been moved to
murderous action [who have become the real martyrs to such
apprehensions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Robert G. Lee has summarized
**[some of [the most lethal of the attack]{.mark}s that [have occurred
since the re-emergence of the yellow peril in the]{.mark} American
mind-life and the imposition of what he calls the \"[mere gook
rule]{.mark},\" i.e., the rule that [any Asian American is a \"gook\"
worthy of extermination]{.mark}:]{.underline}** Most notorious have been
**[[the murders of Vincent Chin]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Detroit;
**[[Navorze Mody]{.mark},]{.underline}** an Indian American, in New
Jersey;. . . **[[Vandy Phorng]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a Cambodian
American, in Massachusetts in 1987; **[[Jim Loo]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
Chinese American, in North Carolina, and five Cambodian and Laotian
American children in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard, in 1989; **[[Hung
Trong]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a Vietnamese American, in Los Angeles in
1996 . . ., \[and\] the killings of scores of Asian American shopkeepers
and cabdrivers \... \[as well as\] twenty-five Korean American
shopkeepers . . . killed by non-Korean assailants \[in the two years
before the Los Angeles riot of 1992\].307 And, **[[what is to be
done?]{.underline}]{.mark}** Rose Hum Lee, writing in 1960, after the
Korean conflict had ended but before the Vietnam War, the temporary
competitive advantage of Japan, or the national security fears about
China and America\'s Chinese had revived a new yellow peril, thought
that \"Now is the most auspicious time \[for Chinese residing in the
United States\] to strive for total and unreserved integration into the
American society\" and put the burden of accomplishing this on the
Chinese themselves: \"Regardless of where the peoples of the United
States of America originated, they must strive to fit in to the new
social climate which emerged in American society and the world after
World War II.\"308 Forty years later we can see that such a program,
even if it is desirable - and some of the new multiculturalists have
registered their dissent from it - has not been effected[. **[Even after
being designated as]{.underline}**]{.mark} one element of
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** Asian American **[\"[model
minority,\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**309 a veritable role model for other
ethnoracial groups experiencing race prejudice, discrimination, and
poverty, **[Chinese Americans discover that [in times of crisis they are
thrust back]{.mark} into the special category reserved for internal
enemies.]{.underline}**310 The idea of America, or the entire Occident
for that matter, **[being [in peril from the \"yellow\" people]{.mark}
has something of a \"geological\" character. It is [deeply embedded in
the Occidental consciousness]{.mark} of itself, a consciousness
[that]{.mark}]{.underline}**, until recently, **[[took \"whiteness\" to
be a fact of nature]{.mark} needing neither an \"archaeology\" nor a
sociological deconstruction]{.underline}**,311 **[[and \"Orientalism\"
to be its]{.mark} utter and [absolute
antithesis]{.mark}]{.underline}**.312 It is an all-too-neglected element
in the \"American dilemma\" that, despite numerous efforts over the past
half-century, has not been re solved.313 Robert Park once pointed out
that \"A more thorough investigation of the facts would probably show
that minorities, racial, cultural, and national, have always sought the
freedom and protection of the more inclusive imperium.\"314 No doubt
this is true, but two questions arise with respect to that claim: How is
that freedom and protection to be gained? What forms of social and
cultural organization are most conducive to both liberty and security?
None of the proposed processual and institutional answers to these
questions-assimilation, acculturation, amal gamation, on the one hand;
congregation, pluralism, ethnic power, and multiculturalism on the
other-has as yet proved either effective or become likely to be fully
realized.315 **[[The lair of the yellow peril\'s fire breathing dragon
is to be found in the winding labyrinth of the American psyche. It
is]{.mark} one of the \"idols\" of the American mind in a society
that,]{.underline}** as Harold Isaacs pointed out so presciently in
1975, **[is \"[fragmenting and retribalizing]{.mark} \... at a much more
rapid rate, certainly, [than \[it is\] moving toward any more humane
kind of]{.mark} humanhood in the [arrangement]{.mark} of \[its\] social
and political affairs]{.underline}**.\"316 Asian Americans, not only Wen
Ho Lee, are thus waiting for an outcome still unclear and more than
likely to be unsatisfying.

### Retooling of rhetoric

#### Thus, the alt is a retooling of rhetoric -- in order to decolonize western academia, we adopt a "global intellectual posture"---rather than adhering to the 1ac's epistemological failures of "yes or no" questions, we pose a critical analysis of colonial discourses (maybe retag this)

117 - 123)**//BRownRice**

The recent resuscitation of the project of Empire should give
International Relations scholars particular pause.1 For a discipline
long premised on a triumphant Westphalian sovereignty, there should be
something remarkable about the ease with which the case for brute force,
regime change and empire-building is being formulated in widespread
commentary spanning the political spectrum. Writing after the 1991 Gulf
War, Edward Said notes the US hesitance to use the word 'empire' despite
its long imperial history.2 This hesitance too is increasingly under
attack as even self-designated liberal commentators such as Michael
Ignatieff urge the US to overcome its unease with the 'e-word' and
selfconsciously don the mantle of imperial power, contravening the
limits of sovereign authority and remaking the world in its universalist
image of 'democracy' and 'freedom'.3 Rashid Khalidi has argued that the
**[[US invasion]{.mark} and occupation]{.underline}** of Iraq does
indeed **[[mark]{.mark} a new stage in [American]{.mark} world
[hegemony]{.mark}, replacing the indirect and proxy forms of Cold War
domination with a [regime]{.mark} much more reminiscent [of European
colonial empires]{.mark} in the Middle East]{.underline}**.4 **[The ease
with which a defence of empire has been mounted and a [colonial
project]{.mark} so unabashedly [resurrected]{.mark} makes this a
particularly opportune, if not necessary, moment, as [scholars of 'the
global']{.mark}, to [take stock of our disciplinary complicities with
power, to account for colonialist imaginaries]{.mark} that are lodged at
the heart of a discipline ostensibly interested in power but perhaps far
too deluded by the formal equality of state sovereignty and overly
concerned with security and order.]{.underline}** Perhaps more than any
other scholar, Edward Said's groundbreaking work in
**[[Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** has argued and
**[[demonstrated]{.underline}]{.mark}** the long and deep **[[complicity
of academic scholarship with colonial
domination.]{.underline}]{.mark}**5 In addition to spawning whole new
areas of scholarship such as postcolonial studies, Said's writings have
had considerable influence in his own discipline of comparative
literature but also in such varied disciplines as anthropology,
geography and history, all of which have taken serious and sustained
stock of their own participation in imperial projects and in fact
regrouped around that consciousness in a way that has simply not
happened with International Relations.6 It has been 30 years since
Stanley **[Hoffman accused [IR]{.mark} of being an '[American social
science']{.mark} and noted its [too close connections to US foreign
policy]{.mark} elites and US preoccupations of the Cold War to be able
to make any universal claims]{.underline}**,7 yet there seems to be a
**[curious amnesia and lack of curiosity about the political history of
the discipline]{.underline}**, and in particular its own complicities in
the production of empire.8 **[[Through]{.mark} [what discourses the
imperial gets reproduced]{.mark}, resurrected and re-energised [is a
question that should be]{.mark} very much [at the heart of a discipline
whose task it is to examine]{.mark} the contours of [global
power.]{.mark} Thinking this failure of IR through some of Edward Said's
critical scholarly work from his long distinguished career as an
intellectual and activist, this article is an attempt to politicise and
hence render questionable the disciplinary traps that have, ironically,
circumscribed the ability of scholars whose very business it is to think
about global politics to actually think globally and
politically.]{.underline}** What Edward Said has to offer IR scholars, I
believe, is a certain kind of global sensibility, a critical but
sympathetic and felt awareness of an inhabited and cohabited world.
Furthermore, it is a profoundly political sensibility whose globalism is
predicated on a cognisance of the imperial and a firm non-imperial ethic
in its formulation. I make this argument by travelling through a couple
of Said's thematic foci in his enormous corpus of writing. Using a lot
of Said's reflections on the role of public intellectuals, I argue in
this article that **[[IR scholars need to develop]{.mark} what I call [a
'global intellectual posture']{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the 1993 Reith
Lectures delivered on BBC channels, Said outlines three positions for
public intellectuals to assume -- as an outsider/exile/marginal, as an
'amateur', and as a disturber of the status quo speaking 'truth to
power' and self-consciously siding with those who are underrepresented
and disadvantaged.9 Beginning with a discussion of Said's critique of
'professionalism' and the 'cult of expertise' as it applies to
International Relations, I first argue the importance, for scholars of
global politics, of taking politics seriously. Second, I turn to Said's
comments on the posture of exile and his critique of identity politics,
particularly in its nationalist formulations, to ask what it means for
students of global politics to take the global seriously. Finally, I
attend to some of Said's comments on humanism and contrapuntality to
examine what IR scholars can learn from Said about feeling and thinking
globally concretely, thoroughly and carefully. IR Professionals in an
Age of Empire: From 'International Experts' to 'Global Public
Intellectuals' **[One of the profound effects of the war on terror
initiated by the Bush administration has been a significant constriction
of a democratic public sphere, which has included the active and
aggressive curtailment of intellectual and political dissent and a sharp
delineation of national boundaries along with concentration of state
power. The [academy]{.mark} in this context has become a [particularly
embattled site with some highly disturbing onslaughts on academic
freedom.]{.mark} At the most obvious level, this has involved fairly
well-calibrated neoconservative attacks on US higher education that have
invoked the mantra of 'liberal bias' and demanded legislative regulation
and reform10, an [onslaught supported by a well-funded network of
conservative]{.mark} think tanks, centres, [institutes]{.mark} and
'concerned citizen groups' within and outside the higher education
establishment11 and with [considerable reach among]{.mark} sitting
legislators, jurists and policy-makers as well as the
[media.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But what has in part made possible the
encroachment of such nationalist and statist agendas has been a larger
history of the corporatisation of the university and the accompanying
'professionalisation' that goes with it. **[Expressing concern with
'academic acquiescence in the decline of public discourse in the United
States']{.underline}**, Herbert Reid has examined the ways in which the
university is beginning to operate as another transnational
corporation12, and **[critiqued the consolidation of a '[culture of
professionalism']{.mark} where academic bureaucrats engage in
bureaucratic role-playing, minor academic turf battles mask the larger
managerial power play on campuses and the increasing influence of a
relatively autonomous administrative elite and the rise of insular
'expert cultures' have led to academics relinquishing their claims to
public space and authority.]{.underline}**13 While it is **[[no surprise
that the US academy should find itself too at that uneasy confluence of
neoliberal]{.mark} globalising [dynamics]{.mark} and
[exclusivist]{.mark} nationalist [agendas]{.mark} that is the
predicament of many contemporary institutions around the world, there is
much reason for concern and an urgent need to rethink the role and place
of intellectual labour in the democratic process.]{.underline}** This is
especially true for scholars of the global writing in this age of
globalisation and empire. Edward Said has written extensively on the
place of the academy as one of the few and increasingly precarious
spaces for democratic deliberation and argued the necessity for public
intellectuals immured from the seductions of power.14 **[[Defending the
US academy]{.mark} as one of the last remaining utopian spaces, '[the
one public space available to real alternative intellectual
practices]{.mark}: no other institution like it on such a scale exists
anywhere else in the world today']{.underline}**15, **[and lauding the
remarkable critical theoretical and historical work of many academic
intellectuals in a lot of his work, Said also complains that 'the
American University, with its munificence, utopian sanctuary, and
remarkable diversity, has defanged (intellectuals)]{.underline}**'16.
The most serious threat to the 'intellectual vocation', he argues, is
'professionalism' and mounts a pointed attack on the proliferation of
'specializations' and the 'cult of expertise' with their focus on
'relatively narrow areas of knowledge', 'technical formalism',
'impersonal theories and methodologies', and most worrisome of all,
their ability and willingness to be seduced by power. 17Said mentions in
this context the funding of academic programmes and research which came
out of the exigencies of the Cold War18, an area in which there was
considerable traffic of political scientists (largely trained as IR and
comparative politics scholars) with institutions of policy-making.
**[[Looking at various influential US academics as 'organic
intellectuals' involved]{.mark} in a dialectical relationship with
[foreign policy-makers]{.mark} and examining the institutional
relationships at and among numerous think tanks and universities that
create convergent perspectives and interests, Christopher Clement has
studied US intervention in the Third World both during and after the
Cold War made possible and justified through various forms of
'intellectual articulation'.]{.underline}**19 This is not simply a
matter of scholars working for the state, but indeed a larger question
of intellectual orientation. It is not uncommon for IR scholars to feel
the need to formulate their scholarly conclusions in terms of its
relevance for global politics, where 'relevance' is measured entirely in
terms of policy wisdom. Edward Said's searing indictment of US
intellectuals -- policy-experts and Middle East experts - in the context
of the first Gulf War20 is certainly even more resonant in the
contemporary context preceding and following the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
The space for a critical appraisal of the motivations and conduct of
this war has been considerably diminished by the expertise-framed
national debate wherein certain kinds of ethical questions irreducible
to formulaic 'for or against' and 'costs and benefits' analysis can
simply not be raised. In effect, what Said argues for, and **[[IR
scholars need to pay particular heed to]{.mark}, is [an understanding of
'intellectual relevance']{.mark} that is larger and more worthwhile,
that is about the [posing of critical]{.mark}, historical, ethical and
perhaps unanswerable [questions rather than the offering of recipes and
solutions]{.mark}, that is about politics (rather than techno-expertise)
in the most fundamental and important senses of the
vocation]{.underline}**.2

First, **[[non-Western IR reveals the possibility of a field of study
that clearly represents the name 'international']{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[IR is characterised by a 'representational
deficiency']{.underline}**, as I call it, **[because it lacks the proper
incorporation and recognition of the various approaches that can help it
to be properly 'international'.]{.underline}** To be sure IR has been
called different names including an "American social science" (Hoffman
1977), a "not-so international discipline" (Waever 1998), a "hegemonic
discipline" (Smith 2002), a "disjunctive empire" (Yew 2003) and a
"colonial household" (Agathangelou and Ling 2004; Inayatollah & Blaney
2004). This discussion did not begin just today. Thus, I emphasise this
deficiency not because it has not been discussed; it is because not much
attention has been devoted to it still. **[And if we should continue to
claim that the discipline is indeed 'international', the [prominent
scholars should not remain just North Americans and some
Europeans]{.mark}. To cite one example, a recent publication titled,
Fifty Key Thinkers in International Relations]{.underline}** (Griffiths
et al. 2009), **[reveals a tall list of all the theorists who matter in
IR. The list cannot be rehearsed here but the key point to note is that
while this list includes theories -- from realism to historical
sociology -- none of the theorists listed is of a non-Western origin,
although not all of them necessarily uphold a western ontology as
defined above.]{.underline}** The argument here is validated by the fact
that out of fifty so-called 'key thinkers' in IR, not even one African,
South American or Asian scholar is cited. This is not due to mere
forgetfulness. Rather, it does **[indicate that "[the 'who' of IR
studies continues to be a select number of academics hailing primarily
from the countries of the core]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Tickner 2003,
296). Let me add that **[it is not just about hoping that "the days of
the Third World being on the margins of the discipline of International
Relations will soon be over]{.underline}**" (Caroline and Wilkin 2004,
255) **[but [by doing something about the current state of affairs in a
more sustainable manner]{.mark}. Second[, bringing in non-Western
]{.mark}]{.underline}**IR **[[de-centres and de-territorializes the
'norm']{.mark} or status quo [by shifting the discipline from the myopic
singularities]{.mark}]{.underline}** ('single stories') **[of pervasive
mainstream conceptions]{.underline}**. As Hobson (2012) shows, **[IR
narratives have portrayed a "West Side Story" as the purpose of the
discipline is to promote and defend Western civilisation]{.underline}**
(cited in de Carvalho et al. 2011, 750), a case where broader
disciplinary dialogue has been rendered irrelevant. And this is simply
the outcome: "**[[the Eurocentric give away lies in the point that they
reified the West and denied the East agency]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
(ibid., 752). However, **[such a [myth becomes normalised]{.mark} as
'common sense']{.underline}** because 1) the historical literature on
1648 is hardly read and scrutinised; 2) IR scholars prefer to rely on
standard and mainstream textbook discussions in areas outside their
expertise; and 3) there is an inherent tendency towards 'presentism' --
the here and now (ibid., 756). To Acharya and Buzan (2007),**[[the
absence of non-Western]{.mark}]{.underline}** IR **[[theory]{.mark} has
been perpetuated not by the absolute lack of what constitute the 'good
life' in the non-West but rather [by ideational and perceptual
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which fuel a mixture of "Gramscian
hegemonies, and ethnocentrism and the politics of exclusion" (288). To
them, this is further facilitated by the Eurocentric framing of world
history and the fact that most mainstream IR theory has its origins in
Western philosophy and political theory. **[Thinking post-Western IR
will have to be able to [overcome these shortfalls by rewriting the
West's own history to reveal its biased representation]{.mark} in
standard textbooks]{.underline}**, and scholars must be ready to read
outside the mainstream box for a better understanding of the genealogies
that undergird most of the popular concepts in IR. In this regard, I
will agree with Welch (2003) that IR theorists should stop reading
Thucydides because such reading makes them think of only wars and the
overbearing power of 'the strong', inhibiting the contribution/influence
'the weak' can make/have. Third, **[[the incorporation of non-Western
worldviews will propel the field of study towards
"pluri-versality]{.mark}" instead of universality]{.underline}** (see
Mignolo 2009), **[which is good for the variety and diversity of its
objects of study]{.underline}**. Steve Smith, in his 2003 Presidential
to the International Studies Association, did not mince words when he
posited that "**[the discipline of International Relations has been a
very partial one. It has been a view decidedly from somewhere, and that
somewhere has been the world of the wealthy, imperial
powers]{.underline}**" (2004, 507). **[He argued that [theorists should
desist from hiding "behind the mask of value-neutrality and
empiricism"]{.mark} to theorise in a manner that will make the
discipline less hegemonic]{.underline}** (ibid., 514). **[This hegemony
does not only reside in the theories propounded but also the medium
through which they become known]{.underline}**. Herman Daly, a non-IR
scholar, gave the following revelation in his 1996 publication. In 1994
I decided to leave the World Bank to return to academia. I certainly had
no illusion that I was leaving blindness and corruption behind and
entering a realm of truth and honesty\... If I had harboured such an
illusion it would have quickly been dispelled by an experience with the
MIT Press that taught me that prestigious universities can sometimes be
less committed to free speech and open debate than commercial publishers
(Daly 1996, 10). This is a general statement that may not be relevant to
a discussion of IR as a so-called 'discipline' but it is instructive in
showing the epistemic imperialism that exists in the academy. Waever
(1998) in tracing the evolution of IR from Germany, France, the UK and
the US has also shown this parochialism in leading IR journals and
publication houses**[. The outstanding question is, what is the essence
of our scholarship if certain opinions will be shut down by those
(gatekeepers) who possess the technological and distributive instruments
requisite for the spread of these opinions]{.underline}**?12 **[[This
hegemony needs to be overcome by opening up the discipline to diversity
and variety]{.mark} not just within the West but also from the non-West.
This trend has resulted in the perception of Africa, for instance, as a
conformist continent or a "follower-society]{.underline}**" that will
continue to imitate the west without any clear theoretical, empirical or
even ideological originality (Adele 2000, 8). **[While some theorists
argue that the existence of 'original' non-Western IR may be difficult
to find or perhaps non-existent]{.underline}** (see Bilgin 2008; Qin
2007), **[I argue that this difficulty resides in the fact that efforts
have not been made to find them]{.underline}**. Additionally, it does
also depend on how we define theory. If the definition of theory takes
up the rationalist straightjacket, where 'good' theory is measured by
its six positivist criteria, namely; accuracy, falsifiability,
explanatory power, progressivity (as opposed to degenerating in its
research programs), consistency (with what is known in other areas) and
parsimony (Vasquez 1995, 230) then some non-Western contributions that
employ critical narrative inquiry or 'thick descriptions' will not
conform. But IR **[[needs to move past this Archimedean point to embrace
the criticality, reflexivity, and self-consciousness of the 'reality' it
tries to explain]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Finally, by looking outside
the West for alternative definitions of what IR entails we will be
thinking of a 'post-racist' discipline]{.underline}** (see Hobson 2007)
**[[through]{.mark} a [decolonisation]{.mark} of the subject matter,
[management of knowledge]{.mark}, and concepts/methods, [and academic
independence or]{.mark} potentially [interdependence]{.mark}. Until
quite recently, there was some kind of an embedded silence even among
critical scholars of the role of non-Western ideas/knowledge in IR. How
critical and emancipatory can we get if indeed we exclude the very
people we seek to emancipate from the frontiers of such
debates?]{.underline}** As it stands now, the empire of IR has become a
house full of (over)privileged white American and a few British men (and
a few women additions) who accept only their interpretations as what
constitutes the 'real world'. According to Shilliam (2011), "the
attribution of who can 'think' and produce valid knowledge of human
existence has always been political; but it was made all the more so in
the nineteenth century when Georg Hegel gave the philosopher a central
role in the development and cultivation of the modern self" (2, emphasis
in original). Arguing that world order is continually characterised by
imperialism, Saurin (2006) notes that **[[the need to
decolonise]{.mark}]{.underline}** IR **[[is]{.mark}
[imperative]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Right from the time IR is said to
have come into existence, that is 1919, the assumptions, concepts, and
language of inquiry have been "infused with imperial and colonial
reasoning" (ibid., 24). And due to its primary quest "to nationalise
social scientific enquiry" resulted in several illusions of what IR is
(ibid., 31**[); these illusions or 'foundational myths' were facilitated
by the prevailing Eurocentrism in world history]{.underline}** **[-- a
modernity based on European discovery of 'the rest of the
world']{.underline}** (see Halperin 2006). **[A post-racist IR will not
only require the centering of marginalised interpretations and voices,
but also the re-interpretation]{.underline}** (and potential
de-centering) **[of prevailing ones to reveal their obscured
shortcomings. It would [also require]{.mark} the field of study [to
think beyond its decidedly stringent Western, rationalist
framework]{.mark} by moving beyond the essentialist characterisations of
'the West' and 'the rest]{.underline}**' as depicted by Huntington
(1993) and an absolute abolishing of Fukuyama's The End of History and
the Last Man (1992)13 in terms of deorientalising the 'other'14 because
civilisation "never has a final definitive form" (Cox 1995, 14; see also
Shani 2008).

Response: '**[[Global IR]{.mark}']{.underline}** Sharing these concerns,
more recent studies have begun to pay greater attention to the
globalisation of IR in an attempt to **[[render]{.mark} the [discipline
more inclusive]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It sets out to safeguard against
a **[[tug of war between Western and non-Western
IR]{.underline}]{.mark}** and a subsumption of one of them in favour of
the other. Amitav Acharya is probably the most passionate scholar in
this regard. In his presidential address at the annual convention of the
International Studies Association in 2014, Acharya explained what
'Global IR' is or should be. His background assumption is this: IR does
'not reflect the voices, experiences ... and contributions of the vast
majority of the societies and states in the world' (Acharya, 2014: 647).
Yet, instead of arguing for a counter (i.e. 'non-Western') approach, he
presented the possibility of a 'Global IR' that transcends the divide
between the 'West and the Rest'. In his views, IR should be 'a truly
inclusive' discipline that recognises its multiple and diverse
foundations. **[What '[Global IR']{.mark} calls for is not [to
discard]{.mark} or disavow [Western-centric IR, but]{.mark} rather to
[render it more inclusive]{.mark} and broader, so that it
[reflects]{.mark} voices and [experiences outside the West]{.mark} more
fully]{.underline}** (Acharya, 2016). In this regard, Acharya and Buzan
(2017) have recently noted as follows: while the **[development of
national schools]{.underline}** can contribute to the goal of a Global
IR ... our key concern about any national school is whether it can
'deprovincialize' -- i.e. **[travel beyond the national or regional
context from which it is derived in the first place]{.underline}**.
(Acharya and Buzan, 2017: 361)

the academy as a place to voyage in, owning none of it but at home
everywhere in it. (Said 2000: 403) **[[The traveller's
knowledge]{.mark}, secure but contingent, [becomes a way of knowing
without]{.mark} the ideological [excesses]{.mark} of either certainty or
indeterminacy.]{.underline}** Said sometimes showed little patience for
infinite play, Derrida being on the receiving end of some of Said's
criticisms (1983), as much as Said derided the chauvinism in what Freire
(1994) once called 'smug Marxis\[m\]'. As well, Said (1994a) does not
fraternize with ethnic triumphalism when he pronounces, **['I have no
patience with the position that "we" should only or mainly be concerned
with what is "ours"']{.underline}** (xxv). **[Said [encourages]{.mark}
us to be at home in exile and to stand with the exile wherever we find a
home. We need not agree with]{.underline}** Bachelard's (1964)
'**[epistemological rupture',]{.underline}** appropriated as the
'epistemological break' by his former student, Althusser (1971), **[to
arrive at Said's basic point that the geo-politics of knowledge requires
[not only an inversion]{.mark} of a previous system [but a]{.mark} more
[complete overhaul or transformation]{.mark} of that system.
[Decolonizing the curriculum]{.mark} through nationalism, even a counter
one at that, [is only one necessary step]{.mark} towards
liberation]{.underline}**. As Said (2000) notes, **[one of the first
sites of change after decolonization was the schools, such as the
Arabization of the curriculum and changing intellectual norms, including
values to be taught. [The inversion of orientalism comes in]{.mark} two
possible forms, the first and more [benign]{.mark} being
[nationalism]{.mark}, the second [and]{.mark} more [nefarious]{.mark}
being [occidentalism.]{.mark} Having successfully avoided the second
does not guard against the limitations of the first.]{.underline}** As
an epistemological limit, **[nationalism encourages schools and students
to become different but Said ponders the importance of becoming
something else altogether.]{.underline}** Said (2000) fears that
**[nationalism in the university has represented not freedom but
accommodation, not brilliance and daring but caution and
fear]{.underline}**, not advancement of knowledge but self-preservation.
Not unlike the Fanon (\[1961\] 2005) of **[The Wretched of the Earth,
who was apprehensive that the native bourgeoisie after decolonization
would become a conservative force, Said questions nationalism's ability
to change]{.underline}** what Althusser (1971) calls **[the
'problematic', which is not the generation of new knowledge for its own
sake, even its [revolution]{.mark}ary form, but knowledge as a new
theory of society.]{.underline}** Sans the science fetish of Althusser,
**[Said [calls for a new function of knowledge.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Likewise, **[he critiques postmodernism's attempt to knock high culture
off its pedestal in favour of celebrating popular
culture]{.underline}**. This move may be a nod to studying former NBA
player Shaquille over Shakespeare but it replaces one form of
essentialism with another as a knee-jerk reaction to western knowledge
and its pretences, in one fell swoop. Here Said sides with the official
party line of the Frankfurt School with respect to the culture industry
(Horkheimer and Adorno 1976). **[To Said, over-celebratory analysis of
popular culture is intellectual provincialism disguised as the opposite
of elitism.]{.underline}** But worldly in his approach, Said is able to
keep his ear to the ground as well. Apposite to the fury over Saul
Bellow's incendiary comment (paraphrased here as 'Show me the African
Proust ... or Zulu Tolstoy!'), Said shows his contempt for the former
Nobel Prize winner's impertinence even as Said is able to admit Proust
or Tolstoy's greatness (and Bellow's, for that matter) (see Said 1994a:
25 and 328). Classically trained in European letters from grade school
to grad school, Said assimilated the European canon if only later to be
able to interrogate it. He did not accomplish this feat without also
enjoying in no small way the pleasures of engaging the 'great works'. He
is not a cheerleader of popular culture and took some pride in critical
judgement about rarified art, classical music and high literature
without their fetish. Said was far more familiar with Leavis and
Whitehead than he was of Beavis and Butt-Head. In this sense, he is as
conservative as they come, something of which he admits being guilty. He
was able to launch one of the most searing and searching critiques of
orientalism and imperialism, particularly in literature, only by going
through, and not around, the great works. In order to accomplish this,
he had to wade through what Matthew Arnold (1867) was fond of calling
'Culture', or the best that a society has produced. Travelling
curriculum and the decolonization movement **[The Decolonial Group
travels to Barcelona, Spain every summer to hold its summer school and
annual meeting.]{.underline}** Not to be equated with postcolonial
scholars like Bhabha, who concentrate on the colonial history between
European centres and the Southeast Asian corridor, **[[the Decolonial
Group focuses]{.mark} its [assault on]{.mark} the relationship between
Latin America and the handful of European nations that have [a]{.mark}
virtual [monopoly on]{.mark} philosophical [thought]{.mark},
particularly its epistemological roots.]{.underline}** From Dussel to
Grosfoguel, **[[this]{.mark} second [articulation]{.mark} of colonial
criticism [shifts the debate to]{.mark} another territory in the
geo-politics of knowledge on the nature of]{.underline}** what Walter
Mignolo (2002) calls **[[the 'colonial
difference'.]{.mark}]{.underline}** That said, **[I am not making a
radical cut between postcolonial and decolonial writers as ultimately
separate movements, even if they maintain important distinctions from
one another. The 'post' in postcolonial is by and large compatible with
the 'de' in decolonial; both are anti-colonial and anti-imperialist.
Both do not reject Marxism outright but neither do they find its uptake
of race to be satisfactory.]{.underline}** For Said, Marxism's main
contestatory framework between workers and owners of capital cannot
explain what he sees as the more-than-economic strife tearing up the
global social fabric, not the least of which is the role of imperialism.
**[Although their points of reference differ and the decolonial scholars
are more at home in the social sciences and philosophy department than
the literary-based postcolonialists, decolonial and postcolonial
scholarship converges on a common target of critique:
Eurocentrism.]{.underline}** Decolonizing the curriculum or colonization
of cognition takes as its starting point the critique of
colonial-imperial relations. But Said, like his close colleague Noam
Chomsky, was always clear that power asymmetries, while formidable, were
ultimately not indomitable. Said (2004) insisted on worldliness not only
as a way to arrive at a text's immanent structure as indefatigably
historical but as a way of being in the world, of being with others. The
comparatist Said was never radically separate from the teacherly Edward
and the latter made appearances now and then in the philologist's prose.
In other words, the university classroom is a social laboratory for
testing the integrity of his otherwise lofty ideas**[,
such]{.underline}** as contrapuntality (2001), intellectuals as amateurs
(1994b) and the hermeneutics of exile (2000). Always working against the
grain, Said nevertheless promoted what Freire (\[1970\] 1993) would have
called 'generosity', which guards against the bad faith that creeps in
after decades of trying to explain the underbelly of a hidden history, a
certain misanthropy and necrophilia. Although it seems the two never
actually met in person, Said and Freire were conceptual travellers with
a shared destination. **[As a professor of comparative literature for
many decades at Columbia University]{.underline}**, a Harvard doctoral
student in the 1960s and a host of boarding school experiences before
that, **[[Said]{.mark} has a sort of bookish biography. He
[experienced]{.mark} colonial schools in several countries, travelled
all over the globe and was as erudite as they come. These
[travels]{.mark} were [both literal and existential]{.mark} for the
younger Said]{.underline}**, an unsettling time that impacted his
intellectual work and made the more mature Said less inclined to settle
for silver-bullet, single-axis explanations about the nature of
historical experience (see also Leonardo 2013). **[By the time he wrote
the Introduction to Culture and Imperialism, he announces that it is 'an
exile's book']{.underline}** (1994a: xxvi). **[[Travel is the exile's
mode of]{.mark} nomadic living and Said could hardly avoid bringing this
constitutive part of his social conditioning into his [teaching
and]{.mark} opinions about [pedagogy. Our model]{.mark} for academic
freedom [should]{.mark} therefore [be the]{.mark} migrant or
[traveler]{.mark}]{.underline}**: for **[if, in the real world outside
the academy, we must needs be ourselves and only ourselves, inside the
academy we should be able to discover and travel among other selves,
other identities, other varieties of the human adventure.]{.underline}**
(Said 2000: 403) **[[This is not]{.mark} the kind of travel one finds on
a [cable channel]{.mark} endorsed by Rupert Murdoch. [And]{.mark} it is
not the sort of travel that mainstream [multiculturalism]{.mark} is
successful in propagating]{.underline}**, perhaps captured by the guilty
pleasure of watching 'American Idol'. **[[Said's travelling
theory]{.mark}, as outlined in a book chapter by that
title]{.underline}** (1983), **[[encourages]{.mark} the practice of
[knowledge as unsystematic]{.mark}]{.underline}** (in the sense of
abandoning originary thinking), **[[unexpert]{.underline}]{.mark}** (in
the sense of reconstructing authority) **[[and
unexploratory]{.underline}]{.mark}** (in the sense of positioning itself
against discovery). **[The de/ postcolonial traveller remains 'skeptical
and critical, [succumbing neither to dogmatism nor]{.mark} to [sulky
gloom]{.mark}]{.underline}**[']{.mark} (Said 1983: 230).
**[[This]{.mark} is a form of learning that differs from the
institutional apparatus we call 'schooling' that is more concerned with
socialization's teleological function than the educational function that
[prepares students for the 'incalculable' and 'irreducible'
other]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see Biesta 2010). **[[It differs from
uncritical]{.mark} forms of ethnic-based [pedagogy because]{.mark} a
[travelling pedagogy interrogates]{.mark} any [essentialist
arrival]{.mark} at questions of identity, ethnic or
otherwise.]{.underline}** **[[The]{.mark} image of the [traveler
depends]{.mark} not [on]{.mark} power but on [motion,]{.mark} on a
willingness to go into [different worlds,]{.mark} use [different]{.mark}
idioms, and understand a variety of [disguises]{.mark}, masks, [and
rhetorics.]{.mark} Travelers must suspend the claim of customary routine
in order to live in new rhythms and rituals.]{.underline}** Most of all,
and most unlike the potentate who must guard only one place and defend
its frontiers, **[the traveler crosses over, traverses territory, and
abandons fixed positions, all the time.]{.underline}** (Said 2000: 404)
Not unlike Giroux's (1992) 'border pedagogy', Said's suggestion is not
meant to be a form of trendy artifice. **[It is a traveller's
perspective without the baggage of tourist mentality. [It is a]{.mark}
cultural [politics of responsibility]{.mark} for the other who
represents no ultimate instrumentality but for the desire to co-exist in
a relation of difference without derision. [It is]{.mark} not a fetish
of the new in the capitalist sense of commodity production amidst the
old story of exploitation, but a [newness that reminds us of]{.mark} the
[dynamism]{.mark} and motion of real, historical life.]{.underline}** In
Said's words, 'Peace is the state of distinctness without domination,
with the distinct participating in each other' (2000: 172). **[As a
politics of difference, knowledge is forged in the interstices between
self and other, where the other is not the foil for the self but its
contrapuntal partner.]{.underline}** **[[If the]{.mark}
[colonial]{.mark}-imperial [lifeworld]{.mark} is maleducative because it
[fixes knowledge]{.mark} as something to be discovered and then imposed,
[then the decolonial]{.mark} imperative is to [insist on]{.mark} its
[openness]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Just as history is there for the
taking, as Freire always insisted, **[[knowledge is]{.mark} there
[for]{.mark} the [making]{.mark}.]{.underline}** If the colonial
situation is a process of layered enclosures, then **[decolonization is
the unveiling of its harms through complete disclosure and then looking
for escape hatches. Colonized subjects occupy a central role in this
truth and reconciliation process, but there is so much distortion to
their development that educators must at least be Fanonian in their
suspicions that forms of self-violence, or refusals about what the self
has become under the colonial regime, are a necessary part of
decolonization]{.underline}** (see Leonardo and Porter 2010; Leonardo
and Singh 2017). That is, **[[colonial regulation]{.mark} of
being,]{.underline}** from the Manichean division of people to apartheid
in everyday life, **[[subverts the colonized's ability to establish
clarity]{.mark} about their predicament.]{.underline}** For so long,
knowledge of the world served the master race's whims, compromising the
subordinate races' true desires for liberation, often aspiring to be
like the colonizer in search of an authentic image of the human (Freire
\[1970\] 1993). **[[Dis-orienting]{.mark} the [desire]{.mark} to become
suboppressors [is]{.mark} at least [half the task.]{.mark} For Said,
[the mistake has been oppositional]{.mark} thought's ability to [stop
at]{.mark} the door of liberation by settling for [sovereignty]{.mark}
or independence.]{.underline}** Settling down is seductive, especially
after so many years of movement where the colonial body is treated as
something to be carted around or displaced from one location to another.
**[This was sometimes articulated with the educational system involving
Native Americans in the US, for whom boarding school was a form of
enclosure, physically and intellectually]{.underline}** (Dog and Erdoes
1999). **[It may be a natural reaction to desire stillness in its many
manifestations, from nationalism to nascent essentialism.
[Travelling]{.mark} [curricula]{.mark} prefer to emphasize the dynamic
history that provides the backdrop of knowledge and pedagogy.
Intellectuals may be able to fix or freeze it, but this is a temporary
condition in order to answer the exigencies of life, university or
otherwise. Said's de/postcolonial perspective represents a pronounced
ambivalence]{.underline}** that opens up rather than closes off
potentialities, **[[dislodges the potentate that has structured academic
life]{.mark} ever since the first westerner walked onto its shores. [It
is]{.mark} an education [worth the]{.mark} name, a [culture]{.mark}
shared rather than a superior one that hovers, and a knowledge defined
by what it can reveal rather than what it covers.]{.underline}**

[The **[failure of Afghanistan]{.mark}** should [open our eyes to the
fact that **we don't**]{.mark} **really [know]{.mark}** [other
countries]{.mark} and cultures [at all]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the
run-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, then [[British]{.mark} Prime
Minister Tony Blair expressed his conviction that the people of Iraq
would welcome "liberation" by the United States and
Britain.]{.underline} [He [**refused to listen** to warnings]{.mark}
that Britain's [imperial record in Iraq would]{.mark} in fact [lead them
to regard]{.mark} British military [intervention]{.mark} with
instinctive distrust and [hostility]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet Blair was
also the first British prime minister to apologize in public for the
crimes of the British empire. As with Western liberal internationalists
in general, this acknowledgement of past national sins did not qualify
in any way Blair's assumption of the right to lecture other nations on
their sins, tell them how they should be governed, and invade them in
the name of building democracy. This combination of attitudes is
inexplicable in rational terms --- but makes perfect sense as a
manifestation of secular religion. In a religious context, how often
have loud public confessions of personal sinfulness provided the
justification for ferocious condemnation of the sins of others? This
combination is to be found in those [American [liberal
internationalists]{.mark} who have [acknowle]{.mark}dged and apologized
[for]{.mark} systematic American [support for savage]{.mark} Middle
Eastern [dictatorships --- **only to demand**]{.mark} that [people
in]{.mark} the [Middle East trust]{.mark} their promises that this time,
a U[.S. administration is]{.mark} **really, truly [sincere]{.mark}**
[about bringing democracy to the region]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Why]{.mark} on earth, on the basis of all past evidence, [should any
Arab]{.mark} or Iranian [trust]{.mark} such [promises]{.mark}? Indeed,
on the basis of their past record, would you buy a used car from these
drummers for democracy?]{.underline} Blair's combination of
[[**ideological fanaticism** and]{.mark} the total **[historical
illiteracy]{.mark}** on which it depends [was starkly revealed
in]{.mark} his July 2003 speech to the U.S. [Congress justifying]{.mark}
the [invasion of Iraq]{.mark}:]{.underline} "[Ours are not Western
values. They are the universal values of the human spirit and anywhere,
any time, ordinary people are given the chance to choose, the choice is
the same.]{.underline} Freedom not tyranny. Democracy not dictatorship."
[This [belief **permeated**]{.mark} **the rhetoric of the [Bush
administration]{.mark}** [after 9/11]{.mark}, the U.S. National Security
Strategy of 2002, [and the "Freedom Agenda"]{.mark} for the Middle
East.]{.underline} In the words of that NSS: "The great struggles of the
twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a
decisive victory for the forces of freedom -- and a single sustainable
model for national success: freedom, democracy and free
enterprise...People everywhere want to be able to speak freely; choose
who will govern them; worship as they please; educate their children --
male and female; own property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor.
These values of freedom are right and true for every person, in every
society..." [In a somewhat less blatant form, this continues to form the
core ideological doctrine of most of the Western media and vast range of
Western institutions, including those aid ministries engaged in
promoting "governance reform" elsewhere in the world. The
**[denial]{.mark}** of the importance [of **local histories and
traditions**]{.mark}, as well as the lessons drawn from the imperial
history of the West, [is **intrinsic to the American**]{.mark} **and
European** [sense of **ideological mission**]{.mark} in the world,
[which underpins their claims]{.mark} to **global and regional
[hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [It is]{.underline}]{.mark} [also to
some extent [**intrinsic** to how]{.mark} the [Western
bureaucracies]{.mark} concerned [operate]{.mark}. [Bureaucracy]{.mark},
as well as ideology, [demands universal templates]{.mark}, universally
applicable. [For]{.mark} the [bureaucracy to function]{.mark} smoothly
([as opposed to]{.mark} the achievement of **[actual change]{.mark}**),
**[local expertise is]{.mark} more a [hindrance]{.mark}** [than a
help.]{.mark}]{.underline} Furthermore, the fact that in many parts of
the world, the priority of personal safety (known in British officialdom
as "The Duty of Care") means that [[West]{.mark}ern
officials]{.underline} can barely travel outside the capital cities, or
even outside their own embassies and international hotels. [After a
couple of years, having [fail]{.mark}ed [to develop]{.mark} any serious
[knowledge of one society]{.mark}, [they hop]{.mark} on [to try to
implement identical programs in another society]{.mark} --- [which
they]{.mark} also **[fail to study]{.mark}**. The result: [programs that
have]{.mark} only the most [tangential relationship to local
reality]{.mark}, and consequently, [don't stand]{.mark} the remotest
[chance of]{.mark} even limited [success]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
example, [British officers and officials working in Helmand province of
Afghanistan were on the most part completely ignorant of the local
Battle of Maiwand in 1879, in which Afghans defeated a British
army.]{.underline} Every Helmandi knew of this battle, and most were
convinced (absurdly, but still) that a key motive for the British
military presence today was to get revenge for Maiwand. [[Academia has
played its]{.mark} own [part in **undermining**]{.mark} the [West's
ability]{.mark} to [engage]{.mark} meaningfully [with]{.mark} political,
social and economic [developments]{.mark} elsewhere [in the
world]{.mark}. Recent decades have seen a steep decline in history and
area studies]{.underline} (and foreign languages in the United States

# K -- Techno-orientalism

## 1NC shell

#### We are living in the age of fear politics -- the war on terror ended years ago yet today's politicians still insist on the expansion of the western security state -- fear-mongering rhetoric like that of the 1ac serves the purpose of continuing the political project of collective political fear 

**Robin 11**(Corey Robin, 2011, "The Politics of Fear",
https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/22/the-politics-of-fear/)**//BRownRice**

In my 2004 book Fear: The History of a Political Idea, I argued that
"one day, the **[war on terrorism will come to an end]{.underline}**.
All wars do. And **[when it does, we will find ourselves still living in
fear: not of terrorism or radical Islam, but of the domestic rulers that
fear has left behind."]{.underline}** When I wrote "one day," I was
thinking decades, not years. I figured that the war on terror---less the
invasions, wars, torture, drone attacks, and assassinations than the
broader atmosphere of pervasive and militarized dread, what Hobbes
called "a tract of time, wherein the will to contend by battle is
sufficiently known" and an enemy is perceived as permanent and
irrepressible---would continue at least into the 2010s, if not the '20s.
Yet even before Osama bin Laden was killed and negotiations with the
Taliban had begun, **[[it was clear that the war on
terror]{.underline}]{.mark}**, understood in those terms,
**[[had]{.mark} [come to an end.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As early as the
2004 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate John Kerry had hinted
at such a possibility in an interview with Matt Bai in The New York
Times Magazine: When I asked Kerry what it would take for Americans to
feel safe again, he displayed a much less apocalyptic worldview. **["We
have to get back to the place we were, where terrorists are not the
focus of our lives]{.underline}**, but they're a nuisance," Kerry said.
"As a former law-enforcement person, I know we're never going to end
prostitution. We're never going to end illegal gambling. But we're going
to reduce it, organized crime, to a level where it isn't on the rise. It
isn't threatening people's lives every day, and fundamentally, it's
**[something that you continue to fight, but it's not threatening the
fabric of your life."]{.underline}** A Kinsley gaffe if ever there was
one, Kerry's comment may have helped seal his fate in that election.
Even so, it laid down a marker of what has essentially come to pass:
**[[Though]{.mark} the [wars in Iraq and Afghanistan go on,]{.mark}
though the United States continues to assassinate actual and suspected
terrorists throughout the Middle East and Central Asia, though [security
lines continue]{.mark} to snake around airport corners, the high-octane
[politics of fear we saw in the aftermath of 9/11 has,]{.mark} for all
intents and purposes, [dissipated]{.mark}. The threat of [terrorism is
no longer the focus]{.mark} of our days]{.underline}**---indeed,
probably hasn't been since 2006; **[it is instead a
nuisance]{.underline}**, something the government continues to fight but
not something threatening the fabric of our lives.
**[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as others in this symposium have noted,
**[the [political infrastructure of fear]{.mark}]{.underline}**---the
bureaucracies and institutions created in the wake of 9/11, the
profiling and practices of surveillance, the laws and enforcement
agencies---**[[survives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We still have a
Department of Homeland Security and a Patriot Act, Guantánamo is open
for service, and what my colleague Jeanne Theoharis calls "Guantánamo at
home"---the draconian policies and procedures, directed primarily at
Muslims and Arabs, in the federal prison system---has not been
scrutinized or even discussed. And all this, it hardly needs be said,
nearly three years into the Obama Administration. From these polar
realities---a **[thinning atmosphere of political fear, an [expanding
infrastructure of political fear]{.mark}]{.underline}**---I draw two
conclusions. **[First, the politics of fear is far less dependent upon
the actual psychic experience of the public than analysts would have us
think. While many believe that the individual emotions of the citizenry
propel the policies the government pursues, I see little evidence of
that. Even if we assume that each and every member of the public is
experiencing fear, that experience still doesn't explain the policies. A
frightened population could just as easily inspire the government to
pursue policies that would dampen rather than arouse fear. It is
politics that produces policies, not fear.]{.underline}** In any event,
the **[public's putative experience of fear cannot explain the
persistence]{.underline}**, indeed the enhancement, **[of the kind of
government policies]{.underline}** and practices **[we've
seen]{.underline}** in the last five years or so. A combination of
bureaucratic inertia and partisan interests, in which neither party has
much incentive to do anything on behalf of a persecuted minority---the
sorry stuff, in other words, of old-fashioned political
science---explains far more than do speculation and experiments in
social or cognitive psychology. **[Second, journalists and
scholars]{.underline}** too often **[assume]{.underline}** that the
**[public is united in its fear because the objects of
fear]{.underline}**---terrorism, radical Islam, and so on---**[are
equally threatening to each and every member of the
public]{.underline}**. But as Hobbes understood so well, men and women
do argue about political threats---whether they exist, whom they
threaten, whence they come, how to respond to them. They argue about
political threats for the same reason they argue about other political
matters: **[[Perceptions of harm]{.mark} are [dependent upon beliefs
about good and evil]{.mark}, justice and injustice, and experiences of
harm are mediated by material factors such as one's standing in the
world.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[it was this profoundly human penchant
to argue about [threats]{.mark} that [drove]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Hobbes to insist it was among the sovereign's most important duties to
simply decide, **[to [declare by fiat, whether a nation was]{.mark}
[threatened]{.mark} or not]{.underline}**---and that it was among the
subject's most important duties to allow the sovereign to make that
decision. **[Far from assuming that this right of the sovereign to
identify public threats would be easily accepted]{.underline}**,
however, Hobbes understood that it **[had to be defended through a
comprehensive effort of popular instruction---a project, judging by the
debates over national security that have punctuated American history
from its inception]{.underline}** (remember the Hartford Convention?),
in which few governments have ever succeeded. That **[[sovereigns have
to assert that]{.mark} [they are the deciders of our fears]{.mark}
testifies to the fact that [national security]{.mark} is [no more a
source of unity than Social Security]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As we've
seen over the last decade, **[[citizens]{.underline}]{.mark}** still
disagree about threats and how to respond to them, and they
**[[experience]{.mark} political [fear in different ways]{.mark}. A
Muslim or Arab citizen of the United States might well be more afraid of
government surveillance than of a terrorist attack. An unemployed
middle-aged woman may be more concerned about economic insecurity or
poverty than Al Qaeda. And even threats that do temporarily command the
public's attention seldom yield united responses beyond the very short
term. A [unity of fear]{.mark}, then]{.underline}**, is not an artifact
of mass psychology; it **[[is a political project, crafted
through]{.mark} leadership, [ideology]{.mark}, and collective
action.]{.underline}** Like many political projects, it often fails, or
at least does not fully succeed. And when it fails---dissenters question
whether we need be afraid, citizens cease to pay attention to "orange"
and "red" alerts, parties focus on other items of public
concern---governments either try to enlarge the infrastructure by
insulating it against the vagaries of public opinion, or dampen the
dissent. Again, old-fashioned politics. **[Since 9/11, we've gotten used
to the phrase "the politics of fear." It's high time we started taking
the politics part more seriously.]{.underline}**

A century has passed since British author **[Sax Rohmer]{.underline}**
introduced the character Dr. Fu Manchu, whose particular brand of
Eastern mysticism wedded with Western science both terrorized and
titillated readers and audiences alike. Appearing in 1912, the character
**[is perhaps one of the earliest and most potent instances of
[techno-Orientalist expression]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A figure of
unnatural, unknowable peril who must be kept from acquiring knowledge
lest it be used against the Western subject, Dr. Fu Manchu is at once
brilliant and technologically challenged. In one part of the serial, Dr.
Fu Manchu plots to strengthen China by kidnapping European engineers,
suggesting the Orient's lack of technological prowess and desire for
Western technology. Yet, in another, he is described as possessing "all
the cruel cunning of the entire Eastern race, accumulated in one giant
intellect, with all the resources of science, past and present."1
**[Both of the past and the future, his monstrous form captured [Western
ambivalences toward]{.mark} what it regarded as the [mysterious power of
the East]{.mark}, manifesting [in]{.mark} strange
[contradictions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Throughout the twentieth
century, **[[variations]{.mark} of that premodern-hypermodern dynamic in
speculative visions of Asia and Asians have been [recycled]{.mark}
numerous times.]{.underline}**2 Exemplars include the villainous Khan
Noonien Singh in Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek universe, the leader of a
group of superhumans who attempt to take control of the Starship
Enterprise; the Chinese scientist Dr. X in Neal Stephenson's novel, The
Diamond Age (1995), a counterfeiter using "a gallimaufry of contraband
technology" (73) to steal Western innovations; and most recently The
Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (2013), a clear revival of Dr. Fu Manchu played
cleverly by Ben Kingsley in a tongue-in-cheek fashion.3 But **[[Western
speculations of an Asianized future are not always consolidated]{.mark}
in a singular fictional figure]{.underline}** as in Fu Manchu, Dr. X, or
The Mandarin. The yellow peril anxiety of an earlier, industrial-age era
embodied by Fu Manchu found new forms across cultures and hemispheres
**[as [Asian economies become more visible competitors in the age of
globalization and rapid tech]{.mark}nological
[innovations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** One needs to witness only the
speculative fictional worlds of Maureen McHugh's novel China Mountain
Zhang (1992), Joss Whedon's television series Firefly (2002), and Gary
Shteyngart's novel Super Sad True Love Story (2010) to trace persisting
anxieties over the past three decades of a Chinadominated future. **[All
of these worlds feature [Western protagonists]{.mark} struggling to
[navigate a]{.mark} sociopolitical [landscape in which China is the
dominant]{.mark} global [empire with a superior technological
edge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Beyond the focus on China, paradigmatic
works such as William Gibson's Japan-based oeuvre (including
Neuromancer), Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, and the Wachowskis' The
Matrix films have also burnished in the **[[Western
consciousness]{.mark} Asian-influenced visions of the future
[underpinned by]{.mark} a familiar yet estranged mixture of [Orientalist
sensibilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** These examples perfectly
illustrate our definition of **[[techno-Orientalism]{.mark}: the
phenomenon of [imagining Asia]{.mark} and Asians [in]{.mark} hypo- or
[hypertechnological terms in]{.mark} cultural productions and political
[discourse]{.mark}.]{.underline}**4 **[Techno-Orientalist imaginations
are [infused with the languages and codes of the technological
and]{.mark} the [futuristic. These]{.mark} developed alongside
industrial advances in the West and [have become part of the West's
project of securing dominance as architects of the future]{.mark}, a
project that [requires configurations of the East as the]{.mark} very
[tech]{.mark}nology [with which to shape it]{.mark}. Techno-Orientalist
speculations of an Asianized future have become ever more prevalent in
the wake of neoliberal trade policies that enabled greater flow of
information and capital between the East and the West. Substantial
[criticism]{.mark} of techno-Orientalism [emerged]{.mark} in the
mid-1990s [when]{.mark} cultural [theorists]{.mark} began to
[trace]{.mark} its manifestations and theorize [its causes and
implications]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Kevin Morley and David Robins,
Toshiya Ueno, and Kumiko Sato, principal trailblazers of the field, laid
much of the valuable groundwork. Morley and Robins's Spaces of Identity:
Global Media, Electronic Landscapes, and Cultural Boundaries (Routledge,
1995), in which a definition of "techno-Orientalism" first saw print,
remains the most cited in critical assessments of technological and
Orientalist discourses; however, Ueno has probably written most
extensively about techno-Orientalism as a discursive cultural phenomenon
in the era of what he identifies as the "post-Fordist social environment
of globalization" (223). **["[The basis of Orientalism]{.mark} and
xenophobia [is the subordination of Others]{.mark} through a sort of
'mirror of cultural conceit,'" Ueno explains. "[The Orient exists in so
far as the West needs it, because it brings the]{.mark} project of the
[West into focus]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (223). Whereas Orientalism, as
a strategy of representational containment, arrests Asia in traditional,
and often premodern imagery, **[[techno-Orientalism]{.mark} presents a
broader, dynamic, and often [contradictory]{.mark} spectrum of
[images]{.mark}]{.underline}**, constructed by the East and West alike,
of an "Orient" undergoing rapid economic and cultural transformations.
**[Techno-Orientalism, like Orientalism, [places]{.mark} great [emphasis
o]{.mark}n the project of [modernity]{.mark}---cultures privilege
modernity [and fear losing]{.mark} their [perceived "edge" over
others.]{.mark} Stretching beyond Orientalism's premise of a hegemonic
West's representational authority over the East, [techno-Orientalism's
scope is]{.mark} much more expansive and [bidirectional]{.mark}, its
discourses mutually constituted by the flow of trade and capital across
the hemispheres.]{.underline}** As Ueno observes, **[techno-Orientalism
is first and foremost an effect of globalism. "If the Orient was
invented by the West," he writes, "then [the Techno-Orient was]{.mark}
also [invented by]{.mark} the world of [info]{.mark}rmation
[capitalism]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (228). **[Technological
developments, driven by the imperial aspirations and the appetites of
consumerist societies on both sides of the Pacific, propel the engines
of invention and production. In its wake, [Western nations vying
for]{.mark} cultural and economic [dominance with Asian nations
find]{.mark} in [technoOrientalism an expressive vehicle for their
aspirations]{.mark} and fears.]{.underline}** Our volume,
Techno-Orientalism: Imagining Asia in Speculative Fiction, History, and
Media, documents past and current constructions of the role of Asia in a
technologized future and critically examines this proliferating
phenomenon. Dr. Fu Manchu illustrates just one way in which
**[techno-Orientalist imagery pervades Western cultural productions in
the early twentieth century.]{.underline}** The principal locales of
techno-Orientalist projects as they developed in the late twentieth
century have primarily been Japan and China. Ueno, whose influential
analyses of "Japanimation" in the mid-1990s seeded the field of
technoOrientalist studies, observes, **["In Techno-Orientalism, Japan is
not only located geographically, but is also projected chronologically.
Jean Baudrillard once called Japan a satellite in orbit. Now Japan has
been located in the future of technology"]{.underline}** (228). Morley
and Robins put a finer point on the temporal dimension of the spatial
construction: **["If the future is technological, and if
[tech]{.mark}nology [has become]{.mark} '[Japanised]{.mark},' then the
syllogism would suggest that [the future is]{.mark} now
[Japanese]{.mark}, too. The postmodern era will be the Pacific era.
Japan is the future, and it is a future that seems to be transcending
and [displacing Western modernity]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (168). Whereas
Japan's dubious honor as the original techno-Orient was bestowed in the
eighties with the help of the cyberpunk movement, the
techno-Orientalizing of China occurred roughly a decade later.5 China
was not yet a competitor in the global economy in the 1980s, when the
West focused its wary gaze on what it saw as an invasion of Japanese
capital investments and imports into Western economies. When China was
recognized as a newly industrialized country (NIC) in the 1990s and its
influence in the global economy increased, it, too, became once again a
target of techno-Orientalist fashioning. The discourse on **[[China's
"rise"]{.mark} in the U.S. context, [consistent with techno-Orientalist
contradictions]{.mark}, has [focused on constructing its people as a
vast]{.mark}, subaltern-like [labor force]{.mark} and as a giant
consumer market [whose appetite for Western cultural products]{.mark},
if nurtured, could [secure U.S.]{.mark} global cultural and economic
[dominance]{.mark}. This dual image of [China]{.mark} as both
developing-world producers and firstworld consumers [presents]{.mark} a
[representational challenge]{.mark} for the West: Is China a human
factory? Or is it a consumerist society, like the United States, whose
enormous purchasing power dictates the future of technological
innovations and economies?]{.underline}** Japan and China are thus
signified differently in the techno-Orientalist vocabulary. **[[Both are
constructed as competitors and]{.mark} therefore [threats to the
U.S.]{.mark} economy]{.underline}**; but while Japan competes with the
United States for dominance in technological innovation, China competes
with the United States in labor and production. To put it in starker
terms, **[Japan creates technology, but China is the technology. [In the
eyes of the West, both are crucial engines of the future: Japan
innovates and China manufactures.]{.mark}]{.underline}** And as Asia,
writ large, becomes a greater consumerist force than the West,6 its
threat/value dualism commensurately increases. These differences in the
technological signification of Japan and China manifest themselves in
the fictive forecasts of the Asiantinged future. If Japan is a screen on
which the West has projected its technological fantasies, then China is
a screen on which the West projects its fears of being colonized,
mechanized, and instrumentalized in its own pursuit of technological
dominance. India, another NIC, has also found itself under the
techno-Orientalist gaze as a consequence of U.S. outsourcing practices.
As a much maligned business strategy, outsourcing has provoked extremely
negative public sentiments in the United States. These opinions find
expression in a particular strand of **[[techno-Orientalist
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[consolidates China and India
as the chief threats]{.mark} to the U.S. service and labor sectors.
These [Asian nations serve as]{.mark} the [scapegoats]{.mark} for
corporate decisions to move service and manufacturing jobs abroad and
bear the brunt of the resulting xenophobic antipathies.]{.underline}**
Chinese and Indian workers, for instance, are routinely portrayed in
techno-Orientalist and technophobic vocabularies; call center employees
in India adopt Western Christian names and mimic the linguistic and
idiomatic style of Americans, a practice so ubiquitous as to be parodied
cinematically in romantic comedies such as Outsourced (2006), conjuring
images of Dickian androids (or Blade Runner's "replicants") who simulate
human behavior and threaten the distinction between "real" and "fake"
Americans. **[Glossy spreads of endless rows of Chinese workers in
corporate factories and towns in mainstream magazines such as Time and
Wired seal the visual vocabulary of Asians as the cogs of
hyperproduction.]{.underline}** In the NIC contexts,
**[[techno-Orientalist discourse constructs Asians as]{.mark} mere
[simulacra and maintains]{.mark} a prevailing sense of [the inhumanity
of Asian labor]{.mark}---[the]{.mark} very [antithesis of
West]{.mark}ern liberal humanism.]{.underline}** Discursive Conspicuity,
Critical Invisibility As this collection demonstrates,
**[techno-Orientalism occurs across genres and
disciplines]{.underline}**---history, art, literature, film, television,
video games---but **[the majority of the criticism coalesces around
literature and film, particularly in the genre of speculative fiction
(SF).]{.underline}** This is unsurprising; techno-Orientalism finds some
of its most pervasive expressions in SF because of the genre's futurist
esprit of contemporary existential, racial, and technological anxieties.
Nevertheless, we identify a disciplinary narrowness to SF in the extant
scholarship that our project attempts to broaden. Even as
techno-Orientalism in SF has been documented by several incisive studies

Licensed under Creative Commons 2.0. SF are scarce. A survey of the
essays published in the genre's flagship journal, Science Fiction
Studies, founded in 1973, confirms the critical neglect. A search with
the term "Orientalism" in the journal's archives yielded only nine
substantive essays that address Orientalism, four of which are book
reviews. A search with the term "techno-Orientalism" yielded, even more
negligibly, two review essays. Similar searches in Extrapolations,
another major academic venue for SF criticism, yielded equally scant
results. And when PMLA, the lingua franca of academic scholarship in
literature and languages, published a special issue on science fiction
in May 2004, no mention of Orientalism could be found--- this despite
the fact that SF's propensity for projecting and amplifying contemporary
racial and imperialist attitudes is well documented.7 Indeed, the
conceptualization of techno-Orientalism as a recognizable discursive
effect of the postindustrial age may have been the clarion call for
addressing this gap in the genre. Orientalism in SF during the
pre-cyberpunk era may have suffered critical neglect because of the
perception that the "yellow peril" has been kept in check by the
mechanisms of immigration and exclusion acts that were in place for much
of the midcentury. It took the repeal of the immigration acts in 1965,
coupled with the entrance of Japanese capital and imports into the U.S.
economy in the late seventies, to precipitate a renewed wariness toward
all things Asian, onto which the West once again projected agendas of
cultural hegemony and technological dominance. Cyberpunk, with its
fetishizing gaze upon Japan as a seductive and contradictory space of
futuristic innovation and ancient mystique, sharply focused the SF
critical and creative lenses upon Asia. Substantial criticism of
techno-Orientalism thus emerged in the mid1990s with the contributions
of Morley and Robins, Ueno, and Sato. Critical momentum continued with
Takayuki Tatsumi's 2000 historiography of Japanese SF in Science Fiction
Studies (SFS), and a 2002 special issue of SFS on Japanese speculative
fiction, guest edited by Takayuki Tatsumi, Christopher Bolton, and
Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Jr., introduced Japanese SF and cyberpunk visions
to the Western audience. Sato's important and incisive 2004
intersectional analysis of what she describes as "the four different
categorical spheres, namely, Western cyborg philosophy, American
cyberpunk, Japanese cyberpunk, and Japanese theory of uniqueness known
as nihonjinron" (335--336) and Christine Cornea's chapter
"Techno-Orientalism and the Postmodern Subject" in Jacqueline Furby and
Karen Randell's Screen Methods: Comparative Readings in Film Studies
(Wallflower Press, 2006) sustained the necessary critical interest in
the field. These studies, however, constitute the bulk of the critical
history of technoOrientalism. Other studies in recent years, such as
Mimi Thi Nguyen and Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu's Alien Encounters: Popular
Culture in Asian America (Duke, 2007), Wendy Hui Kyong Chun and Lynn
Joyrich's 2009 special issue of Camera Obscura, "Race and/as
Technology," Chun's New Media, Old Technologizing Orientalism • 7 Media:
A History and Theory Reader (Routledge, 2005), and Lisa Nakamura's
Cybertypes (Routledge, 2002), made significant contributions to
critiques of Orientalism in popular culture and mainstream media. Yet,
despite technoOrientalism's growing prevalence in the Western cultural
consciousness, and in SF more specifically, it has been generally
ignored in academic and popular cultural spheres. A special issue of the
literary journal MELUS, titled "Alien/Asians" (2008) and edited by
Stephen Hong Sohn, expanded the critical scope of the phenomenon and
drew it closer for theoretical scrutiny. Sohn's introduction
persuasively conveys the urgent need for vigilant documentation and
analysis of the ever-growing techno-Orientalist vocabulary. The eight
essays in the issue examine a range of techno-Orientalist instantiations
in SF within U.S., Japanese, Chinese, and Indian contexts, from "a
cyberpunk-inflected Asian future" to "the cyborg technologies
intertwined with Asian American bodies" (Sohn 15). The essays, Sohn
writes, "investigate how alternative imaginaries provide fertile
terrains to consider the prospects of racial subjectivity and identity"
(15). The essayists take a hard look at the work of SF luminaries such
as Philip K. Dick, Ursula K. Le Guin, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson,
and William S. Burroughs, whose work consciously or unconsciously traded
in technoOrientalist tropes, as well as the work of Asian American and
Asian Canadian writers such as Karen Tei Yamashita, Amitav Ghosh, and
Larissa Lai, who mount metafictional critiques of techno-Orientalist
tropes in SF. Techno-Orientalism: Imagining Asia in Speculative Fiction,
History, and Media, therefore, has two objectives. The first is to
continue the work begun by the aforementioned predecessors, to "consider
the prospective thesis that cultural production is still invested in
parsing out how the yellow peril continues to be a mode to draw from,
write against, challenge, negotiate, and problematize" (Sohn 6--7). The
volume argues that while Orientalism defines a modern West by producing
an oppositional and premodern East, techno-Orientalism symmetrically and
yet contradictorily completes this project by creating a collusive,
futurized Asia to further affirm the West's centrality. The second
objective is constructive. While we critique the dehumanizing effects of
the technoOrientalist gaze, we also see an opportunity for critical
reappropriations in texts that self-referentially engage with Asian
images; indeed, as an example, Asian SF writers have already taken to
the trope to create the SF cottage industry in which the subject and
setting are Eastern. There is of course the danger that Asian and Asian
American creators might internalize techno-Orientalist patterns and
uncritically replicate the same dehumanizing model. However, thanks to
its global and mass appeal, the speculative imagination in television,
graphic novels, or science fiction is by no means the purview of single
national traditions. Even as techno-Orientalism has become more
pervasive, it has also engendered counterdialogue in those same cultural
and political spaces. Global Consumption While **[[Orientalism]{.mark}
as a critical lens describes how Western discourse discursively
catalogues or frames the East, it has always been [trained on
domestic]{.mark}--- that is, Western or U.S.---[configurations against
the Orientalized Other.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Edward Said notes his
"real argument is that **[Orientalism is---and does not simply
represent---a considerable dimension of modern political-intellectual
culture, and as such has less to do with the Orient than it does with
'our' world"]{.underline}** (12). **[[Techno-Orientalism]{.mark}, with a
vision of the future that is global in scope and reach, adds a wrinkle
to the critical commonplace that Orientalism actively produces and
[reproduces an oppositional East to cement Western
hegemony.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Particularly within the realm of SF,
techno-Orientalist tropes have been absorbed, reenvisioned, and
replicated by other sites of cultural production, with interesting
geopolitical implications.8

If SF and its variants in historiography, cinema, and new media provide
the content of techno-Orientalist expressions, we believe that **[Asian
American studies equips us with the best critical and theoretical
toolboxes for documentation and interrogation]{.underline}**. Asian
American studies has always attended to constructions of culture, race,
and the body partly because **[U.S. [techno-Orientalist
imagination]{.mark} has its roots in the [view]{.mark} of the
[Asian]{.mark} body]{.underline}**---the Chinese body, most
specifically---**[[as]{.mark} a form of [expendable
tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**, a view **[that emerged in the
discourse of early U.S. industrialization. From the earliest era of
Asian peoples in the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
**[their technical abilities were both lauded and erased]{.underline}**.
An **[exemplar is the Chinese men who composed more than half of the
labor force that completed the transcontinental
railroad]{.underline}**'s western portion over the high Sierra Nevada
mountains to Promontory, Utah, in 1869. **[In the campaign to extend the
Chinese Exclusion Act]{.underline}** of 1882, **[the
A]{.underline}**merican **[F]{.underline}**ederation of
**[L]{.underline}**abor **[argued]{.underline}** in their publication,
Some Reasons for Chinese Exclusion, Meat vs. Rice, American Manhood
against Asiatic Coolieism: Which Shall Survive? (1902), **[that the
Chinese male body differed radically from the American male
body]{.underline}**. The publication argued that the Chinese laborer
could withstand physical deprivations that American and European
laborers could not (American Federation of Labor et al. 5, 14, 16, 18).
This constructed difference rationalized discriminatory policies against
Chinese railroad workers. Meat vs. Rice did not argue the Chinese had
particular technical skills that were valuable for constructing the
transcontinental railroad. On the contrary, **[the publication claimed
the Chinese body simply did not require the conditions of safety,
sustenance, and shelter that bodies of European descendents
required]{.underline}**. **[Implicit in their argument is a threat to
the superior European laborer's way of life or culture by a kind of
unfeeling superhuman antithetical to the West's liberal humanist
credo]{.underline}**. The **[U.S. techno-Orientalist imagination
is]{.underline}** thus **[rooted in this view of the Asian body as a
form of expendable technology]{.underline}**---a view that emerged in
the discourse of early U.S. industrialization and continued to evolve in
the twentieth century. In 1982, a twenty-seven-year-old Chinese American
named **[[Vincent Chin was beaten to death]{.underline}]{.mark}** by two
white men in Detroit. **[The attackers, Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz,
were autoworkers in a U.S. auto industry that was losing market share to
Japanese cars]{.underline}**. Though China drafter, did not work in
automobiles, Ebens and Nitz viewed him as representative---indeed, an
embodiment---of Japanese auto manufacturing as they beat him with a
baseball bat, reminiscent of Americans smashing Japanese-made cars in
reaction to increasing auto imports in the early 1980s. 9 The callous
brutality of Chin's death evinces something more than racial hatred;
**[[Chin]{.mark} not only [was]{.mark} perceived as [a]{.mark}
convenient [stand-in for the Japanese automotive industry]{.mark}, but
[embodied its traits]{.mark}]{.underline}**---unfeeling, efficient, and
inhuman. **[In Ebens and Nitz's eyes, they were Luddites striking down
the automatons that had been sent in to replace them]{.underline}**.
**[[Techno-Orientalist]{.mark} [discourse completed the project of
dehumanizing]{.mark} Vincent [Chin by rendering him]{.mark} as not only
[a racialized Other]{.mark}, but [a factory Machine that had to
be]{.mark} [dismantled by Ebens and Nitzto reclaim their personhood,
subjectivity, and masculinity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 10 The shock and
outrage over Chin's murder served as a critical rallying cry under which
a coalition of ethnic-specific groups joined as Asian Americans. In the
twenty-first century, the perceived economic threat of Japan and its
automobiles has given way to China. Despite the fact that China does not
have a particularly strong reputation as a high-tech nation,
**[techno-Orientalism's [robust flexibility allows for seamless
transplantation to another national site]{.mark}]{.underline}**. China's
rapid economic rise is largely credited to its vast manufacturing base,
which, coupled with cheap labor and less regulation, has made it an
attractive production location for many tech companies, including Apple
and Dell. And although the vast majority of Chinese cannot afford the
iPads and iPhones they produce, **[[we see in]{.mark} U.S. media [a
representational shift, using techno-Orientalist conventions]{.mark},
[transforming Chinese from mindless workers to sinister
agents]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, in October 2010, a **[U.S.
PAC called Citizens Against Government Waste uploaded a [commercial
titled "Chinese Professor"]{.mark}]{.underline}** on YouTube. Set in
Beijing, China a.d. 2030, the commercial depicts a male professor
lecturing in a large hall accompanied by high-tech gadgets. The lecture
consists of conservative talking points regarding the decline of the
United States. As colorful images of fallen nations scroll behind him,
the professor explains, "America tried to spend and tax itself out of a
great recession. Enormous so called 'stimulus spending,' massive changes
to health care, government takeovers of private industries, and crushing
debt." He concludes, "Of course, we owned most of their debt, so now
they work for us." With echoes of Fu Manchu, the professor smiles
directly into the camera, eliciting his students' mirth. **[By
presenting the Chinese professor, the students, and the lecture as
moving seamlessly between the lecture hall technology and the tablet
screens that students hold in their laps, this video [implies]{.mark}
that [China now leads]{.mark} the [world in tech]{.mark}nological
production and consumption]{.underline}**. **[The [encoded secondary
message]{.mark} of the commercial [sidesteps the reality of China's
still developing]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nological [penetration by
projecting a]{.mark} present-day [existential fear]{.mark} in[to]{.mark}
a vision of [the future]{.mark}, with technology supposedly rooted in
U.S.-based innovation]{.underline}**. **[It]{.underline}** is an elegant
solution that effectively **[[alarms]{.mark} the uninformed [viewer by
using a pan-Asian]{.mark} technological [conflation to elide reality
and]{.mark} implicitly [accuse]{.mark} [China of stealing U.S.
i]{.mark}]{.underline}**ntellectual **[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roperty.
Thus, although the national actors and the details are quite different
from the automobile industry of the 1980s, **[[we have a]{.mark} similar
[techno]{.mark}-[Orientalist narrative: U.S. jobs]{.mark} and
manufacturing are [being stolen by inorganic]{.mark}, technologically
infused [persons who threaten]{.mark} not only [our economic]{.mark} but
[humanistic integrity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. SF's techno-Orientalist
tendencies have become so common as to merit incisive parody. The
animated series Futurama takes place a thousand years in the future, and
both skewers and pays homage to SF conventions. In an episode from the
sixth season, Futurama depicts the launch of the new "EyePhone," a jab
at Apple's handset, as a pillory of modern consumerism. The series'
white protagonist, Fry, asks a retail clerk of South Asian descent,
"you're from one of those ethnicities that knows about technology; why
is it called an EyePhone?" (Sandoval). Depicted in the show as having an
intelligence level on par with Homer Simpson, Fry is not meant to be
taken seriously, and often acts as a vessel for twentieth-century
ignorance in a progressive future. What is notable in this exchange is
how the producers of Futurama have Fry explicitly verbalize a familiar
techno-Orientalist trope---Asiatic bodies functioning as gatekeepers,
facilitators, and purveyors of technology. In this episode, the South
Asian clerk literally acts as the final node on the assembly line that
has been largely produced by robotic arms---the clerk reaches through
the drapes to pull an EyePhone from a pile and we see mechanical limbs
swinging about the factory. He is an assembly line automaton with a
human skin, and his affectless, bored intonation belies his true nature
as a machine. A less self-aware show might leave it at that, but Fry's
graceless pronouncement underscores the techno-Orientalist trope, taking
SF to task while simultaneously paying ironic homage to the genre. This
same technologizing convention that Futurama so sharply satirizes is
**[found in numerous literary works]{.underline}**, including David
Mitchell's Cloud Atlas (2004). Mitchell's six stories link together
characters and narratives spanning past, present, and distant future.
Consequently, Mitchell's novel has the unenviable task of repeatedly
establishing the framing for each separate story line. An economical
method for quickly thrusting the reader into the speculative Future is
to use a technologized East Asia, as he does in the story "An Orison of
Sonmi-451." The setting of Nea So Copros, the "corpocracy" of what
appears to be a unified Korea sometime after the twenty-second century,
is where we are introduced to our enslaved narrator, Sonmi-451, a cloned
"fabricant" designed to serve in a fast-food restaurant. **[Mitchell
paints Korea as the setting for high technology, enforced consumption,
and excessive advertising; and his larger social critique lies in the
mirroring of the fabricants who must serve and the "purebloods" who must
constantly consume, a master-slave dialectic that relies on cannibalism,
erased from view, and technology, projected into high
visibility]{.underline}**. Sonmi-451eventually gains self-awareness,
knowledge, and power to create a declaration of rights for enslaved
fabricants and oppressed classes, but only after she reads the classics
of Western civilization (187, 193). Thus, **[Mitchell's novel reinforces
both the perception of Asia as the definitive site for technophilic and
technophobic speculations of an oppressive future and the view that only
a Western-coded subject can truly realize liberal humanism in such an
environment]{.underline}**

#### Saids work shows orientalism as hegemonic\--It can most usefully be applied to the new techno-orientalism that dominates western fear of the easts rise.

In conclusion, I find that **[[Said's work helps us understand the
underlying evaluative and]{.mark} [prescriptive logic of Orientalism as
a hegemonic discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and **[it [does so without
being essentialist in its analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and without
overlooking its more ambivalent and contradictory qualities. In fact,
**[it [could be argued that the dogmas can be
"applied]{.mark}"]{.underline}** **[i[n a way that describes a]{.mark}
fair [range or variety of representations that one finds in
Orientalist]{.mark}]{.underline}** films, including concepts such as
Homi Bhabha's discussion of "ambivalence," concerning identity politics
in the colonial encounter.37 Bhabha's focus on a psychoanalytical
explanation for racist discourse, as opposed to Said's essentially
political approach, leads him to downplay strict colonizer/colonized and
master/slave binaries, and develop instead the notion of a double
consciousness, expressed in the colonizer's simultaneous fear and desire
for the Other, as we have discussed regarding exoticism. **[For the
colonized, this manifests itself as hybridity, an uneasy combination of
submission to authority and "sly civility,]{.underline}**" a subtle form
of resistance in which the colonized both imitates and mocks the
colonizer,38 which partly describes the character of Ong Chi Seng in The
Letter. D**[espite expressing disappointment at Said's "reluctance to
engage with the alterity and ambivalence in the articulation of these
two economies]{.underline}** \[latent and manifest Orientalism\],"
Bhabha quotes the passage from Orientalism in which Said describes the
West's vacillation between the familiar and the alien, which produces a
median category encapsulating the complex issue of power and
desire.3**[9 [The analytical usefulness and therefore heuristic value of
the dogmas lie in their simplicity,]{.mark} and the possibility of
u[sing them to chart the evolution of Orientalist
discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}** in film, noting both enduring themes
and new variations.

**[[One]{.underline}]{.mark}** such **[[variation is
techno-Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which refers to the
**[[Western envy and fear of a technologically superior
Orient]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which certainly applies to contemporary
Singapore. To be shanghaied has also acquired new connotations, as noted
by Singaporean architect William Siew-wai Lim, which include "being
seduced \[to\] incidentally discover an imaginary paradise of tomorrow"
and "being overwhelmed, misled, and conned by the virtual explosion of
mythical opportunities and the get-rich-quick syndrome."40 At the
nine-minute mark of Hitman: Agent 47, we are introduced to the
headquarters of Syndicate International, thanks to a dramatic forward
track and upward pan from the ocean to an ominous low-angle view of the
Syndicate's skyscraper on Singapore's Boat Quay, crowned by an
ostentatious letter S. A superimposed title identifies Singapore as the
location, which triggers the techno-Orientalist associations, as the
dragon-beast of steel and glass emerges from the water to threaten the
world with its plans to create an army of genetically engineered
killers. However, we quickly realize that the Syndicate is run primarily
by foreign expatriates, with a Frenchman at its head, which sidesteps
some Orientalist concerns. On the other hand, when one considers the
far-reaching powers of the Syndicate, including that of tapping into
Changi Airport's security camera network, overriding what could only be
controlled by the Singapore government itself, one must describe this
foreign influence as imperialistic in its assumptions. As Shohat and
Stam put it, so-called classical Hollywood films continually
"**[[recycled the formulae of European supremacy]{.mark} vis-à-vis
[globally dispersed others]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with **[the [White
European always retaining his or her ʻpositional
superiority']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Edward Said's term)."41 Even though
the Syndicate's boss, Antoine Le Clerq, dies at the film's end, Hitman:
Agent 47's erasure of cultural difference can be equated with a
seemingly anachronistic yet enduring colonial perspective, regardless of
whether we attribute this perspective to the film's writers or their
chosen narrative genre. Less well known is the 2004 science fiction film
Cyber Wars (Kuo Jian Hong, 2004), set in the futuristic city of Sintawan
(a thinly disguised Singapore), in which the Caucasian protagonist seeks
help from an Asian character who serves as the guru of Cyberlink, the
city's Orwellian computer network. In one scene, the virtual interface
with Cyberlink showcases techno-Orientalism, combining representations
of the past and future: futuristic virtual reality technology leads the
characters to a Chinese herbal shop, featuring spices with magical
properties. The Western hero has been shanghaied by Asian technology and
has landed on a virtual boat floating in a disorienting urban
environment made up of neon lights flashing Chinese-language

Studies \| *"The Perfect Type of Industry": 2012 and Apocalyptic Visions
of the Asian Century* pg 1-6 \| DOA: 7/8/2022 \| SAoki)

Donald Trump's comments on China after his assumption of the presidency
have left American journalists scrambling to make sense of his opinions.
Once having accused China of "raping" the United States on the campaign
trail (Diamond, 2016), he has recently expressed great admiration for
President Xi Jinping as the leader of a world superpower; he proclaimed
in a stump speech that China committed "one of the greatest thefts in
the history of the world" (Smith, 2016) in its trade relations with
America, but on March 4th, 2018, praised Xi for eliminating the two-term
limit on China's presidential office, remarking off-handedly that
"\[America\] might want to give that a shot someday" (Liptak, 2018).
Accordingly, this statement made the headlines of several major
publications and provoked intense speculation on Trump's perception of
the office of the President and suspicion about his ultimate goals in
governing the United States. For all the psychological, political, and
economic analyses that have tried to make sense of Trump's
"flip-flopping" attitudes toward foreign relations, it has thus far
remained unclear where and how the President formed his opinions on
Chinese trade policy. His avowed affection for Fox News and other
conservative media outlets, who have long held concerns about Chinese
economic ascendancy, might be the root of his campaign-trail vitriol.
However, his more recent remarks supporting the Chinese presidency and
begrudgingly expressing admiration for the policies he had previously
excoriated display a kind of economic sportsmanship more attuned to his
background as a businessman with interests in playing to the most
profitable market. These are both reasonable hypotheses, and there is
hardly any precedent to expect an elected official to hold to campaign
promises, but it is inaccurate to the past century and a half of
U.S.-China relations to say that **[[Trump]{.mark} is]{.underline}**
"flip-flopping" on China. Rather, he is **[[expos]{.mark}ing two sides
of [the]{.mark} same [political outlook that has driven]{.mark} our
[foreign policy]{.mark} in the East Asian arena for so
long]{.underline}** -- **[two sides that have co-existed [for as long as
the West has feared the East]{.mark}: the [dualism of Yellow
Peril.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In order to truly understand this strange
relationship between China and the United States, we must first look
back to **[the origins of the Yellow Peril and trace its
development]{.underline}** at the beginning of the 20th century. The
term itself was coined by Russian sociologist Jacques Novicow
**[in]{.underline}** 1897 to describe **[[the Sinophobic logic pervasive
in the Western discourse of nationalist economic
anxiety]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the essay "Le Péril Jaune," he
dissected several common arguments laid forth **[[for the suppression of
Chinese workers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, most prominently that they were
naturally satisfied with being paid a lower wage than whites, were
predisposed to find pleasure in hard work, and would ultimately
destabilize the world economy in China's favor through the sheer size of
their workforce. They represent what Jack London refers to as "the
perfect type of industry" (78), a people naturally inclined and suited
to hard work, with few economic goals or aspiration beyond their
station. **[Such arguments were [the driving force for the passage of
the Chinese Exclusion Act]{.mark}]{.underline}** of 1882 and were
popularly supported by organizations like the Asiatic Exclusion League
through the turn of the century. They were only fueled by reportage on
wars in the Pacific where Eastern nations were beginning to assert their
military power, first against each other, and then -- unthinkably --
against Western civilizations. **[The Russo-Japanese War heralded change
on an apocalyptic level for the West]{.underline}**. Russia, having only
recently established itself as a European power under the controversial
Romanov dynasty, lost several major conflicts against a Westernized
Japanese military and was forced to make major concessions to a nation
that, in **[[the]{.mark} [Western imagination]{.mark}, had primarily
[been the set]{.mark}ting [for]{.mark} lush, courtly [Orientalist
fantasies]{.mark}]{.underline}** like The Mikado and Madama Butterfly.
The Japanese, it seemed, had mastered the ways of the West much faster
than anyone had predicted, and the West was beginning to pay the price
for its inattention. China, where Japan threatened mastery of the
long-feared hordes of cheap labor, was cast in a new and immediately
threatening light. The corrupt rule of the Qing Dynasty had long plagued
China with the title of the "sick man of Asia," threatening the death of
the Chinese empire. If the Asiatics could somehow master themselves and
take full advantage of the plentiful natural resources that the
non-industrializing Qing had failed to tap, then Russia would only be
the first of many to fall to the Yellow Peril. In November 2017, Trump
praised China for mastery of the trade game and clear dedication to
Chinese national interests. "Who can blame a country for being able to
take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens?" he
asked, going on to criticize previous administrations for their
comparatively lax pursuit of American profit. It would seem that China,
then, has finally mastered itself without the help of Japan, and has
furthermore bested the United States as the greatest economist in the
world, fulfilling the prophecy of an "Asian Century" that has been
anticipated in fear for over a hundred years. How, then, is it possible
that journalists -- the very same Fourth Estate that feverishly
reproduced the diverging Yellow Peril narratives of the Russo-Japanese
War -- cannot reconcile his comments with the narratives that their
predecessors played in perfect tension, directly correspondent as they
are? And how has the global imagination responded to this supposedly
impending collapse of Western civilization? The purpose of this thesis
is firstly to argue that **[the particular strains of
[apocalypticism]{.mark} that [emerged around]{.mark} the Russo-Japanese
War crystallized [the two faces of the Yellow Peril]{.mark} that has
once again reared its Janusian head in American
journalism]{.underline}**. I identify **[one as]{.underline}** that of
**[the]{.underline}** classic **["coolie," and the other as
the]{.underline}** "master," primarily to distinguish between the roles
of dominator and dominated. Over the course of the argument, I will
replace "master" with **["creditor" to denote the transformation of the
economic arena of concern from the factors of production to that of
financial capitalism]{.underline}** over the course of the 20th century.
Through an investigation of war correspondences, memoirs, educational
books, short fiction, and essays, I will trace the development and
circulation of the "coolie" and "master" images of Yellow Peril in the
United States from 1904 through 1923 and argue for the necessity of the
Russo-Japanese War to understanding portrayals of American economic
precarity as well as the resulting effects on Asian Americans. The
secondary purpose of this thesis is to explore how America has dealt
with the apocalypticism inherent to Yellow Peril. Although journalists
of the early 20th century were relatively trigger-happy with warnings of
impending civilizational collapse at the hands of the Chinese, modern
journalism stops rather conservatively at predictions of trade war and
national decline as a world power. However, the apocalyptic has not by
any means been vanished. Rather, it has been relegated (or perhaps
sublimated) to the realm of fiction, and most spectacularly that of the
disaster film, where entire countries might be obliterated with no real
consequence, to the delight of the public. This is particularly true of
German director Roland Emmerich's Hollywood oeuvre, which includes such
American epics as Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, and
Godzilla. When Emmerich deals with impending disaster on a global scale,
one might reasonably expect to witness the spectacular collapse of
significant nations around the world, especially those with a familiar
visual lexis ripe for gleeful iconoclasm. The entry of China onto the
world stage as one of these significant nations, because of this dual
narrative, has had complex implications for its depiction in disaster
films both on a diegetic and a production level. Emmerich's 2012 (2009)
is uncommon in this genre because of its treatment of China as a source
of salvation for all Western civilization, and because of its popular
reception amongst Chinese moviegoers. Ultimately, this thesis will seek
to answer the questions I have posed about the underappreciated cultural
significance of the Russo-Japanese War, its centrality to the discourse
of Yellow Peril, the development of dichotomous narratives during that
era, and how the prophetic aspects of journalism, as well as its
apocalyptic figurations, have been developed in cultural production. It
will also explore the function of apocalyptic films as an ideological
apparatus that foments support for exclusionist Yellow Peril policy and
populist racial hysteria, providing the public with visions of America
as it might persist even after a physical obliteration through a state
eschatology in direct opposition to civilizational collapse. **[By
[theorizing an American approach to confronting the impermanence of
empire, I hope to shed light on]{.mark} an often [overlooked influence
on U.S.-China relations and]{.mark} the [domestic treatment of Asian
Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[and provide a basis
for]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[discussing [how apocalypticism is used as
a national project to plan for the collapse of the national
apparatus]{.mark} it is intended to serve]{.underline}**. My argument
relies on several fundamental contentions. The first is that **[[the
Yellow Peril is a tool used by the West]{.mark} to understand its
economic relationship with Asia]{.underline}**, especially in terms of
coolie labor and the presentation of a call to action to limit Asian
immigration. The second is that **[the Yellow Peril is [a type of
eschatology through which the American empire can cathect its
anxieties]{.mark} about its place on the world stage]{.underline}**.
Finally, I contend that the publication of the documents previously
mentioned, as well as the release of 2012 (2009), indicate **[the
presence of [a state-sanctioned eschatology, which focuses on
naturalizing and preserving the superstructure of empire, dislodging it
from its material formations]{.mark} and creating a pathway toward
maintaining regenerative but [imperially reproductive understanding
of]{.mark} social, political, and economic
[relationships]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It is a way of anticipating
the total obliteration of the American state and envisioning a future in
which it may one day rise again.]{.underline}**

SAN FRANCISCO --- **[Imagine a futuristic city where robots prevail.
Since the advent of imperialism, this futuristic and otherly view has
often served as the popularized Western conception of Asia. This concept
is known as [Techno-Orientalism]{.mark}, a phenomenon that primarily
dominates discourse surrounding media portrayals of East
Asia.]{.underline}** According to journalist George Yang in Wired
Magazine, **[Techno-Orientalism, which [creates]{.mark} an [ideology
of]{.mark} the Asian ["Other," rests on]{.mark} Western [logic
of]{.mark} the [East as]{.mark} a [technological
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the world. With **[Beijing's
technological rise in an increasingly globalized world,
[Techno-Orientalist frameworks]{.mark} have now [become fundamental
to]{.mark} specifically [describing China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Plan A
Magazine's Lily Luo writes that the term "Techno-Orientalism" was
originally coined by Asian scholars like David Roh, Greta Niu and Betsy
Huang. **[These scholars perceived Techno-Orientalism as the projection
of historical Orientalism]{.underline}**, or what Khan Academy's Nancy
Demerdash describes as the "conception of an 'Orient' that was rooted in
incivility." **[Under the futuristic gaze of Techno-Orientalism, East
Asians are not only conceived of as a racialized source of fear, but
also a source of technological fear.]{.underline}** In other words,
**[the [technological advanc]{.mark}ements of East Asian countries were
[perceived as a threat]{.mark} to the global order. Today,
Techno-Orientalism is [most evident in]{.mark} the Western [media's
coverage]{.mark} of China]{.underline}**, which often reflects what Yang
describes as "Western anxieties about the East." "Chi**[na's dystopian
tech could be contagious,"]{.underline}** reads a 2018 headline from The
Atlantic**[. The word "contagious" implicitly projects the notion that
China's technology is somehow diseased]{.underline}**, **[[evoking
imagery of]{.mark} illness and a [plague]{.mark}]{.underline}** ---
**[racialized elements that Yang states were formerly attributed to
Chinese immigrants]{.underline}** building the United States's
Transcontinental Railroad back in the 19th century. The **[article goes
on to describe China's "social credit" system and its effects as a
method of "social control" with "teeth."]{.underline}** The **[element
of "teeth" [provokes]{.mark} a more [physical understanding of]{.mark}
China's [technological capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Instead of
directly analyzing the mechanics of the system, **[the article [employs
metaphors that conjure]{.mark} up negative [connotations of fear]{.mark}
and violence]{.underline}**. Another headline for a 2019 article in The
American Conservative demonstrates a similar concept: "George Orwell's
Dystopian Nightmare in China." The **[featured image displays a large
cartoon of Chinese President Xi Jinping looming over ordinary citizens
and handing them numbers intended to dictate their
identities.]{.underline}** The **[article cites the Orwellian vision of
the world]{.underline}** --- particularly Social Psychologist Erich
Fromm's afternote about the dangers of men becoming machines ---
**[implying that this is what China has become.]{.underline}** **[The
issue is not endemic to a few articles or a handful of media
organizations and publications.]{.underline}** In a 2018 op-ed in
Bloomberg, **[Cathy O'Neil argues that the United States must take an
active stand against the surveillance state with the headline: "Want to
See Your Dystopian Future? Look at China."]{.underline}** For **[The New
York Post]{.underline}**, a headline **[reads: "China's 'social credit'
system is a dystopian nightmare." This [angled coverage]{.mark} of
China,]{.underline}** unintentional or not, **[[falls prey to]{.mark} a
certain [dehumanizing rhetoric]{.mark} in which the [Chinese people are
viewed as]{.mark} constant [victims]{.mark} of a dystopian, futuristic
state]{.underline}**. In the process of shedding light on how China's
technological advancements may strip humanity away from Chinese
citizens, an important topic that deserves coverage and criticism,
**[Western media coverage paradoxically falls victim to the same trope:
[implying]{.mark} that Chinese people are [mindless]{.mark}
[robots]{.mark} at the mercy of a technological villain.]{.underline}**
It is necessary, though, to acknowledge that criticism of
Techno-Orientalist sentiments pervasive in Western media is not based on
the assumption that such articles are not credible. **[In fact, it is
because these [articles]{.mark} are so well-written and well-researched
on a topic that merits global attention that it [become]{.mark}s even
more [essential to understand]{.mark} how [racialized ideals]{.mark}
manifest in complex ways]{.underline}** within contemporary media
discourse --- even in the small ways, like headlines, images and
adjectives. **[This [problem becomes cyclical]{.mark}, especially
because so many articles cite the ideas mentioned by others. This may
explain how the media tends to exacerbate Sinophobia.]{.underline}**
Often, Western media's hegemonic mindset regarding Beijing prizes
competition over collaboration. This undermines a positive diplomatic
relationship between the United States and China and, more critically, a
nuanced American understanding of Chinese people, culture and values.
**[When evaluating how Techno-Orientalism has shaped internalized
conceptions of China, [it is critical to]{.mark} be rhetorically careful
and to distinguish between hard evidence and Western interpretations of
that evidence.]{.underline}** These **[interpretations appear to be
motivated by hegemonic fears of Asian countries achieving unprecedented
progress and subverting colonialist paradigms.]{.underline}**
Alternatively, these interpretations may be real fear rooted in the use
of technology to oppress certain liberties --- a genuine concern.
However, journalists must be careful in examining their assumptions and
biases. When writing about China, they should consider how certain
language may benefit discourse on the country or proliferate harmful
stereotypes. **[It may even be worth thinking about how the media can
provide a counternarrative to Techno-Orientalist ideologies. Instead of
characterizing China's technological rise as dangerous and
fear-mongering, journalists and media experts could explain the original
reasoning behind such technological policy measures.]{.underline}** The
Qiao Collective, for example, is an organization that is a staunch
defender of China against "Western aggression." **[While not without its
controversies and criticism, the volunteer-run media site features
articles intended to provide a more nuanced, humanizing perspective on
China.]{.underline}** Articles on the website strategically deconstruct
stereotypes and misconceptions about China from raising awareness of
China's internationalist solidarity during the coronavirus pandemic to
more personal reflections on the connections between China's political
thought and anti-racist thinking. **[Ultimately, addressing biases in
media coverage can enhance not only the quality of reporting, but also
address the ways in which reporting contributes to political
misconceptions of entire nationalities, cultures and
values.]{.underline}**

Said's debt to the Foucault (1977) of Discipline and Punish is clear
when the former affirms the latter's archaeological method, whereby
**[rules of discursive engagement produce subjects based on their
inclusion, as opposed to exclusion, into statements that do not
determine but define their participation]{.underline}**. In other words,
**[it is through their appearance (in statements, in documents, in
narratives) that natives as such are transformed into
natives]{.underline}**. Said (1979: xix) writes that **[[this 'will to
understand' the Orient turned into]{.mark} a certain '[will to
dominate']{.mark} it]{.underline}**. **[France's ability to 'know' the
Egyptians [brings the Orient]{.mark} and its subjects [into]{.mark} view
or [existence, as objects of consumption]{.mark} for the Occident. They
are brought into vision by a civilizing force capable of
supervision]{.underline}**. Like Foucault's description of technologies
of surveillance, **[[the colonial panopticon sees the Orient without
being seen, writes it without being read]{.mark}, [surveys it without
being marked.]{.mark} This happens through writing and other forms of
capturing the natives for nativist purposes, that is, of asserting
European superiority over the naturalized inferiority of the Orient. But
Said disagrees with Foucault by asserting the author's imprint rather
than disappearance from discourse]{.underline}** (see Foucault 1991).
**[This is consistent with [Said's]{.mark} 'worldly' [analysis of
literature]{.mark} and other linguistic practices [as]{.mark} not
reducible to text but instantiations of concrete relations with their
context. They function as [representations o]{.mark}f the material
[world]{.mark}]{.underline}**, not in the reductive sense that
compromises orthodox Marxism's effectivity but in a Vician (1984)
recursive sense of play between cultural traffic, knowledge production
and human participation. **[Sometimes credited with Said, postcolonial
analysis does not signal a break from anti-colonial analysis as much as
it is a shift in explaining its processes.]{.underline}** Said is
concerned with the same colonialism that provided Fanon (\[1952\] 2008)
and Césaire's (\[1955\] 2000) problematic but **[[Said's is]{.mark} a
[colonial]{.mark} predicament turned into a [literary
phenomenon]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Its brutality is not only its
capacity to turn targets of colonialism into non-beings but equally
their disfigurement through metaphor and other linguistic practices.
**[The worldliness of language, for example, means that [annunciation
cannot be divorced from]{.mark} the [earthliness]{.mark} that
interpellates it. [Disfiguration happens when knowers are]{.mark}
perversely [consumed]{.mark} as objects in the orientalist knowledge
industry and ignorance ironically asserts itself as the only legitimate
form of knowledge]{.underline}** (see Mills 2007). Said shares Anibal
Quijano's (2000) turn away from studies of official, administrative
colonialism and towards the 'coloniality of power'. Following the
grooves of Quijano, **[Nelson Maldonado-Torres]{.underline}** (2007:
243) **[describes coloniality thusly: Coloniality is different from
colonialism.]{.underline}** Colonialism denotes a political and economic
relation in which the sovereignty of a nation or a people rests on the
power of another nation, which makes such nation an empire.
**[Coloniality, instead, refers to long-standing patterns of power that
emerged as a result of colonialism]{.underline}**, but that define
culture, labor, intersubjective relations, and knowledge production well
**[beyond the strict limits of colonial administrations. Thus,
[coloniality survives colonialism. It is]{.mark} maintained alive in
books, [in]{.mark} the [criteria for academic performance]{.mark}, in
cultural patterns, in common sense, in the self-image of peoples, in
aspirations of self, and so many other aspects of our modern
experience]{.underline}**. In a way, as modern subjects we breathe
coloniality all the time and everyday. Nxot to be underestimated, the
fall of traditional colonialism marked a transition in the modern world
system of race from colonialism to coloniality, from subordination to
subjectivation, from the transparency of power to its opaqueness, and
finally, from what Said (1994a: 23) characterizes as the reliance on the
'business of empire' and 'empire of business'. Just as Henry Giroux and
Peter McLaren (1986) describe curriculum as simply the introduction to a
particular way of life, so we can characterize, with William Appleman
Williams, 'empire as a way of life' (cited in Said 1994a: 55).
Immigrants, refugees and other categories of people enter colonialism as
a structure already lying in wait, whether or not a colonial power
administers a colonial state (see Grosfoguel 2007). In short, the world
witnesses the coloniality of power turn into the power of coloniality to
direct life outcomes even after the end of the official colonial era.
Just as the end of US enslavement ended one peculiar form of racism and
not racism itself, thus inaugurating another form (i.e. Jim Crow
segregation) to replace it (Bonilla-Silva 2001), ending colonial
occupation does not sound the death knell of coloniality. Knowledge and
the epistemic problem **[To say that decolonization is a curricular
problem is to suggest that curriculum reform is part of the decolonial
project. [Knowledge production has always been part of the colonial
project]{.mark} for it was not only a material imposition of a foreign
or external power but a concerted effort internally to supplant an
existing way of life with another. This means that [decolonizing the
curriculum]{.mark} [is no less than decolonizing]{.mark} the dominant
theory of knowledge, if not [knowledge itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}** By
theory, Said favours a secular version not reducible to its abstract,
even religious, overtones but theory as part of human activity in Vico's
(1984) The New Science, which is that humans can only understand (and
therefore undo) what they themselves have made. It shares a family
resemblance with Lukács' (1971) **[affirmation of theory's place in
forging critical consciousness as part of creating the world we can get
behind rather than only describing the one we reject in front of
us]{.underline}** (see Said 1983: 234). But **[neither is theory the
same as critical consciousness]{.underline}**, **[the second providing
spatio-temporal context for the first as well as accounting for the
untidy nature of historical experience that resists standardization
through theory.]{.underline}** In this sense, **[[knowledge is]{.mark}
less a thing of human nature than [a thing humans do.]{.mark} As part of
undoing what colonial knowledge has made of us to which we no longer
consent, the gift of [colonialism must be returned]{.mark} with interest
[within a]{.mark} decolonial [project]{.mark} [that dis-orients the
curriculum.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In recent decades, **[multicultural
reform has put a dent in Eurocentrism's hold on the US curriculum. That
welt has been noticed as its sentinels were awakened in order to defend
their territory.]{.underline}** Once thought to be something about
re-indigenization of land, decolonization moves on to new territory,
this time the realm of knowledge and cognition. It is one thing to
remove the colonizer from the first and quite another to purge them from
the second. For the colonizer's stench remains long after the denouement
of decolonization. **[Insofar as [the colonizer]{.mark} was able to
[insert themselves into every nook]{.mark} and cranny of the colony,
inner city or township, [including the]{.mark} colonial [subject's
self-concept]{.mark}, a decolonizing violence of the same magnitude,
what Fanon]{.underline}** (\[1961\] 2005) **[calls [a 'cleansing
force']{.mark}]{.underline}** (51; italics in original), **[[must take
place]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Colonialism redefined the category of
'human' as part of the radical departure within humanism to reduce it to
essential traits like abstract reason. **[Since at least the Cartesian
cogito, which pronounced the mind-body split in favour of a
decontextualized, rational spirit, the coloniality of being meant that
cognition was a cog in the juggernaut of European, capitalist, colonial
expansion. [Western epistemology has oriented humans]{.mark}, as part of
defining their essence, [towards knowledge as]{.mark} a
[conquering]{.mark} impulse.]{.underline}** This 'ego conquiro' and its
accompanying 'imperial attitude' became a constitutive part of
knowledge, practically and conceptually (Maldonado-Torres 2007: 245;
italics in original). **[In practical terms, it means a fundamentally
suspicious and misanthropic attitude towards the other as a threat to
European being, who must be stamped out or violently assimilated in what
has become a perpetual state of war.]{.underline}** Conceptually,
**[europocentrism has a virtual monopoly on what it means to be
human]{.underline}**, for as Charles Mills (1997) reminds us, **[within
the racial contract European humanism is just as it sounds: only
Europeans are humans.]{.underline}** To make matters worse, the
'educational racial contract' (Leonardo 2015) is flanked by the
'colonial contract' (Leonardo and Vafai 2016). **[Even accursed Whites
in the form of white women and the white working class, for example,
retain the mark and possibility of being human; they are beings, after
all. [The radical cut within]{.mark} the denominator of [the human made
by colonialism]{.mark} within an imperialist ontology [makes
curriculum]{.mark} reform [a matter of life and death]{.mark} as
colonial subjects fight off forms of social death in everyday
life.]{.underline}**

**[The role of intellectuals and academics is central throughout Said's
critique of Orientalism. [Said builds his]{.mark} entire [deconstruction
on]{.mark} the Western tradition of [writing]{.mark}, and on theories,
which are also generally characterized as Western.]{.underline}** For
this, **[he bases his work on ideas from Nietzsche]{.underline}**
(representation and the thing-in-itself), **[Foucault]{.underline}**
(discourse, power/knowledge, episteme and truth regimes),
**[Gramsci]{.underline}** (cultural hegemony), **[and
Derrida]{.underline}** (deconstruction). In rejecting the conflation
between representation and truth, the tradition, which Said follows, is
Nietzschean. Giving the example of a painting, which is normally
conceived as a fixed image representing a fixed object, Nietzsche
concludes "the human intellect allowed appearance to appear, and
projected its mistaken conceptions onto the things" (Nietzsche, 2000:
38). This is based on the belief that the thing-in-itself always exists
in the state in which it is depicted. Nietzsche considered such a
conception to be erroneous, because **["the appearance has come to being
gradually, and will continue to be evolving, and can therefore not be a
representation of an essence that created it. It is our minds, our
intellect, that gradually create the appearance"]{.underline}** (38).
Hence, **[all [representations]{.mark} [are]{.mark} already
[misrepresentations]{.mark} by the sheer idea that they represent a
thing. [Orientalism claims to be representing the
Orient]{.mark},]{.underline}** but in doing so[, **[it
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[only representing [its own
conception]{.mark} of what must be outside the construction of the ideal
West. [The Orient]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which Orientalists claim to
represent, and travel literature claims to depict, **[[is]{.mark}
therefore [empty of essence]{.mark}]{.underline}**[:]{.mark} "Perhaps
**[we will recognize then that the thing -in- itself]{.underline}**
deserves a Homeric laugh, **[in that it seemed to be so much, indeed
everything, and is actually empty, that is, empty of
meaning"]{.underline}** (38). Said owes to Antonio Gramsci the idea of
cultural hegemony, which is "exercised in society by the ruling
class"(41). For Gramsci, t**[he intellectuals of society function as:
the '[officers' of the ruling class]{.mark} for the exercise of the
subordinate function of social hegemony [and]{.mark} political
government of the '[spontaneous' consent]{.mark} given by the great
masses of the population to the direction [imprinted on social]{.mark}
life by the fundamental ruling class, a consent which comes into
existence 'historically' from the 'prestige']{.underline}** (and hence
from the trust) **[accruing to the ruling class from its position and
its function in the world of production]{.underline}** (Gramsci, 2000:
40). **[Gramsci is here treating the knowledge of intellectuals as,
literally, a "production"]{.underline}** (Gramsci, 2000, 39), albeit
indirectly. **[The [role of the intellectual]{.mark} in shaping public
opinion [is due to]{.mark} their [mediation]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
the process, **[between the social fabric and the "super- structures of
which]{.underline}** the intellectuals **[are in fact the
'officials'"]{.underline}** (39). For Said, **[the persistence of the
spontaneous acceptance of the [binary world view of]{.mark} the
[opposition West versus East builds in]{.mark} the [scholarly
world]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[on protecting]{.mark} the
[hierarchies]{.mark} which maintain, for the public, the imaginary sense
of binarism. These concepts]{.underline}** of prestige, trust, and the
relation between the ruling class and the intellectual **[are also
discussed by Foucault as he elaborates on the close relation between
power and knowledge]{.underline}**, and the power regime in his works
such as the Archaeology of Knowledge (1969), Civilization and Madness
(1964), and interviews published in Power/Knowledge (1980). A. L. Macfie
summarizes Nietzsche and Gramsci' s views as follows: **[According to
Foucault, until the period of the Renaissance people had assumed that
language reflected reality]{.underline}** (objects, things). **[But in
the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries [language came to be
seen]{.mark}, not as a reflection of reality, but [as a]{.mark}
transparent '[film']{.mark}, dissociated from it.]{.underline}** As a
result **[it became possible to identify words and statements not as
signs, representing objects and things, but as events, floating in a
space, field or episteme]{.underline}**. In this strange world,
**[knowledge became not so much a matter of fact as the outcome of a
struggle for power, in which events and discourses]{.underline}**,
vehicles of 'economies of power'**[, created new 'networks' and
'regimes' of knowledge -- regimes which would themselves survive only
until such time as new ones arose, capable of taking their
place.]{.underline}** Truth, therefore \... was not outside power or
lacking in it (Macfie, 2000: 41). **[Said builds on Foucault's concept
of discourse and truth regimes]{.underline}** as described by Foucault,
**[which means [that power allows]{.mark} particular things to pass as
unquestionable truths, to argue that there is nothing inherent or fixed
about [the Orient or the Occident or West,]{.mark} and that the idea of
the unitary West or Western subject is built upon a contrast to its
imaginary Other, the Oriental, which is depicted as inherently inferior
and less capable. This is something, he says, has been accepted
throughout Europe's hi]{.underline}**story, and has both allowed, and
been allowed to survive by power regimes. **[Aijaz
[Ahmad]{.mark}]{.underline}** in "Between Orientalism and Historicism"
(1991) **[critiques Said's [focus on]{.mark} text "facilitates a reading
of [history]{.mark} not from the basis of material production, but from
its systems of representations"]{.underline}** ([Macfie]{.mark}, 2000:
285). According to Ahmad, **[[Said's view of Orientalism]{.mark} is
ahistorical for two reasons: the first is counting on a non-material,
non-linear understanding of history. The second]{.underline}**, upon
adopting Said's view for argument's sake, **[[is]{.mark} that [by
foregrounding literature]{.mark} Said defines his object of study in
ways, which are incompatible with one another. The contradiction which
Ahmad refers to is between Said's general and specific definitions of
Orientalism]{.underline}** quoted at the beginning, since by doing that,
**[Said defines two different starting points for the tradition which he
studies: one of them is roughly aroundthe end of the eighteenth
century]{.underline}** (Ahmad, 2000: 288), **[the other is European
antiquity with Homer's Iliad and Aeschylus' The Persians
(]{.underline}**287). **[By stating an earlier beginning of Orientalism,
Said]{.underline}**, according to Ahmad, **[accepts a humanist approach
to history while his indebtedness to Foucault betrays the
antihumanist]{.underline}**, Foucauldian, approach to history. Ahmad
says that the problem with Said here is that he "tries to occupy
theoretical positions which are mutually contradictory" (Macfie, 2000:
285). Nevertheless, in both cases Ahmad persists in his insistence on a
particular mode of knowledge and history - reading, which for him is
characteristic of Western academia. **[Ahmad therefore believes that
Said has foregrounded the concept of discourse in order for him to use
it as a defense against the misrepresenter of Oriental
history]{.underline}** (Ahmad, 2000: 293). Ahmad also refers to one of
the theoretical difficulties in Said's work which is "**[he has never
been able to work out his relationship with the two slightly older
intellectuals of his generation,]{.underline}** Foucault and Derrida,
whose work has influenced him the most" (290). This, along with the span
and fluidity of Said's definition for his object of knowledge leads
Ahmad to the confusion of having to see Said either as a political
writer or a theoretical writer (294). **[In one way or another, to be
understood, Said must fit within a category, and ultimately Ahmad sees
Said to be "riven between his anti - Westernist passion and his
Foucauldian allegiance"]{.underline}** (291). **[[Ahmad gives precedence
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the "Western archive of knowledge" (291) -
that is[, **[West-written history]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[- as the
true narrative which must therefore precede the discourse which Said is
trying to deal with for "his anti-Westernist passion"]{.underline}**
(291). In both sides of Ahmad's argument (historicism and
disciplinarity), **[one can see his attempt to preserve a mode of
knowledge that depends on categorization and field division, and
preserving the catalogue of Western text, which has produced that
knowledge.]{.underline}** Nevertheless, requiring **[Said to conform to
one particular mode or another, i.e. wholesale]{.underline}** -
Foucauldian (anti-humanist) **[or the opposite, or a mode of writing or
scholarly field]{.underline}** (political, historical, etc.), **[is what
we are here considering as a particular mode of knowledge, with breaks
in the borderlines of the epistemic field being seen as an act of
violence to one's own conception of self, as an academic in this
case.]{.underline}** Bernard Lewis in Islam and the West (1993) argues
that **[[Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the academic profession of
enquiry into the lives of the Orientals, **[[cannot]{.mark} as a whole
[be criticized]{.mark}, especially not [by someone who is not an
Orientalist]{.mark} himself. "The most rigorous and penetrating critique
of Orientalist, as of any other, scholarship has always been and will
remain that of their fellow scholar]{.underline}**s, especially, though
not exclusively, those working in the same field" (Lewis,1993: 268).
**[Lewis automatically dismisses critiques made by non-Orientalists
simply for this reason. It is why he does not consider Said to be a
scholar at all]{.underline}**, and for the same reason, he dismisses
non - Orientalist Marxist critiques as coming from unqualified
individuals, unlike their Orientalist counterparts whose criticism is
much more welcome. "**[[Most of these critics are not]{.mark} themselves
[Orientalists]{.mark} \... it means that they do not possess the
Orientalist skills]{.underline}**, which are exercised with little
difference by both Marxist and non-Marxist Orientalists" (257). **[[This
establishes the Orientalist]{.mark} as a category of qualified people
who can or possess the [skills and tools]{.mark}, which give them the
right to speak about and for the Orient]{.underline}**. Lewis refuses to
accept Said as a scholar, which contrasts with his respect for other
people' s academic titles, such as Dr. Abdel-Malek (256) and Professor
Zakaria (267), whom he accepts as scholarly simply because of their
restriction to "known scholarly language" (256). The major part of
Lewis's attack on Said took the form of showing how Said got historical
facts wrong, such as predating the rise of Arabic studies in France and
ignoring German scholarship (258). Fred Halliday in "Orientalism and Its
Crisis" (1993) argues he is wedded to a classical view of history
(Halliday, 1993: 145), **[where there are truths, there are actual
Orientals and that what Orientalist does is find these truths and
represent them. Halliday claims that the choice of the name
'[Orientalism' itself is]{.mark} a form of [hegemonic]{.mark}
claim,]{.underline}** **[[overgeneralized]{.mark}, and made by
Said]{.underline}** simply **[[due to]{.mark} most of the
[knowledge]{.mark} and text [produced by early]{.mark} Orientalists
having been produced within an imperialist context.]{.underline}**
Halliday says there is no reason to reject any kind of knowledge simply
because of the context in which it has been produced, and he gives the
example of robbing a bank, where in order to achieve that aim, one would
need an actual map and plan based on real knowledge which would enable
them to perform the task at hand (148). **[This and similar claims,
however, completely mix between the geographic and statistic knowledge
produced about the land]{.underline}**, its strategic map, the
distribution of natural resources in it and the description of the
peoples and their traditions on the one hand as scientific observable
data, and the poetics in which this kind of knowledge is reproduced,
**[where [identities of Self and Other are presumed]{.mark} even before
any of that [writing]{.mark} takes place, or the way in which the
scholar or researcher is thought of as having full capacity for
accessing and producing that kind of knowledge.]{.underline}** This all
falls under the same category of generalizations. **[Said [never
condemns]{.mark} the [objective or linguistic knowledge]{.mark} of the
researcher or the philologist, but the idea that he is now believed to
have full access,]{.underline}** and full capacity to make the kind of
generalized judgments that are then used to justify the continuity of
colonization as a civilizing mission**[. It is a power regime that
transforms the words of the scholar, thanks merely to his or her title,
into truth.]{.underline}**

### AT: Chinese threat real

**[The role of theory here is to provide the connective tissue of ideas
and concepts to help us perceive the bigger picture and the various
intersections within]{.underline}**, changing and moving through time,
but **[anchored with examples in a material reality that is familiar to
us.]{.underline}** The role of theory however is not explain everything
perfectly. Nevertheless, **[my purpose has been to illustrate the role
that advancing China as a technological society has played during its
modern development]{.underline}**, how this has in turned been received
by others. What we find is that **[each period has been deeply entwined
with competitive nationalisms and often, various forms of cultural,
political and even racial discrimination.]{.underline}** I have not
discussed whether Sino(techno)phobia is in some way justified. This is
the defining concern among those who assert that Chinese technology is
dangerous, even without the taint of Digital Orientalism. To **[be sure,
[Chinese technology can]{.mark} now [compete, and]{.mark} perhaps
"[win]{.mark}" in a decade or so; [but it did]{.mark} [not start the
world down]{.mark} the path of competitive nationalism, imperialism or
[hegemony]{.mark}, nor did it innovate the first technological society.
China can still argue that its advances have been to secure sovereignty
and national wellbeing and not hegemony]{.underline}**, arguments that
are less credible elsewhere. This is why in part I find arguments
advanced by some against Huawei, for example, to be disingenuous.
**[[Given what we know]{.mark} of actual American practices---including
unregulated tech giants with self-serving agendas]{.underline}**
(including **[selling access to malign and anti-American
intere]{.underline}**sts), **[as well as US governmental spying through
US-tech based networks, even on allies, and the fact that after 9/11
that the US government could access private and academic
network]{.underline}**s held by American firms and universities **[with
little to no judicial oversight---the [blacklisting of Chinese
firms]{.mark} because they "might" engage in similar tactics at some
point, and to characterize this as defending liberal values against
communism, [is complete nonsense]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, as
others have pointed out, there are constructive ways for Huawei to
comply with the cybersecurity laws wherever they do business \[26\], and
unlike many American frims, there's no evidence that they haven't done
so. **[This is why Mayer and I described the [continuing]{.mark} US-led
[campaign]{.mark} against Huawei as [exemplifying
Sino(techno)phobia]{.mark} and Digital Orientalism]{.underline}**
\[45\]. I have not discussed whether there is Chinese fear of Western
technology, and how this relates to Sino(techno)phobia. To be sure, the
Chinese are wary of any technology that compromises sovereignty and
security. **[While the West and particularly the [US]{.mark} have
increasingly [flirted with]{.mark} the [fantasy of technological]{.mark}
autarky, of decoupling from Chinese technology, the same can be said
about China seeking autonomy and independence]{.underline}**. But it
should be noted that in the US, it's common to cry loudly of potential
threats, while in China, it's generally taboo to do so unless those
threats can be countered effectively. That said, we should acknowledge
the increasing trend of technology securitization and strong fusions
between civilian and military technology in both countries and the
mutual fear this creates. Much is made about China's intention of
demonstrating the superiority of its system relative to Western forms of
liberalism, with such rhetoric peaking again with what some in the West
view as Chinese triumphalism associated with its successful eforts to
contain the outbreak (e.g., \[80\]). But this overstates the role of
ideology in policymaking and pits Marxism spuriously as the central
antagonist in this confrontation \[44\]. Marxism did normalize
technological development and the emergence of China's technological
society as a material means for reestablishing sovereignty and security.
But **[perhaps today's [competition is]{.mark} really [located
in]{.mark} the [extent to which China]{.mark} as a technological society
[acknowledges itself for]{.mark} what it is and then seeks a position of
human [advancement]{.mark} that transcends]{.underline}** or evolves
**[to a higher stage of existence and well-being]{.underline}**---as
**[[China]{.mark} claims per it ambitions to [establish]{.mark} itself
as a ['full]{.mark}y modern socialist [nation]{.mark}.' Conversely, [the
West]{.mark}, and more specifically the US, [seem]{.mark} stuck in time
or even [regressing]{.mark}, unable to accept or manage changes
constructively, unable to normalize the growing
intersections]{.underline}** and counterbalances that must exist within
and **[between governance, technology, social progress and individual
actualization. Too often, [instead of looking inward]{.mark} and finding
the true source of its problems, and further, how these problems are not
dissimilar from others elsewhere, [the US has externalized them with
Sino(techno)phobia and]{.mark} Digital
[Orientalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Perhaps **[the difference between
the two countries is the extent to which they acknowledge and react to
their own totalitarian-oriented surveillance states.]{.underline}** In
general terms, Shoshana Zubof gets to this question in part in her book,
The Age of Surveillance Capitalism \[88\], where she asks whether we
will be 'the masters of information and machines or its slaves.' We
should be cautious when applying this thinking to China. **[Too often
[Westerners equate the CPC as the]{.mark} inhuman [monster
wielding]{.mark} inhuman [technology]{.mark}.]{.underline}** What if the
opposite is true: **[what if the CPC is the human face that aims to be
the master of machines and information, and to do so as much as possible
for the greater good within a]{.underline}** social and political
**[system they believe they were compelled to create in the first place
in order to survive the onslaught of technologically advanced imperial
nations? What if this human face (or Facebook) does not exist at all in
the West, or only limitedly, incapable of actually confronting or
regulating various technological masters that have become systemically
entrenched]{.underline}** and the pharmakon of contemporary
life---**[both the poison and the cure for so many Western
ills?]{.underline}** However, **[[it's possible that China]{.mark}'s
general tendency towards techno-positivism [risks]{.mark} revisiting
[dystopian]{.mark} social [experimentation]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
misadventures, as the lockdowns suggest to some. Here I concede
sympathies to a diferent viewpoint in Marxism, attributed to especially
to Antonio Gramsci and Walter Benjamin, opposing positivism and
determinism; but **[I also realize that [it's]{.mark} the nature of the
Chinese political system to respond to crises by asserting control as
opposed to surrendering the same.]{.underline}** In fact, in the broader
context of public health, which has always been based on police power,
**[asserting control is considered universally
preferable.]{.underline}** Further, **[it's not uncommon for a state to
privilege saving lives if it has the capacity to do so despite
signifcant economic, social and political costs.]{.underline}** It's
generally better to be blamed for losses incurred despite strong eforts
to minimize them, than to do less and likewise sufer. **[The concern
that China aims to take over the world, and so on, seems little more
than a [hyperbolic]{.mark} speaking point belabored endlessly
[as]{.mark} the [new Red Scare]{.mark} [rhetoric]{.mark}, girding
decoupling.]{.underline}** In fact, **[despite mounting empirical
evidence that China is a major contributor to global
justice]{.underline}** \[23\], **[a more dangerous concern at present is
that China might choose to decouple itself.]{.underline}** It's not
farfetched to suggest that we may have reached an infection point, one
in which China increasingly views the world outside its borders as
ungovernable. This would not be the frst time this has happened. And to
a certain extent this has already happened with the pandemic--- neither
the frst nor last of global pandemics---with some experts predicting
more to come due to climate change. **[Nevertheless, [China is
determined to proceed]{.mark} towards a new threshold of development as
a technological society, with or without everyone else.]{.underline}**
Many **[derailments might occur along the way, from new crises like the
pandemic or global warming,]{.underline}** which many experts fear will
wreak global havoc by 2050. Other than these, are there any convincing
eforts currently underway that might forestall China's advance in lieu
of encouraging it? We might be witnessing less a clash of civilizations
than one outcompeting the other despite that other setting the initial
terms of the game.

#### Perceived threats of Chinese technological dominance inaccurate and nonsense -- rather, they are sinotechnophobic projections of Western technological insecurity and an inability to move towards the future.

There has been a lot of research done on China within the academic field
of security studies. [[Researchers]{.mark} have [studied the]{.mark}
**[Western view of China]{.mark}** from both critical and non-critical
perspectives. Some [research is a **Western attempt to
understand**]{.mark} and predict the tactics and [strategies used by
China]{.mark}. Ratner (2011) argues that it is important to look at the
Chinese government through different perspectives, and not only
strategic ones, and tries to perceive the emergent security threats
which China will have to handle in the future. Zhang (2019) investigates
how the PRC use coercion, both military and non-violent coercion as a
tactic against other states in the South China Sea. Saunders (2020)
explores China's strategies and calculations when it comes to their
national security.]{.underline} [He looks at aspects such as their
**modernisation of their military** as well as their international and
regional cooperation and diplomacy in both military and other [security
fields]{.mark} to [analyse how China is trying to secure]{.mark} its
strong [position in]{.mark} the [world order]{.mark}. [The focus is on
how China is protecting]{.mark} its [national interests]{.mark} overseas
[by looking]{.mark} at their [military]{.mark} [strategies]{.mark}, and
their peacekeeping operations to better understand China's
behaviour]{.underline} (Saunders 2020). Overall, these **[[studies do
not tell us]{.mark} that [much about China, as they are]{.mark} still
[from]{.mark} a [Western perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Other
studies about China focuses on how the West views China. Möller (2007)
gives an account of how the West has researched China from the 80s until
the early 2000s. He looks at how the debates have gone from discussing
multipolarity to China's rise, and conclude that the research has been
dominated by different strands of thought at different times: The
evolution of the European debate over two decades points to an early
dominance of Sinological exceptionalists, followed by a challenge by
"internationalists" that pulled the Sinologists back in conceptional
terms, followed in turn by the emergence of constructivism that provided
the Sinologists with an excuse to once again turn exceptionalist (Möller
2007, 183). Hook, through a descriptive study, gives an account of how
the British threat perception of China has changed and developed from
1945-2000, with a focus on Hong Kong and how the handover of Hong Kong
to China affected it (Hook 2004). Roy (1996, 758) conducted a literature
review over the different arguments on the pro-China vs anti-China
stances politically. [[Focusing on]{.mark} the China threat, the
arguments he presents concern regional instability and [how China could
transform into a superpower]{.mark} which would [increase]{.mark} both
their power and [threat level to the West]{.mark}.]{.underline} More
recently, Song (2015) did a securitisation analysis with a
poststructuralist approach and analyses how [the **[West]{.mark}
[securitises China from three different
perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One of the more interesting pieces
of research is by Pan Chengxin (2012), who discusses how, in the current
Western research on the rise of China, China is usually approached
either as a security threat or as a country full of economic
opportunities. Building onto arguments by Said, Clifford, and Geertz
about the autobiographical nature of knowledge, Pan argues that [**most
[studies about China's rise]{.mark}** to power [say more about
how]{.mark} the [West views itself rather than]{.mark} **producing
[actual useful knowledge about China]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[[Two]{.mark} paradigms (or [narratives]{.mark}), opportunity and
threat, [perpetuate]{.mark} the **[East as]{.mark} something [Other to
the West]{.mark}** (Pan 2012, 43). Focusing on this othering, Pan argues
that it "is not so much about treating others as threats per se as it is
about the employment of such discursive tactics as imposition,
reduction, and denial when it comes to understanding other's
subjectivities" (Pan 2012, 56). Furthermore, using the thre[at paradigm
when looking at China tells us]{.mark} about how the West is afraid to
be treated like they have treated others in history; the **[West is
afraid to be colonized]{.mark}, conquered [by China]{.mark}**. This
paradigm is built onto ideas about Western superiority due to knowledge
-- i.e. modernity and technology -- which allows/have allowed them to
justify not only the current world order but also colonisation (Pan
2012, 43ff). Hence, it includes ideas of **Orientalism**, 'the white
man's burden' etc.]{.underline} [[Through representing China as a
monolithic whole]{.mark}, dismissing its subjectivities, and/or imposing
onto it a singular, fixed subjectivity of power politics, [the **"China
threat**" paradigm acts as]{.mark} a [discursive construction of
an]{.mark} **objectified [Other]{.mark}**, cast as an Other and
threatening object, China by definition lacks the kind of rationality
and subjectivity that are characteristic of the Western knowing
subject]{.underline} (Pan 2012, 55).

### Biotech

#### Invocations of securitied rhetoric in biowarfare is part of a larger techno-Orientalist anxiety fueled by US competitiveness with China in the global tech race\-\--Yellow Peril becomes reconfigured through this imaginary and manifests in domestic anti-Asian sentiments in the name of technological and national security

Make no mistake, as long as President Trump continues to take a
confrontational stance, using **[the [rhetoric of blame against
China]{.mark} with the intention to punish]{.underline}** it **[with new
sanctions, tariffs, and even]{.underline}** **[the cancellation of U.S.
debt obligations]{.underline}**,5 **[the [racial aggressions against
Asian Americans]{.mark} will continue to [rise]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
if not intensify. By now, it is widely accepted that the novel
coronavirus emerged first in Wuhan, and scientists believe that the
zoonotic disease might have jumped from animals to humans at Wuhan's
Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a wet market where vegetables, seafood,
meat, and a small number of exotic wildlife were sold. Despite this, on
April 30, President **Trump** casually offered a new theory, which
Secretary of State **[Mike [Pompeo tweeted:]{.mark} that [COVID]{.mark}
had [originated in]{.mark} the [Wuhan]{.mark} Institute of
Virology]{.underline}**, which houses a biosafety level-4 lab, a**[nd
that the virus might have "leaked" from that lab]{.underline}**. **[The
[implicit suggestion]{.mark} is [that China]{.mark} had either
[intentionally bioengineered]{.mark} the novel [corona]{.mark}virus to
cause massive destruction, thereby attributing malice, or carelessly
leaked the virus due to scientific negligence, thereby
[attributing]{.mark} incompetence]{.underline}**. In either case,
**[these kinds of [unsubstantiated speculations]{.mark} work [to]{.mark}
further [stoke]{.mark} anger and [disdain]{.mark} against the Chinese
state]{.underline}**. More disturbingly**[, [they traffic in the idea of
China as a biotech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology
**[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**, resonating The immediate and
unqualified responses from the scientific community reveal the danger of
these potentially incendiary speculations. Responding swiftly, the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a press release
the morning of April 30 stating that "The Intelligence Community . . .
concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was
not manmade or genetically modified . . . " (my emphasis).6 Within days,
the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, attested that the virus "could not have been
artificially or deliberately manipulated."7 These assertions sought to
extinguish any attribution of malice to the Chinese state. **[Even with
firm contestation]{.underline}**, however, **[[the very invocation of
the idea of biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology **[[warfare
has]{.mark}]{.underline}** tapped into and perhaps even
**[[fueled]{.mark} our existing [techno-Orientalist
anxieties]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As the COVID pandemic story transpires
in real time, engulfing the entire global community, taking unexpected
twists and turns, making divergences and transgressions, we have become
increasingly aware that the layers of entanglements cannot be easily
parsed out, nor will we know anytime soon how and when the story will
end. We offer a query into how we might assess and make sense of the
intensifying Sinophobia and xenophobia in this current context. To do
so, we must resist the temptation to confine our analysis to the narrow
parameters of the pandemic. Rather, **[we insist on [examining the rise
of anti-Asian aggression within the]{.mark} concomitant vectors of the
[pandemic]{.mark}, the escalation of the [U.S.-China trade war]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} the [growing]{.mark} [concerns about cyber]{.mark}- and
techno-[security]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Here we assert that **[[the
ideology of yellow peril set]{.mark} with[in a techno-Orientalist
imaginary]{.mark} is powerfully [animating the racial form and]{.mark}
racial [affect mediating]{.mark} the multiple terrains of public health,
tech]{.underline}**nology, **[global trade, and [national
security]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While it is tempting to treat this
historical conjuncture as extraordinary, it is crucial that we situate
the current unfolding within the long history of Asian racialization,
one that indexes the abiding tension between the political impetus to
define national belonging and the shifting economic imperatives of the
nation-state.8 In this essay, we examine the techniques and effects of
race-making in this current moment, while linking them to historical
antecedents, in order to illustrate **[the persistence of the [yellow
peril ideology]{.mark} as it is being [configured through a
techno-Orientalist imaginary where China is posited as the chief
enemy-threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} What follows **[is an
analysis of how Chinese alterity as national security threat is being
simultaneously constructed and disciplined in the different but related
arenas of the pandemic, science, and tech]{.underline}**nology.

#### Discussion of new emerging tech in STS shows that race is NOT just biological, but has recentered toward a posthuman conversation of socio-genetic discussion\-\--specifically in biotech, this racial configuration brings new forms of biological orientalism to fruition that aggregates Asian Americans into racialized stereotypes of dehumanization

Studies" \| DOI: 10.1215/00029831-3711150 \| SAoki)

\-\--STS = science and technology studies

Like Zhou's and Anderson's monographs, which group Asian American texts
and cultural productions around a particular theme, Lee's book can be
approached as an analysis of Asian American literature and performance
art within the framework of biopolitics and the idea of the fragmented
Asian American body. But Lee's book is much more ambitious, an
epistemological reassessment of Asian American studies that attempts to
graft recent scholarship in gender theory, queer theory, and science and
technology studies (STS) onto Asian American critical thought to break
the static thinking of the field's pursuit of social justice and
understanding of agency. **[In a framework where race is understood as a
historically variable construct with material effects, [the term Asian
American has been foregrounded as a necessary]{.mark} "fictional
([discursive) construct]{.mark},"]{.underline}** one **[[that]{.mark}
constantly [threatens to be interpreted as essentialist and]{.mark}
[biological]{.mark}]{.underline}** (8). Pointing to the field's renewed
anxiety about essentialism, Lee reviews the different ways scholars such
as Kandice Chuh and Colleen Lye have called for "more rigorously
historicist, formalist, \[and\] aesthetic" interrogations (10). While
not taking issue with these endeavors, **[Lee questions [the
implications of]{.mark} [avoiding a discussion of the ways scientific
discourse on race has moved to the genetic and cellular
level]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and **[[has cleaved from the
biological]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This
[disconnect]{.mark}]{.underline}**, she argues, **[[forecloses]{.mark} a
number of [opportunities to advance social justice]{.mark}
agendas]{.underline}**: **[the ability to see the persistence
of]{.underline}** particular forms of **[biological
racism]{.underline}**, **[the [emergence of new racial
forms]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} and the apparent equivalence of
living matter "in an abstract system of underlying exchangeability"
(233**[). In a manner analogous to Asian American studies' deployment of
qualified personification, [STS deploys discursive strategies that
conjure narratives about fictional persons]{.mark} in order to return
the part (of the body) to the whole---for example, conflating cell lines
with persons and [turning them into proxies for
personhood]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Lee highlights how **[recent
scholarship in STS traces the historicity of biology and exposes [the
ways biotech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology **[[has reconfigured biology
as a factory in correspondence with an intensified
commodification]{.mark} of organs and tissues from surplus populations,
separating human biological persons from partial persons]{.underline}**.
She pushes **[[Asian American scholarship]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
**[[consider these new forms of racial profiling]{.mark} and
rearticulated divisions [between]{.mark} nature and culture, [human and
posthuman]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words, **[[the meaning of
race has changed within the discourse of biology]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[but]{.underline}** Lee contends that **[these shifts have neither
displaced nor supplanted a chromatic schema of race. Instead,
[biotech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology**[['s separation of human
biological persons from partial persons]{.mark} and its
anthropomorphizing of cells performatively [intensify the aggregation
and disaggregation of Asian Americans into revised racial classification
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This emerges]{.underline}**, for
instance, **[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** the case of Greg Bear's
biothriller Blood Music (1985), whose plot includes **[[racializing and
reinforcing Orientalist stereotypes]{.mark} of Asian Americans as
superhuman, indifferent to feeling and suffering, and biologically
impossible]{.underline}**

### Borders

#### The nation state border is constructed on a eschatological imaginary that pulmugates in racialized ways of understanding U.S.-Asian relations as an ideological contagion

**Man 18** (Jessica Man \| Master of Arts degree in Asian American
Studies \| *"The Perfect Type of Industry": 2012 and Apocalyptic Visions
of the Asian Century* pg 26 \| DOA: 7/8/2022 \| SAoki)

Adam McKeown reminds us that the ways in which **[the Chinese Exclusion
Act]{.underline}** was enforced at the American border "**[did more than
just classify Chinese immigrants. It asserted a vision of properly
ordered global social relationships]{.underline}**, a vision that was
**[inseparable from the failures and contradictions inherent in its
enforcement]{.underline}**" (379-280). **[There is a wealth of
scholarship that addresses the imperial preoccupation with legislating
the border, linking it to both nationalist-statist anxieties about
maintaining the ethno-national hierarchies of empire as well as
anxieties about controlling subjugated bodies and legitimating colonial
relationships to land]{.underline}**. **[[Chinese
exclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which **[[provide]{.mark}d [the basis
for all subsequent iterations of racialized border
control]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[points to the conceptualization of
migrant labor [as]{.mark} [ideological contagion]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
All migrants are "carriers;" "illegal" migrants as early as the
Exclusion Act had not been subjected to the proper ritualized screening
that McKeown writes about. The inconsistencies inherent to border
policing despite several attempts at reform indicate that **[Exclusion
was]{.underline}** not only about the physical prevention of Chinese
entry, which it failed to do in the comprehensive manner pushed by labor
unions, but **[about the public ideological decontamination of the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. The concept of
**[[Yellow Peril]{.mark} not only [threatened the stability]{.mark} of
these "properly ordered global social relationships,"]{.underline}**
i.e. the economic and political ordering of immigrants and citizens
based on American ideas of trade, race, and disability, **[but
[with]{.mark} actual [total cultural and national
annihilation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Yellow Peril is]{.mark} not
only epistemological or metaphysical -- it [is an eschatological way of
understanding U.S.-China]{.mark} ([and]{.mark} more broadly [U.S.-Asian)
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With this framework, we can begin to
understand the Page and Exclusion Acts and the associated immigration
bans levied in the early 20th century as **[a state-sanctioned method of
staving off apocalypse and eschaton, a legitimate way of recognizing the
periodic and transitory nature of Empire]{.underline}**. VII. Dream
Interpretation -- Apocalypse, Eschaton, and Empire In order to
understand the relationship between state and apocalypse, we must first
define the terms "apocalypse," "eschaton," and "eschatology."
"Apocalypse" is commonly understood as a temporal mode that is focused
on the imminence of an ending -- to Empire, to global life, to
cosmology. I am making a distinction here between the popular and the
theological, scholastic definitions. The former conflates apocalypse and
eschaton into a commentary on imperial and colonial anxiety, while the
latter approaches apocalypse as a critical, fundamental, and radical
shift in epistemology where what is hidden is revealed, and eschaton as
the moment or period of obliteration where knowledge itself collapses.
"Apocalypse" is a term derived from the Greek apokalypsis, roughly
translating to "uncovering," but most famously taken to mean
"revelation," as in the biblical Revelation of John, sometimes called
the Apocalypse of John. The word cannot be separated from its
theological origins; Christianity is one of the fundamental traditions
of thought through which Western nations understand history, social
order, and futurity, and apocalypticism comes directly out of that
tradition. The secularized notion of apocalypse turns prophesy into
prediction, masking imperial Christian logics behind those of
capitalism, modernity, and the state. "Apocalypse," especially in its
theological sense, should not be used as a semantically-neutral stand-in
for just any religious conceptualization of the end of the world for
this exact reason. John's apocalypse, received on the island of Patmos,
is an extremely dense text, crowded with fantastic and terrifying
images, moving in and out of different modes of signification without
giving the reader a comprehensive cipher. Throughout the text, John
describes a vision of the destruction of the world, wars in spiritual
and physical realms, the subjugation and liberation of humanity, and the
dramatic culmination of Christian notions of spiritual warfare. Most
importantly, the text anticipates the thing which is to be revealed: the
total renewal and redemption of the spiritual and physical realms, and
the nature of the perfected body. John's vision is not only of the end
of the world but of how the cosmos will be reorganized into a new as a
temporal mode that is focused on the imminence of an ending -- to
Empire, to global life, to cosmology. I am making a distinction here
between the popular and the theological, scholastic definitions. The
former conflates apocalypse and eschaton into a commentary on imperial
and colonial anxiety, while the latter approaches apocalypse as a
critical, fundamental, and radical shift in epistemology where what is
hidden is revealed, and eschaton as the moment or period of obliteration
where knowledge itself collapses. "Apocalypse" is a term derived from
the Greek apokalypsis, roughly translating to "uncovering," but most
famously taken to mean "revelation," as in the biblical Revelation of
John, sometimes called the Apocalypse of John. The word cannot be

humanity, and the dramatic culmination of Christian notions of spiritual
warfare. Most importantly, the text anticipates the thing which is to be
revealed: the total renewal and redemption of the spiritual and physical
realms, and the nature of the perfected body. John's vision is not only
of the end of the world but of how the cosmos will be reorganized into a
new. In this way, the Exclusion Act, the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, and
other turn-of-the-century immigration acts can be understood to
constitute a state or state-sanctioned eschatology. **[[Protective and
nationalist]{.mark} [legislation]{.mark} is always [instated to narrow
down the possible futures of empire and empire's
end]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[If American triumphalism is a
belief in the inevitable dominance of U.S. government, culture, and ways
of life over those of other nations, it must be maintained and driven by
an eschatological imaginary that exposes weaknesses in the imperial
strategy and thinks about the ways]{.underline}** through which **[the
empire could be destroyed]{.underline}**. **[London's "Unparalleled
Invasion" provides an apocalypse that exposes the eschatological
nature]{.underline}** of the Exclusion Act and how it anticipated the
fundamental threat Chinese laborers posed to the American nationstate.
The Exclusion Act and all other anti-Asian immigration laws function on,
and are **[[justified through, an imagined future predicated on the
destructive power of Yellow Peril]{.underline}]{.mark}**, validating a
specific vision of eschaton and apocalyptically reframing the nature of
Asian immigration. Apocalypse necessarily deals with periodicity.
Christian theology recognizes several "marks" in its historical record:
pre- and post-lapsarian time, ante- and post-diluvian time, preand
post-messianic time, pre- and post-apocalyptic time, and so forth. It
also recognizes the nebulous and intractable nature of time -- Giorgio
Agamben notes in Infancy and History that Christianity "resolutely
separates time from the natural movement of the stars to make it an
essentially human, interior phenomenon" (95). The Second Epistle of
Peter corroborates this observation, famously stating that "with the
Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day"
(3:8, ESV). Eschatology therefore must be understood to extrapolate from
a specific system of periodizing or marking history, but purposefully
leave the actual span of the period it envelops unclear in order to
avoid foreclosing itself at a certain date**[. [In a statesanctioned
eschatology]{.mark}, the effect is to suspend, extend, and frame the
period of imperial life so that [the end state of totalized destruction
hangs ominously over the present moment, continually presenting a
justification for exclusion and border maintenance as nationalist
projects of conservation]{.mark}]{.underline}.**

The term **[yellow peril emerged in]{.underline}** the late nineteenth
century **[in response to Japan's arrival to the geopolitical stage as a
formidable military and industrial contender to the Western
powers]{.underline}** of Europe and the United States.9 The concept was
further elaborated and given a tangible racial form through Sax Rohmer's
series of novels and films that provided the early content for the
social imaginary of "yellow peril" along with its personification in the
character of Dr. Fu Manchu, the iconic supervillain archetype of the
Asian "evil criminal genius," and his cast of minions.10 Strikingly, Dr.
Fu Manchu's characterization as evil, criminal, and genius continues to
inform the racial trope of the Asian scientist spy; and more recently,
we may add to the list the bioengineer, the CFO, the international
graduate student, to name just a few. Moreover, **[[the notion
of]{.mark} the [non-differentiable "yellow" masses continues to function
as a]{.mark} [homogenizing and dehumanizing device of Asian
racialization, which makes]{.mark} possible the [transference of
Sinophobia to Asian xenophobia]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In its inherent
attempt to construct a racial other, **[["yellow peril"
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** more **[[a projection of Western
fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** than a representation of an Asian
object/subject, and in this sense, it may be **[[better understood as a
repository of racial affect]{.mark} that can animate a myriad of
representational figures, images, and discourses]{.underline}**,
depending on context. Indeed, the **[images and discourses of yellow
peril have surfaced multiple times]{.underline}** throughout the
twentieth century, **[[capturing a multitude of ever-shifting perceived
threats]{.mark} that range [from]{.mark} the danger of [military
intrusion]{.mark}]{.underline}** (i.e., Japanese Americans during WWII),
**[[economic competition]{.underline}]{.mark}** (i.e., Chinese laborers
in the late nineteenth century, Japan in the 1980s), **[Asian moral and
cultural depravity]{.underline}** (i.e., non-Christian heathens, Chinese
prostitutes, opium smokers), **[[to biological
inferiority]{.underline}]{.mark}** (i.e., effeminacy, disease carriers).
As Colleen Lye observes, "the incipient **['yellow peril' refers to a
particular combinatory kind of anticolonial \[and anti-West\]
nationalism]{.underline}**, in which the union of Japanese technological
advance and Chinese numerical mass confronts Western civilization with a
potentially unbeatable force."11 Arguably, **[[the yellow peril of today
represents heightened Western anxieties around China's]{.mark} combined
forces of population size, global economic [growth]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
rapid [tech]{.mark}nological-scientific [innovation]{.mark}---all of
which emerge from a political system that is [considered ideologically
oppositional to ours]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The current context, we
suggest, is **[[best understood through]{.underline}]{.mark}** the lens
of **[[techno-Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When the idea of
techno-Orientalism first appeared in David Morley and Kevin Robins's
analysis of why Japan occupied such a threatening position in Western
imagination in the late 1980s, **[techno-Orientalism
offer]{.underline}**ed **[a framework [to make sense of]{.mark} the
technologically imbued [racist]{.mark}
[stereotypes]{.mark}]{.underline}** of Japan/the Japanese that were
emerging with**[[in the context of Western fears and anxieties]{.mark}
around Japan's ascendancy as a technological global
power]{.underline}**. They proposed that **[if technological advancement
has been crucial to Western civilizational progress, then [Japan's
tech]{.mark}nological [superiority over the West]{.mark} also [signals a
critical challenge to Western heg]{.mark}emony,
[including]{.mark}]{.underline}** its **[cultural [authority to control
representations of the West and its "others."]{.mark}]{.underline}**
They claimed that the shifting balance in global power---**[the West's
[loss]{.mark} [of tech]{.mark}nological
[preeminence]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[has induced an identity
crisis]{.mark} in the West]{.underline}**. In response,
**[[techno-Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in which "\[idioms of
technology\] **[[become structured in]{.underline}]{.mark}**to **[the
discourse of [Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**," is produced in large
part to discipline Japan and its rise to techno-economic power.12 **[The
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, for
instance, **[[externalized its anxiety into xenophobic
projections]{.mark} of Japan]{.underline}** as a "culture that is cold,
impersonal, and machine-like" **[[in which]{.underline}]{.mark}** its
**[[people are "sub-human" and "unfeeling
aliens."]{.underline}]{.mark}**13 **[Techno-Orientalism]{.underline}**,
born from the "Japan Panic," **[was effectively consolidated through and
around political-economic concerns [that frame]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Japanese and, by extension, **[[Asian techno-capitalist progress as
dangerous and dystopian]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Extending Edward Said's
concept of Orientalism,14 **[[techno-Orientalism marks a geo-historical
shift where]{.mark} [the West no longer has control over the terms that
define the East]{.mark}---the "Orient"---[as weak, inferior, and
subordinate]{.mark} to the West]{.underline}**. It marks a shift not
only in political-economic power but also in cultural authority.
**[Techno-Orientalism]{.underline}**, then, **[is]{.underline}** the
**[expressive]{.underline}** vehicle (cultural productions and visual
representations) **[[by which Western and Eastern nations
articulate]{.mark} their [fears]{.mark}, desires, [and anxieties]{.mark}
that are [produced in]{.mark} their [competitive struggle to gain
tech]{.mark}nological [heg]{.mark}emony through economic trade and
scientific innovation]{.underline}**.15 Analogous to Japan's position in
the late 1980s, **[China currently figures in]{.underline}**to **[the
techno-Orientalist imaginary as a powerful competitor in mass
production, a global financial giant, and an aggressive investor in
technological, infrastructural, and scientific
developments]{.underline}**. At the same time, the increasing purchasing
power of **[[China provokes American fear]{.mark} of a future global
market that is economically driven by Chinese consumptive desires and
practices]{.underline}**. It is **[this duality]{.underline}**---the
domination of both production and consumption across different sectors
of the techno-capitalist global economy---that **[[undergirds American
anxieties of a sinicized future]{.underline}]{.mark}**.16 Further
**[[amplifying]{.mark} these [anxieties]{.mark}]{.underline}** around
Chinese techno-economic domination **[[is]{.mark} our imagination of
China]{.underline}**/the Chinese **[as the ultimate [yellow
peril]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[whose state ideology is oppositional
to]{.underline}** that of **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates and **[whose]{.underline}** unmatched
population size combined with its **[economic expansion and
tech]{.underline}**nological **[advancements]{.underline}** may actually
**[pose]{.underline}** a real **[challenge to U.S.]{.underline}** global

Nevertheless, at the precise moment that China was at her most
vulnerable, in the late-to-early nineteenth century, **[this is when we
see rise of the "yellow peril" discourse, broadly aimed at the East but
attaching to China in particular, without outcomes like the Chinese
Exclusion Acts in the United States and the growing popularity of "super
villains" like Fu Manchu]{.underline}** \[19, 47, 72\], that would
evolve into the Red Scares during the Cold War, exemplified in popular
media like The Manchurian Candidate (1962) and many others. **[This is
to say that at various points in time there have been profound [Western
apprehensions about Chinese]{.mark} intelligence and [capacity,
and]{.mark} these have correlated with [efforts to dominate China as a
perceived]{.mark} cultural, ideological and often [racial
inferior]{.mark}]{.underline}**. T**[his pattern seems to be
[repeat]{.mark}ing [itself today]{.mark}. [As China]{.mark} has [emerged
as]{.mark} a [technological society]{.mark}, the general [Western fear
of tech]{.mark}nology or technophobia has [developed as]{.mark} a
[distinct Sino(techno)phobia]{.mark}, [along with fears]{.mark} the [CPC
is using Chinese tech]{.mark}nology [in]{.mark} a [bid for global
domination. We have even some]{.mark} popular [conspiracies from]{.mark}
leading [American officials promoting]{.mark} the [idea that COVID-19
was]{.mark} [engineered]{.mark} in a laboratory [as part of a]{.mark}
larger [plot to help China]{.mark} ascend over its competitors, the US
most especially.]{.underline}** As noted above, there are three themes
that broadly correspond with three periodizations of Orientalism that
can be used to described how the West in various ways has perceived
China. But to be clear, as Vukovich reminds (per private communication),
these three themes are all based on the same underlying logic and
motivations. Similarly, I am reminded of an apt comment made by Fredric
Jameson of 'heads in the clouds of capitalism of the 21st century, but
our feet grounded in the same logic and basic practices of capitalist of
the 19th century' (\[30\] 72). The first theme, what we can call the
classical Orientalism described by Said, dominated until the end of the
Mao era and the Beginning of Reform and Opening Up (\[75\] 23). This
theme and period saw China as being culturally, socially and politically
backward, justifying colonialism and other forms of aggression. The
second period, which I describe using Vukovich's work, is Sinological
Orientalism, where China is seen as increasingly adhering whether it
likes it or not to universal values and standards established by the
West a la "the end of history" (Ibid. 1, passim). In this context we see
Western scholars and policymakers contesting Chinese exceptionalism,
still asserting a type of Western paternalism and superiority, and
concluding that China's party-state system will eventually collapse
(i.e., the "collapse thesis") or reform itself into a liberal democracy
within a liberal capitalist world order. **[Sinological Orientalism was
dominant more or less until mounting American disappointments crossed
paths with China's exceptional rise.]{.underline}** This can be dated
with contrasts over a twenty year period, with extraordinary examples
occurring in three periods: 2001: China joins the World Trade
Organization; the US suffers 9/11 an initiates the Global War on
Terror). 2008: China has a triumphant propaganda achievement hosting the
Beijing Olympics; American economic governance failures spark the Global
Financial Crisis. 2021: China claims victory over extreme poverty and
establishes a xiaokang/"moderately prosperous society," and effectively
contains COVID-19; the US suffers high morbidity and mortality,
experiences high inflation and a host of social ills, including intense
polarization and what some describe as a coup attempt instigated by
then-President Donald Trump against Congress with the Capitol Attack on
January 6, and along the way, executes a disastrous retreat from
Afghanistan). **[While [Trump]{.mark} had [repeatedly invoked China in
negative ways]{.mark} during his campaign for the presidency in 2016, to
the point of using dog whistle tactics, a number of factors pushed him
to a more extreme position after he took office. First, CIA-associated
intelligence failures and the increasingly discredited collapse thesis
was replaced by the Pentagon-supported "threat thesis," which in turn
was likely reinforced by the high number of generals Trump appointed to
key positions in his Administration.]{.underline}** By 2017, Xi's
anti-corruption campaign had restored a measure of public trust and
disciplined the Party and state, and likewise produced a number of
reforms that could be characterized as significant improvements to
governance. This was capped with the 19th Party Congress, when term
limits on Xi's leadership position were suspended, completing his
consolidation of power. **[[China]{.mark} had also [launched]{.mark} a
number of national "[made in China" development campaigns]{.mark}, while
Chinese [firms like Huawei were gaining global market share in
areas]{.mark} previously dominated by Western firms[, or at]{.mark}
[least]{.mark} those [considered]{.mark} the US considered less
[dangerous to]{.mark} its [hegemony]{.mark} (e.g., Japanese, South
Korean, Taiwanese, etc.). [These developments intersect]{.mark}ed
[with]{.mark} growing American concerns with the role of technology
generally, with mounting distrust of major firms like Facebook, Google,
Apple and others, and even [greater distrust for Chinese firms]{.mark}
like Huawei, Tencent, TikTok and so on. [Trump's]{.mark} "Make America
Great Again" ([MAGA) campaign drew]{.mark} substantial [inspiration
from]{.mark} Ronald [Reagan's rhetoric against the Soviet Union]{.mark}
in the 1980s, and altogether, [these developments saw]{.mark} the
[Trump]{.mark} Administration [but American]{.mark} society more broadly
[agreeing that China was a threat]{.mark}, one that needed to be
countered in various ways. A large part of this rhetoric asserted that
China had gained her achievements at America's expense, with allegations
of state and corporate espionage explaining China's technological
capacity, but also helped along by American multinational firms that
accommodated China for access to the Chinese market.]{.underline}** All
of this this helped normalize Trump's trade war against China, to the
extent that it has still not been reversed by his Democratic successor
Joe Biden. In fact, it likewise intersected with rhetoric accusing China
of genocide and slavery in Xinjiang, alleged by many, including the
State Departments of both administrations. **[Various [efforts to block
Chinese technology]{.mark} at home and abroad, to create chokepoints in
Chinese production, to encourage boycotts [were pursued]{.mark}. As
these developments peaked in 2020 under the duress of failed American
efforts to contain COVID-19, the US saw spikes in anti-Chinese
sentiments and racist attacks on people of Asian descent.]{.underline}**
With these points in mind, we can theorize that Sinological Orientalism
was increasingly overwhelmed by Digital Orientalism, roughly dated from
2017, and continues to the present. Within this new theme/period there
are three key features that present in somewhat contradictory but
nevertheless explicable ways. **[First is the inversion the key ideas of
Sinological Orientalism, insomuch as [China is now viewed as]{.mark} not
becoming like the US but as [a growing threat]{.mark}, particularly [as
China's technological capacity]{.mark} and that of the CPC [are]{.mark}
viewed as [advancing]{.mark} hand-in-hand \[62\]. Some, like former US
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence, publicly
claimed that China was ideologically committed to seeking a global
communist order and hinted at a new Cold War \[5, 60, 61\]. In short,
[many no longer saw China and]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the
[path of]{.mark} political or economic [convergence]{.mark}, but the
complete opposite. This [rhetoric did not change]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
the arrival of a [new US]{.mark} presidential
[administration]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Second, however, is that despite
this apparent divergence, and despite efforts in Washington and Beijing
to emphasize cultural and political differences, there were in fact
profound convergences underway. **[China like the West was being
radically transformed by digital culture and technology as a whole, with
similar positive and negative experiences. As many have discussed
elsewhere, China's capacity to spy on competitors and compete militarily
advanced, (though still shy of American abilities and practices by most
estimates). Perhaps more pervasive and significant despite American
alarmism about China's improved intelligence and military capabilities:
as market reforms and culture became increasingly advanced and dominant
from the 1990s onward, incredible generation gaps emerged in which young
Chinese arguably had more in common with their Western peers than their
own parents.]{.underline}** These developments worried Beijing to no
end, with deep suspicions directed against what it saw as the malign
influences of foreign soft power. In fact, while the government salutes
young people as the most fortunate in Chinese history, ample data from
Chinese government sources suggest that Chinese youths have been in a
state of increasing crises, with significant increases in
youth-associated drug and alcohol abuse, crime, suicides, sexual abuse,
mental illness, social discontent, spiraling divorce rates, screen-brain
interfacing and so on, again, **[quite similar to their peers in the
West]{.underline}** \[42\]. **[Third is that many of these ills have
meet new policy responses in China that arguably demonstrate not only an
increased capacity for governance as an advanced technological society,
they also appear to contrast with accelerating declines of the same in
the West, especially the United States.]{.underline}** This is apparent
in the last couple of years, where China's dynamic zero-covid policies
demonstrate a new plateau in its development as a technological society,
while breakdowns and even regression seem more apparent in America. In
the US, for example, there have been profound economic and social
disruptions associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, with
deaths exceeding a million. In contrast, China was the first and by some
accounts the only country to contain the virus, with deaths c. 5000 over
the same time period. China was also the first to reverse contractions
and return to positive economic growth in 2020, becoming the top global
destination for inbound foreign direct investment that same year (Xinhua
\[69\]). Furthermore, once again it proved its position as the world's
leading industrial system \[57\], providing critical supplies to meet
surging global demand (e.g., personal protection equipment, vaccine
production, computer products needed as students around the world
shifted to online courses, etc.) as other countries struggled to meet
basic needs \[4\]. In the US, in addition the high morbidity and
mortality rates, many if not most children lost at least year of
effective schooling, with declining standardized exam results and
graduation rates in states painting a bleak picture \[22, 54\],
especially among low-income and minority students who were more
vulnerable from the start (who didn't have access to computers or
internet services for taking classes online, or who dropped or sold
these resources to buy food, and who often lacked guardians capable of
supervising their studies (see, for example, \[1, 16, 49\]). These
reverses have to be placed in a broader context, namely, the national
policy initiatives that started with national legislation known as "No
Child Left Behind" (2001) and continued with subsequent reforms that
aimed to dramatically improve STEM education to better compete with
students from China and India---reforms that had thus far failed to
achieve desired results and that are now encountering systemic reversals
associated with the pandemic. To make matters worse, the US during the
pandemic saw marked increases in sexual abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,
depression, suicide, crime and hunger among children. It also saw major
upticks in screen times as children were forced online, dependent on
technologies sans effective data privacy protections, and susceptible to
various forms of online exploitation. Meanwhile, US technology firms
reaped record profits and pushed back against nascent attempts to
regulate them (meanwhile, China disciplined major Chinese tech
platforms, online gaming targeting children, and after school programs
that were widely recognized as having pushed children to breaking
points). Meanwhile, the US saw the rise of a growing anti-science and
anti-vaccine culture among Americans, further undercutting both outbreak
responses and rational thinking. In some states, new laws required
teaching the Biblical account of creation alongside the Big Bang Theory
in public school science classes. Fake news became the norm, eroding
trust in government and well-established news sources. The Federal
Reserve increased the money supply by 20% to help cover the crisis,
fueling major increases in inflation, and both the Trump and Biden
administrations provided massive outlays of public assistance with
trillions in subsidies and cash payments. The American economy faltered
and the fate of the US dollar as the supranational currency diminished.
As American society floundered, it turned inward against itself through
polarization and increasing crime and violence, and likewise turned
against countries it considered competitors who were faring better,
China above all. While the US failed to contain the outbreak, China
managed to do so through effective lockdowns and subsequent controls
that minimized social and economic disruption. To be sure, some areas
faced significant disruptions, e.g., Shanghai, but the argument that
this minimized disruptions elsewhere likely has merit. But to be clear,
there has not yet been an honest appraisal of China's dynamic zero-covid
policies. China likely had little choice otherwise: had it not taken
this approach, we might be looking at six million or more dead in China.
Given the density in Chinese cities, we likely would have seen collapsed
health care systems and disrupted economic production, schools closed,
children suffering, and so on. This would have created tremendous
amounts of social instability among a people and system with little
tolerance for chaos. **[At the same time, keeping COVID-19 under control
limited the possibility of new mutations. It ensured the Chinese economy
could provide vital supplies for global markets. China sped the
development of new technologies and organizational capacities to limit
the disease and preserve social well-being and progress. These included:
mobilizing, expanding, reinforcing and better linking national and local
health and public health systems, down to local police bureaus and
neighborhood committees]{.underline}** (juweihui); establishing clear
operational values and objectives; speeding development and
dissemination of vaccines (86% with two doses nationally as of January
2022, according to the National Health Commission, see: \[25\]);
requiring masking, social distancing and when necessary, lockdowns (in
some cases individual buildings, city districts and whole cities);
building emergency overflow hospitals in outbreak areas (fangcang
yiyuan); requiring individual temperature scans for entering public
transportation and large public venues, including shopping malls;
establishing free testing on demand with same day results; enabling
individual tracking of movement for past 14 days by mobile phone number
(xingcheng ma); and linking all of these efforts, including public
guidance about outbreaks and control efforts, vaccine and test records,
to smart device apps based in various digital platforms that facilitate
contact tracing, and that produce codes that allow or restrict
individuals from traveling or entering public buildings (jiankang ma),
and when necessary, signaling and helping enforce self-isolation or
stronger forms of quarantine (in fact, this is simply a fast moving
outgrowth of the public and popular embrace of e-government in China,
see \[38\]). **[Meanwhile, many [Western countries]{.mark}
[wag]{.mark}ged [their fingers, arguing]{.mark} their [principles
of]{.mark} individual [freedom were more sacred than effective
containment]{.mark} through social controls.]{.underline}** These calls
only intensified with lockdowns in Jilin and Shanghai in 2022, and
understandably so. That said, the general perception among many
Sinologists and international disease specialists was that the lockdowns
were technically impossible to execute, especially in Shanghai, that the
people would rise up and stop them, that it was impossible to contain
and control the Omicron variant anyway, and even, that it was
unnecessary to do so, despite the fact that Omicron killed more in the
US than Delta, and killed scores in Hong Kong. In fact, while the
initial lockdown of Shanghai was fractious, while there was
inconsistency ensuring essential supplies were met reliably and fairly,
while there were excesses that required adjustment and sporadic cases of
local officials guilty of abuse or negligence, a city of 25 million was
locked down (historically unprecedented), many of the initial missteps
of the lockdown resolved, and the outbreak contained with associated
deaths minimized. As much of the rest of the world is moving to a model
of endemicity, despite the US predicting up to a 100 million new
infections in America alone in late 2022, China is building what some
describe as a 48-hour or 72-hour testing regime and building on local
and national health codes that connect individual test results with
locations and movements \[31\]. For some critics this evokes a dystopian
nightmare, and others might fairly criticize it as emphasizing the sort
of techno-positivism not uncommon to Marxist-Leninist systems, the sort
that have variously produced both great leaps forward and backward. Time
will tell whether China's pandemic control policies served the nation
well, but however they are assessed, we shouldn't be distracted from the
key point: China did this because it believed it must, because a
critical mass of its people expected the government to control and fight
the disease, and most importantly that same mass helped make it happen.
In short, dynamic zero-covid, including the lockdowns, happened in China
because they could, because China as a technological society could,
whereas most Western countries lacked the ability or the will to do so
at all. **[Thus, when we look others hoping for silver bullets from what
many perceive as an insufficiently regulated and untrusted
pharmaceutical industry, when we see a breakdown in trust in government
and even public health agencies like the US Centers for Disease Control
that were once considered the gold standard the world over, what we also
see are untrusted techniques trying to compensate for the pronounced
inadequacy of the US to function effectively or competitively as a
technological society. And while the US by some accounts still holds an
edge over China in terms of intellectual property and technology stocks,
[it seems]{.mark} increasingly [apparent that China has
surpassed]{.mark} the [US as a technological society]{.mark}, and
likewise, shortened the time when it will exceed the US on other fronts
as well.]{.underline}** It should be noted that among a raft of proposed
solutions**[, [US policymakers]{.mark} have advanced the idea of
national industrial policy that resorts not to free market principles
but [aim]{.mark}s [to]{.mark} [compete with China]{.mark}]{.underline}**
using tactics more familiar to a planned economy. These efforts have not
yet matured and there is good reason to suspect they never will, even if
supporting legislation is signed into law. Additionally, we should note
that in 2008 and again with the pandemic, **[the [US has resorted to
extraordinary]{.mark} market [interventions]{.mark} with both monetary
and fiscal policies, far outstripping the more narrow and disciplined
scope of China's regime of macro-controls, which the US excoriates
despite their relative efficacy.]{.underline}** It's difficult to
categorize these points as either convergences or divergences, as they
contain elements of both. **[But it shouldn't surprise us if [Digital
Orientalism evolves as]{.mark} the [US learning from]{.mark} and copying
[China as it seeks solutions]{.mark} to its multitude of deeply
entrenched problems, [but rationalizing this politically as an
existential need to compete with China]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

There has long been a **[complicated coexistence between Western fears
of China and Western senses of cultural and technological
superiority.]{.underline}** As D.E. Mungello notes, **[when Europeans
traveled to China to visit the Ming court in the sixteenth century, the
technical and cultural advances observed by these visitors were so
unsettling that it led some to classify the Chinese as being racially
"white."]{.underline}** It was only later, **[when the Qing Dynasty was

"After Yang" follows a long tradition of science-fiction narratives that
fall under the category of **["[techno-Orientalism]{.mark}," [in which
the future is often figured as Asian, and Asians are often figured as

techno-Orientalist worlds, however, have since become a template for
speculations about the future---any future. There are techno-Orientalist

Machina"---you get the idea. In these films, **[an [ambient dread about
Asian influence gets expressed]{.mark}]{.underline}** through an
aesthetic sensibility **[rather than by representing or centering actual
Asian characters.]{.underline}**

**[As [with]{.mark} Edward [Said's foundational theory of
Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in which **[[the Eastern Other is
framed]{.mark} as peripheral to the rich humanism of the
Western]{.underline}** subject**[, [techno-Orientalism figures Asians as
distant, unrelatable, and inscrutable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Whereas
Saidian Orientalism understood the Eastern Other as fundamentally
backward and uncivilized, however, **[[techno-Orientalism presents an
upgraded vision of the Asian as threateningly futuristic and
advanced]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In both iterations, **[[the Other is a
robot]{.underline}]{.mark}**---or at least robotic---**[because [Western
speculations about an Asianized future still rely on stereotypes]{.mark}
of Asians as passive, unfeeling, and good at math.]{.underline}**

Earlier **[instances of techno-Orientalism largely fixated on Japan's
technological advancements,]{.underline}** but the **[[twenty-first
century has progressively shifted toward "rising
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**." (Techno-Orientalism might be traced as
far back as the British author Sax Rohmer's infamous evil scientist, Dr.
Fu Manchu, who plots to build up Chinese power by kidnapping European
engineers.) As scholars David S. Roh, Betsy Huang, and Greta A. Niu
write, in "Techno-Orientalism: Imagining Asia in Speculative Fiction,
History, and Media," "Japan creates technology, but China is the
technology." In other words, **[if [Japan was once the innovator, then
China is now the relentless manufacturer.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Digital Orientalism explains the acceleration of fears of China's rise and if it continues to dominate our epistemological thought then it could have apocalyptic consequences-surveillance states and justification of suppression

We introduce the concept of "**[[digital
orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**" to help **[[explain what is really
at stake in controversies over China's rapid
digitalisation.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In a special issue of the Journal of Chinese Political Science, we
write: "The increasingly apparent and uncomfortable development that
many instinctively deny is that **[[one of the key elements
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Sinological]{.mark}
**[[orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the notion **[that [China
would]{.mark} [become]{.mark} more like [the
West]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[has [become increasingly
true,]{.mark}]{.underline}** with the caveat that **[the
[West]{.mark}]{.underline}**, likewise through the same types of
technology, **[has [become]{.mark} increasingly [like
China]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

Anxieties have resurfaced in two key areas. First, **[[worries about the
"technological society" and its threat to values and
practices]{.underline}]{.mark}** considered culturally intrinsic **[[are
key concerns]{.mark} in both China and the West.]{.underline}**

These **[[fears have accelerated]{.mark} in the West with]{.underline}**
the unprecedented **[[rise]{.mark} [of]{.mark} platform
[companies]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- technology-enabled businesses that
create value by facilitating exchanges between two or more
interdependent groups -- **[[and state
surveillance]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

But **[with the [emergence of a Chinese tech state]{.mark} and
mushrooming Chinese platform companies]{.underline}**, and with China
drawing even with and perhaps overtaking the West in some technology
fields, these **[[fears have been reinforced.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Huawei and the double standards of the West

Second, **[[China's technological leapfrogging has produced
"Sinotechnophobia]{.underline}]{.mark}**". The **[[fear]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [Chinese]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}** has
diminished Western fears of Western tech in a manner that **[[recalls
the cold wa]{.mark}r]{.underline}**'s arms race ("we're bad, but they're
worse").

But **[[Sinotechnophobia could have apocalyptic
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**, either through self-destruction or
mutual destruction, on par with those described by Jairus Victor Grove
in Savage Ecology: War and Geopolitics at the End of the World**[[:
imagine unrestricted surveillance states justifying self-suppression in
the name of bolstering security against each
other]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with competing artificial intelligence
running algorithms that accelerate poor decision-making.

What **[[digital orientalism masks is the extent to which China
experiences many of the same problems and practices found in democratic
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Surveillance capitalism works
similarly everywhere and some misuse of AI and big data by US agencies
is on par with China and sometimes worse.

This convergence also causes discomfort in Beijing, which often trumpets
China's differences while struggling to discipline the '90s and 2000s
generations, which, having grown up in a market society with extremely
high levels of personal technology usage, have more in common with
American millennials than with their own parents.

How AI and quantum computing add to danger of US-China conflict

Whatever **[threats]{.underline}** Huawei poses for democratic politics,
it **[[distracts us from those posed]{.mark} [already by Western tech
giants]{.mark}]{.underline}** and algorithmic governance through an
almost complete erosion of privacy, **[[omnipresent
surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}** and valid worries that elections can
be hacked by foreign powers or purchased via social marketing using
targeted fake news.

In the Journal of Democracy, Larry Diamond describes [this]{.mark}
[as]{.mark} the "**[road to digital unfreedom"]{.underline}** and
"**[[postmodern]{.mark} [totalitarianism]{.mark}]{.underline}**". We add
that a self-defeating **[["us versus them" logic is merely picking your
poison.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Instead of focusing on the drawbacks of an individual company or
technology, we should acknowledge the broader reality: **[intensifying
global homogenisation, cyberwar, the dominance of platform companies,
inescapable surveillance capitalism, the impossibility of data privacy,
the normalisation of stealth mass-manipulation and nudging campaigns,
the experience of post-truth rationalities and the reduction of
individuals to constantly accessible screen-brain
interfacing.]{.underline}**

**[[Liberal societies don't need Chinese tech]{.mark} [to
destroy]{.mark} not just democratic processes but the very conditions of
democratic life and politics.]{.underline}** Yet, **[[by creating a
"dangerous other]{.underline}]{.mark}**" and foregrounding misleading
binaries, **[[digital orientalism keeps us from deliberating
socio-technical futures and the good society that we should
envision.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Only by recognising]{.mark} the convergence of [authoritarian
digitalisation]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [China, Europe and the US]{.mark}
[can we unchain our]{.mark} [imaginative]{.mark} [powers]{.mark} [as
digital citizens]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [find]{.mark} [a]{.mark} better
[way]{.mark} [forward]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Digital Orientalism the is independent cause towards the fear that drives the US and its Allies to harsh policies towards China

Gregory **Moore 22**\[Gregory Moore, Professor of Global Studies and
Politics at Colorado Christian University, \"Huawei, Cyber-Sovereignty

We [**[define digital orientalism]{.underline}** **[as]{.underline}**
**[re/inscribing]{.underline}**]{.mark} a
pseudo-**[[otherness]{.underline}]{.mark}**, typically **[[resorting to
tropes first employed during classical]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[Said\],
**[[Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[and Sinological [forms of
orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[Vukovich\], but now **[[used when
social, cultural, economic and even political
differences]{.underline}]{.mark}** have [**[increasingly]{.underline}**
**[narrowed]{.underline}**]{.mark} through
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** increasing [**[tilt]{.underline}**
**[towards]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}** **[global technological
society]{.underline}**]{.mark} in ways that are
**[[undermining]{.underline}]{.mark}** older **[national and cultural
narratives and [associated hegemonies]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[17, p.
1\].

**[[Said's orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** construct \[26\] is an
important contribution to the study of colonialism, post-colonial
thought, international relations and sociology. There is no reason to
challenge it here. It's **[[application to the digital realm]{.mark}
is]{.underline}** an interesting and
**[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}** one. The premise of the editors of
this special issue is that **[the West expected China to evolve into a
liberal democracy]{.underline}**, but that this has not happened, and
moreover this (from the **[[West's perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}**
"fundamentally **[[illegitimate]{.underline}]{.mark}**")
**[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[has]{.underline}]{.mark}** been
able to **[[increasingly]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[compete]{.mark}
[head to head with the]{.mark} US and the [West]{.mark} [in military,
political, economic and technological terms]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and
this has **[[created deep fear]{.mark} [among]{.mark}
[Western]{.mark}/democratic [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Fear is
a key part of this orientalist narrative]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
argument is that **[[it is fear of this digital, political and cultural
other]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[that drives]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
tough US, Australian, British (for example) **[[policy toward
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and drives a harsh stand toward Huawei. To
set this up in a cause and effect framework, then **[[digital
orientalism is the independent variable that causes fear in the US and
others towards China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that **[[brings
about]{.underline}]{.mark}** the dependent variable, **[[harsh policies
toward China]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Huawei specifically. What this
would mean is that **[[other factors would not
explain]{.underline}]{.mark}** the dependent variable, the harsh
US/Western policy toward Huawei. The question we will pose here is, is
this correct?

#### **The 1ac's positing of China as an emerging threat through technological development follows orientalist discourses that constantly racialize and dehumanize Asian peoples**

**Mahoney 6/14**[(Josef Gregory Mahoney, 6-14-2022, \"China's Rise as an

There has long been a **[complicated coexistence between Western fears
of China and Western senses of cultural and technological
superiority]{.underline}**. As D.E. Mungello notes, when Europeans
traveled to China to visit the Ming court in the sixteenth century, the
**[technical and cultural advances]{.underline}** observed by these
visitors were so unsettling that it **[led some to classify the Chinese
as being racially "white."]{.underline}** It was only later,
**[when]{.underline}** the **[Qing Dynasty was in decline]{.underline}**
and Europe was on the rise that **[[Orientalism 'colored'
Chinese]{.mark} both yellow and scientifically
[inferior]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[52, 53\]. Others also have argued
that **[[initial Western tech development]{.mark} in the early modern
period were in part [inspired by Chinese accomplishments and fears of
the same]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[24\]. Nevertheless, **[at the precise
moment that China was at her most vulnerable]{.underline}**, in the
late-to-early nineteenth century, **[this is when we see [rise
of]{.mark} the ["yellow peril" discourse]{.mark},]{.underline}** broadly
aimed at the East but attaching to China in particular, without outcomes
like the **[Chinese Exclusion Acts]{.underline}** in the United States
and the **[[growing]{.mark} popularity of "[super
villains]{.mark}"]{.underline}** like Fu Manchu \[19, 47, 72\], that
would **[evolve into the Red Scares during the Cold War,]{.underline}**
exemplified in popular media like The Manchurian Candidate (1962) and
many others. This is to say that at various points in time **[there have
been [profound Western]{.mark} [apprehensions]{.mark} about Chinese
intelligence and capacity, and these have [correlated with efforts to
dominate China]{.mark} as a perceived cultural, ideological and often
racial inferior.]{.underline}** This pattern seems to be repeating
itself today. **[[As China]{.mark} has [emerged]{.mark} as a
technological society, the [general Western fear of tech]{.mark}nology
or technophobia has [developed as]{.mark} a distinct
[Sino(techno)phobia]{.mark}, along with [fears]{.mark} the CPC is using
[Chinese tech]{.mark}nology in a bid for global [domination]{.mark}. We
have even some popular conspiracies from leading American officials
promoting the idea that COVID-19 was engineered in a laboratory as part
of a larger plot to help China ascend over its competitors, the US most
especially.]{.underline}** As noted above, there are **[three themes
that broadly correspond with three periodizations of
[Orientalism]{.mark} that can be used to [described how the West]{.mark}
in various ways has [perceived China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But to be
clear, as Vukovich reminds (per private communication), these three
themes are all based on the same underlying logic and motivations.
Similarly, I am reminded of an apt comment made by Fredric Jameson of
'heads in the clouds of capitalism of the 21st century, but our feet
grounded in the same logic and basic practices of capitalist of the 19th
century' (\[30\] 72). The first theme, what we can call the **[classical
[Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** described by Said, **[dominated
until the end of the Mao era and the Beginning of Reform and Opening
Up]{.underline}** (\[75\] 23). This theme and period **[[saw China
as]{.mark} being culturally, socially and politically [backward,
justifying colonialism and]{.mark} other forms of
[aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The second period, which I describe
using Vukovich's work, is **[Sinological Orientalism, where China is
seen as increasingly adhering whether it likes it or not to universal
values and standards established by the West a la "the end of
history"]{.underline}** (Ibid. 1, passim). In this context we see
**[[Western]{.mark} scholars and [policymakers contesting Chinese
exceptionalism]{.mark}, still [asserting]{.mark} a type of
[Western]{.mark} paternalism and [superiority,]{.mark} and concluding
that China's party-state system will eventually collapse]{.underline}**
(i.e., the "collapse thesis") **[or reform itself into a liberal
democracy within a liberal capitalist world order.]{.underline}**
Sinological Orientalism was dominant more or less until mounting
American disappointments crossed paths with China's exceptional rise.
This can be dated with contrasts over a twenty year period, with
extraordinary examples occurring in three periods: 2001: China joins the
World Trade Organization; the US suffers 9/11 an initiates the Global
War on Terror). 2008: China has a triumphant propaganda achievement
hosting the Beijing Olympics; American economic governance failures
spark the Global Financial Crisis. 2021: China claims victory over
extreme poverty and establishes a xiaokang/"moderately prosperous
society," and effectively contains COVID-19; the US suffers high
morbidity and mortality, experiences high inflation and a host of social
ills, including intense polarization and what some describe as a coup
attempt instigated by then-President Donald Trump against Congress with
the Capitol Attack on January 6, and along the way, executes a
disastrous retreat from Afghanistan). While Trump had repeatedly invoked
China in negative ways during his campaign for the presidency in 2016,
to the point of using dog whistle tactics, a number of factors pushed
him to a more extreme position after he took office. First,
CIA-associated intelligence failures and the increasingly discredited
collapse thesis was replaced by the Pentagon-supported "threat thesis,"
which in turn was likely reinforced by the high number of generals Trump
appointed to key positions in his Administration. By 2017, Xi's
anti-corruption campaign had restored a measure of public trust and
disciplined the Party and state, and likewise produced a number of
reforms that could be characterized as significant improvements to
governance. This was capped with the 19th Party Congress, when term
limits on Xi's leadership position were suspended, completing his
consolidation of power. China had also launched a number of national
"made in China" development campaigns, while Chinese firms like Huawei
were gaining global market share in areas previously dominated by
Western firms, or at least those considered the US considered less
dangerous to its hegemony (e.g., Japanese, South Korean, Taiwanese,
etc.). These developments intersected with growing American concerns
with the role of technology generally, with mounting distrust of major
firms like Facebook, Google, Apple and others, and even greater distrust
for Chinese firms like Huawei, Tencent, TikTok and so on. Trump's "Make
America Great Again" (**[[MAGA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) campaign
**[drew]{.underline}** substantial **[inspiration from Ronald Reagan's
rhetoric against the Soviet Union]{.underline}** in the 1980s, and
altogether, these developments saw the Trump Administration but
**[American society more broadly agreeing that China was a threat, one
that needed to be countered]{.underline}** in various ways. A large part
of **[this [rhetoric asserted that China]{.mark} [had gained]{.mark} her
[achievements at America's expense]{.mark}, with allegations of state
and corporate espionage explaining China's technological capacity, but
also helped along by American multinational firms that accommodated
China for access to the Chinese market]{.underline}**. All of this this
helped normalize Trump's trade war against China, to the extent that it
has still not been reversed by his Democratic successor Joe Biden. In
fact, it likewise intersected with rhetoric accusing China of genocide
and slavery in Xinjiang, alleged by many, including the State
Departments of both administrations. **[Various [efforts to block
Chinese tech]{.mark}nology at home and abroad, to [create
chokepoints]{.mark} in Chinese production, to encourage boycotts were
pursued. As these developments peaked in 2020 [under]{.mark} the duress
of failed American efforts to contain [COVID]{.mark}-19, the [US saw
spikes in]{.mark} anti-Chinese sentiments and [racist attacks on people
of Asian descent]{.mark}.]{.underline}** With these points in mind, we
can theorize that **[Sinological Orientalism]{.underline}** was
**[increasingly overwhelmed by [Digital
Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, roughly dated from 2017, and
continues to the present. Within this new theme/period there are
**[three key features that present in somewhat contradictory but
nevertheless explicable ways]{.underline}**. First is the inversion the
key ideas of Sinological Orientalism, insomuch as **[China is now viewed
as not becoming like the US but as a growing threat, particularly as
China's technological capacity and that of the CPC are viewed as
advancing hand-in-hand]{.underline}** \[62\]. Some, like former US
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence, publicly
claimed that China was ideologically committed to seeking a global
communist order and hinted at a new Cold War \[5, 60, 61\]. In short,
**[many no longer saw China and the US on the path of political or
economic convergence, but the complete opposite. This rhetoric did not
change with the arrival of a new US presidential
administration.]{.underline}**

### Cyber

#### Cybersecurity is a [strategic framing of racialization]{.underline} rooted in [techno-Orientalist anxieties]{.underline} that [weaponize]{.underline} racialized fears of the dangers to liberalism and democracy to [legitimize]{.underline} a hegemonic state that [paints Asians]{.underline} in the specter of a [techno-viral threat]{.underline}

**Siu and Chun 20** (Lok Siu and Claire Chun \| "Yellow Peril and
Techno-orientalism in the Time of Covid-19: Racialized Contagion,

The American media coverage of Wuhan's shutdown and the Chinese state's
deployment of surveillance technology to contain the virus through
contact tracing and quarantine enforcement measures offered the American
public a preview of the PRC government at work. Enfolded in these
stories are both the underlying admiration and fear around the Chinese
state's efficiency and efficacy in using technology for population
control. Similarly, the same kind of **[[admiration and fear are evident
in American perceptions of China]{.mark}'s explosive economic
development and global reach]{.underline}** since the 1990s. And
arguably, **[these]{.underline}** same **[sentiments re-emerge [when we
read about]{.mark}]{.underline}** the seemingly rapid success of
**[Huawei]{.underline}** Technologies, which has become the world's
largest telecommunications technology company, overtaking Western
companies that were once household names, like Eriksson, Nokia, and
Motorola. The exemplary case of **[Huawei brings our discussion of
[yellow peril in]{.mark}to the explicit terrain of [techno-Orientalism
where the idea of the Chinese techno-virus---emerging at the nexus of
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology, **[international trade, [and
cyber-security]{.mark}]{.underline}**---is **[[articulated through the
racialized fear of Chinese]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nological
**[[domination]{.underline}]{.mark}** achieved purportedly by stealing
trade secrets, engaging unfair trade practices, and enabling Chinese
state surveillance. What the case of Huawei illustrates is the extension
of the "Chinese virus" trope that already exists in the domains of
public health (as biological pathogen) and research institutions
(scientist-spy) into the realm of everyday consumer technologies. Our
point in discussing Huawei is not to defend it or to judge its
activities. Rather, **[we want to call attention to [the increasing
significance of media/communications tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nologies
**[[as sites of interstate techno-economic-security]{.mark}
[struggles]{.mark}]{.underline}** (in addition to already existing
corporate surveillance). Toward that end, the Huawei example clearly
shows the entwined issues and **[discourses of
tech]{.underline}**nology, **[international trade, and
[cybersecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, all of which **[are [filtered
through]{.mark} and constitutive of [the racializing techniques
of]{.mark} the "[Chinese virus]{.mark}."]{.underline}** Between January
2019 and February 2020, the **[U.S. D]{.underline}**epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[J]{.underline}**ustice **[filed three
indictments against Huawei]{.underline}** and its subsidiaries. That
Huawei is the first foreign company of recent memory that is singled out
by the United States for charges related to sanctions violations,
conspiracy to steal trade secrets from American companies (including
source code and wireless technology manuals), and federal racketeering
(including fraud, obstruction of justice, money laundering) is
noteworthy in itself. **[This]{.underline}** last charge of racketeering
is used historically to address organized crime (i.e. mafias) and
**[points to the U.S.]{.underline}** government's **[intended juridical
delegitimization of Huawei as an irrational institution mired in secrecy
and an unlawful global corporation that cannot be
trusted]{.underline}**. In response to these allegations, Huawei accused
the Department of Justice of exercising a form of political persecution
and asserted that "\[the charges\] are based largely on resolved civil
disputes from the last twenty years that have been previously settled,
litigated, and in some cases, rejected by federal judges and juries."31
The case will likely take years to resolve, but its function will become
apparent by the ensuing interstate trade and diplomatic negotiations
between China and the United States. Meanwhile, **[the]{.underline}**
White House and various **[[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** state
departments **[have begun to [exert pressure on]{.mark} both [domestic
institutions and allied nation-states to end contracts and research
collaborations with Huawei]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[For instance, the
U.S. D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[C]{.underline}**ommerce in 2019 **[blacklisted the firm [on charges
of i]{.mark}]{.underline}**ntellectual
**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roperty **[[theft]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
barred U.S. companies from selling products to Huawei without federal
authorization.32 Also, as discussed in the above section, the FBI has
placed pressure on universities to increase oversight of Chinese
American researchers and to divest from research collaborations funded
by Huawei and other Chinese firms. Multiple universities, including MIT,
Stanford University, and the University of Illinois, have terminated
research partnerships with Huawei.33 In addition to these domestic
pressures, **[U.S. officials have asked allied nation-states to cancel
any existing contracts with Huawei, especially ones that
involve]{.underline}** using the firm's equipment for developing
**[5G]{.underline}** wireless networks. **[[Cybersecurity serves as the
stated rationale]{.mark}, conjuring the potential of the
C]{.underline}**hinese **[C]{.underline}**ommunist
**[P]{.underline}**arty through its ties to the firm **[[to engage in
cyber surveillance/espionage by intercepting]{.mark} individual,
corporate, and government [data]{.mark}]{.underline}** flowing through
the 5G wireless networks. According to this logic, **[[the
"Chinese/Asian contagion" manifest as "Chinese/Asian espionage" can now
be hardwired into the infrastructural fabric of our
telecomm]{.mark}unications [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}** through which
data will travel from our phones, computers, online accounts, and other
kinds of technologies to Chinese companies and, potentially, the Chinese
state. The assertion is that the use of Huawei's equipment will create
massive security vulnerabilities not just to U.S. intelligence but also
to American individuals whose personal information can be captured and
used for endless possibilities of commoditization**[. It is also [argued
that Chinese tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology **[[integration into any
Western cyber]{.mark} infrastructure [project "would give China the
upper hand]{.mark} [in]{.mark} any potential [cyber
war]{.mark}."]{.underline}**34 Recently, **[[this racialized
fear]{.mark} of Chinese tech]{.underline}**nology **[[has
materialized]{.underline}]{.mark}** with intensified urgency in the
privacy debates surrounding the immensely popular video-sharing
platform, TikTok, and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. With over
100 million users in the United States alone, TikTok has ascended to
social media ubiquity, **[[exacerbating American anxieties]{.mark}
around China's tech]{.underline}**nological
**[dominance]{.underline}**.35 Rehearsing much of the same rhetoric used
to condemn Huawei, **[U.S. lawmakers have argued that TikTok poses a
threat to the "national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates," citing concerns over
TikTok's handling of user data and the company's alleged allegiance to
the Chinese government.36 Indeed, in early August 2020, the Trump
administration released an executive order that would effectively ban
the social media app from the United States if ByteDance failed to
address concerns regarding the app's surveillance mechanisms, including
the Chinese Communist Party's "access to Americans' personal and
proprietary information . . . "37 Worth noting is the fact that TikTok
was the platform of choice used by K-pop fans to flood the Trump
campaign with fake ticket reservations to the Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally.
The spectacular embarrassment of a half-empty arena no doubt left an
impression on the White House. However, even as the U.S. government is
accusing Chinese corporations like ByteDance and Huawei of colluding
with the state, it too is expanding collaborations with U.S. technology
companies. For instance, in 2019, Microsoft was awarded a \$10 billion
contract from the Department of Defense to update and transform the U.S.
military's cloud computing infrastructure. The project, known as the
Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), is the Pentagon's
largest technology contract to date38 and represents the growing
relationship between the high-tech industry and the military.
Ironically, these are the very same nationalistic ties that the U.S.
government has accused TikTok of advancing. **[The strategic [framing
of]{.mark} potential [foreign violation]{.mark} of individual privacy
[is part and parcel of]{.mark} the [racialized construction of the
"Chinese/ Asian]{.mark} [techno-virus" as a danger to both American
liberal personhood and national capitalist
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, the potentiality for China to
gain the upper hand in any possible cyber and technological war with the
United States compounds the economic threat that conglomerates like
Huawei and ByteDance pose to U.S. global capitalism. **[The perceived
dual dangers of compromised national security and economic
competition---as embodied by Chinese transnational tech

#### Fears of COVID further perpetuate the racialization of the virus -- spurs anti-asian violence and the dehumanization of Asians through a techno-orientalist lens

**[[In]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[early]{.underline}]{.mark}** weeks
of the **[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19 outbreak in the United
States, President **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** put out many mixed
messages, but he **[[remained consistent]{.mark} with]{.underline}**
one---that **[China was to blame]{.underline}** for the spread of the
virus. Repeatedly, he **[insisted on calling the novel coronavirus "the
[Chinese virus]{.mark}," despite mounting public criticism against the
[racialization of the deadly pathogen]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Many noted
the **[[inflammatory nature of this anti-Asian
rhetoric]{.mark}.]{.underline}** During this same period, reports
ranging from verbal abuse to intimidation to physical assault against
people of Asian descent documented the **[[sudden rise of anti-Asian
hate]{.mark} crimes in the United States and globally.]{.underline}**
According to Human Rights Watch, an **[Asian woman [in
Brooklyn]{.mark}]{.underline}**, New York, **[suffered a [racially
motivated acid attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and in Texas, a **[Burmese
American man and his two children were stabbed by a man who claimed he
thought the family was "Chinese and infecting people with the
coronavirus."]{.underline}**1 The Asian Pacific Policy and Planning
Council in the United States reported over one thousand cases of
anti-Asian incidents in a two-week period in March 2020.2 **[Outside the
United States, a [Singaporean student]{.mark} in the United Kingdom was
[violently]{.mark} [kicked and punched]{.mark} by an angry group of men
after they [uttered, "we don't want your coronavirus]{.mark} in our
country"]{.underline}** (my emphasis).3 **[In Australia, a survey taken
by the community group Asian Australian Alliance recorded a total of 178
reports of anti-Asian incidents in two weeks, ranging from racial slurs
to physical assault.]{.underline}**4 Though President Trump has dropped
the "Chinese virus" for "kung flu" and tweeted on March 23 that "It is
very important that we totally protect our Asian American community . .
. the spreading of the virus is NOT their fault," it seems that
**[Sinophobia and [racial violence against Asian Americans have been
unleashed.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Make no mistake, as long as President
Trump continues to take a confrontational stance, **[using the rhetoric
of blame against China with the intention to punish it with new
sanctions, tariffs, and even the cancellation of U.S. debt obligations,5
the [racial aggressions]{.mark} against Asian Americans [will continue
to]{.mark} rise, if not [intensify]{.mark}.]{.underline}** By now, it is
widely accepted that the novel coronavirus emerged first in Wuhan, and
scientists believe that the zoonotic disease might have jumped from
animals to humans at Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a wet
market where vegetables, seafood, meat, and a small number of exotic
wildlife were sold. Despite this, on April 30, President **[Trump
casually offered a new theory]{.underline}**, which Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo tweeted: that **[COVID had originated in the Wuhan Institute
of Virology, which houses a biosafety level-4 lab, and that the virus
might have "leaked" from that lab. The implicit suggestion is that China
had either intentionally bioengineered the novel coronavirus to cause
massive destruction, thereby attributing malice, or carelessly leaked
the virus due to scientific negligence, thereby attributing
incompetence. In either case, these kinds of unsubstantiated
speculations work to further stoke anger and disdain against the Chinese
state.]{.underline}** More disturbingly, they **[traffic in the [idea of
China as a biotechnology threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**, resonating with
pre-existing filmic representations of futuristic dystopian worlds. The
immediate and unqualified responses from the scientific community reveal
the danger of these potentially incendiary speculations. Responding
swiftly, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a
press release the morning of April 30 stating that "The Intelligence
Community . . . concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the
COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified . . . " (my
emphasis).6 Within days, the director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, attested that the
virus "could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated."7
These assertions sought to extinguish any attribution of malice to the
Chinese state. Even with firm contestation, however, the very invocation
of the idea of biotechnology warfare has tapped into and perhaps even
fueled our existing techno-Orientalist anxieties. As the COVID pandemic
story transpires in real time, engulfing the entire global community,
taking unexpected twists and turns, making divergences and
transgressions, we have become increasingly aware that the layers of
entanglements cannot be easily parsed out, nor will we know anytime soon
how and when the story will end. We offer a query into **[how we might
assess and make sense of the intensifying Sinophobia and xenophobia in
this current context. To do so, [we must resist the temptation to
confine our analysis to the]{.mark} narrow parameters of the
[pandemic]{.mark}. Rather, [we insist on examining the rise of
anti-Asian aggression]{.mark} within the concomitant vectors of the
pandemic, the escalation of the U.S.-China trade war, and the [growing
concerns about cyber]{.mark}- and
techno-[security]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Here we **[assert that the
ideology of yellow peril set within a techno-Orientalist imaginary is
[powerfully animating]{.mark} the [racial form]{.mark} and racial
affect]{.underline}** mediating the multiple terrains of public health,
technology, global trade, and national security. **[While it is tempting
to treat this historical conjuncture as extraordinary, it is crucial
that we situate the current [unfolding]{.mark} within the long [history
of Asian racialization]{.mark}, one that indexes the abiding tension
between the political impetus to define national belonging and the
shifting economic imperatives of the nation-state.]{.underline}**8 In
this essay, we examine the techniques and effects of race-making in this
current moment, while linking them to historical antecedents, in order
to illustrate the persistence of the yellow peril ideology as it is
being configured through a **[[techno-Orientalist imaginary where China
is posited as the chief enemy-threat]{.mark}. What follows is an
analysis of how [Chinese]{.mark} alterity as [national security
threat]{.mark} is being simultaneously [constructed]{.mark} and
disciplined [in]{.mark} the different but related [arenas of]{.mark} the
pandemic, [science, and technology.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Discourses of disease as security threats follow the trend of the racialization of disease, putting a target on Asian and Black people's backs

**Siu and Chun 20** (Lok Siu, Claire Chun, October 2020, **[Yellow

Covid-19]{.underline}**: Racialized Contagion, Scientific Espionage, and
Techno-Economic Warfare, page 427-428)**//BRownRice**

**[The [Racialized Contagion]{.mark}]{.underline}** The **[recent
[exponential rise of anti-Asian violence]{.mark} in the United States
and [globally]{.mark} during the pandemic illustrates the [persistent
danger of racializing diseases]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Historians and
social critics have documented and **[traced the ways in which diseases
have been continually racialized by their association with particular
peoples in geographical regions.]{.underline}** Examples in recent
memory include **[[SARS]{.mark} [marked as Asian, MERS as Middle
Eastern, Ebola as African, and so on]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In regards
to this current pandemic, it might be useful to recall the
**[popularization of the "Chinese as contagion]{.underline}**" trope in
U.S. history, as its multiple afterlives continue to inform the public's
facile acceptance of the notion of Chinese as diseased bodies and
pathogenic carriers. The late **[[nineteenth century racialization
of]{.mark} the [smallpox]{.mark} outbreak]{.underline}** in San
Francisco serves as the antecedent to the current moment and illustrates
its **[relationship to the broader context of the [anti-Chinese
movement.]{.mark}]{.underline}** When the smallpox epidemic broke out in
San Francisco intermittently from 1868 through the 1880s, its origin was
presumptively traced to Chinatown. At the time, it was widely accepted
that epidemics were caused by environmental factors like polluted air,
contaminated water, and general bad hygiene and sanitation. **[Through
prevailing racist ideas of this period, [Chinatown]{.mark}'s crowded
streets, tight living quarters, and irregular layout were taken as
evidence in creating a "[laboratory of
infection]{.mark}."]{.underline}**17 According to Nayan Shah, public
health officials of the time helped construct Chinatown as a place
filled with "horrors of percolating waste, teeming bodies, and a
polluted atmosphere" and attributed these unsavory conditions to
"depraved" innate Chinese cultural behaviors and practices, ignoring the
economic factors that compel sharing of living quarters and the racist
state in not extending sanitation services to Chinatown.18 **[By linking
the environmental conditions of Chinatown with Chinese "primordial"
culture, [government officials]{.mark} came to [target]{.mark} the
[Chinese person]{.mark}]{.underline}** (the culturalbiological body)
**[[as the site of disease]{.mark} origin, contamination, and threat to
public health writ large.]{.underline}** Another study of public health
in Los Angeles offers an analogous scenario.19 **[The emergence of these
[public health discourses]{.mark} in the 1870s must be [situated in the
context of the anti-Chinese movement]{.mark}. As Chinese workers poured
into cities]{.underline}** like San Francisco and Los Angeles **[after
the completion of the railroad, they quickly became targets of
intensified prejudice and racial violence.]{.underline}** To the white
working class, these Chinese laborers were **[perceived not only as
economic threats to their livelihood; but, as [racialized discourses of
Chinese as disease carriers intensified]{.mark}]{.underline}**, they
were also feared and despised as a biomedical threat. Together, these
**[[yellow peril discourses molded perceptions of ethnic Chinese
as]{.mark} both [economic and biological threats]{.mark}, fueling the
anti-Chinese movement that eventually led to the successful legislation
of the Chinese Exclusion Act. This historical example shows how the
racialization of disease worked in tandem with racial capitalist logic
to animate anti-Chinese sentiment, violence, and legislation. The
current rise in anti-Asian violence is clearly spurred by President
Trump's persistent attacks against China along with his explicit
racialization of the virus.]{.underline}** Indeed, since the onset of
the pandemic, his administration has sought to blame China, whether it
is for hiding the seriousness of the outbreak in Wuhan, delaying
communication of the outbreak, or underreporting the number of deaths.
**[The deployment of the politics of blame seeks to displace the
pandemic-induced anger, anxiety, and rage onto China and, by extension,
onto the bodies of Chinese and Asian Americans. Moreover, the
[racialized terms]{.mark}, the "Chinese virus" and the "kung flu,"
[naturalizes the virus as being endemic to Chinese
bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, thereby **[[conjuring the phantasm
of]{.mark} the Chinese/[Asian contagion]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While
the ideational power of the Chinese/Asian contagion **[lies in its
construction of the Asian body as the vehicle and embodiment of the
virus, the deployment of blame against China/the Chinese for the spread
of the virus serves as the catalyst that directs anger and rage against
Chinese/Asian bodies.]{.underline}** However, to view current attacks
against Chinese/Asian Americans in the isolated context of the pandemic
risks the danger of interpreting this aggression "as exception."
Instead, drawing on the lessons of the late nineteenth century example,
we want to situate the rise of anti-Asian violence within the broader
context of the anti-China campaign.

THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) may have led to the most
significant public health emergency of the 21st century, with enormous
implications for the global economy and politics. Some recent forecasts
suggest that the COVID pandemic is likely to plunge the world economy
into a deep-seated crisis whose consequences will be even worse than the
Great Depression of the 1930s (Caşın, 2020). These forecasts were
recently validated by Gita Gopinath, the chief economist of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), who portrayed the current situation
as "the worst recession since the Great Depression, and far worse than
the Global Financial Crisis" (Gopinath, 2020). What is more, Western
leaders' recent statements may well be interpreted as early signs of a
rapidly accelerating geopolitical turbulence. German Chancellor Angela
**[Merkel]{.underline}** has **[described the COVID-19 pandemic as the
greatest threat since W]{.underline}**orld **[W]{.underline}**ar
**[II]{.underline}**. The European Union (EU), already suffering from
heavy blows dealt by the 2009 European debt crisis and Brexit (Britain
Exit), has been accused by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of
abandoning his country. For similar reasons, Italian mayors have ripped
down EU flags and politicians participated in popular protests targeting
the EU's indifferent attitude. Meanwhile, Italy and Spain welcomed
generous medical aid delivered by China and Russia. Italy, as one of the
top troop contributors to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[NATO]{.underline}**), **[went so far as to host Russian military
personnel operating near a US military base]{.underline}** (Braw, 2020;
Clark, 2020; Smith, 2020). **[These [cracks]{.mark} with[in the Atlantic
Alliance]{.mark} seem to be [accompanied by a rising
Sinophobia]{.mark}]{.underline}**. French President Emmanuel
**[[Macron]{.mark} openly [targeted China]{.mark} with his statement,
"There are clearly things that have happened that we don\'t know
about"]{.underline}** (Financial Times, 2020). In his turn, US President
Donald **[Trump publicly supported claims that the pandemic originated
in a lab in Wuhan and]{.underline}** went on to proclaim that he had
**[decided to defund the]{.underline}** World Health Organization
(**[WHO]{.underline}**) **[[for]{.underline}]{.mark}** its
"**[[insidious relations]{.mark} with China]{.underline}**" (Chomsky,
2020). He **[insisted on [branding COVID]{.mark}]{.underline}**-19
**[[as the "Chinese disease"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (The Conversation,
2020). Similarly, US Secretary of State Mike **[[Pompeo direct]{.mark}ed
open [threats at China]{.mark}]{.underline}**: "**[There will be a time
when the people responsible will be held accountable ... There will be a
time for assigning blame]{.underline}**" (Bild, 2020). **[Pompeo went so
far as to [name China "as the most dangerous adversary]{.mark} for the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and [for all Western
governments]{.mark}]{.underline}**". He added: "**[We're going to do the
right things by [building up]{.mark} our
[military]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Finnegan & Margolin, 2020). British
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab joined the chorus by declaring, "We'll
have to ask the hard questions about how it came about and how it
couldn\'t have been stopped earlier ... We can't have business as usual
after this crisis" (France 24, 2020). Against this backdrop, the present
article aims **[to [bridge the gap between]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
"**[[disaster capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**" approach
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the study of "**[[cultures of
fear]{.underline}]{.mark}**", **[to provide a systematic explanation of
how the capitalist world order undergoes profound
transformations]{.underline}**. The "capitalist world order" refers
**[in]{.underline}** this **[context to a system of global governance
[that institutionalizes a s]{.mark}]{.underline}**tatus **[[quo of
capitalist-imperialist cooperation and expansion]{.mark} under the
leadership of an imperialist power or group of powers]{.underline}**.
The main argument in this article is that **[[the cultivation and
diffusion of a culture of fear]{.mark} erected on world-historical
disastrous events serve as an important medium for the
[transform]{.mark}ation of [the world order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
this context, we will draw on the ways in which **[neoliberalism was
globally instituted as the organizing principle of the [US-led]{.mark}
world order in a political-economic and cultural context [constructed
around disasters]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The focus will be on
**[emblematic cases that illustrate the symbiotic relationship between
neoliberalism and [the culture of fear as a constitutive element of the
US-centered world order]{.mark}]{.underline}**: the Pinochet coup in
Chile and Argentina's military dictatorship era, "shock therapy"
economics in Russia, and the US war on terror following 9/11. Our
inferences from these cases will then be used to perform an
**[anticipatory analysis of how the COVID]{.underline}**-19
**[pandemic]{.underline}** may **[give way to a world-historical
transformation based on a rapidly spreading culture of
fear]{.underline}**. We will rely on the method of process tracing,
which uses logical reasoning by reference to major events of historical
importance, as well as the preferences, goals, values, and perceptions
of global actors involved in these events (Vennesson, 2008; Bennett,
2010; Collier, 2011). Our article is structured as follows. The first
section will conceptually explain the symbiotic relationship between
disaster capitalism, neoliberalism, and the culture of fear. The second
section will be devoted to case studies that show case the said
relationship. In the final section, we will recontextualize our research
within the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic. Disaster Capitalism and
the Culture of Fear The term "disaster capitalism" was coined by Naomi
Klein (2007), who based her conceptual framework on the critique of
neoliberalism. In her lexicon, neoliberalism refers to a policy paradigm
defined by three landmark demands: privatization, government
deregulation and deep cuts to social spending. Her polemic against
neoliberalism focuses especially on Milton Friedman, one of its most
prominent neoliberal thinkers. Reflecting on Hurricane Katrina -- one of
the most devastating natural disasters in US history -- Milton Friedman
recommended the US government to dismantle its public education system
by extending the network of charter schools and distributing vouchers to
households for food access. Ultimately, Klein shows that the Katrina
disaster provided an opportunity for the Bush administration to
implement Friedman's neoliberal recommendations with action (Klein,
2007). Based on similar cases, Klein advances the argument that
**[[global capitalism instrumentalizes]{.mark} man-made or natural
[disasters]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g. military coups, terrorist
incidents, economic crises, wars, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes)
**[[for the sake of advancing its own agenda]{.mark} of renewal and
reconstruction]{.underline}**. According to her, such disorienting
disasters help to suspend public debate and suppress democratic
practices. **[This [allows capitalists to exploit]{.mark} the window of
opportunity opened by [traumatic shocks]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Klein,
2007). Undoubtedly, capitalism cannot succeed in rejuvenating itself
merely through topdown policy impositions. It needs to secure popular
consent from the ground up. In this regard, we believe that the study of
**["[cultures of fear]{.mark}"]{.underline}** would be helpful for a
deeper understanding of the inner mechanism of disaster capitalism. A
culture of fear is a system of beliefs, values, and behavioral patterns
rooted in negative emotions such as fear and terror, which **[can be
[used as "affective tools]{.mark} of government that come into being [as
a modus of population management deployed by military]{.mark},
political, and administrative [actors]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Linke &
Smith, 2009: 5). **[It [feeds off]{.mark} a strong sense of [existential
insecurity that inflates]{.mark} the meaning of [harm]{.mark} and
fosters a mood of mistrust]{.underline}**. This is facilitated by
simplistic blaming of the media and the propagation of alarmist
reactions meshed with catastrophic rhetoric (Furedi, 2018). In certain
cases, **[[the end result is the formation and consolidation of an
imagined community united against the threat of the
Other]{.underline}]{.mark}**, whoever or whatever that might be. In this
way, global capitalism can easily deploy a securocratic language around
disastrous events to emotionally mobilize popular support and execute
its own programmatic agenda conducive to large-scale transformations in
the world order (Linke & Smith, 2009). Ultimately, fear becomes "a
central figure of global social life" (Linke & Smith, 2009: 4).
Neoliberalism and Disaster Capitalism in Action Chile is widely regarded
as the first laboratory of neoliberalism: the later structural
adjustment programs of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank were modeled on the Chilean experiment. In fact, the case of
Chile perfectly reveals how the roots of neoliberalism formed in
world-historical disasters are constitutive of the US-centered world
order. Chile's socialist president Salvador Allende was overthrown in
1973 by a military coup led by Augusto Pinochet and actively supported
by the United States. In 1975, Chile transitioned to neoliberal
capitalism under the guidance of the Chicago Boys: neoliberal economic
advisors, most of whom were trained at prominent American institutions
such as at the University of Chicago, Harvard University, and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Klein, 2007). Chile's neoliberal
restructuring owed its power to wide-scale social pacification: the
military junta cracked down on opposition forces and inculcated a
culture of fear, ensuring compliance with neoliberal shock therapy
measures. Estimates suggest that in the Pinochet era, more than 3,000
people disappeared and tens of thousands were jailed, tortured, and/or
exiled. This repressive environment strengthened Pinochet's hand in
reducing import tariffs and social expenditure, abolishing price
controls, carrying out mass privatization, and debilitating unions.
Ultimately, Pinochet's shock therapy exposed Chile to deep recessions in
1975 and 1982, and contributed to extreme levels of inequality. Chile's
Gini coefficient rose from around 0.45 in the mid-1970s to over 0.6 by
the end of the 1980s (Taylor, 2006). Moreover, the replication of the
Chilean model in the rest of the region resulted in disaster. The number
of people in poverty in Latin America grew from 118 million in 1980 to
196 million in 1990. The region's total foreign debt increased from
US\$31.3 billion in 1972 to US\$430 billion in the late 1980s, and
US\$750 billion by the 2000s. In the period 1981--2000, average annual
economic growth was only 1.6% in Argentina, 2.1% in Brazil, and 2.7% in
Mexico (Arestis & Saad Filho 2007; Saad Filho, 2007). The mobilization
of fear through military coups was also instrumental in the case of
Argentina's transition to neoliberalism under US influence. Argentina
stepped into a long era of military dictatorship when Isabel Perón\'s
government was overthrown by General Jorge Rafael Videl as part of
Operation Condor, a US-backed campaign of state and paramilitary terror
in support of right-wing dictatorships in Latin America. This period --
also called the Dirty War era (1976--1983) -- led to the disappearance
of 30,000 people, along with other human rights violations including
child kidnappings (Hellinger, 2014) This environment of public fear was
used by the military junta to impose neoliberal restructuring on the
Argentine economy (Klein, 2007). In 1976, thanks to US support for the
military dictatorship, Argentina was granted "the largest loan ever to a
Latin American country" (Cooney, 2007). In line with the newly adopted
neoliberal agenda, the country initiated a radical deindustrialization
policy that accentuated agroindustry in favor of the landed oligarchy.
This process went hand in hand with financial deregulation and the
suppression of unions. Argentina witnessed a record increase in foreign
debt, from US\$9.7 billion in 1976 to over US\$45 billion in 1983
(Cooney, 2007). A world-historical disaster of an even greater magnitude
took place in Boris Yeltsin's Russia in 1991--1999, following the
collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin took advantage of the environment
of fear and confusion created by the disintegration of the Soviet Union
to launch a shock therapy campaign with the aim of liberalizing the
Russian economy. The campaign started in 1992, with the IMF's active
support: Yeltsin made a hasty move to liberalize prices and trade, which
was followed by mass privatizations. An important side effect of these
privatizations was the emergence of a new stratum of Russian oligarchs
feeding off rising corruption in the Yeltsin era (Bedirhanoğlu, 2004).
The shock therapy resulted in average real pay falling by almost 50% in
the period 1990--1995. Organized crime grew to such an extent that up to
80% of private banks and businesses in major cities were involved with
"mafia" organizations (Kotz & Weir, 2007). In the long run, excessive
liberalization and indebtedness exposed Russia to the negative effects
of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. This eventually marked the end of
the Yeltsin era and paved the way for Vladimir Putin's rise to power
(Baiman, Boushey, & Dawn, 2000: 210-217). **[The [post-9/11
conjuncture]{.mark} is an]{.underline}** important **[[example
of]{.mark} how the world order is shaped by the symbiotic relationship
between [disaster capitalism and]{.mark} the neoliberal [culture of
fear]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Mendieta, 2011). **[[The collective
trauma]{.mark} created by these attacks [served as]{.mark} a historic
[opportunity]{.mark} for the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**[to launch the "war on
terror"]{.underline}**:]{.mark} a strategic campaign **[[for]{.mark}
restructuring the world order in [pursuit of]{.mark} its [imperialist
agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}** On September 11, 2001, four passenger
planes were hijacked by terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda. Two of the
planes crashed into the World Trade Center complex and the third into
the Pentagon, while the fourth plane crashed in a field near
Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The attacks claimed nearly 3,000 lives and
resulted in more than 25,000 injuries. The collective trauma created by
these attacks served as a historic opportunity for the United States to
launch the "war on terror": a strategic campaign for restructuring the
world order in pursuit of its imperialist agenda. As such, "the Bush
administration outsourced, with no public debate, many of the most
sensitive and core functions of government -- from providing health care
to soldiers, to interrogating prisoners, to gathering and 'data mining'
information on all of us" (Klein, 2007: 12). The enacting of
**[the]{.underline}** USA **[Patriot Act enabled the government to
suppress civil liberties and enhance the influence of the US military
and prison-industrial complexes]{.underline}**. **[[Mass surveillance
and incarceration]{.mark} thus [became the norm]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Klein, 2007; Mendieta, 2011). The driving agenda was not limited to
reasserting the waning importance of US interventionism in the absence
of the Soviet Union and reordering the Greater Middle East with the aim
of inhibiting the rise of potential US rivals in Eurasia. The United
States was also interested in refuelling its stagnating neoliberal
economy based on a military stimulus. This was particularly seen in the
US occupation of Afghanistan since 2001, the War on Iraq, and other
interventions, for example in Libya and Syria as part of the so-called
Arab "Spring". In summary, these cases demonstrate how disastrous events
such as terrorist attacks, state failures, and military coups lead to
largescale transformations that open up new possibilities for neoliberal
restructuring on a global scale. **[[Disaster-led
crises]{.underline}]{.mark}** sweep away the conditions for healthy
public deliberation; this process is **[[facilitate]{.mark}d by an
[authoritarian environment of fear]{.mark} and confusion]{.underline}**.
Such an environment is **[easily [exploited]{.mark} by capitalist
interests [in favor of an agenda of renewal and
reconstruction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In particular, the post-9/11
conjuncture strongly exemplifies the ways in which disaster capitalism
reproduces itself by deploying an Islamophobic culture of fear, where
highly inflated and alarmist reactions help to reorganize the world
order in line with the catastrophic rhetoric of the war on terror
COVID-19 and the Collective Mobilization of Fear The above cases can
give us valuable insights into the possible ways in which the
**[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19 pandemic may **[[pave the way for a
paradigm shift]{.mark} in the world order]{.underline}**. Worthy of
mention in this regard is Giorgio Agamben's thesis of a "state of
exception". In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Italian
philosopher Agamben asserted that the danger of the disease was highly
exaggerated. According to him, the pandemic is a socially constructed
phenomenon, which helps governments to create a state of exception in
deploying extraordinary measures that might have been difficult to
implement under normal circumstances. In other words, Agamben claimed
that governments purposefully exaggerated the risks of the pandemic in
order to implement new social control devices and methods (Agamben,
2020). Though he may have underestimated the lethal potential of the
pandemic, there seems to be some value in taking his "state of
exception" thesis seriously. The pandemic of COVID-19 has great
potential to be used by capitalist forces to reinvent the capitalist
system or postpone the collapse of global capitalism by exploiting
widespread anxiety and panic. **[By creating a culture of fear that
feeds off the COVID-19 disaster, global capitalism]{.underline}** can
potentially **[incapacitate anti-systemic forces through increased use
of new surveillance tech]{.underline}**nologies and enhanced
social-distancing strategies. It is known that infectious diseases can
trigger negative psychological effects such as hypochondriasis and
anxiety (Duncan et al., 2009). The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception to
this psychological peril. A case in point is a survey by Wang and his
team, which reveals **[the psychological damage that the pandemic caused
in China during its early phases]{.underline}**. In this study, **[16.5%
of respondents showed moderate to severe depression symptoms while 28.8%
of them experienced anxiety problems and 8.1% had high stress
levels]{.underline}** (Wang et al., 2020). Similarly, in a survey
conducted during the lockdown period in Italy, 17.3% of respondents said
they had depression while 20.8% admitted having anxiety problems (Rossi
et al., 2020). In a similar vein, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the
people of Italy to intense stress, closely associated with high levels
of uncertainty as to how long it will take for Italy to return to normal
and whether the pandemic will affect loved ones (Montemurro, 2020). The
**[COVID]{.underline}**-19 pandemic may really have **[engendered a
collective trauma and mass anxiety]{.underline}** that can be easily
**[taken advantage of by global capitalism]{.underline}**. Another
important observer who anticipates the potentially dangerous outcomes of
the COVID-19 pandemic is Slavoj Žižek. He claims that there is no
turning back to normal and that this pandemic will irreversibly change
our lives. Žižek implies that the pandemic will have paradigm-shifting
effects for the world. In his opinion, the pandemic can only have two
possible outcomes: either a new normal will be constructed "on the ruins
of our old lives" or a new form of barbarism will emerge (Žižek, 2020:
3). Žižek goes on to suggest that the pandemic has the potential to
engender the worst socioeconomic catastrophe since the Great Depression.
In this new period, markets will not be able to prevent the forthcoming
waves of poverty and chaos. Moreover, Žižek does not believe that
developing medical treatments or a vaccine will suffice to reverse the
crisis of global capitalism (Žižek, 2020). Indeed, even when the
pandemic is brought under control, the markets may not function as they
used to, because the risk of a new wave of COVID-19 could discourage
investments and lead to monopolistic prices at the expense of lower
income groups. Žižek maintains that the pandemic can only be controlled
by using a different paradigm to neoliberalism; that is, through
large-scale measures including government-imposed quarantines.
Furthermore, he points to the fact that the spontaneous functioning of
markets would eventually deepen the inequalities and hamper access to
basic necessities and services. As such, the risk of economic disaster
can only be averted through globally coordinated efforts; not only in
the battle against the disease, but also in production and distribution.
In the meantime, Žižek expresses optimism that this crisis presents a
universal threat and therefore may give birth to global solidarity
inasmuch as it invites us to reconsider "the very basic features of the
society". In this sense, the WHO's global coordination efforts at
leading this process based on precise and scientific recommendations
without causing panic can be seen as a key catalyst for an emergent
solidarity on a global scale (Žižek, 2020: 41). This is in contrast to
US efforts to delegitimize the WHO by reference to its alleged
"China-centric" approach (Deutsche Welle, 2020). In contrast to the
WHO's responsible approach, certain world leaders are not interested in
following scientific guidance, preventing mass panic, or promoting
global solidarity. Agamben (2020) underlines the fact that public
authorities -- and the mass media -- contribute to the diffusion of
panic at first hand. For instance, Donald Trump has not restrained
himself from amplifying popular anxiety with his statements highlighting
the number of potential fatalities from COVID-19; at the very beginning
of the pandemic, these were estimated at somewhere between 100,000 and
240,000 (Mangan, 2020). Similarly, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has
not hesitated to stir mass panic by warning his people to be prepared
"to lose loved ones to coronavirus" (Hughes & Payne, 2020). Yet
political restraint could have played a key role in reducing
pandemic-related social risks. One possible explanation for this
situation is that **[[leading politicians in Western societies are
seeking to capitalize]{.mark} on a historical opportunity [to reorganize
global capitalism by justifying]{.mark} extraordinary [measures through
manufactured mass panic and Sinophobia]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Therefore, **[[they are mobilizing a culture of
fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** predicated on the COVID-19 disaster. As
such, **[China's geopolitical isolation can be used to re-industrialize
capitalism in core countries, reverse the increasing Chinese influence
on global governance, and postpone the multipolatization of the world
order]{.underline}**. Yuval Noah Harari's warnings buttress this
possibility of exploiting the disaster for a fear-driven political
agenda. **[A state of horror triggered by economic and social turbulence
can [encourage]{.mark} [society]{.mark}]{.underline}** as a whole **[[to
search for]{.mark} a strong [leader who will restore]{.mark} public
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is similar to how the incessant
economic disasters in post--World War I Germany resulted in the rise of
the Nazis to power. Harari thus underlines how **[a crisis can be [a
turning point]{.mark} for a society, [or]{.mark} a [decisive moment
to]{.mark} [determine]{.mark} the [direction of
history]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The COVID-19 pandemic is exemplary of
such a milestone. It marks one of the deepest crises in recent history,
which will surely have serious ramifications, not only for public health
but also for the global economy, world politics, and culture (Harari,
2020). According to Harari, the human species will certainly survive the
pandemic, but the world will be subjected to a deep-seated structural
crisis. He goes on to argue that today's political choices will greatly
affect how the post-coronavirus world takes shape. Similar to how
Agamben cautions about a disease-induced "state of exception", Harari
refers to the "nature of emergencies", underlining how these are
"fast-forward historical processes", and there are some "short-term
emergency measures" that can be implemented to overcome the crisis
(Harari, 2020). We are already seeing the rapid proliferation of
immature technologies such as distance-education platforms and
teleworking environments. The diffusion of such technologies in the
post-coronavirus era may result in the permanentizing of precarious
labor practices (e.g. temporary employment, lower wages,
de-unionization, job insecurity) and the intensification of labor
exploitation (e.g. unpaid overtime and further disturbance of work-life
balance). Meanwhile, governments across the world have already declared
states of emergency and started to take extraordinary measures to
counter the pandemic. One of these measures is the implementation of new
surveillance technologies on the pretext of controlling the contagion.
For instance, the UK government has adapted its facial recognition
systems to identify COVID-19 victims (Tovey, 2020). Another case in
point is how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has authorized
the use of surveillance technology, normally designed for anti-terrorist
activities (Harari, 2020). Coupled with the proliferation of mass
anxiety, "social" isolation and new surveillance technologies, the
perpetuation of authoritarian government practices may seriously
undermine the mobilizing potential of popular movements against
neoliberal capitalism and imperialism. These possibilities parallel
Harari's observations: he suggests that the implementation of biological
and emotional surveillance is another possible outcome. What is more,
once these measures are normalized, they may become permanent, in the
same way as the extraordinary antiterrorist measures adopted in the
post-9/11 era (Harari, 2020). According to Harari, our political choices
are the important things. Like Žižek, he believes that we need a global
plan that avoids isolationism and encourages the free flow of
information and equipment all over the globe, since the pandemic cannot
be regionally contained. Moreover, global cooperation requires stronger
trust in science and close care for personal hygiene, regular
handwashing, and physical distancing. Just as Žižek advocates a stronger
state to deal with the crisis, Harari maintains that the state's role is
crucial in this period and surveillance is necessary to overcome the
pandemic. However, he also cautions that data collected for this purpose
should not be exploited to invent "an all-powerful government" (Harari,
2020). According to Harari, more dangerous than the disease itself is
"our own **[hatred, greed and ignorance]{.underline}**", which may even
**[[set the stage for a new dictatorship under mass
panic]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Deutsche Welle, 2020, April 22). In this
sense, mass surveillance on social media platforms such as YouTube,
WhatsApp, Twitter, and Facebook -- as well as banning and removing
content associated with "false" news and "conspiracy" -- risk generating
new forms of censorship to sustain the relations of domination and
oppression. While Harari shares Žižek's optimism about the prospects for
global cooperation, he also cautions that **[these prospects are
[threatened by a growing tendency towards scapegoating or targeting
minorities and rival nations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Such tendencies --
**[which are]{.underline}** perhaps **[[most strongly reflected
in]{.mark} a [Sinophobic culture of fear]{.mark} in Western
nations]{.underline}** -- evoke the pre-World War II period during which
protectionism increasingly gained currency and minorities such as Jews
and Roma were persecuted. At this point, Žižek calls for caution about a
possible return to the premodern state of reason after COVID-19 (Žižek,
2020: 14). Even though developed countries benefit from higher
educational standards, their citizens can be prone to anthropomorphizing
the COVID-19 pandemic. The origins of this regression of reason may be
found in mass anxiety and panic, which are further provoked by political
authorities and corporate media (Žižek, 2020). According to Žižek,
rational thinking dictates the necessity for collective struggle against
the pandemic and stronger social policies geared towards protecting
society as a whole. On any account, Žižek reasons that our health and
welfare are inextricably linked to those of others, which brings forth
the principle of altruism at the expense of absolute individualism.
However, in the case of COVID-19, Žižek's reasoning does not seem to fit
the facts. Individualism may well be taking on increasing importance to
the extent that people have started to see others, not only as potential
rivals in the marketplace, but as "biological threats". Enhanced
individualism also has the potential to atomize society by fostering
anxiety, especially when individuals withdraw themselves into their own
private domains and see the public domain as inherently threatening.
Such perceptions can be easily manipulated by political authorities such
as Trump and Johnson, who are interested in taking advantage of
disastrous situations. Put differently, a panic environment facilitated
by public authorities may result in increased mass anxiety as a coping
mechanism in the face of disastrous or threatening situations. On the
one hand, the COVID-19 pandemic may further exacerbate the global
economic crisis, with the total disappearance of growth, a ubiquitous
rise in unemployment and debts, and a cascade of bankruptcies across the
world. On the other, it may have already started to create material
conditions for the reproduction of neoliberal individualism. Perhaps
most importantly, the meaning of self-quarantine against COVID-19 may be
extended from mere home isolation to the normalization of
self-interested behavior. When society allows itself to be taken over by
fear, individuals become more prone to pursuing nothing else but their
own well-being and daily survival. In this environment, those in power
positions could easily seize the moment to reshape the public domain in
line with their agenda. This means that the COVID-19 pandemic may not be
the absolute end of neoliberalism per se, even though it has exposed the
deepening of the crisis of global capitalism. Under the influence of
self-interested politicians, mass anxiety -- as a popular self-defence
mechanism against dangerous situations -- risks the retreating of
individuals, not only into their apartments but also into their narrow
individual interests

Curiously, 'the West' has received comparatively little conceptual
attention in the field of International Relations (IR). While references
to Western institutions, Western values, or a Western way of life as the
broader target of terrorist threats are pervasive, we talk about 'the
West' as if it were an unproblematic and taken-for-granted entity. To
the extent that there have been attempts to unpack the meaning, **[the
identity and the borders of '[the West']{.mark}, they have largely been
[built on an ontological understanding of 'Western civilisation']{.mark}
as a given entity with certain essential characteristics]{.underline}**
(Collins 2001: 422; Bonnett 2004: 332). Samuel Huntington's narrative of
a 'clash of civilisations' provides **[the most obvious example of such
an essentialist conceptualisation where 'the West' is [construed as a
coalition of states united by a common cultural
heritage]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Huntington 1993, 1996). Essentialist
conceptualisations of this kind have been an obvious target for critics
pointing to the socially and historically contingent construction of
cultural representations, especially when they come in the seductive
form of geographic terms imbued with geopolitical meaning (Said
1978/2003, 1994; Hall 1992; Jackson 2006a). **[An 'imaginative
geography' of [this]{.mark} kind]{.underline}**, Said (1978/2003: 71)
notes, **['[legitimates a vocabulary]{.mark}, a universe [of
representative discourse]{.mark} peculiar [to]{.mark} the discussion and
understanding o]{.underline}**f \[in the case of Said's work\] Islam and
of **[[the Orient']{.underline}]{.mark}**. Said's analysis of
**[[orientalism remains]{.mark} [instructive]{.mark} to students of 'the
West']{.underline}**, however, **[not only [through the analytical
vocabulary of imaginative geographies]{.mark}, but [also on]{.mark}
account of the [engrained hierarchies and
asymmetries]{.mark}]{.underline}** he carefully observes. 'To speak of
scholarly specialisation as a geographical "field" is, in the case of
Orientalism, fairly revealing since no one is likely to imagine a field
symmetrical to it called Occidentalism' (ibid.: 50). Indeed, while the
term occidentalism has been introduced (Buruma and Margalit 2004), it
does not refer to a distinct scholarly enterprise, but is rather used to
trace how contemporary criticism of the West is rooted in earlier
criticism of modernity such as 19th-century German romanticism. The
study of the West is characteristically not organised into a field of
enquiry, for **['the West']{.underline}** refers precisely to what is
rarely questioned and routinely taken for granted. It
**[[remains]{.mark} diffusely [associated with]{.mark} such different
notions as [modernity]{.mark}, [capitalism and liberal
democracy,]{.mark} civilisation]{.underline}** (in the singular, yet
equipped with an imaginary of geographical delimitation) **[[as well as
imperialism, racism, and 'Western' domination]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Bonnett 2004; Browning and Lehti 2010). In this regard, **[imaginary
geographies [share]{.mark}]{.underline}** 'with magic and **[with
[mythology the self-containing]{.mark}, self-reinforcing character of a
closed system, in which objects are what they are, for once, for all
time, for ontological reasons that no empirical material can either
dislodge or alter]{.underline}**'.1 Against such a background of
'epistemological obstacles' (Bachelard 1938/ 2002) to the study of the
West, our primary objective in this article is to reconstruct and
theorise transformations of Western order in a manner that does not
presuppose a fixed understanding of 'the West' as a pre-constituted
political space, ready-made and waiting for social scientific inquiry.
'The West', we contend, is one of the elusive phenomena in international
politics, which do not have phone numbers --- to recall one of Henry
Kissinger's complaints about an ineffectual European partner at the side
of the United States (US). Yet, references to 'the West' are ubiquitous
in both political and scholarly discourse, each of them conveying some
notion of what the West stands for. Motivated by a reconstructive
interest, we propose focusing on the performative effects of these
references. We are specifically interested in the institutional
consequences of a security semantics in which 'the West' figures as the
threatened, yet notoriously vague referent object that has to be
defended against alleged challenges. A political formation or order
called **['[the West']{.mark} can]{.underline}** then **[be [understood
as a contingent arrangement]{.mark} of such institutional
consequence]{.underline}**s, an arrangement that is
**[[continuously]{.mark} constituted, [reproduced and
transformed]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for instance, **[[by speech acts of
securitisation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Hence, to the extent that
**[[securitisation has become]{.mark} a more [important]{.mark}
mechanism [in reproducing the West]{.mark}]{.underline}** in recent
years, one might say that **['[the West' is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
indeed **[[secured by securitising its very
existence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Given that the standard image of a
Western community of values is linked prominently with the notion of
security communities, the article will begin with a critical review of
this literature. In the section 'A Western security community?', we
argue that the Copenhagen School's understanding of securitisation
dynamics provides an adequate methodological framework for
reconstructing the reproductive and transformative dynamics at hand. In
the section 'A securitising community -- theorising 'the West'', we
reconstruct **[such securitisation dynamics [in]{.mark}]{.underline}**
three different fields: **[the [implications of representing China and
Russia as main challengers of Western order]{.mark}, the effects of the
transformation of]{.underline}** the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
([**[NATO]{.underline}**) **[towards a global security
actor]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and the consequences of extraordinary
renditions and practices of torture for the normative infrastructure of
'the West'. In the conclusion, we briefly outline why **[[Western
securitisation]{.mark} dynamics]{.underline}** in our view **[[should be
understood as a discursive shift]{.mark} away from a legally enshrined
culture of restraint [towards more assertive forms of
self-authorisation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A Western security community?
Geographical representations such as West, East, South, and North
encompass a distinct meaning in politics, especially in international
relations.2 By establishing territorial, cultural, religious, and social
boundaries, they convey a sense of order in our understanding of
political space --- and thus serve as localisations of identity (Albert
et al. 2001). In everyday political language **['the
West']{.underline}** usually refers to a political space encompassing a
grouping of states in Europe and North America (including Australia, New
Zealand, and possibly Japan as 'Western' outliers in the Pacific), which
**[share a particular set of characteristics]{.underline}** and are
therefore **[tightly connected with each other]{.underline}**. The
commonalities are **[usually summed up in attributions such as 'advanced
liberal democracies', 'market-oriented' or 'capitalist'
economies]{.underline}**, and a secularist culture developing out of a
Judeo-Christian heritage.3 How political relations among European and
North American states have developed and how they have contributed to
shaping global politics more broadly has been at the centre of IR
debates for several decades. Taking issue with both realist and
institutionalist scholarship on the origins and mechanisms of
inter-state alliances, the literature on security communities (Adler and
Barnett 1998) has highlighted the constructivist bedrock argument that
political order can be conceived of only as the result of ongoing
processes of social interaction. Hence, at least two reasons as to why
the security community literature provides an instructive starting point
come to mind. First, the security community approach originated as a
perspective attempting to transcend the state-centric perspective of IR
and, in particular, security studies. It thereby allows us, second, to
conceive of 'the West' as a political space characterised by
transnational processes of political association and integration.
Political entities such as security communities are not perceived as
just being 'out there', but are seen as the result of transformative
processes such as the formation of collective identities through social
learning. Hence, as we share these premises, choosing the security
community literature as a foil to develop our own argument means to
engage relatively close kin. We can thus not only deliberately refrain
from restaging the arguments vis-a\`-vis realist, liberal, and
institutionalist accounts, we can also focus more specifically on the
dynamics by means of which 'the West' is invoked, reproduced, and
eventually transformed, for this is precisely where we beg to differ
with the storyline conventionally presented by proponents of a security
community approach. In a nutshell, we argue that the literature on
security communities simply does not go far enough in stepping outside
of the imaginative geographies characterised above. The initial work on
security communities that was conducted in the 1950s by Deutsch et al.
(1957/1968) was driven by an interest in identifying the complex
processes and mechanisms which enabled the permanent elimination of war
between states, in particular **[in the 'North Atlantic
area']{.underline}**. They **[focus]{.underline}**ed on 'integration' as
a complex process by which security communities might come about. Most
importantly they were interested in examining how a 'sense of
community', central to their account of 'integration', could take shape
in diverse and unique historical circumstances. In discussing the issue
of how one ought to distinguish between 'integration' and
'non-integration' Deutsch and his collaborators argued that the
achievement of a security community would have to involve 'something
like the crossing of a threshold'. The problem was that \[s\]omewhat
contrary to our expectation \[y\] some of our cases taught us that
integration may involve a fairly broad zone of transition rather than a
narrow threshold; that states may cross and recross this threshold or
zone of transition several times in their relations with each other; and
that they might spend decades or generations wavering uncertainly within
it. (ibid.: 32--33) Thus, not only did integration turn out to be a
rather complex process involving at least a dozen 'essential conditions'
(ibid.: 58), it was also evolving along unique historical trajectories
in uneven ways. As a result, Deutsch and his colleagues concluded that a
'sense of community' should not be applied 'as a matter of static
agreement' and that 'more could be learned by viewing it as a matter of
dynamic process' (ibid.: 37). This keen sense of the processual
complexity and non-linearity of political integration got by and large
lost in subsequent research on security communities in general and in
research on the transatlantic security community in particular. Rather
than taking Deutsch's warning about the 'uncertain wavering' between
integration and non-integration seriously, the research agenda on
security communities was increasingly shaped by a premise 'that
community exists at the international level' (Adler and Barnett 1998: 3,
italics added). Moreover, rather than dwelling on the Deutschian
twilight zone between integration and non-integration, Adler and Barnett
suggested looking for various groups of states that seemed to have
abandoned the use of force in their relations in order to determine
whether they fit the definition of a pluralistic security community. In
particular, researchers were advised to 'look for communities where
actors have shared identities, values, and meanings, many-sided
relations, and long-term reciprocity' (ibid.: 33). If these criteria
were met, and the citizens of these states held 'dependable expectations
of peaceful change', then we would have reason to speak of a security
community. Not only does such a perspective neglect Deutsch's interest
in open-ended transformative processes, it also embraces a strong
methodological preference for detecting something, which is both
theoretically proclaimed and normatively embraced. Researchers, then,
may lose a thorough and systematic reconstruction of social dynamics and
contingencies out of sight. Pointing to the 19th-century heritage of the
term, Charles Tilly (1998: 397) offers a particularly clear-cut
elaboration of the problem: A haze of Paradigm Lost still surrounds the
word 'community' in popular parlance, the social sciences, philosophy,
and history. Calling up idealized images of solidarity and coherent
identity in compact settlements before the advent of today's complexity,
the term almost inevitably evokes a mixture of description, sentiment,
and moral principle. Users of the term with respect to international
relations are usually hoping to create or restore solidarity among
nations. This volume \[Adler and Barnett 1998\], with its quest not
merely to identify but also to promote security communities, manifests
just such a hope. Much like Tilly, we share the hope but remain troubled
when it seems to impinge on the actual research process. In his work on
the endurance of the transatlantic security community after 1990, Thomas
Risse, for instance, similarly focused on postulating the existence of
such a community as the key variable in explaining transatlantic
cohesion. **[Instead of taking [NATO as an institutional solution to
deal with]{.mark} a multifaceted set of [threats]{.mark} and
risks]{.underline}** (as realists would do), he argues that **[[the
alliance was the expression of an underlying community of shared
values]{.mark} built on 'mutual sympathy, trust, and
consideration']{.underline}** (Risse-Kappen 1996: 368). In this reading
a 'Western' perception of a 'Soviet threat' certainly helped to foster a
sense of common purpose within NATO, **[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}**
according to Risse '**[[it did not create]{.mark} the [community]{.mark}
in the first place'. [Rather]{.mark}, 'the collective identity led to
the [threat perception]{.mark}, not the other way around']{.underline}**
(Risse-Kappen 1995: 32). In this view **[the creation and persistence of
the North Atlantic Alliance could be explained as the institutional
expression of 'the values and norms embedded in the political culture of
liberal democracies', which together constituted the 'collective
identity of a security community among democracies]{.underline}**'
(Risse-Kappen 1996: 370; Schimmelfennig 1998: 213--4). As long as these
values and norms are not seriously challenged by its members, 'the West'
appears as an impressively stable security community in which conflicts
are still resolved peacefully (Pouliot 2006; critically Cox 2005). In
contrast to Deutsch's initial work, this type of research is not
particularly interested in the complex processes that lead to the
creation of security communities in the first place. Instead, it takes
the existence of a transatlantic security community already for granted
and appears to accept, at least implicitly, an essentialist conception
of community. Once again, a 'we-concept' is taken to be based on a set
of values and norms, which are always already there. To be sure, most
scholarship on security communities acknowledges that security
communities are constructed in social interaction. However, rather than
focusing on such interactions and reconstructing the ensuing complex
processes empirically, Deutsch's successors often propose models with
preestablished definitions of 'conducive factors' and 'necessary
conditions' that supposedly foster the development or persistence of
security communities. Adler and Barnett (1998: 37), for instance,
concede that they do this in a 'highly stylized manner'. Yet, they feel
obliged to do so in order to overcome two drawbacks associated with
Deutsch's operationalization of security communities: (1) the concept
was resistant to precise operationalization because it was fuzzy and
ill-defined; and, (2) while Deutsch's behavioral methodology was able to
capture increased transboundary movements that suggested
interdependence, it could not detect a greater sense of cohesion and
community based on mutual responsiveness, value orientation, and
identity. The current challenge is to devise indicators that overcome
these shortcomings. (ibid.: 48--49, italics added) In other words, where
Deutsch's processualism cautioned against a constricted fixation on
abstract 'indicators', the approach adopted by Adler and Barnett
narrowly circumscribes the problem of how inter-state communities emerge
by formal definitions from the very beginning. The actual efforts are
then directed at identifying already existing security communities and
then to determine whether they qualify as 'loosely coupled' or 'tightly
coupled'. Hence, the second generation of security community researchers
not only assumes that communities and shared values already exist, but
also focuses methodologically on identifying indicators instead of
analysing processes. However, while many of the substantive claims of
the second generation sound quite plausible, it remains methodologically
unclear how to decide, for example, whether groups of states do indeed
have 'shared identities' or whether their relations are characterised by
'long-term reciprocity'. Some critics have therefore objected that Adler
and Barnett's framework was 'not backed by a compelling method of
empirical investigation' (Bially Mattern 2000: 303). Their discussion of
questions of research design suggests that scholars could easily
identify features of security communities that self-evidently exist,
just waiting to be discovered. This understanding seems to rest on the
belief that security communities were 'out there', independent of the
concepts social scientists apply (Jackson 2008: 134--43). Yet, to treat
democratic values or human rights, for instance, as attributes that
specific societies possess or acquire is to conceal the intersubjective
construction of these concepts and to ignore their productive, even
hegemonic power. This is the reason why Iver Neumann and Michael
Williams have proposed that constructivist **[analyses of [NATO's
enlargement should consider]{.mark} the alliance's [self-description
as]{.mark} a 'democratic security community' not as an unproblematic
fact but as [a way of exercising symbolic power]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Claiming a democratic identity can then be interpreted as a political
practice **[[that assigns legitimacy to NATO's actions and]{.mark} at
the same time [structures the realm of possibilities for acceptable
Russian self-conceptions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Hence, **[[the
'capacity to claim such identities, and to grant and deny them to
others, is a source of social power']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Williams
and Neumann 2000: 364). An approach that treats references to common
Western values as evidence for an alleged reality --- **[the existence
of a transatlantic security community]{.underline}** --- **[risks
committing an essentialist fallacy by taking the invocation of these
depictions at face value]{.underline}**. One problematic consequence of
such an account is that **[[it becomes methodologically impossible to
distinguish between a political assertion of 'shared values' and its
performative effects]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Assuming an already
existing transatlantic security community with certain 'shared values'
and a 'collective identity' tends to reify prevalent notions of
political discourse instead of interpreting them as an element in
processes of social construction. In our view, claims to a democratic
identity of NATO or public commitments to human rights constitute a
valuable body of empirical material that social scientists ought to be
interested in. However, instead of treating them as evidence for an
alleged **['[Western' identity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, we suggest
treating them as **[[a distinct]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
**[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}**ful **[[move in a political
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Jackson 2006b). Invocation of 'Western
values' or a 'democratic identity' can then be interpreted with regard
to their performative effects and institutional consequences. Thus,
instead of presupposing the existence of an Atlantic security community,
we are interested in reconstructing processes of community formation,
that is, processes that lead to the evolution, reproduction and
transformation of an inter-state political space commonly described as
'the West' (e.g., Jackson 2003; Bially Mattern 2005). Just like Deutsch
and his colleagues, we assume that political orders are integrated via
the construction and reproduction of a sense of community in complex and
non-linear dynamic processes. However, in contrast to the initial work
on security communities, which focused on measuring the quantity and
density of transactions, we propose that **[the emergence and the
reproduction of a sense of community should be studied by focusing on
the productive power of representations in contingent processes of
signification]{.underline}**. As these processes of community formation
are open ended and nonlinear, **[[they can be reconstructed from within
by interpreting how]{.mark} contentious references to '[the West'
operate in political discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Wilderson's theorization of antiblackness is too totalizing and forces Asians into violent spheres of whiteness cementing them as junior partners to whiteness which precludes alternative strategies of navigating racialized power structures

**Gotby 16** (Alva Gotby, "Body, Geography, Exteriority : Race and
spatiality in the writings of Denise Ferreira da Silva" 2016) mahintha

This problem also indicates a broader issue, which is that
**[[Wilderson's account absolutises]{.mark} the [exclusion of black
people]{.mark} - an "ontological" exclusion that is detached from actual
historical processes yet in some sense seems to depend on those
processes.]{.underline}** But what is political ontology? Here, I think
it can most usefully be described as the naturalisation of certain
relations of power, through various institutions and processes. However,
**[[Wilderson suggests]{.mark} that [groups]{.mark} can be [banished
from]{.mark} those "[ontological" relations]{.mark} altogether ([while
simultaneously arguing]{.mark} that [blackness is determined by
gratuitous violence, thus ignoring]{.mark} the [fact that this violence
is]{.mark} a form of [relation]{.mark}), [and that ontology]{.mark},
once it is instituted, [operates on]{.mark} a [level]{.mark} that is
[detached from material and historical processes]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
This political ontology thus becomes next to impossible to change,
because once instituted by a historical process, it becomes almost
dehistorical. While I agree that it is difficult to overstate the
importance of race for the constitution of the modern world, I think
**[th[is absolutising of antiblackness]{.mark} might serve to
[renaturalise it as]{.mark} an [totalised and unchanging condition, thus
ignoring]{.mark} the [multitude of strategies through which racial power
operates]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[Wilderson explicitly states
that he is not interested in how raciality came to be, but rather wants
to describe it as an ontological paradigm of power.]{.underline}**82 For
Ferreira da Silva on the other hand, **[the "how" of race cannot be
neatly separated out from the "what" of race.83]{.underline}** Thus, we
must look at the processes of knowing that instituted the racial -
rather than an absolute ontology of race as exclusion, Ferreira da Silva
proposes an ontoepistemology of racial difference. As I have shown, she
criticises the use of exclusion as a model for understanding race. Much
of that criticism does not apply to Wilderson's theory - for example, he
does not presuppose a prepolitical subject beyond the mechanism of
exclusion. Rather, he suggests that blackness is a form of
desubjectivation.84 He also does not naturalise racial bodily traits as
the explanation for exclusion, as he uses Hortense Spillers' concept of
flesh to describe racial embodiment. Flesh, in Spillers' terminology, is
a politically produced being, not a natural minimal level of life.85
However, **[I find [Wilderson's account limiting because]{.mark} it
[tends towards]{.mark} doing one thing that Ferreira da Silva puts under
the label "the [logics of exclusion]{.mark}," namely [to create]{.mark}
an almost [entirely negative statement of]{.mark} the [being of]{.mark}
(certain) [racialised people]{.mark}. In [his insistence on black people
as]{.mark} the [only group which is completely excluded from
humanity]{.mark}, he [lumps Asian and Arab people together with white
people in]{.mark} the [category of masters, providing very little
justification for doing so]{.mark}.]{.underline}**86 **[Thus, one
racialised group is placed in total negativity, while other non-white
groups are fully included in the sphere of the human. [He]{.mark} does
[place Native Americans in]{.mark} a [liminal position]{.mark}, half-
way between the human and the antihuman, life and death. [This]{.mark}
move [strikes me as]{.mark} rather [U.S.- centric, and Wilderson tends
to waver on the spatial extension of this racial ontology]{.mark}
-]{.underline}** does it apply to North America or the whole world?
Moreover, **[[to place Asians and Arabs solidly within the sphere of
humanity]{.mark}, while blacks are completely excluded, [obscures
how]{.mark} the [racial produces degrees of differentiation]{.mark}.
With Sylvia Wynter, we might consider raciality as gradual deviation
from the purported norm of Man, rather than as the total
nonrelationality of one racial group from others.]{.underline}**87 With
Ferreira da Silva, we might say that racial bodies are ordered on a
scale of transparency/affectability, where blackness occupies the
position unsublatable affectability, the body so close to dying that it
can never be represented as subjectivity unmediated by death.
**[[Wilderson's account does not give]{.mark} a very [clear
account]{.mark} as [to why white capacity is dependent on black
incapacity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Instead he merely states that it is
so, thus **[not explaining how whiteness is constituted.]{.underline}**
While Ferreira da Silva and Wilderson share a commitment to what I would
call the radical exteriority of the racialised subject, in the sense
that it is a subject that cannot be included into humanity and
universality, Ferreira da Silva's account provides us with a key to how
this mechanism of exteriority work. Because her account does not rely on
the pure negativity of the racialised other, she can state that what has
been positioned as exterior is the affectable subject. Again,
**[exteriority is different from exclusion because it does not
necessarily connote negativity, or being deprived of
something]{.underline}**.

#### Vote neg for transnational Asian-Black solidarity\-\--only through rejecting totalizing forms of theorization and US-centric epistemologies can we enable intersectional critique that allows for collective survival 

**Liu 20** (Wen Liu \| "Internationalism Beyond the "Yellow Peril": On
the Possibility of Transnational Asian American Solidarity" \| DOI:
10.5070/T8112050102 \| DOA: 7/17/2022 \| SAoki)

However, the point of **[[Asian--Black solidarity is neither
recentering]{.mark} Asian American [experiences in the struggle toward
police abolition nor placing racism against Black and Asian American
communities in the same comparative framework]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[These approaches would minimize Black people's repression by the
carceral state and fall into the unproductive logic of an "Oppression
Olympics."]{.underline}** The 1960s slogan that some Asian Americans
have repopularized---"Yellow Peril Supports Black Power"---in order to
support the current movement2 has stirred up debates relating to Asian
Americans' relationship to the ongoing Black struggles. While it
highlights the historically bounded fate and formation of the Asian
American and Black Power movements,3 it should also remind us that the
1960s **[[Asian--Black solidarit]{.mark}y was [made possible by the
antiimperialist]{.mark} [positions of anti-Vietnam war and the
decolonial movements in the global South]{.mark}. The [Orientalist
depiction of Asian nationals as "foreign enemies"]{.mark} during World
War II [constituted the "perpetual foreigner" status of Asian American
subjects, thus]{.mark} [demanding]{.mark} an Asian American [critique of
racial exclusion and the US empire]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other
words, the demand for racial inclusion and equality as the basis of
Asian--Black solidarity without problematizing the transnational reach
of US imperialism is not only anachronistic but also counterproductive.
As Minju Bae and Mark Tseng-Putterman articulate, **[[the interconnected
events of Orientalist racialization of the Asian body as virally
contagious and BLM's uprisings against policing "require an analysis
that sutures the discourses of antiblackness and Orientalism,]{.mark}
not [as]{.mark} equivalent but [constitutive components of global racial
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**,"4 rather than flattening the
differences of white supremacist operations under the US nation-state.
In the midst of a global pandemic and social upheavals, how will
transnational Asian--Black solidarity take shape? Currently living in
Taipei, Taiwan, I am involved in an emergent circle of diasporic Asian
radicals who write and organize around the vibrant left-leaning
movements in Taiwan and Hong Kong and seek to build international
solidarity based on a critique of both US and Chinese imperialism.
**[This new activist milieu that has been described as "transnationally
Asian"]{.underline}**5 **[[not only rejects]{.mark} Asian American
[assimilationist politics]{.mark} and the narrow focus of liberal
international politics around democracy and human rights, [but]{.mark}
also [actively seeks cross-national and]{.mark} cross-[racial points
of]{.mark} racial [encounters and challenges the]{.mark} orthodox
Western leftist takes on social movements that often defer to a
[reductionist binarism of "capitalism versus
communism."]{.mark}]{.underline}** For example, a Hong Kong activist was
excluded from participating in a BLM solidarity event hosted by the
Sunrise Movement, an American youth--led climate organization, due to
some US leftists' Twitter commentaries that misrepresented Hong Kong's
protests against Beijing's increasingly harsh conditions of
authoritarian control as being funded by the US military. Writers from
Lausan, a leftist Hong Kong press, have condemned such
mischaracterization of Hong Kong's ongoing mass movement as merely
manipulated by US imperialism and, instead, insisted on the importance
of building alliances between Hong Kong's struggle against
authoritarianism and BLM's vision of police abolition.6 From this single
case, one can understand that **[[building transnational
solidarity]{.mark} is complex and arduous work, both conceptually and
practically. It [requires us to maneuver from one ideological trap to
another across geopolitical contexts and locally specific historical
conditions]{.mark}. While transnational iteration is emancipatory and
necessary to achieve a genuine form of Asian--Black solidarity, [it must
be built on a bidirectional and bifocal analysis instead of merely
relying on the US-centric epistemology]{.mark} of what constitutes
leftist politics]{.underline}**. By seeking transnationalism from the
West toward the non-West and not vice versa, it's easy to fall into the
logic of Western "China apologists" or neo-Cold War logic, dismissing
the interasian conflicts that also have global ramifications. To put it
in another way, as China criminalizes Hong Kong's fight for fundamental
democratic rights and implements mass arrests of young activists under
the National Security Laws,7 **[a progressive Asian American politics
must not only be focused on racial relations domestically but challenge
multiple forms of Empire beyond the borders of the US]{.underline}**.
Only through this multidimensional transnational praxis can we begin to
see the underlying mechanisms that allow BLM activists from Minneapolis
to Seattle to adopt Hong Kong protesters' strategies against the police.
8 These possibilities for alliance among "transnationally Asian"
activists include protesters in Hong Kong and the US using umbrellas and
tennis rackets to protect themselves from tear gas, the joint coalition
between Taiwanese indigenous organizations and Black Lives Matter Taiwan
calling out racism,9 and Singaporeans debating whether to topple their
colonial monuments.10 Our current shared struggles against the rapid
right-wing turn of global hegemonies do not draw lines between the
simple binaries of "East vs. West," "white vs. Black," or
"authoritarianism vs. democracy," but underscore the interconnected
fights against the militarized police state, neoliberal capitalist
order, Han supremacy, and the continued impacts of Euro-American
coloniality. **[The "yellow peril" may have been a useful metaphor
describing the shared racialization of the Asian body against white
supremacy and US imperialism; the politics of internationalism in the
present conditions requires a much more nuanced analysis of
interregional geopolitics across the transpacific. [The possibility of
transnational Asian American solidarity must be situated beyond the
framework of "one united race against one
empire."]{.mark}]{.underline}** Indeed, the fastgrowing infection and
mortality rates of Covid-19 show that the virus cannot be simply
contained by national borders, and **[[our racial critique must]{.mark}
also [be extended]{.mark} [transnationally]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When
a disease is racialized, **[it not only exposes the racial inequalities
built in the global public health infrastructures but also how
mechanisms of national security require the domination of subjects who
are deemed to be "outsiders."]{.underline}** **[Rather than falling into
a nationalistic blame game based on the Cold War logic---choosing sides
between one empire (the US) and another (China)]{.underline}**---the
pandemic requires us to engage in the racial justice and antinativist
struggles in our different localities as well as **[[hold one another's
movements accountable to an internationalist vision of collective
survival]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

eschatological, and proposes a method of preserving ethno-national
power. **[[Eugenic self-defense is]{.mark} [implicated]{.mark} and
inherent to the forecasting of precarious conditions.]{.underline}** The
entanglement of history with fiction, as well as the understanding of
history as a fiction, and of speculation as fictive work, should compel
us to look at cultural production as the production of politicized time.
This thesis contends that **[the [Orientalist racism of the Yellow Peril

progression that generates anxiety about borders]{.mark}, both
geopolitical and financial]{.underline}**, and that **[this

**[[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the 20th century. Its
development into the Asian Century requires fundamental changes to the
nature of speculative fictions and methods of subjugation, which we can
understand both through legislation and the speculative contexts that
generate it. Future discussions of Orientalist apocalypticism,
especially those strains that entail Yellow Peril and economy, must
first look back to the entry of Japan into modernity at the conclusion
of the Russo-Japanese War in order to understand what sort of future
Americans have predicted for themselves, and still predict in different
shapes today. **[[If this is to be a decolonial project, we must]{.mark}
also [look at how an empire understands post-imperial time in order to
create a vision of the future that interrupts Empire and forecloses the
state]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We must look critically at what within us
is structurally valued, how that value is reproduced within our
imagination, and reconsider what we plan to carry on our backs through
our journey into the eschaton of the Asian Century

A century has passed since British author **[Sax Rohmer]{.underline}**
introduced the character Dr. Fu Manchu, whose particular brand of
Eastern mysticism wedded with Western science both terrorized and
titillated readers and audiences alike. Appearing in 1912, the character
**[is perhaps one of the earliest and most potent instances of
[techno-Orientalist expression]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A figure of
unnatural, unknowable peril who must be kept from acquiring knowledge
lest it be used against the Western subject, Dr. Fu Manchu is at once
brilliant and technologically challenged. In one part of the serial, Dr.
Fu Manchu plots to strengthen China by kidnapping European engineers,
suggesting the Orient's lack of technological prowess and desire for
Western technology. Yet, in another, he is described as possessing "all
the cruel cunning of the entire Eastern race, accumulated in one giant
intellect, with all the resources of science, past and present."1
**[Both of the past and the future, his monstrous form captured [Western
ambivalences toward]{.mark} what it regarded as the [mysterious power of
the East]{.mark}, manifesting [in]{.mark} strange
[contradictions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Throughout the twentieth
century, **[[variations]{.mark} of that premodern-hypermodern dynamic in
speculative visions of Asia and Asians have been [recycled]{.mark}
numerous times.]{.underline}**2 Exemplars include the villainous Khan
Noonien Singh in Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek universe, the leader of a
group of superhumans who attempt to take control of the Starship
Enterprise; the Chinese scientist Dr. X in Neal Stephenson's novel, The
Diamond Age (1995), a counterfeiter using "a gallimaufry of contraband
technology" (73) to steal Western innovations; and most recently The
Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (2013), a clear revival of Dr. Fu Manchu played
cleverly by Ben Kingsley in a tongue-in-cheek fashion.3 But **[[Western
speculations of an Asianized future are not always consolidated]{.mark}
in a singular fictional figure]{.underline}** as in Fu Manchu, Dr. X, or
The Mandarin. The yellow peril anxiety of an earlier, industrial-age era
embodied by Fu Manchu found new forms across cultures and hemispheres
**[as [Asian economies become more visible competitors in the age of
globalization and rapid tech]{.mark}nological
[innovations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** One needs to witness only the
speculative fictional worlds of Maureen McHugh's novel China Mountain
Zhang (1992), Joss Whedon's television series Firefly (2002), and Gary
Shteyngart's novel Super Sad True Love Story (2010) to trace persisting
anxieties over the past three decades of a Chinadominated future. **[All
of these worlds feature [Western protagonists]{.mark} struggling to
[navigate a]{.mark} sociopolitical [landscape in which China is the
dominant]{.mark} global [empire with a superior technological
edge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Beyond the focus on China, paradigmatic
works such as William Gibson's Japan-based oeuvre (including
Neuromancer), Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, and the Wachowskis' The
Matrix films have also burnished in the **[[Western
consciousness]{.mark} Asian-influenced visions of the future
[underpinned by]{.mark} a familiar yet estranged mixture of [Orientalist
sensibilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** These examples perfectly
illustrate our definition of **[[techno-Orientalism]{.mark}: the
phenomenon of [imagining Asia]{.mark} and Asians [in]{.mark} hypo- or
[hypertechnological terms in]{.mark} cultural productions and political
[discourse]{.mark}.]{.underline}**4 **[Techno-Orientalist imaginations
are [infused with the languages and codes of the technological
and]{.mark} the [futuristic. These]{.mark} developed alongside
industrial advances in the West and [have become part of the West's
project of securing dominance as architects of the future]{.mark}, a
project that [requires configurations of the East as the]{.mark} very
[tech]{.mark}nology [with which to shape it]{.mark}. Techno-Orientalist
speculations of an Asianized future have become ever more prevalent in
the wake of neoliberal trade policies that enabled greater flow of
information and capital between the East and the West. Substantial
[criticism]{.mark} of techno-Orientalism [emerged]{.mark} in the
mid-1990s [when]{.mark} cultural [theorists]{.mark} began to
[trace]{.mark} its manifestations and theorize [its causes and
implications]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Kevin Morley and David Robins,
Toshiya Ueno, and Kumiko Sato, principal trailblazers of the field, laid
much of the valuable groundwork. Morley and Robins's Spaces of Identity:
Global Media, Electronic Landscapes, and Cultural Boundaries (Routledge,
1995), in which a definition of "techno-Orientalism" first saw print,
remains the most cited in critical assessments of technological and
Orientalist discourses; however, Ueno has probably written most
extensively about techno-Orientalism as a discursive cultural phenomenon
in the era of what he identifies as the "post-Fordist social environment
of globalization" (223). **["[The basis of Orientalism]{.mark} and
xenophobia [is the subordination of Others]{.mark} through a sort of
'mirror of cultural conceit,'" Ueno explains. "[The Orient exists in so
far as the West needs it, because it brings the]{.mark} project of the
[West into focus]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (223). Whereas Orientalism, as
a strategy of representational containment, arrests Asia in traditional,
and often premodern imagery, **[[techno-Orientalism]{.mark} presents a
broader, dynamic, and often [contradictory]{.mark} spectrum of
[images]{.mark}]{.underline}**, constructed by the East and West alike,
of an "Orient" undergoing rapid economic and cultural transformations.
**[Techno-Orientalism, like Orientalism, [places]{.mark} great [emphasis
o]{.mark}n the project of [modernity]{.mark}---cultures privilege
modernity [and fear losing]{.mark} their [perceived "edge" over
others.]{.mark} Stretching beyond Orientalism's premise of a hegemonic
West's representational authority over the East, [techno-Orientalism's
scope is]{.mark} much more expansive and [bidirectional]{.mark}, its
discourses mutually constituted by the flow of trade and capital across
the hemispheres.]{.underline}** As Ueno observes, **[techno-Orientalism
is first and foremost an effect of globalism. "If the Orient was
invented by the West," he writes, "then [the Techno-Orient was]{.mark}
also [invented by]{.mark} the world of [info]{.mark}rmation
[capitalism]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (228). **[Technological
developments, driven by the imperial aspirations and the appetites of
consumerist societies on both sides of the Pacific, propel the engines
of invention and production. In its wake, [Western nations vying
for]{.mark} cultural and economic [dominance with Asian nations
find]{.mark} in [technoOrientalism an expressive vehicle for their
aspirations]{.mark} and fears.]{.underline}** Our volume,
Techno-Orientalism: Imagining Asia in Speculative Fiction, History, and
Media, documents past and current constructions of the role of Asia in a
technologized future and critically examines this proliferating
phenomenon. Dr. Fu Manchu illustrates just one way in which
**[techno-Orientalist imagery pervades Western cultural productions in
the early twentieth century.]{.underline}** The principal locales of
techno-Orientalist projects as they developed in the late twentieth
century have primarily been Japan and China. Ueno, whose influential
analyses of "Japanimation" in the mid-1990s seeded the field of
technoOrientalist studies, observes, **["In Techno-Orientalism, Japan is
not only located geographically, but is also projected chronologically.
Jean Baudrillard once called Japan a satellite in orbit. Now Japan has
been located in the future of technology"]{.underline}** (228). Morley
and Robins put a finer point on the temporal dimension of the spatial
construction: **["If the future is technological, and if
[tech]{.mark}nology [has become]{.mark} '[Japanised]{.mark},' then the
syllogism would suggest that [the future is]{.mark} now
[Japanese]{.mark}, too. The postmodern era will be the Pacific era.
Japan is the future, and it is a future that seems to be transcending
and [displacing Western modernity]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (168). Whereas
Japan's dubious honor as the original techno-Orient was bestowed in the
eighties with the help of the cyberpunk movement, the
techno-Orientalizing of China occurred roughly a decade later.5 China
was not yet a competitor in the global economy in the 1980s, when the
West focused its wary gaze on what it saw as an invasion of Japanese
capital investments and imports into Western economies. When China was
recognized as a newly industrialized country (NIC) in the 1990s and its
influence in the global economy increased, it, too, became once again a
target of techno-Orientalist fashioning. The discourse on **[[China's
"rise"]{.mark} in the U.S. context, [consistent with techno-Orientalist
contradictions]{.mark}, has [focused on constructing its people as a
vast]{.mark}, subaltern-like [labor force]{.mark} and as a giant
consumer market [whose appetite for Western cultural products]{.mark},
if nurtured, could [secure U.S.]{.mark} global cultural and economic
[dominance]{.mark}. This dual image of [China]{.mark} as both
developing-world producers and firstworld consumers [presents]{.mark} a
[representational challenge]{.mark} for the West: Is China a human
factory? Or is it a consumerist society, like the United States, whose
enormous purchasing power dictates the future of technological
innovations and economies?]{.underline}** Japan and China are thus
signified differently in the techno-Orientalist vocabulary. **[[Both are
constructed as competitors and]{.mark} therefore [threats to the
U.S.]{.mark} economy]{.underline}**; but while Japan competes with the
United States for dominance in technological innovation, China competes
with the United States in labor and production. To put it in starker
terms, **[Japan creates technology, but China is the technology. [In the
eyes of the West, both are crucial engines of the future: Japan
innovates and China manufactures.]{.mark}]{.underline}** And as Asia,
writ large, becomes a greater consumerist force than the West,6 its
threat/value dualism commensurately increases. These differences in the
technological signification of Japan and China manifest themselves in
the fictive forecasts of the Asiantinged future. If Japan is a screen on
which the West has projected its technological fantasies, then China is
a screen on which the West projects its fears of being colonized,
mechanized, and instrumentalized in its own pursuit of technological
dominance. India, another NIC, has also found itself under the
techno-Orientalist gaze as a consequence of U.S. outsourcing practices.
As a much maligned business strategy, outsourcing has provoked extremely
negative public sentiments in the United States. These opinions find
expression in a particular strand of **[[techno-Orientalist
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[consolidates China and India
as the chief threats]{.mark} to the U.S. service and labor sectors.
These [Asian nations serve as]{.mark} the [scapegoats]{.mark} for
corporate decisions to move service and manufacturing jobs abroad and
bear the brunt of the resulting xenophobic antipathies.]{.underline}**
Chinese and Indian workers, for instance, are routinely portrayed in
techno-Orientalist and technophobic vocabularies; call center employees
in India adopt Western Christian names and mimic the linguistic and
idiomatic style of Americans, a practice so ubiquitous as to be parodied
cinematically in romantic comedies such as Outsourced (2006), conjuring
images of Dickian androids (or Blade Runner's "replicants") who simulate
human behavior and threaten the distinction between "real" and "fake"
Americans. **[Glossy spreads of endless rows of Chinese workers in
corporate factories and towns in mainstream magazines such as Time and
Wired seal the visual vocabulary of Asians as the cogs of
hyperproduction.]{.underline}** In the NIC contexts,
**[[techno-Orientalist discourse constructs Asians as]{.mark} mere
[simulacra and maintains]{.mark} a prevailing sense of [the inhumanity
of Asian labor]{.mark}---[the]{.mark} very [antithesis of
West]{.mark}ern liberal humanism.]{.underline}** Discursive Conspicuity,
Critical Invisibility As this collection demonstrates,
**[techno-Orientalism occurs across genres and
disciplines]{.underline}**---history, art, literature, film, television,
video games---but **[the majority of the criticism coalesces around
literature and film, particularly in the genre of speculative fiction

of its most pervasive expressions in SF because of the genre's futurist
esprit of contemporary existential, racial, and technological anxieties.
Nevertheless, we identify a disciplinary narrowness to SF in the extant
scholarship that our project attempts to broaden. Even as

Licensed under Creative Commons 2.0. SF are scarce. A survey of the
essays published in the genre's flagship journal, Science Fiction
Studies, founded in 1973, confirms the critical neglect. A search with
the term "Orientalism" in the journal's archives yielded only nine
substantive essays that address Orientalism, four of which are book
reviews. A search with the term "techno-Orientalism" yielded, even more
negligibly, two review essays. Similar searches in Extrapolations,
another major academic venue for SF criticism, yielded equally scant
results. And when PMLA, the lingua franca of academic scholarship in
literature and languages, published a special issue on science fiction
in May 2004, no mention of Orientalism could be found--- this despite
the fact that SF's propensity for projecting and amplifying contemporary
racial and imperialist attitudes is well documented.7 Indeed, the
conceptualization of techno-Orientalism as a recognizable discursive
effect of the postindustrial age may have been the clarion call for
addressing this gap in the genre. Orientalism in SF during the
pre-cyberpunk era may have suffered critical neglect because of the
perception that the "yellow peril" has been kept in check by the
mechanisms of immigration and exclusion acts that were in place for much
of the midcentury. It took the repeal of the immigration acts in 1965,
coupled with the entrance of Japanese capital and imports into the U.S.
economy in the late seventies, to precipitate a renewed wariness toward
all things Asian, onto which the West once again projected agendas of
cultural hegemony and technological dominance. Cyberpunk, with its
fetishizing gaze upon Japan as a seductive and contradictory space of
futuristic innovation and ancient mystique, sharply focused the SF
critical and creative lenses upon Asia. Substantial criticism of
techno-Orientalism thus emerged in the mid1990s with the contributions
of Morley and Robins, Ueno, and Sato. Critical momentum continued with
Takayuki Tatsumi's 2000 historiography of Japanese SF in Science Fiction
Studies (SFS), and a 2002 special issue of SFS on Japanese speculative
fiction, guest edited by Takayuki Tatsumi, Christopher Bolton, and
Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Jr., introduced Japanese SF and cyberpunk visions
to the Western audience. Sato's important and incisive 2004
intersectional analysis of what she describes as "the four different
categorical spheres, namely, Western cyborg philosophy, American
cyberpunk, Japanese cyberpunk, and Japanese theory of uniqueness known
as nihonjinron" (335--336) and Christine Cornea's chapter
"Techno-Orientalism and the Postmodern Subject" in Jacqueline Furby and
Karen Randell's Screen Methods: Comparative Readings in Film Studies
(Wallflower Press, 2006) sustained the necessary critical interest in
the field. These studies, however, constitute the bulk of the critical
history of technoOrientalism. Other studies in recent years, such as
Mimi Thi Nguyen and Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu's Alien Encounters: Popular
Culture in Asian America (Duke, 2007), Wendy Hui Kyong Chun and Lynn
Joyrich's 2009 special issue of Camera Obscura, "Race and/as
Technology," Chun's New Media, Old Technologizing Orientalism • 7 Media:
A History and Theory Reader (Routledge, 2005), and Lisa Nakamura's
Cybertypes (Routledge, 2002), made significant contributions to
critiques of Orientalism in popular culture and mainstream media. Yet,
despite technoOrientalism's growing prevalence in the Western cultural
consciousness, and in SF more specifically, it has been generally
ignored in academic and popular cultural spheres. A special issue of the
literary journal MELUS, titled "Alien/Asians" (2008) and edited by
Stephen Hong Sohn, expanded the critical scope of the phenomenon and
drew it closer for theoretical scrutiny. Sohn's introduction
persuasively conveys the urgent need for vigilant documentation and
analysis of the ever-growing techno-Orientalist vocabulary. The eight
essays in the issue examine a range of techno-Orientalist instantiations
in SF within U.S., Japanese, Chinese, and Indian contexts, from "a
cyberpunk-inflected Asian future" to "the cyborg technologies
intertwined with Asian American bodies" (Sohn 15). The essays, Sohn
writes, "investigate how alternative imaginaries provide fertile
terrains to consider the prospects of racial subjectivity and identity"
(15). The essayists take a hard look at the work of SF luminaries such
as Philip K. Dick, Ursula K. Le Guin, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson,
and William S. Burroughs, whose work consciously or unconsciously traded
in technoOrientalist tropes, as well as the work of Asian American and
Asian Canadian writers such as Karen Tei Yamashita, Amitav Ghosh, and
Larissa Lai, who mount metafictional critiques of techno-Orientalist
tropes in SF. Techno-Orientalism: Imagining Asia in Speculative Fiction,
History, and Media, therefore, has two objectives. The first is to
continue the work begun by the aforementioned predecessors, to "consider
the prospective thesis that cultural production is still invested in
parsing out how the yellow peril continues to be a mode to draw from,
write against, challenge, negotiate, and problematize" (Sohn 6--7). The
volume argues that while Orientalism defines a modern West by producing
an oppositional and premodern East, techno-Orientalism symmetrically and
yet contradictorily completes this project by creating a collusive,
futurized Asia to further affirm the West's centrality. The second
objective is constructive. While we critique the dehumanizing effects of
the technoOrientalist gaze, we also see an opportunity for critical
reappropriations in texts that self-referentially engage with Asian
images; indeed, as an example, Asian SF writers have already taken to
the trope to create the SF cottage industry in which the subject and
setting are Eastern. There is of course the danger that Asian and Asian
American creators might internalize techno-Orientalist patterns and
uncritically replicate the same dehumanizing model. However, thanks to
its global and mass appeal, the speculative imagination in television,
graphic novels, or science fiction is by no means the purview of single
national traditions. Even as techno-Orientalism has become more
pervasive, it has also engendered counterdialogue in those same cultural
and political spaces. Global Consumption While **[[Orientalism]{.mark}
as a critical lens describes how Western discourse discursively
catalogues or frames the East, it has always been [trained on
domestic]{.mark}--- that is, Western or U.S.---[configurations against
the Orientalized Other.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Edward Said notes his
"real argument is that **[Orientalism is---and does not simply
represent---a considerable dimension of modern political-intellectual
culture, and as such has less to do with the Orient than it does with
'our' world"]{.underline}** (12). **[[Techno-Orientalism]{.mark}, with a
vision of the future that is global in scope and reach, adds a wrinkle
to the critical commonplace that Orientalism actively produces and
[reproduces an oppositional East to cement Western
hegemony.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Particularly within the realm of SF,
techno-Orientalist tropes have been absorbed, reenvisioned, and
replicated by other sites of cultural production, with interesting
geopolitical implications.8

Manifest Orientalism are the visible, overt features of Asian culture,
such as clothing, architectural styles, calligraphy, and artistic
creations. **[Manifest [Orientalism is]{.mark} what is [spoken]{.mark}
and acted upon]{.underline}**. **[[It includes info]{.mark}rmation and
changes [in knowledge about]{.mark} the Orient as well as
[policy]{.mark} [decisions founded in Orientalist
thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is the expression in words and
actions of Latent Orientalism. The first \'Orientalists\' were 19th
century scholars who translated the writings of \'the Orient\' into
English, based on the assumption that a truly effective colonial
conquest required knowledge of the conquered peoples. This idea of
knowledge as power is present throughout Said\'s critique. [**[By
knowing the Orient, the West came to own it]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
**[The Orient became the studied, the seen, the observed, the object;
Orientalist scholars were the students, the seers, the observers, the
subject]{.underline}**. **[[The Orient was passive; the West was
active]{.underline}]{.mark}**. One of **[the most significant
constructions of Orientalist scholars is that of the Orient
itself]{.underline}**. What is considered the Orient is a vast region,
one that spreads across a myriad of cultures and countries. It includes
most of Asia as well as the Middle East. The depiction of **[[this
single \'Orient\']{.underline}]{.mark}** which **[can be studied as a
cohesive whole is one of the most powerful accomplishments of
Orientalist scholars. It [essentializes an image of a prototypical
Oriental\--a biological inferior that is culturally backward, peculiar,
and unchanging]{.mark}\--to be depicted in dominating and sexual
terms]{.underline}**. **[[The discourse and visual imagery of
Orientalism is laced with notions of power]{.mark} and superiority,
formulated]{.underline}** initially to **[[facilitate a colonizing
mission]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the part **[of the West and
[perpetuated]{.mark} [through]{.mark}]{.underline}** a wide variety of
**[[discourse]{.mark}s [and policies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
**[[language is critical to the construction]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[The feminine and weak Orient awaits the dominance of the West; it is
a defenseless and unintelligent whole that exists for, and in terms of,
its Western counterpart]{.underline}**. The importance of such a
construction is that **[it creates a single subject matter where none
existed, a compilation of previously unspoken notions of the
Other]{.underline}**. **[Since the notion of the Orient is created by
the Orientalist, it exists solely for \[them\]]{.underline}** ~~him or
her~~. **[[Its identity is defined by the scholar who gives it
life]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Said argues that Orientalism can be found
in current Western depictions of \"Arab\" cultures. The depictions of
\"the Arab\" as irrational, menacing, untrustworthy, anti-Western,
dishonest, and\--perhaps most importantly\--prototypical, are ideas into
which Orientalist scholarship has evolved. These notions are trusted as
foundations for both ideologies and policies developed by the Occident.
Said writes: \"**[The hold these instruments have on the mind is
increased by the institutions built around them. For every
Orientalist]{.underline}**, quite literally, **[there is a support
system of staggering power, considering the ephemerality of the myths
that Orientalism propagates]{.underline}**. **[The system now culminates
into the very institutions of the state]{.underline}**. To write about
the Arab Oriental world, therefore, is to write with the authority of a
nation, and not with the affirmation of a strident ideology but with the
unquestioning certainty of absolute truth backed by absolute force.\" He
continues, \"**[One would find this kind of procedure less objectionable
as political propaganda]{.underline}**\--which is what it is, of
course\--**[were it not accompanied by sermons on [the]{.mark}
[objectivity]{.mark}, the [fairness]{.mark}, the [impartiality]{.mark}
of a real historian]{.underline}**, the implication always being that
Muslims and Arabs cannot be objective but that Orientalists. . .writing
about Muslims are, by definition, by training, by the mere fact of their
Westernness. **[This [is the culmination of Orientalism as a dogma
that]{.mark} not only [degrades]{.mark} its subject matter but [also
blinds its practitioners]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\". So Said calls into
question the underlying assumptions that form the foundation of
Orientalist thinking. **[A [rejection of Orientalism entails]{.mark} a
[rejection of biological generalizations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[cultural constructions,]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[and racial]{.mark}
and religious [prejudices]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is **[[a rejection
of greed]{.mark} as a primary motivating factor [in intellectual
pursuit]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is an **[[erasure of the line between
\'the West\' and \'the Other.\']{.underline}]{.mark}** Said argues for
the use of \"narrative\" rather than \"vision\" in interpreting the
geographical landscape known as the Orient, meaning that a historian and
a **[[scholar would turn]{.mark} not to a panoramic view of half of the
globe, but rather [to a focused and complex type of history that allows
space for the dynamic variety of human
experience]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Rejection]{.mark} of Orientalist
thinking does not entail a denial of the differences between \'the
West\' and \'the Orient,\' but rather [an evaluation]{.mark} of such
differences [in]{.mark} a more [critical and objective fashion]{.mark}.
\'The Orient\' cannot be studied in a non-Orientalist
manner]{.underline}**; rather, **[the scholar is obliged to study more
focused and smaller culturally consistent regions. [The person who has
until now been known as \'the Oriental\' must be given a
voice]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Scholarship from afar and second-hand
representation must take a back seat]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to

### Asian Poetics

#### Vote neg to endorse the poetry of Asian America

Form and Asian American Poetics* pg 157-159 \| DOA: 7/19/2022 \| SAoki)

Frank **[[Chin's]{.mark} groundbreaking [play]{.mark} The Chickencoop
Chinaman]{.underline}**, first produced in 1972, **[[opens with]{.mark}
his main character, [Tam]{.mark} Lum]{.underline}**, explaining his
birth: "My dear in the beginning there was the Word! Then there was me!
And the Word was CHINAMAN. And there was me" (6). Tam elaborates in
thunderous tones: Born? No! Crashed! Not born. Stamped! Not born!
Created! Not born. No more born than the heaven and earth. No more born
than nylon or acrylic. For I am a Chinaman! A miracle synthetic! Drip
dry and machine washable. (8) **[[Tam's]{.mark} immaculate
[conception]{.mark} is miraculous because he [comes "out of
junk-imports, lies, railroad scrap iron, dirty
jokes"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (6). The list goes on, but this first
handful of detritus sketches an American past of cheap Asian imports and
labor. Tam cannot simply jettison this mess; instead, it comes together
to create him. In fact, **[[Tam orphans himself]{.mark} in the play in
order [to claim a lineage of exclusion and
Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A synthetic creation made from the
dregs of racism, **[[Tam is an emblem of Asian America]{.mark}: [the
miracle]{.mark} of Asian America [lies in this transformation]{.mark},
[a new cultural]{.mark} [formation come to life against a history of
anti-Asian sentiment and policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Tam explains
that "The Word is my heritage," but this grim past has been especially
difficult to embrace for Asian America. **[Asian America has
dramatically expanded since its 1968 creation. Perhaps we may read the
literary shaping of Asian America in the last forty years as a dialectic
of exclusion and inclusion, in which periodic delineations inspire new
entries.]{.underline}** The originary "Word" as Chin construed it,
however, continues to be theorized as a hard limit: **[[Asian America
has a heritage]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} it is emphatically [not
Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The breach between Orientalism and
anti-Orientalism has widened since The Chickencoop Chinaman as a growing
field of scholarship has significantly uncovered an anti-Orientalist
literary past. As a result of these crucial excavations, Asian America
created a canon untainted by American Orientalism. Yet **[[the
Asian]{.mark} [American movement]{.mark} itself [provided an
extraordinary demonstration of]{.mark} the [artistic riches that could
result from grappling with an Orientalist heritage]{.mark}, and Asian
American artists have returned again and again to Orientalism as a
complex source for new experiments]{.underline}**. Jessica Hagedorn's
important 1993 anthology of Asian American literature proclaimed that
"Charlie Chan Is Dead," but the truth, as the anthology demonstrates, is
that reviving him is a means of bringing together a wide range of texts.
**[[The original spark of resistance was the miracle of Asian American
literature]{.mark}, and later generations of Asian American artists
continue to return to this potent stance, in ever-changing and often
surprising ways]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[[resistance hasn't gone away
in Asian American literature because Orientalism has never gone
away]{.underline}]{.mark}**---and **[the call to Asian American
political resistance seems as crucial in the twenty-first century as it
was when it was first sounded in the late 1960s.]{.underline}** It has
been the aim of this study to examine this heritage by reopening a past
of literary Orientalism which has long been walled off from Asian
American literature. The Orient examined in the first half of this study
was ultimately a legitimizing force: **[Pound and Snyder secured their
authority in the Far East, and [the poetry that resulted from]{.mark}
their [transpacific journeys presented Eastern]{.mark} [aesthetics as
the mode of an American literary revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Each
was locked into his own distance from the United States, and each found
a way of grasping an essence of nativity by sailing due east. To garner
authority in a distant land in order to trumpet it back home is a
well-known colonial enterprise, but these American adventurers presented
a subtle twist on the old formula by operating through alliance over
difference. At the base of such alliances lay commerce: these literary
accords were offshoots of political and commercial ties across the
Pacific which periodically hailed a friendly Orient. **[The sympathetic
Orient these poets discovered]{.underline}** and, in particular,
**[their [aesthetic admiration]{.mark} for the Far East [presented a
singular bind for Asian American poets]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Asians
in the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[tend to be
branded with alternating praise and blame, each of which calls for
varying tactical responses]{.underline}**: "junk-imports, lies, railroad
scrap iron, dirty jokes" provide fodder for combat, but altogether
different maneuvers are required to negotiate a legacy of haiku and
scroll painting. How to respond artistically to this Orientalism, one
premised on appreciation---in all senses of the word---and not
denigration, has been the central conundrum of this study. **[[In making
the leap from Orientalism to Asian America]{.mark}, I have attempted to
convey the formidable task of creating a new culture out of an
ill-fitting heritage---[and routing this question through poetry
brings]{.mark} to bear [a distinctly formal
pressure]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The [modernist and counterculture
poetic revolutions were shot through with Orientalism, and]{.mark} it is
my claim that [this heritage conditioned]{.mark} [the formal innovations
of Asian American poetry]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Lawson Fusao **[Inada's
[poetry presents a significant experiment away from this past]{.mark}:
he turned to [different]{.mark} [cultural amalgams]{.mark}, applying
African American and Latino rhythms to his verse, but he also
[critically revised Orientalist forms for Asian
America]{.mark}]{.underline}**. My study closes with further formal
experiments **[in Asian American poetry]{.underline}**, in which **[[an
Orientalist heritage is invoked]{.mark} in order [to break it open and
reveal the fissures within]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Theresa Hak Kyung Cha
and Myung Mi Kim reopen a literary past, and their difficult poems
provide a kind of anatomy lesson for American poetry as they dissect its
forms. Apparitions of Asia has traced Pound's modernist apparition of
"Petals on a wet, black bough" to Myung Mi Kim's "azaleas in full
bloom/Composed of many lengths of bone." Against the momentary flash of
Poundian Imagism, Kim's appari tion refers to a bitter transpacific
history. At the end of the twentieth century, **[Asian American poets
newly invoke the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates-- East
Asian alliances that drove the literary revolutions of the past.
**[[American]{.mark} [poetry is itself a supremely synthetic
creation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For the poets of the first half of my
study, the component parts of their verse were aligned with an American
ambition: they dreamed of bardic status, a role which had long been
declared defunct. These **[[poets]{.mark} quite literally [circumvented
the problem]{.mark} of their full belonging to
America]{.underline}**---the first and most important requirement to be
a bard---**[[by reforming their native land through a discipline learned
in the Orient]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In reading the poetic forms of
American Orientalism, I have sought to examine the precise
configurations that result from transpacific alliances in order to
understand their significance within modernist and Beat poetics---and,
further, in order to comprehend the formal burden they present for Asian
American poets. **[[The miracle synthetic of Asian American poetry
emerged in the wake]{.mark} of these extraordinary claims to nativity.
In querying their own belonging to the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, **[these [poets conducted experiments in verse
which took apart and newly assembled the forms]{.mark} [that constrained
them in literary acts that ultimately renewed American
poetry]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Americans idealize Asians as their allies, a "cultural fetishization"
**[[that renders Asia in]{.mark}to a "[utopian attraction]{.mark}" for

**[[discourse]{.mark} also [threatens to eclipse both Asian colonialism

In doing so, **[[Hughes showcases an "overlapping tale" involving

the absence of Korea in studies of black radical literature, I also
examine **[[the poetics of]{.underline}]{.mark}** what I call

In 1956, Atsuko Tanaka donned a kimono-style garment made entirely out
of colored incandescent light bulbs of different sizes and electrical
cords tangled together. When displayed in galleries and exhibitions, the
dress hung on its own, decorative and immobile like a sort of postmodern
Christmas tree. When worn in performances, **[[Electric Dress]{.mark}
came to life and [covered Tanaka's body]{.mark} from head to
toe]{.underline}**, leaving only her face and hands exposed. **[The
effect was the fusing of tech]{.underline}**nology **[and flesh,
[transforming her into a glowing symbol of post-war
Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Tanaka was part of the radical artistic
Gutai movement in Japan that rejected traditional art styles in favor of
large-scale multi-media works that integrated technology in ways that
had never been previously attempted. **[By breaking away from the past,
Tanaka chose to re-envision Japan as the center of modernization,
rapidly changing and growing as if undisturbed by war and the horrors of
recent history]{.underline}**. **[[Electric Dress signifies a
rebirth]{.underline}]{.mark}** of industry and consumerism in a country
that had previously suffered. During Tanaka's performances, the complex
network of pulsating lights flickered on and off; tangled wires mimicked
the body's own circuitry of nerves and veins; and her hybrid body,
composed of luminous techno-skin, became emblematic of the lights of a
modern Asian city.

protagonist]{.mark}]{.underline}**, often as the figure of the space
cowboy, **[[at the center of the narrative and relegates Asian subjects
to the background]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As machines, **[they are
[suspended between life and death]{.mark}, [marked as both super-human
and sub-human]{.mark}, [unable to materialize]{.mark} as
fully-formed]{.underline}**. The Western protagonist must exhibit his
superiority over technology (and over race) through exploitation and
control. These techno-Orientalist stereotypes make their way into
popular narratives, from Blade Runner to Cloud Atlas. More recently,
these tropes appear in the third season of Westworld, where scenes set
in a futuristic version of Los Angeles were filmed in different
locations across Singapore. This suggests that the future will be Asian,
but the heroes will never be. **[[Asian futurism]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
on the other hand, **[recasts these technology-driven visions of the
future to [create speculative worlds in which Asian thinkers and
artists]{.mark} are not exoticized as Oriental others]{.underline}**.
**[Instead they [are at the center of narratives rather than dotting the
margins]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Asian futurism asks not how future
imaginings of]{.underline}** Asia and **[Asian identity are built from
the West looking East, but instead, how they emerge from the East
looking forward]{.underline}**. In this preoccupation with imagining a
hypothetical future, **[[we have to re-orient ourselves]{.mark} to see
how we are situated in the present and ask the question "Where do we go
from here?"]{.underline}** While contemporary artists attempt to rework
tropes of techno-Orientalism and reposition Asia in the future, we
question our own position in the present and begin to feel even more
disconnected from the past. There is a gap between this abstract
futuristic conception of Asia, the actual experiences of Asians today,
and those of our predecessors. Where, and When, Do We Go From Here? I
return again to the image of Tanaka in Electric Dress to develop my own
theory on Asian futurity as that which is inseparable from history.
**[The presence of Tanaka's human body in]{.underline}** her 1956
performance of **[Electric Dress evoked a feeling of horror rooted in
historical memory that resonates with both the audience and the
performer in a way that the lone object cannot]{.underline}**. Audience
members worried about the amount of heat that emanated from the
incandescent bulbs and feared that the dress would electrocute her. In a
postwar context, **[the excessive light covering her body becomes
reminiscent of the light of the atomic bombs and their devastating
technological power]{.underline}**. **[Tanaka even confessed to having a
fleeting thought of death]{.underline}** by electrocution **[when she
flipped the switch on]{.underline}** the console and turned the power
on: "Is this how a death-row inmate would feel?" **[The [fear and
anxiety]{.mark} that came [along with]{.mark} this sense of
[hope]{.mark}, of looking forward, [suggest how intertwined the
past]{.mark}, the [present]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the [future
are]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[While we speak about Asia in the future
tense, the past still tightly grips our social reality in the present.
We live in a moment where]{.underline}** minimalism, or rather a kind of
**[affective minimalism, is a virtue]{.underline}**, deeply informing
our lives and the ways that we build our archives looking forward; we
are told by tidying expert Marie Kondo to only keep items that we have
sentimental relationships with and discard items that no longer "spark
joy." **[In looking to the past, we might find more moments of sadness
and confusion than of joy]{.underline}** --- **[memories that we would
rather suppress and forget but that deeply inform our present
moment]{.underline}** nonetheless. The Chinese sociologist Fei Xiaotong
noted the following upon visiting the United States in 1944: "American
children hear no stories about ghosts. They spend a dime at the
drugstore to buy a Superman comic book...Superman represents actual
capabilities or future potential, while ghosts symbolize belief in and
reverence for the accumulated past.\" Despite being born and raised in
the United States, I never cared much for superheroes, but I very much
believe in ghosts. As I continuously ask myself "What now?" and "What
next?" I find myself being drawn into the past and realizing that the
"actual capabilities or future potential" that Fei saw in Superman might
be found instead within and through ghosts, through history.
**[Performances of Asian futurism are]{.underline}** still primarily
responding to place, **[imagining alternate realities through
constructing or subverting images of landscapes like the
hyper-technological Asian metropolis that Tanaka embodies in Electric
Dress]{.underline}**. **[[When futurity is linked to place]{.mark} and
not the lives of the people who inhabit those places, [I fail to
envision myself in it]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Dawn Chan writes,
"...**[the Asian American experience continues to grapple with the
unease that comes with sitelessness]{.underline}** and the ongoing
threat of encountering the phrase go home." **[[The Asian American
experience]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in this sense, **[[is lost in time as
well as]{.mark} in [space]{.mark}.]{.underline}** I have never lived or
spent much time in Asia, and my status as an American citizen is one
that is constantly being contested. I have never been able to locate
myself anywhere within Asia nor within the United States, so I identify
with **[the term [Asian American]{.mark}]{.underline}** because it
**[[encompasses]{.mark} [everywhere and nowhere]{.mark}
simultaneously]{.underline}**. While my identification with the term in
the present is one of ambivalence, I look through **[the lens of
history]{.underline}** and **[recognize how [the term]{.mark}
[emerged]{.mark} not from one particular place but [from a collective
movement]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- the Black Power Movement. **[[It
is]{.mark} therefore [necessary to parse through our]{.mark} vastly
[different experiences]{.mark} as racial minorities in order [to
recognize rather than]{.mark} to [equate oppressions in Asian
racialization's relationship to white supremacy]{.mark} [and
anti-blackness]{.mark}. Attention to [intersectionality]{.mark} in
approaching multiply-marginalized identities [is not divisive but
conducive to kinship]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This multiplicity is
irreducible and cannot be situated within one specific place or one
particular time]{.underline}**. The **[divisions between then/now, and
here/there, highlighted by Asian futurism become blurred by
movement.]{.underline}** An alternative approach to **[performing Asian
futurity]{.underline}**, I believe, **[relies on an acknowledgement of
history and of multiplicity to build interracial solidarity with
attention to the specificity of racialization]{.underline}**. Asian
futurism, after all, draws inspiration from Afrofuturism, yet there has
been very little discourse amongst and between the two futuristic
imaginings. David Xu Borgonjon suggests that **[[if there's a
place]{.mark} for art that reflects the concrete experiences of Asians
today, "[it must be]{.mark} [collective]{.mark} in process, focused on
action, [and oriented to the margins]{.mark}."]{.underline}** This art
asks not only how we can develop a theoretical futurism but emphasizes
how **[[we can utilize]{.mark} that [theory to act in envisioning a real
future for real people]{.mark}]{.underline}**. An **[[orientation
towards the margins allows us to decenter whiteness and consider
multiply-marginalized identities in relation to each other rather than
to whiteness alone]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A collaborative living
archive that documents and experiences the complications and
interconnectedness of Afro-Asian solidarity, like that of
**[BUFU]{.underline}** (By Us For Us), might be such a project that
looks to history and addresses the present through collective action by
constructing paths of possibility. BUFU --- which was founded by a
collective of queer femme Black and Asian artists/organizers --- **[was
born]{.underline}** in 2015 **[out of racial solidarity]{.underline}**
and Black Lives Matter organizing **[and evolved into a decentralized
multimedia project that aims to build solidarity between Black and Asian
diasporas]{.underline}**. Their video documentary weaves together
interviews in different languages and footage from around the world to
facilitate global conversations that reveal how deeply interconnected
our personal histories are. Through collecting stories about Black and
Asian cultural and political relationships around the globe and sharing
this living archive through public programming, **[BUFU engages with
multiply-marginalized communities to confront history and build
collective and collaborative solidarity]{.underline}**. **[[In Electric
Dress, the future is the body and tech]{.mark}nology fusing together and
[becoming one]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This project, on the other hand,
uses the technology of documentary to center human experience and form a
collective body. **[[The future is solidarity, a shared language, a
deepening of the archive]{.mark}. In every second of footage, there is
movement. [In order to look to a future]{.mark} where we can really see
ourselves, [we need to look backwards]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A theory
of **[[Asian futurity can only]{.mark} [work]{.mark} towards more
generative ends [through]{.mark} an [acknowledgment of history and of
multiplicity]{.mark}, looking [not at where we are situated but how we
move together]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

### Kill America

#### Vote neg to have the dragon of Yellow Peril emerge from its lair of the American psyche and bring about the death of America

Origins and Vicissitudes of a Racist Discourse" \|

CHINESE AMERICA AND THE YELLOW PERIL: WHAT IS TO BE DONE?

In the last year of the nineteenth century, Theodore Roosevelt wrote to
Spring Rice, a British diplomat, boasting, \"Together . . . the two
branches of the Anglo-Saxon race . . . can whip the world.\"302 A few
years later, he was not that sure. And neither were the U.S. presidents
who came after him. For the next one hundred years first China, then
Japan, then China again would rise up in America\'s public consciousness
as a threat to the West in general and the United States in particular.
**[[In each era of]{.mark} this [yellow peril mystique Americans of
Asian heritage]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whether immigrant aliens or
native-born citizens, **[would [suffer outrages]{.mark} directed
[against]{.mark} their character, culture, opportunities,
and]{.underline}**, often enough, **[[their very
lives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Whether cast as members of a \"race,\"
a \"civilization,\" or a \"culture,\" [Asian Americans are treated as
bearers of virtually ineradicable traits that]{.mark}, are at least
implicitly [assumed to be \"inherited]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}** Thus,
Professor Huntington asserts that civilizational \"differences are the
products of centuries\"303 and that cultural differences are \"far more
fundamental than differences among political ideologies and political
regimes.\"304 For Huntington, as Robert G. Lee has pointed out in his
thoroughgoing critique of the \"clash of civilizations\" thesis,305
**[[Asian Americans]{.mark}, together with all those representatives of
other non-western civilizations residing in America, [are imagined to
threaten the U.S. with \"de-Westernization]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}**
This is a fate so terrible, Huntington-sounding very much like Homer
Lea - warns, that **[\"[if Americans cease to adhere to their liberal
democratic]{.mark} and European-rooted political [ideology, the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[as we
have known it [will cease to exist]{.mark} and will follow the other
ideologically defined superpower \[the Soviet Union\] on the ash heap of
history.\"]{.underline}**306 However, **[[it is the Asian American
victims of individuals]{.mark} and groups that have been moved to
murderous action [who have become the real martyrs to such
apprehensions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Robert G. Lee has summarized
**[some of [the most lethal of the attack]{.mark}s that [have occurred
since the re-emergence of the yellow peril in the]{.mark} American
mind-life and the imposition of what he calls the \"[mere gook
rule]{.mark},\" i.e., the rule that [any Asian American is a \"gook\"
worthy of extermination]{.mark}:]{.underline}** Most notorious have been
**[[the murders of Vincent Chin]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Detroit;
**[[Navorze Mody]{.mark},]{.underline}** an Indian American, in New
Jersey;. . . **[[Vandy Phorng]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a Cambodian
American, in Massachusetts in 1987; **[[Jim Loo]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
Chinese American, in North Carolina, and five Cambodian and Laotian
American children in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard, in 1989; **[[Hung
Trong]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a Vietnamese American, in Los Angeles in
1996 . . ., \[and\] the killings of scores of Asian American shopkeepers
and cabdrivers \... \[as well as\] twenty-five Korean American
shopkeepers . . . killed by non-Korean assailants \[in the two years
before the Los Angeles riot of 1992\].307 And, **[[what is to be
done?]{.underline}]{.mark}** Rose Hum Lee, writing in 1960, after the
Korean conflict had ended but before the Vietnam War, the temporary
competitive advantage of Japan, or the national security fears about
China and America\'s Chinese had revived a new yellow peril, thought
that \"Now is the most auspicious time \[for Chinese residing in the
United States\] to strive for total and unreserved integration into the
American society\" and put the burden of accomplishing this on the
Chinese themselves: \"Regardless of where the peoples of the United
States of America originated, they must strive to fit in to the new
social climate which emerged in American society and the world after
World War II.\"308 Forty years later we can see that such a program,
even if it is desirable - and some of the new multiculturalists have
registered their dissent from it - has not been effected[. **[Even after
being designated as]{.underline}**]{.mark} one element of
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** Asian American **[\"[model
minority,\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**309 a veritable role model for other
ethnoracial groups experiencing race prejudice, discrimination, and
poverty, **[Chinese Americans discover that [in times of crisis they are
thrust back]{.mark} into the special category reserved for internal
enemies.]{.underline}**310 The idea of America, or the entire Occident
for that matter, **[being [in peril from the \"yellow\" people]{.mark}
has something of a \"geological\" character. It is [deeply embedded in
the Occidental consciousness]{.mark} of itself, a consciousness
[that]{.mark}]{.underline}**, until recently, **[[took \"whiteness\" to
be a fact of nature]{.mark} needing neither an \"archaeology\" nor a
sociological deconstruction]{.underline}**,311 **[[and \"Orientalism\"
to be its]{.mark} utter and [absolute
antithesis]{.mark}]{.underline}**.312 It is an all-too-neglected element
in the \"American dilemma\" that, despite numerous efforts over the past
half-century, has not been re solved.313 Robert Park once pointed out
that \"A more thorough investigation of the facts would probably show
that minorities, racial, cultural, and national, have always sought the
freedom and protection of the more inclusive imperium.\"314 No doubt
this is true, but two questions arise with respect to that claim: How is
that freedom and protection to be gained? What forms of social and
cultural organization are most conducive to both liberty and security?
None of the proposed processual and institutional answers to these
questions-assimilation, acculturation, amal gamation, on the one hand;
congregation, pluralism, ethnic power, and multiculturalism on the
other-has as yet proved either effective or become likely to be fully
realized.315 **[[The lair of the yellow peril\'s fire breathing dragon
is to be found in the winding labyrinth of the American psyche. It
is]{.mark} one of the \"idols\" of the American mind in a society
that,]{.underline}** as Harold Isaacs pointed out so presciently in
1975, **[is \"[fragmenting and retribalizing]{.mark} \... at a much more
rapid rate, certainly, [than \[it is\] moving toward any more humane
kind of]{.mark} humanhood in the [arrangement]{.mark} of \[its\] social
and political affairs]{.underline}**.\"316 Asian Americans, not only Wen
Ho Lee, are thus waiting for an outcome still unclear and more than
likely to be unsatisfying.

### Orientalism is false

#### Attempts to label Orientalism as an effect of [all]{.underline} powers takes away from the true origin -- modern Europe, which used [anthropocentrism]{.underline}, [knowledge]{.underline} and [liberalism]{.underline} to dominate nature to throw the world into modernity. 

**Hallaq 19** -- He's the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities
at Columbia University, where he has been teaching ethics, law, and
political thought since 2009. He has published over eighty books and
articles on topics including law, legal theory, philosophy, political
theory, and logic. (Wael, "An Interview with Professor Wael Hallaq",
3/4/19, The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs,
http://www.fletcherforum.org/home/2019/2/12/an-interview-with-professor-wael-hallaq,
Accessed 7/17/22)//mackerel

WH: To answer your question, I want to begin with the blurb's statement
that **[Restating Orientalism is concerned with "re-evaluating,"
"deepening," and "extending" the critique of Orientalism.]{.underline}**
Let me begin with the last of the trio, "extending," but let me insert a
caveat first. At one level, I could not even begin to extend **[Said's
critique]{.underline}** when he, **[like almost every
scholar]{.underline}** engaged in such matters, **[applies the term
indiscriminately, almost to any idea or person writing about anything
Islamic, Asian or African. Said erroneously thought that Orientalists
are to be found everywhere, from ancient Greece to thirteenth century
Latin scholars, to]{.underline}** von Grunebaum, Bernard Lewis and their
likes in **[the twentieth century]{.underline}**. So it is not true that
I extend the critique in any of these directions. If anything, in fact,
**[I limit its diachronic scope]{.underline}**, I reign it in, **[and
refuse to accept its sweeping historical coverage. [There was no
Orientalism before modernity]{.mark}, not even in the high cultures of
antiquity who, according to Said, were also "racist." \[...\] I may even
counter by deploying an equally categorical statement: "[No matter how
ethnocentric and]{.mark} how [dominating pre-modern empires all were,
none could wed knowledge to power and redefine ethics as our modern
empires did and]{.mark} continue to [do]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

But how do I extend the critique, which I in fact do? **[First, in order
to show why it is a modern phenomenon, [I deepen]{.mark} the
[exploration]{.mark} into the genealogy of modern knowledge in order [to
excavate]{.mark} a [structure of thought that is -- as a hegemonic
structure \-- unprecedented in human history.]{.mark} Second, [because
this structure is]{.mark} a [foregrounding]{.mark} structure, [it
obviously did not just sit under]{.mark} the field of [Orientalism
alone. If the structure foregrounds modern thinking and ways of
living]{.mark} in the world, [then it radiates onto all
disciplines]{.mark}, especially the ones formed by this structure as
paradigms.]{.underline}** This is the accurate meaning of "expanding the
critique" in the blurb. **[I see engineering, economics, business
schools, journalism, law schools, mainstream philosophy, science,
medicine]{.underline}**, and a host of others **[as being
epistemologically structured in the same manner]{.underline}** in which
Orientalism was fashioned. **[The major difference]{.underline}**, from
this perspective, **[is the substantive content of each discipline.
Orientalism is the most obvious field for the study of the other, even
more so than anthropology, and it is here, in Orientalism, where racism,
manipulation, control, domination, and sovereignty show themselves most
obviously.]{.underline}**

**[My argument]{.underline}**, furthermore, **[is also that showing and
[practicing sovereignty over a Hindu or a Muslim in Asia is
not]{.mark}]{.underline}** very **[[different from]{.mark} showing and
[exercising sovereignty over a tree or a river in]{.mark}]{.underline}**
the forests of **[[Peru or Ecuador.]{.underline}]{.mark}** I call
**[[each instance an epistemological "genetic
slice"]{.mark}]{.underline}** where the **[[totality of
such]{.underline}]{.mark}** instances **[[amounts to a unique but
structured modern attitude]{.mark}]{.underline}** toward the world.
**[[Said]{.mark} navigated at the political level of racism, pejorative
language, and exoticizing the Orient, but [could not see]{.mark} that
what is involved in the [production of Orientalism was]{.mark} nothing
short of [a deeper, underlying structure of thought from which he could
not extricate his own thought.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[To critique Orientalism is to critique secular humanism, liberalism,
anthropocentrism, materialism, capitalism]{.mark} \-- all of which, and
more, Said took for granted.]{.underline}**

FF: What is the relationship between 'the west', modernity, knowledge
and power? Could you elaborate on the relationship between orientalism
and colonialism?

WH: I think **[it is [important to understand]{.mark} that [modernity is
not a continuous trajectory with what preceded]{.mark} it. Modernization
theory]{.underline}** continues unabated in almost every academic field.
This theory, foundational to writing and making history, **[operates
on]{.underline}** the assumption of what I have labelled a **[["theology
of progress."]{.underline}]{.mark}** The theology is **[founded on the
[assum]{.mark}ption that [time has a homogeneous teleological
structure]{.mark}, that this [structure is inevitable, and]{.mark} that
the [earliest phases of history were preparatory for]{.mark} the
[later]{.mark} ones, [which were in turn]{.mark} simply the [means to
reach]{.mark} the [intended summit of real human progress: Western
modernity]{.mark}. Integral]{.underline}** to this understanding **[is
that no]{.underline}** culture or **["civilization" outside of and prior
to modern Europe possessed the same validity, competence, and moral and
intellectual development. [Whatever]{.mark}]{.underline}** these
civilizations had possessed of **[[value]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
culturally or otherwise, **[[was]{.mark}
[consumed]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the process of **[[preparing for a
higher goal]{.mark}, outside and beyond themselves. [The goal was
Western modernity]{.mark},]{.underline}** which was
**[[imposed]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the world **[[by colonialism,
coercion, and hegemony]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[Even if we]{.mark} were to [concede]{.mark}---[however objectionable
and repugnant]{.mark} this may be--- that [modernity's violent
tools]{.mark} were [adopted by necessity]{.mark} with a view [to
improv]{.mark}ing [the human condition, we]{.mark} find ourselves
[fac]{.mark}ing the [bitter reality of a world in which we have
destroyed almost everything around us]{.mark}, from communal and social
structures to ecology and environment.]{.underline}**

What many do not seem to understand is that **[all this is [integral to
modernity]{.mark} as a particular project, [as a particular epistemology
which has dictated a particular set of practices, all of which are the
work of]{.mark} a particular subject, [a particular
subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. My argument is that **[[modernity's
structure of thought created a novel relationship between man and
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}**, one **[[that
produced]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
**[[pathological]{.underline}]{.mark}** sense of **[[domination over
nature, including our own.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Colonialism did not start in the colonies, but in Europe itself, and
this is because [early modern Europe embarked on a quest in which
knowledge was systematically harnessed to subjugate nature, including
our own selves. Orientalism is nothing more than a strand of discourse
by which this bleak result was achieved, but every branch of
knowledge]{.mark} -- philosophy, science, law, etc.-- is [equally
involved]{.mark} in the same project. That [modernity now is
everywhere]{.mark} in the world [should not hide]{.mark} the fact of
[its European origins.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The reader is advised to
read the book for a detailed account of how all this happened.

#### **Orientalism is only regarded as dangerous by those who don't know enough about it, Said's book is riddled with vengeful bias, and the theory provides incentives for not considering Asian scholarship.** 

**Owen 12** \[Owen, Roger, Roger Owen is the A.J. Meyer Professor of
Middle East History at Harvard University and was previously the
Director of the university's Center for Middle Eastern Studies.,
4-20-2012, \"Edward Said and the Two Critiques of Orientalism,\" Middle
East Institute,
https://www.mei.edu/publications/edward-said-and-two-critiques-orientalism\]//AA

And so it has been ever since. **[[Orientalism]{.mark} often continues
to be [regarded as dangerous]{.mark}, perhaps in particular [by those
who have never read it.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Hence, the intense,
ludicrous, alarming and, I would hope, unique way in which the field of
modern Middle Eastern studies has become polarized between the followers
of Edward Said and those of Bernard Lewis and, now between those
belonging to the Middle East Studies Association (MESA) and its
newly-created rival, the Association for the Study of the Middle East
and Africa (ASMEA). **[Given the fact that this "dangerous person"
Edward Said appeared well-versed, if not in the social sciences then in
post-structuralism and in what was soon to become post-colonial studies,
meant that the motley band of persons identified as Saidians could all
be tarred --- regardless of what they actually said, regardless of what
they actually taught --- with the same brush as being purveyors of
[politically motivated]{.mark}, trendy, and [ideologically dangerous
gibberish]{.mark}. Such is the [meretricious message]{.mark} which,
[without]{.mark} much [elaboration]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} without any
obvious [mental effort, remains]{.mark} as [potent]{.mark} with some
audiences as it did 30 years ago.]{.underline}** It also is worth noting
that **[[the personal tone]{.mark} of the book helped to [make
things]{.mark} even [worse]{.mark}. The author himself, his reasons for
writing the book, [his genuine offense]{.mark} at the way [Arabs and
Muslim are objectified in]{.mark} such [a reductionist way]{.mark}, is
powerfully present in the text.]{.underline}** He names names ---
Bernard Lewis' in particular. And **[certain passages are more easily
read as political and polemical rather than as scholarly and academic,
even if this was almost certainly not Edward's original
intention.]{.underline}** All this has had unfortunate consequences.
**[[Critics]{.mark} use the personal and the political to [muddy the
waters]{.mark}, not only of Edward's critique itself but also [of anyone
who can reasonably]{.mark}, or unreasonably, [be associated with
it.]{.mark} Hence [it provides a reason for not taking the work of a
huge number of scholars of the Middle East with the academic respect it
deserves, even when]{.mark}, as in the case of most social scientists at
least, [their work has]{.mark} little or [nothing to do with
Orientalism]{.mark}, either in praise or blame.]{.underline}** By the
same token, **[[it allows those who]{.mark} still [practice]{.mark} some
version of an [Orientalist approach to insulate themselves]{.mark}, and
their students, [from]{.mark} a powerful, [alternative, point of
view.]{.mark}]{.underline}** More seriously, **[the ad hominem attacks
on Said and his band of alleged Pied Pipers also make it more difficult
to sustain an attack on the role of Orientalists in authorizing certain
aspects not only of American military and security policy but those of
Israel as well.]{.underline}** For all the books that castigate the
malign influence of the State Department Arabists, none to my knowledge
point to the policy impact of Israeli Orientalists as well as to the
fact that, even in Israeli terms, their close association with the
country's defense establishment has been counter-productive to what
might be described as the country's national interests. Think of expert
authorities like Gabriel Baer, who assured me, in the mid-1970s, that
Egypt would never make peace with Israel. Think of those who created and
managed the Palestinian "village leagues." Think of those who supported
policies to encourage Hamas during the first Intifada. Think of those
who argued that the Shi'a population could be lured into playing an
anti-PLO, anti-Syrian role in South Lebanon. **[[Bad Orientalism
encourages the notion that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.]{.mark}
Bad [Orientalism]{.mark}, paradoxically, though based on the concept of
a certain Middle Eastern timelessness, [authorizes]{.mark} ambitious
[schemes]{.mark} of political and social engineering [based on
short-term considerations while lacking]{.mark} any way [of anticipating
unexpected long-term consequences.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

WH: My short answer is a resounding Yes. **[I think that the
[position]{.mark} which argues [that one cannot critique modernity from
within modernity---necessarily the only place in which we find
ourselves--- is]{.mark} a [nihilistic]{.mark} one.]{.underline}** It is
**[[both historically and epistemologically untenable]{.mark}.
Historically, because every piece of evidence points to the undeniable
fact that]{.underline}** systems and cultures and **["civilizations" are

Modernity came at the heel of European Christendom, just as Islam came
at the heel of Persian and Byzantine empires, and Greece before it
displaced Pharaonic Egypt and Phoenicia. Each one of these
"civilizational constellations" was epistemologically and culturally
unique]{.underline}**, each with a particular way of seeing the world.
**[[To say that modernity is the end of history is sheer
foolishness.]{.mark} Epistemologically, because our forms of knowledge

So the question is **[[how do we]{.mark} go about [exit]{.mark}ing this
situation?]{.underline}** In Restating Orientalism and \[my\] new book
to appear next year, Reforming Modernity , **[I argue]{.underline}**
that **[[our only hope is]{.mark} to [develop]{.mark} what I call an
[external critique]{.mark}, which [does not mean]{.mark} that [we can
speak from outside modernity]{.mark}. To speak from within modernity is
inescapable.]{.underline}** In my earlier The Impossible State, **[[I
developed]{.mark} the concept of [central and peripheral domains, both
of which must exist in all cultures and "civilizations."]{.mark} For
example, [in modernity]{.mark}, the [state, capitalism, bureaucracy, and
a particular form of reason have become central domains]{.mark} that
govern all other domains. These central domains [have formed our
subjectivities, and made us who we are]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
My argument is that **[[we can capitalize on the peripheral domains,
through]{.underline}]{.mark}** an act of **[[heuristic
retrieval]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in order **[[to displace the central
domains]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And **[[ethics is one peripheral
domain]{.underline}]{.mark}** from which **[[we can begin to rethink who
we are]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In the time and space we have here,

#### **Orientalism is a flawed and contradictory theory**

**Landlow 7**[(George P Landlow, Oct 23 2007, \"Edward W. Said\'s
Orientalism,\" Professor of English and Art History, Brown University,
http://www.postcolonialweb.org/poldiscourse/said/orient14.html)**//BRownRice**](file:///C:\Users\rishishetty\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\(George%20P%20Landlow,%20Oct%2023%202007,%20%22Edward%20W.%20Said's%20Orientalism,%22%20Professor%20of%20English%20and%20Art%20History,%20Brown%20University,%20http:\www.postcolonialweb.org\poldiscourse\said\orient14.html)\BRownRice)

Drawing upon the methods of feminist criticism of the 1970s, **[Said\'s
[Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** did much to create the field of
postcolonial studies by teaching us to \"read for the gap,\" placing
texts in broad political contexts. Despite its obviously valid points
about weaknesses of Euro-American thought, its appeal for Western
intellectuals, and its liberating effect on intellectuals from former
countries that were colonized, this seminal book **[[has]{.mark} some
[major flaws]{.mark}:]{.underline}** Though enormously effective as a
polemic, **[Orientalism is [very shoddy as scholarship]{.mark}, and yet
it presents itself as a corrective to flawed scholarship. [The
book]{.mark} completely [neglects China, Japan, and South East
Asia]{.mark}, and it has very [little to say about India]{.mark}.
Although purporting to be a study of how the West treats all of the
East, the book [focuses almost entirely upon the Middle East]{.mark}.
Its [generalizations about \"the Orient\"]{.mark} therefore
[repeat]{.mark} the very [Orientalism]{.mark} it attacks in other
texts!]{.underline}** It is bizarrely forgiving of French Orientalist
writers like Nerval and Flaubert. **[Orientalism is an [orientalist text
several times over]{.mark},]{.underline}** and in two ways **[commits
the [major errors]{.mark} involved with the idea of the
Other]{.underline}**: First, it assumes that such projection and its
harmful political consequences are something that only the West does to
the East rather than something all societies do to one another. (I am
surely not the only teacher who has had heard Asian-American students
returning from their parent\'s country of origin exclaim, \"Everything
Said says the West does to the East, the East does to the West!\")
**[Because Orientalism is apparently [based on very little knowledge of
the history of]{.mark} European and Non-European [imperialism]{.mark},
it [treats Western colonialism as unique]{.mark}. This point, like the
previous one, makes perfect sense if one takes Said\'s pioneering book
largely as a political polemic, for in that case such omissions might be
forgivable. One expects more from criticism and scholarship,
particularly politically motivated criticism and
scholarship.]{.underline}** Although greatly influenced by feminist
criticism and theory, **[Orientalism almost completely [neglects gender
matters]{.mark}. Although [emphasizing]{.mark} the way the [West
sexualizes the East]{.mark}, it also tends to [repeat]{.mark} the
[pattern]{.mark}, and, moreover, its generally favorable treatment of
French orientalization suggests a great insensitivity to such
issues,]{.underline}** For many scholars, **[one of Orientalism\'s most
offensive claims was its [dramatic assertion that no European or
American scholar could \"know\" the Orient and that,]{.mark} moreover,
all scholarly [attempts to do so]{.mark}]{.underline}** (except Said\'s
own) **[always [constituted]{.mark} acts of
[oppression]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In a single dramatic move, which had
great appeal for many, Said committed the greatest single scholarly sin:
he silenced others by preventing them from taking part in the debate.
According to Said, if someone knew Persian or Tamil grammar, the history
of Islam or Hinduism, or the societies of Saudi Arabia, Eygpt, or
Bangladesh, he or she already belonged to the devil\'s party. They were
corrupted by what Said defined as Orientalism. For Said, who studied
literature at Princeton and Harvard, this proved a very convenient
tactic, since he knew very little about these alien fields. Indeed, one
of the bitterest charges directed at him was that in his own Orientalist
ignorance of the actual Middle East, Said himself in effect suppressed
important work by Egyptian and Arabic scholars! **[Whatever liberatory
or other benefits [Orientalism]{.mark} might have offered upon its
appearance, it has [harmed literary studies]{.mark} and literary
students. By focusing exclusively on the political valences of literary
texts, it has very little to offer those also interested their literary
or aesthetic dimensions. Even those with little interest in such
non-political themes have been harmed by the school of thought
Orientalism has fostered: its political argument, which first enriched
familiar texts, impoverishes when it leads to a neglect of literary and
rhetorical technique. (Note: Said does not himself argue against
acquiring such skills, but those who follow him often
do.)]{.underline}** Even if all these charges were true (and I believe
they are), Said\'s Orientalism remains a major work. Why do you think
this is the case? How is the book larger than the local conditions in
which it was produced? Why do the book\'s strengths, rather than its
weaknesses, appear far more important to a scholar working in, say,
Morocco, Singapore, or India?

The **[[myth of Civilization v. Barbarism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (also
known as the \"new barbarism thesis\"\--see Richards, 1996) and its
variations **[[are an outgrowth of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the third
aspect of the myth of **[[American]{.mark}
[Exceptionalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**: America represents the forces of
good against evil**[. This [myth is a classic story of \"Us versus
Them\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[[favors cultural or civilizational
explanations]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark} over political or
economic ones.]{.underline}** The myth\'s central dichotomy **[[appeals
to identity and makes it powerfully]{.mark}
[intuitive]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Linguists and anthropologists have
noted that language has a binary structure wherein almost every noun,
adjective, and verb has a direct opposite. Generally, one term has
positive connotations while the other does not, and using one term
brings to mind its value-opposite. This underlying architecture of
**[[language is relevant]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the study of this
myth, **[[because it means that]{.mark} either
word]{.underline}**\--**[[civilization or
barbarism]{.underline}]{.mark}**\--**[[alone can conjure the larger body
of work on myth]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If a speaker talks about the
\"triumph of civilization**[,\" it can be understood that (good)
civilization is triumphing over (bad) barbarians]{.underline}**
(Jackson, 2005). Thus, **[words that have clear
opposites]{.underline}**\--for example, justice, western, evil, freedom,
and hate\--**[[are]{.mark} [especially powerful lexical triggers of
political myth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** According to Cap (2005),

The present formula of social communication in the US demonstrates a
striking proportion of language which portrays reality in terms of a
necessary division into \"two,\" which the latter usually means
different and opposing. Such a stance is hence expected of politicians,
and non compliance is scarcely tolerated\--President Bill Clinton \...
got under a massive wave of criticism for being \"too conciliatory\" in
his 1997 State of the Union Address, (p. 14)

This sheds light on the groundwork and intuitive appeal of Civilization
v. Barbar ism. Huntington\'s 1993 thesis, The Clash of Civilizations,
and Barber\'s (1992) Jihad vs. McWorld are reified traces of work on
this myth. **[Today, Civilization v. Barbarism acts as a classic story
of \"Us versus Them]{.underline}**,\" in which a **[[politically and
culturally civilized western world is defined in opposition to a violent
and barbaric eastern world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Edward
**[Said]{.underline}** (1978) **[drew attention to this construct
in]{.underline}** his famous book,
**[[Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The lasting influence of Rafael
Patai\'s (1973) book The Arab Mind is an especially relevant example of
(neo-)Orientalism. Patai claimed that **[[psychological and cultural
factors intrinsic to the \"Arab mind\" account]{.mark} for what he
described as [the violence, stagnation, and backwardness of Arab
populations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Such (neo-)Orientalist explanations
for violence have **[[served as a sort of pseudo scientific alibi for
the Civilization v.]{.mark} [Barbarism myth]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
illustrating the sometimes porous boundary between myth and scientific
theory.

Certainly, **[[rhetoric of the time accessed this myth]{.mark} in order
[to legitimize and justify acts of genocide]{.mark}]{.underline}**
against Native Americans throughout the eighteenth century. In fact,
William McKinley\'s secretary of state, John Hay, combined the third com
ponent of American Exceptionalism with Civilization v. Barbarism when he
described the Indian wars as \"the righteous victory of light over
darkness \... the fight of civilization against barbarism\" (qtd. in
Judis, 2005, p. 55). **[[Cold War rhetoric also conveyed the myth of
Civilization v. Barbarism,]{.mark} and Reagan\'s rheto ric in particular
used the language of \"good versus evil]{.underline}**.\" As the
discourse and practice of the Cold War reveals, **[the significance of
the [conflict]{.mark} between the United States and the Soviet Union
[went far beyond politics and economics]{.mark}]{.underline}**; it was
understood that a Godless \"**[[evil]{.mark} [empire\" was
threatening]{.mark} our way of [life]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Implicit in
the Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen Debate was the idea that the encroachment
of the Soviet Union would threaten the commodity-rich lifestyles of
average Ameri cans. The discourse around the threat of Communism was
largely an exercise in axiological proximization, whereby the evil
ideology of the enemy was conveyed as encroaching on everything we know
to be good and right. Because of the ideological nature of the Cold War,
We and They could not be reliably defined by geopolitical borders; so
**[[the myth]{.mark} of Civilization v. Barbarism [served as a
discursive compensation for blurred boundaries]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

George H.W. Bush\'s public opinion polls and focus groups showed that
the **[[public found]{.mark} [rhetoric emphasizing]{.mark} axiological
[considerations]{.mark} [such as the \"evil\" deeds of Saddam Hussein to
be more compelling]{.mark}]{.underline}** in justifying the Gulf War
**[than rhetoric emphasizing economic reasons]{.underline}**, such as
jobs and oil (Rottinghaus, 2008). Thus, **[the [legitimization effect of
\"good versus evil\" rhetoric is widely
acknowledged.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Orientalism isn't that great of a book

**Bijl 22** -- Freelance writer/analyst interested in Sino-African and
Afrasian relations (Matthijs, "The Remaking of Edward Saïd's
Orientalism", 3/3/22, Medium,
<https://medium.com/@matthijsbijl/the-remaking-of-edward-saids-orientalism-no-postcolonial-critique-c5ea78d232c8>,
Accessed 7/16/22)//mackerel

**[Orientalism is and was known as a controversial work.]{.underline}**
I can't comment on scholarly criticism with regard to Saïd's inferences
made from 18th/19th and 20th-century writers, which may or may not
sometimes have been incorrectly interpreted or cited. Regardless,
**[there was undeniably some sort of representation constructed and
reproduced in literature and by policymakers that had clear racist
undertones and was embedded in a strong sense of Western superiority.
There are [several issues with Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
however, **[beginning with [Saïd's problematic understanding of
rep]{.mark}resentation[s]{.mark}. [The Self vs. Other concept]{.mark} is
pretty straightforward]{.underline}**, namely that along the passage of
time and increasing contacts with and knowledge of other peoples, human
societies have felt the need to define themselves in opposition to a
fictional Other. **[This [has become a Manichean relationship in which
the Self is dependent in its own construction on its representation of
the Other.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For example, **['we are civilized
because they are barbaric' or 'we are good because they are evil'. [Saïd
criticizes Orientalism as a discourse that has inadequately represented
the Orient and thereby constructed and reaffirmed the high notions
Western cultures had/have about themselves. In itself, this argument is
well-grounded]{.mark} in a review of centuries of Western colonial
literature, conquests, and political/economic domination. But [Saïd
isn't]{.mark} necessarily [concerned with]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
problems of **[[colonialism. As stated by himself: The Arab world today
is an intellectual, political, and cultural satellite of the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. This is
not in itself something to be lamented; the specific form of the
satellite relationship, however, is. **[[Saïd's overriding
concern]{.mark} is with an [incorrect]{.mark}, and [therefore unjust,
representation of this Arab world. He decries]{.mark} the ["degradation
of knowledge" and implores]{.mark} his [readers to accept]{.mark} that
their [conception of the Middle East/Orient]{.mark} is [distorted by
constructed rep]{.mark}re[s]{.mark}entations. [He urges them to expand
their knowledge]{.mark} in order [to decrease]{.mark} (and [perhaps
ultimately break]{.mark}]{.underline}** out of) **[[this
distortion]{.underline}]{.mark}** of knowledge. **[What [he is]{.mark},
seemingly, [not concerned with]{.mark} is: (1) [how a changing cultural
representation of the Orient Other would necessarily impact the
representation of the Western Self; (2) how the Orient has represented
itself vis-à-vis the West]{.mark}; Saïd claims there is a clear
imbalance in the number of works produced in the West on the Orient
versus the number of workers produced in the Orient on the West, and one
cannot really speak of a self-representation or at the very least a
counterweight in that regard; [(3) the question whether some sort of
representation is inevitable. In the theoretical case a representation
of the Other would be entirely 'native' and just, would an Other still
exist? And would You as a Self continue to exist?]{.mark}]{.underline}**
As Saïd himself touches upon, an arbitrary division has been made on a
variety of artificial categories such as race, which has led to the
removal of the universality of humanity. By returning to a state of
universal humanity, the fabric of societies might be argued to unravel.
People have cared beyond their own family about their community
precisely because they have been able to identify with it and in
opposition to others. **[While an understanding of other cultures is
necessary and essential, some sort of representation to fit these
cultures within one's own framework appears necessary in order to
continue human societies as we know them. Without a Self vs. Other
cultural representation, humanity would in its universality return to a
family clan-based organization. Or, in other words, it would continue a
Self vs. Other representation but now simply based on
bloodlines.]{.underline}** Orientalism, moreover, boils down to the
dictum power is knowledge. This is not unique to Western representations
of the Orient, of course, and would extend to every historic
relationship in which one culture has exercised political and economic
hegemony over another and thereby repurposed representations of the
other culture. Saïd merely touches upon this broad application of his
critique on cultural representations, failing to see the broader
implications and applications of his writing. **[After all, Orientalism
addresses a small circle of academic readers]{.underline}** who, for
example, are assumed by Saïd to be already well-versed in etymological
discussions of the Arabic word tahwra. **[[Saïd's main goal, in the end,
appears to be]{.mark} the [awakening]{.mark} of [Orientalists who fail
to see]{.mark} that [their body of knowledge]{.mark} on the Orient [is
constructed rather than]{.mark} an [accurate]{.mark} representation. [He
is writing for an Occidental audience who can read vast quotations in
French and have intimate knowledge of obscure Orientalists. He is not
interested in any Oriental readers.]{.mark} Saïd published his work in
English and didn't author its later Arabic translation. He also makes no
reference to Oriental representations of itself and the Occident, and
ways in which they might have been constituent for Orientalism itself.
The [adoption of Orientalism as]{.mark} a [postcolonial critique]{.mark}
is therefore [clearly a remaking and incorrect representation]{.mark} of
Saïd's personal and academic intentions and his writing. [Saïd is not
out to tilt the balance of power]{.mark} in favor of the colonized, [he
merely intends to make the colonizer understand his colonized object
better.]{.mark} He explains how through philology, in combination with
other disciplines, representations of the Other/Orient were imbued by
racism. Yet [for all his detailed descriptions of the clear racism and
exploitation of the Orient by the West, Orientalism is no scathing
critique of racism, colonialism, or imperialism. Following the
publication and subsequent popularity of his work, Saïd and his readers
have remade his work to represent such a
critique]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Note for example the most popular quote
of the book on Goodreads: "Every single empire in its official discourse
has said that it is not like all the others, that its circumstances are
special, that it has a mission to enlighten, civilize, bring order and
democracy, and that it uses force only as a last resort. And, sadder
still, there always is a chorus of willing intellectuals to say calming
words about benign or altruistic empires, as if one shouldn't trust the
evidence of one's eyes watching the destruction and the misery and death
brought by the latest mission civilizatrice." This quote isn't from the
original edition of Orientalism published in 1978 but is penned down by
Saïd in his preface to the 25th-anniversary edition, in 2003. Its
anti-imperial/colonial tone is something Saïd actively eschewed in his
original work. One can only speculate to the reason (fear of reputation
damage in an already close-knit community of academics? Failure to
escape from his own Western education?), but it is clear that by 2003
Saïd had remade himself into an advocate of postcolonialism and critic
of the West (although he rejects the notion still in 2003 that his book
is anti-West). But besides Saïd himself, who now is even considered "a
founder of postcolonialism", Orientalism has been remade by its readers
as well into a postcolonial critique. **[Through the fact it has been
simplified and reduced to a mere few sentences in academic teaching, but
also through its readers who were especially offended or inspired by its
slimmer of revolt against and renunciation of the West and reframed the
book in turn through the emotions evoked. If anything, [this
remaking]{.mark} of Orientalism itself [is a vivid display of the way in
which a search for scientific objectivity and an uncovering of "truths"
is bound to be rendered into repr]{.mark}e[s]{.mark}entations [of this
reality. Orientalism]{.mark} as such, [as]{.mark} examined and [argued
by Saïd, is a reflection of this unavoidable reality of
repr]{.mark}e[s]{.mark}entations. [One should always be conscious of
knowledge being framed and interpreted through various lenses and
contexts and attempt to limit this distortion as much as possible, yet
also be aware of the boundaries of]{.mark} this exercise for
['truth'.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Orientalism as a theory is full of flaws and contradictions

**Elif notes 4/11**(Elif Notes, 04-11-2022, \"Edward Said's Orientalism:
Various Flaws and Weaknesses,\" ElifNotes,
https://elifnotes.com/edward-saids-orientalism-flaws-and-weaknesses/)**//BRownRice**

Edward Said's Orientalism is his signature contribution to literary
criticism and academic life. The book questions a pattern of
misrepresentation of the Orient (East) by the Occident (West). It argues
that there had never been a neutral scholarship that studied the Orient.
This is because those who were doing the study belonged to the West.
This fact exercised colonial power over those being studied. This
unequal power relation created the very object of study. It means 'we'
could study 'them' because 'they' were separated from 'us' and subject
to 'our' rule. The evaluation and critique of Edward Said's set of
beliefs, known as 'Orientalism', forms a significant background for
postcolonial studies. Besides, it has also given birth to a new
sub-discipline---the cultural study of colonialism. However, Edward
Said's [[Orientalism has various]{.mark} [flaws]{.mark} and weaknesses
as well.]{.underline} Various literary theorists, anthropologists,
historians, and political scientists have often cited as well as
criticized it. However, it received [[strong criticism from]{.mark}
academic Orientalists, including some of [Eastern
background]{.mark}.]{.underline} Edward Said's Orientalism made a
[parenthetical statement that 'the world is made up of two [unequal
halves, Orient and Occident']{.mark}.]{.underline} This statement
presents a useful summary of the binary opposition he creates.
Nevertheless, here Said acknowledges the obvious opposition of Orient
and Occident. Whereas, at various stages in the text, he complicates the
issue. [He [refers to Orient]{.mark} both [in opposition to]{.mark} that
which is ['Western' and]{.mark} also that which is ['European']{.mark}.
At the same time, [neglecting]{.mark} its already established natural
[antonym]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some [[Major Drawbacks of Said's Binary
Distinction]{.mark} Between the Orient and the Occident]{.underline} The
[dualistic [definition of]{.mark} the [Occidental half]{.mark} of the
binary by Edward Said [causes a]{.mark} great
[problem]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is obvious that he uses the two terms
apparently interchangeably. Yet, [despite the overlapping of definition
to some extent, the lack of true synonymy between 'European' and
'Western' shows that it is no longer explicit what Said is suggesting
the Orient (East) to be defined in opposition against.]{.underline}
Since this binary construction is crucial to Said's theory, if it is
improperly explained or seems indistinct, [the whole theory [raises
doubt.]{.mark} Said's [binary distinction]{.mark} between the Orient and
the Occident further [becomes doubtful by]{.mark} his discussion of the
[commonality of German]{.mark} Orientalism, [American]{.mark}
Orientalism, [and Anglo-French Orientalism]{.mark}. By naming them
separately, and in therefore [acknowledging]{.mark} a [difference as
well as]{.mark} a [commonality between the three]{.mark}, Said opens up
the possibility of the existence of multiple Orientalisms rather than a
single unified system of Western thought, which he elsewhere defines
Orientalism as being.]{.underline} This concession to divisions within
European thought, and further, between European and American thought,
highlights the problems of trying to discuss and theories such large
terms as Europe and Western. Moreover, Said discusses the problem he
claims every writer on the Orient faces. These problems, in his views,
are: "how to get hold of it, how to approach it, how not to be defeated
or overwhelmed by its sublimity, its scope, its awful dimensions".
However, at the same time, he appears faced with similar problems of the
sublimity, scope and dimensions of his terms as he discusses the
Occident. EDWARD SAID'S ORIENTALISM: DEFINITION, SUMMARY & ANALYSIS
[Fractured Unity of Occidental Models in Edward Said's
'Orientalism']{.underline} As the unity of Edward Said's Occidental
models fractures, his [binary system breaks down yet further. The
[central binary distinction]{.mark} between the Occident and the Orient
becomes [increasingly complex]{.mark}. For, it [becomes]{.mark} more
[apparent that]{.mark} while we can define Europe and the West in
relation to their differences with the Orient, so can we similarly
define the West's component parts in relation to their differences with
each other. In this way, the binary opposition upon which Said's
premises his theory is problematic because he has [defined]{.mark} it
[poorly]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, Said theory also appears
doubtful because of the reductive nature of the terms he uses. Such
reductive tendencies are not only present in his discussion of
Europe/the West/the Occident. They also appear to the same degree in his
discussion of the Orient. In addition, while Said acknowledges the
geographical span of the Orient, "which extended from China to
Mediterranean", and has already discussed the perils of sublimity in
writing about the Orient, he nevertheless still seems to forget the
cultural and societal span this sweeping labelling of 'the East' takes
in, and continues to talk about the Orient as a single sublimed entity.
Edward Said's Orientalism Theory: [Overshadowed by Improperly Defined
Concepts]{.underline} Although Edward Said acknowledges Orientalism as
'a Western style'. However, he seems to [fall too easily into line with
the western thought he critiques. He does so by [delineating the Orient
as a holistic unit]{.mark} because of its exoticism and its '[otherness'
to the West]{.mark}, instead of any commonality of features within
itself. [By not seeking enough to]{.mark} define and [question]{.mark}
the concepts and [labels]{.mark} he uses in his discussion, [Said falls
victim to their reification]{.mark}.]{.underline} This eventually makes
Edward Said's [Orientalism theory [overshadowed by concepts]{.mark} that
he [fails to define properly]{.mark} and [gain control
over]{.mark}.]{.underline} Also, this evidence seems to [indicate the
necessity of a [number of different binaries to]{.mark} fully
[construct]{.mark} the complex system of [interrelationships]{.mark}.
These interrelationships are between the various acting nations and
people in this discourse, rather than one simple distinction of the West
and the East.]{.underline} READ BRIEF SUMMARY OF EDWARD SAID'S
ORIENTALISM [[Major Flaw]{.mark} in Said's Claim about the Orient's
Silence]{.underline} As we've discussed, [Said's often sweeping and
reductive nature is explicit to an extent in his [problematic use
of]{.mark} the [terms around which his argument revolves]{.mark}.
Another example of such a generalizing tendency in Orientalism appears
in his suggestion that: "[Orientalism]{.mark} is [premised upon
exteriority]{.mark}, that is, on the fact that [the Orientalist]{.mark},
poet or scholar, makes the Orient speak, [describes the Orient]{.mark},
renders its mysteries plain for and to the West". [Another central
aspect]{.mark} of Said's theory [is that]{.mark} the [knowledge]{.mark}
gained about the Orient from representations of it in literature, is
[crucial to t]{.mark}he [power the West]{.mark} held over it. In his own
words: "Knowledge of the Orient, because generated out of strength, in a
sense creates the Orient, the Oriental, and his world". However, we can
see such writers such as]{.underline} William Jones, Warren Hastings,
Robert Southey, William Hodges as [Said]{.underline} describes. That is,
to speak for the Orient, and thus, to create it in the minds of their
readers. While, theirs are not the only representations of the Orient
that exist. Often cited as an Indian author's first text in English, The
Travels of Dean Mahomet (1794) is quite significant in this regard. An
autobiographical book , it is an instance of the exception of Said's
generalized rule of exteriority. [Its production and existence is
[enough to dispute Said's claim about the Orient]{.mark} being spoken
merely from the outside---the West.]{.underline} Mahomet's work clearly
defies Said's convention. It is an explicit example of a description of
the Orient, rendering its mysteries plain and clear for the West, not
written by an external 'Orientalist', a European poet or scholar
travelling in the East. However, its author is an Indian writer who has
travelled in and emigrated to Europe. Edward Said's Orientalism Theory:
Based Upon A Generalized & False Assumption [Therefore, Edward Said's
Orientalism theory seems based upon a generalized and a false assumption
that 'such an Orient was silent'.]{.underline} Although very much in the
minority, the existence of Mahomet's text rejects Said's notion of such
silence. The book further reveals that [it is [not]{.mark} the [imperial
eyes' that solely created the Orient]{.mark}. However, the
[representations of the East by the Eastern people also played a role in
its creation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Nevertheless, Mahomet is not simply
an Indian writer who offers a simple refutation of Said's claim of
exteriority. Instead, since he migrated to Europe, Mahomet is a hybrid
figure, as culturally English as he is ethnically Indian. Similarly, his
text is a hybrid. Other European Orientalist texts seem to influence it
in style and possibly in content. Yet, it is also different due to his
different view of events. Although Mahomet's text doesn't base on
exteriority to the Orient to the same degree as works by contemporaneous
writers, neither can seem the work of a completely Oriental insider. It
shows that there are certain complexities surrounding Mahomet's location
as a writer. Therefore, his work's example cannot completely disprove
Said's claim of Oriental exteriority. However, it does highlight the
fact that there are elements to Said's Orientalism that he
oversimplifies and doesn't explore as fully as he might have done. For
Said to claim that "Orientalism is premised upon exteriority" is as
reductive in its own way as the earlier problems surrounding his
definition of the binary opposition of the Orient and the Occident. This
is because it is without examination of a character like Dean Mahomet or
other recourse to evidence and examples. Conclusion As I've demonstrated
in the above argument, Edward Said's Orientalism theory has certain
flaws and weaknesses. However, in spite of these flaws and weaknesses,
there is a also testament to the importance of Said's work. That is, it
provoked such criticism and debate nearly two decades after its
publication.

#### Orientalism is too totalizing of a theory and doesn't allow us to learn about the Middle East

**Jones 8**(Johnathan Jones, 5-22-2008, \"Orientalism is not racism,\"

Romanticised but not out of contempt \... The Snake Charmer by Jean-Léon
Gérôme A woman wraps a giant snake around her nude form as north African
men in a picturesque variety of costumes look on in J-L Gérôme\'s 19th
century painting The Snake Charmer. She stands on a Turkish carpet; the
entire scene is permeated by sexy blue light reflected off a tiled wall.
This is the \"orient\" as imagined by a 19th-century European. You can
see why Penguin in the 1980s chose it as a cover image for the paperback
of the critic Edward W Said\'s famous book Orientalism. **[The
[appositeness of Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, first published in
1978 and one of the most influential books of the last 30 years, **[[to
the present]{.mark} moment [is obvious]{.mark}. Writing at a much
earlier stage in America\'s relationship with the Islamic world, Said
analysed what he claimed to be certain enduring structures of western
thought about the \"orient\". These structures were established by
European intellectuals in the 19th century - he argued - and taken up in
the 20th by American scholars. The Orient]{.underline}**, he suggests,
**[was a lurid fiction of otherness that afforded westerners a valuable
territory of fantasy and desire]{.underline}** - as Tate Britain\'s
exhibition, The Lure of the East: British Orientalist Painting, which
opens on June 4, will surely illustrate. **[And yet, this [western
fascination was in no sense humanising]{.mark}. Orientalism, he argues,
produced not real understanding but knowledge that was power: the racist
claim to omniscience summed up by one of his chapter headings, \"Knowing
the Oriental\".]{.underline}** Advertisement Let me be frank. I think
**[[Orientalism is more than just a bad book]{.mark}. It is a bad book
that [legitimates bad politics]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is a **[[great
wedge of dishonesty that has begat a great mountain of
ignorance]{.mark}. It is a treason of the clerks, an intellectual fraud
that [justifies bigotry and hatred.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Said\'s book
**[licenses the claim that any and all statements by westerners about
the Middle East can be dismissed as worthless and racist. [Anything a
European says]{.mark}]{.underline}** about a range of subjects from the
Pyramids of Giza to the stories of Sinbad the Sailor to the nature of
Islamic art **[can be [assumed]{.mark} from the start by readers of
Orientalism to be [orientalist]{.mark} - or latterly,
Islamophobic.]{.underline}** In fact, the very writers and scholars
analysed by Said tell a different story. One of the first works of
Orientalism that he discusses is the vast Description of Egypt, ordered
by Napoleon and researched by a team of French scholars whose work was
eventually published in a series of monumental volumes by 1828. From
this staggering work, Said quotes no more than a paragraph of its
preface. In this one paragraph, he finds evidence that Napoleon\'s
scholars saw Egypt as a theatre of colonial power. In fact, the
paragraph, itself fairly anodyne, looks irrelevant when you examine the
Description as a whole with its meticulous drawings of stingrays and
snail shells and careful records of engineering machinery used to pump
water from the Nile, ploughing techniques, and costumes. Can all this be
lumped together as one colossal discourse about a fictional Orient? Was
Napoleon saying Egyptians were like fish? Advertisement **[The real
story here]{.underline}**, that Said reveals against his intentions,
**[is the [remarkable fact that Europeans]{.mark} and Americans [in the
19th century knew more about]{.mark} the cultures of [the Middle East
than we do now.]{.mark}]{.underline}** They read the Tales of the 1001
Nights and dreamt of the Alhambra. **[Was this just a complacent
Imperialist celebration of power, based on the contrast between
nostalgia for the great Oriental past and contempt for the Arab present?
No, I think there was real curiosity and admiration. But where has it
gone? [Today the west is bleakly incurious about]{.mark} the history of
[Islam]{.mark}, its art, peoples and learning. There\'s a [blank wall of
terror]{.mark}. This wall has been [strengthened by Said\'s book]{.mark}
because it [closes down a crucial way for cultures to encounter one
another]{.mark}: it closes down [romanticism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
first time I visited Granada and walked through the stucco-laden,
tile-glistening rooms of the Alhambra, I had no doubt this triumph of
medieval Moorish architecture was the most beautiful building I had ever
seen. I also reached quite naturally for \"orientalist\" metaphors to
describe it to myself - in short, I felt like I was riding on a magic
carpet. I still think that\'s a reasonable way to evoke in words the
feeling of lightness the Alhambra creates. To see - and love - Islamic
art in this way is not a style of contempt. **[It is not patronising.
[It is not racist,]{.mark} and it is the very opposite of Islamophobic.
In censoring such longings, [Said\'s book]{.mark} has for 30 years
helped to [ensure that white Europeans]{.mark} and Americans
[become]{.mark} progressively more [ignorant of the Islamic
world]{.mark}. It is a modern classic - of fear and
loathing.]{.underline}**

### AT: Orientalism- Said's"Ideal type"

#### Said's narrative of Orientalism contains a damaging paradox in which he seeks to reject typification of "the orient" yet himself typifies European civilization as an "Ideal Type", an agent of Orientalism creating an essentialist simplification

Sara R. **Farris 10**\[Sara R. Farris, Senior Lecturer in Sociology at
Goldsmiths, University of London , \"AN 'IDEAL TYPE' CALLED
ORIENTALISM\",7-19-2010, Taylor & Francis,
https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/1369801X.2010.489701,
1LEE\]

The 'whole **[[impulse to classify nature and man into
types']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Said 2003: 119), **[[for Said, was one of
the elements that prepared the way for modern Orientalist
structures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 'In natural history, in
**[anthropology, in cultural generalization,]{.underline}** **[a type
had a particular character which provided the observer with a
designation]{.underline}** and, as Foucault says, "a controlled
derivation"' (ibid.). Said goes on to **[[list such designations: 'the
wild men', 'the Europeans', 'the Asiatics']{.underline}]{.mark}** and so
on. The practice of **[[classification]{.mark}, as Said recognized[,
became crucial to sciences]{.mark}]{.underline}**, both natural and
social. However, in the field of the social sciences and humanities it
resulted in the assembly of human/cultural types, thus producing
stereotyped images of cultural collectivities. As we have seen, **[Said
acknowledged that Max [Weber\'s ideal]{.mark} types played a central
role both [in shaping the ways in which classification was employed by
European]{.mark} -- [but also North American]{.mark} [-- social sciences
and in]{.mark} [assembling non-western cultures and individuals into
Orientalized types]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[Said]{.underline}]{.mark}** was thus very insightful when he
**[[recognized a certain instrumental]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
summational function of the **[[notion of the ideal
type.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Its main problem and dangerousness, for
Said, lay in the nature of the ideal type itself, as a way of
simplifying and naturalizing the Other (especially the Oriental Other)
as an articulation of a geographical, historical and sociopolitical
entity with immutable traits. He also recognized the pervasiveness of
this notion in contemporary intellectual work. As he writes, 'still,
th**[e [notion of a type]{.mark} -- Oriental, Islamic, Arab, or whatever
-- endures and [is nourished by similar kinds of abstractions or
paradigms]{.mark} or types [as they emerge out of the modern social
sciences']{.mark} (]{.underline}**Said 2003: 61, my italics).

The characteristics of ideal types as **[the modalities and the outcomes
of conceptualization and classification]{.underline}** proper to social
sciences are the result of Weber\'s epistemological presuppositions.
Ideal types express Weber\'s neo-Kantian conception of the relationship
between reality and knowledge in which the former is a meaningless
infinity in constant change, to which human beings give their own
meanings, and the latter is the rigorous, disciplined capacity of the
scientist to put some order in this chaos. **[[The ideal
type]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[a conceptual construct which is
neither historical reality nor even the 'true'
reality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is even less fitted to serve as a
schema under which a real situation or action is to be subsumed as one
instance. It has the significance of a purely ideal limiting concept
with which the real situation or action is compared and surveyed for the
explication of certain of its significant components. (Weber 1949: 93)

The ideal type thus appears as a 'telescope' or a 'yardstick' (Mommsen
1974) **[[used in order to comprehend reality.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Within Max Weber\'s comparative studies on world religions, the method
of the ideal type functions as a tool for the '**[[conceptualization'
and 'classification' of different social
phenomena]{.underline}]{.mark}** by means of focusing upon a specific
point of view, or 'perspective angle'. Thus Weber applied it in his
historical comparative studies in order to classify religious
prescriptions regarding economic activity into 'types of economic
ethics', and came up with a typification of different societies as those
geoculturally and geopolitically unified constellations that Said
criticized as essentialist and stereotyped.

Each of Weber\'s studies on Weltreligionen thus leads to the
**[[formulation of types of 'civilizations' that in the end seem to be
assumed as uniform and static]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a result, as
many subsequent critics have emphasized, the variables 'time' and
'history' are cancelled from these unifying/essentializing ideal types
(Fischoff 1944; Robertson 1933). Even Parsons had to admit that Weber
'tended to treat typical motives ... as rigidly unchangeable entities
\[and\] used ideal types to atomize his material into rigid units which
could only be combined and recombined in a mechanistic way or absorbed
into higher-order patterns' (Parsons 1963: lxiv).

Said, on the other hand, although he does not offer such an extensive
methodological reflection as Weber, refers explicitly to Foucauldian
concepts of discursive formations in methodological terms. Nonetheless,
**[[several criticisms]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the same kind as those
addressed to Weber\'s ideal types **[[have also been made of Said\'s
multifaceted definition of Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Clifford
1988; Porter 1994). The tendency towards **[a certain semantic [shifting
in his definition of Orientalism]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [association
between very different authors who belonged to very different
countries]{.mark} and epochs are aspects of Said\'s work that have been
criticized]{.underline}** precisely because of a certain ultimate
disregard for the variable 'history'. As Porter has argued,
'\[**[[Said\] fails to historicize adequately the texts he cites and
summarizes, finding always the same triumphant discourse where several
are frequently in conflict']{.underline}]{.mark}** (1994: 160).

We could go further by noting many more similarities between Said\'s
discourse and Weber\'s ideal type. **[[Orientalism shares with Weber\'s
notion of the ideal type]{.mark} the one-sided viewpoint of departure
and focus that [implies the choice of what aspects or objects can enter
into the definition]{.mark}]{.underline}** (or class). Thus, Said chose
to focus on British, French and American Orientalism, while leaving
aside other writings. Like Weber\'s ideal type**[[, Orientalism tries to
view with the same 'telescope' centuries of history and the most
disparate writings and authors, thus often risking annihilating history
and dehistoricizing the object of investigation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Similarly, Weber and Said share an attitude of beginning the
classification with the purpose of providing a historical account of the
object under investigation (namely, the origin of the spirit of
capitalism in Weber, and the origin of Orientalism in Said), thus
attempting to find its starting point. In a further moment, however,
this point is then lost in the beginning of human history. In Weber it
was to be the sixteenth century of the Reformation, but then became the
beginning of rationalization in its march from pre-Christian history
right up until the disenchantment of the world in Protestant Europe. In
Said, Orientalism at one stage is the discourse constructed
'politically, sociologically, militarily, ideologically, scientifically
and imaginatively during the post-Enlightenment period' (Said 2003: 3)
and then progressively goes back to the Middle Ages with Dante Alighieri
and then to that virtual place that Said calls 'imaginative geography',
which makes us set arbitrary boundaries according to a 'universal
practice of designating in one\'s mind a familiar space which is "ours"
and an unfamiliar space beyond "ours" which is "theirs"' (53--9).

In the end, and at a more substantial level, **[[the central similarity
between Weber\'s ideal types of Oriental civilizations and Said\'s ideal
type of Orientalism lies in their very content]{.underline}]{.mark}**:
in their geopolitical and geocultural 'nature' as immutable and
determining traits. The mere fact of belonging to them affects ideas,
cultural and intellectual practices and identities. We might recall that
**[[by 'Orientalism' Said means]{.mark}, among other things, 'European
culture' and '[Western style for dominating, restructuring, and having
authority over the Orient']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Said 2003: 3). Thus
the Orientalist discourse belongs to 'Europe' and the 'West' as
autonomous entities, and it ends up being the ideal type of the attitude
adopted by westerners towards the Orient, in a pure geocultural,
crystallized fashion. Said\'s (and several postcolonials') **[[tendency
to treat Orientalism as a geographical and 'civilizational'
entity]{.mark}]{.underline}** has been brilliantly highlighted by
Fernando Coronil (1996) and Neil Lazarus (2002). The former notes how
'typical markers of collective identities, such as "territory",
"culture", "history" or "religion" appear as autonomous
entities ... \[and\] as with commodities, the material thing-like,
tangible form of geographical entities becomes **[[a privileged medium
to represent the less tangible historical relations among
peoples']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Coronil 1996: 77). As a consequence,
**[[the Orientalist typifying or summational
attitude,]{.underline}]{.mark}** strongly criticized by Said for the
generalizations and essentialization of the non-western territories and
cultures it provided**[[, is the expression of a territorial entity
itself, a territorial entity]{.mark} [which in turn has been unified and
generalized by Said in a common type: European
culture.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Said was certainly correct to identify in the European social sciences
dealing with non-western societies and in particular Weber\'s ideal
types the danger of essentialist simplification that, at its core, was
informed by a Eurocentric attitude. Nonetheless, **[[when he accused
Eurocentrism of essentializing non-western
societies,]{.underline}]{.mark}** of neutralizing their internal
differences and their history, of addressing artificial entities such as
the 'Orient' or 'Islam' and the like, **[[he himself ran the risk of an
essentialist simplication]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is to say that he
committed the error of adopting a similar conceptual structure in
relation to Europe or the West, conceived as geographical, geopolitical,
geocultural abstract categories.

Beyond Orientalism

As Said clearly recognized, the most important task of all would be that
of undertaking 'studies in contemporary alternatives to Orientalism, to
ask how one can study other cultures and peoples from a libertarian, or
a non-repressive and non-manipulative, perspective' (Said 2003: 24).
This is certainly a difficult task, for which answers on the level of
meta-reflection -- epistemological and/or methodological -- seem to be
inadequate and misleading.21 **[[Said]{.underline}]{.mark}** was well
aware of the importance of such a task; indeed, his critique of the
manipulative and repressive depictions produced by European scholars
during centuries of uneven relations between the West and the East was
designed precisely in order to open the space for such non-repressive
perspectives. Nonetheless, while conducting this critique, he
**[[employed a methodological and theoretical
apparatus]{.underline}]{.mark}** much **[closer to that which he
criticized than he thought.]{.underline}**

The concept of **[[discursive formation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, used by
Said in order **[[to describe Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** both
**[[as the discourse produced by colonial rulers]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** as the **[[discourse that performatively
produced them]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[recalls]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Weber\'s analysis of **[[the active dimension of the relationship
between religion and political power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
pattern of thought seems to affect also their reciprocal anti-Marx (and
anti-Marxist) critique, as well as a certain epistemic ambiguity
according to which representation is never, and can never be,
'objective' or 'true'. At the same time, both affirm that the task of
the intellectual is to speak 'truth' to power and politics. In this way,
**[[the realm of politics becomes the locus]{.mark} in which determining
decisions that 'truly' act upon reality can be made.]{.underline}**

Yet, in the last instance, the decisive affinity between Weber and Said
lies in the way in which both conceptualized their object of enquiry:
**[[Said]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not less than Weber, **[[produced an
'ideal type' of the West as the geographical, geocultural and
geopolitical agent of Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, while
the formulation of a 'civilizational' and 'geocultural' ideal type was
precisely Weber\'s goal, in his search for the origin of Europe\'s
accomplishments in comparison to the East, Said\'s goal was that of
demolishing this 'civilizational' attitude that, according to him,
helped to immortalize the Orient as the static, geocultural entity thus
depicted by European writers. The conceptual coordinates that he
employed for **[[his analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, arguably
**[[run the risk of unwittingly reinforcing]{.mark}]{.underline}** such
**[['civilizational' attitudes]{.underline}]{.mark}**.22

**[[This internal paradox strongly weakens Said\'s
critique]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not only in intellectual terms, as a
source of contradictions or incoherence, but especially **[[on the level
of what his critique aimed to be]{.underline}]{.mark}**: that is, **[an
instrument for the pursuit of studies not affected by a manipulative and
repressive perspective]{.underline}**. If the origin of this
manipulative perspective is thought to lie in a sort of geographical
entity, or immutable 'cultural' essence (regardless of whether it is the
European or the Oriental), it obviously becomes much more difficult, if
not **[[impossible, to produce a counter-non-manipulative perspective
from within]{.underline}]{.mark}**.23 Said\'s critique has been
important for the humanities and social theory as a stimulus for
rethinking some foundational categories and in terms of disciplining a
certain politico-theoretical 'arrogance'. The time has perhaps come,
however, to **[[rethink the terms of this critique
itself,]{.underline}]{.mark}** if we are to find a way to move beyond
the 'ideal type' -- and reality -- **[[that lies at the heart of
Orientalism.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[What is to be gained from a relational approach to digital
sovereignty?]{.underline}** This article argued that
**[[centering]{.mark} the relationship between the [national Self and
its Others]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [analysis of national digital
sovereignty elucidates why and how it emerges and develops.
This]{.mark}]{.underline}** argument **[[bridges two]{.mark} established
[claims]{.mark} from constructivist theories of culture and
tech]{.underline}**nology. **[[One is that national identity as]{.mark}
articulated and [propagated by governing elites guides the state's
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nological program. **[[Another is that
identity is]{.mark} an [inherently relational]{.mark}
category]{.underline}** that is **[[maintained through continuous
boundary making between the Self and its Others.]{.mark} Taken together,
[these]{.mark} claims [indicate]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[[it is
analytically productive and]{.underline}]{.mark}** sometimes
**[[imperative to attend to relational dynamics between the national
Self and its Others to grasp the logics of digital
sovereignty.]{.underline}]{.mark}** To illustrate this proposition, this
article traced how Estonia's cultural constructions of its Russian and
Western Others shaped the contours of its digital sovereignty. It showed
that Estonia's digital initiatives, which are often couched in
technofuturistic postnational discourse, are meant to reaffirm Estonia's
sovereign territorialized existence within the Euro-Atlantic community.

Whereas this article examined digital sovereignty as an elite political
project manifested in highlevel official discourses and institutions,
**[[the relational lens's theoretical and methodological versatility
opens the door for diverse]{.underline}]{.mark}** scholarly
**[[approaches]{.mark} to digital sovereignty. [Ethnographies of
infrastructure]{.mark}, for example, [can investigate Self-Other
dynamics in]{.mark} the [everyday]{.mark} workings of [digital
sovereignty, what]{.mark} cultural anthropologist of technology [Alix
Johnson]{.mark}]{.underline}** (2021) **[[conceptualizes]{.mark}
as]{.underline}** the **["[mechanics of]{.mark} [sovereignty]{.mark}."
This]{.underline}** approach **[[treats sovereignty as a process of
material construction and explores its constitutive people and
practices]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Lorraine Kaljund (2018), for instance,
draws on participant observation and interviews with the developers of a
recent e-Estonia initiative, data embassy, to explore how this team
embeds ethnocentric Estonian statehood into the project's software,
code, and policy.

**[[Another dimension]{.underline}]{.mark}** to consider **[[is domestic
power struggles over competing constructions of Otherness and
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology. **[[Analyses of debates]{.mark} and
decision making [surrounding digital]{.mark} [sovereignty]{.mark},
particularly]{.underline}** the **[[use of Othering to legitimize one's
technological agenda]{.mark}, [illuminate]{.mark} [how and why some
ideas but not others become state rhetoric and
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The official e-Estonia narrative
retroactively frames Estonia's digital turn as a self-evident response
to Soviet occupation and a reflection of ethnic Estonians' natural
predisposition toward technology. Yet, when Estonia's ruling coalition
first promoted the project of digital transformation in the early 1990s,
as part of their Western-oriented ethnocentric platform, it was not
uniformly supported across the political spectrum. How did e-Estonia
become political dogma, the questioning of which is seen as tantamount
to undermining Estonia's Euro-Atlantic credentials and benefiting
Russia? **[[Detailing national technopolitical struggles]{.mark} would
[help]{.mark} [show digital sovereignty as always a product of political
contention]{.mark}, including over membership in the national imagined
community.]{.underline}**

**[Further, [sociological approaches]{.mark} might [explore how
Self-Other dynamics manifest]{.mark} within the circles
[directly]{.mark} involved [in]{.mark} the [making]{.mark} of [digital
sovereignty. Historically, dominant ethnic and political elites excluded
their Others from creating and enjoying tech]{.mark}nological
[innovation on par with the privileged group]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Edgerton, 2006, pp. 131--136). Scholars of e-Estonia note that the
country's digital elite---entrepreneurs, developers, policy
makers---remain almost exclusively ethnically Estonian (Kattel & Mergel,
2019, p. 147) and that national digitization does not benefit the social
and professional standing of ethnic Estonians and Russians equally
(Drechsler, 2018, p. 13). In Estonia and elsewhere, **[future research
could employ the relational lens in examining the [structural barriers
to participation in the making of digital sovereignty and]{.mark} the
[consequences of]{.mark} such [representational
imbalances.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Specific manifestations of Self-Other dynamics on digital sovereignty
will vary across national contexts. [The analytical task of the
relational approach is to discover and conceptualize Others and then
empirically demonstrate their material significance for digital
sovereignty]{.mark}. Beyond the nation-state, the relational approach
potentially applies to other types of digital sovereignty conceptualized
by scholars, such as municipal, personal, indigenous, corporate, and
others.]{.underline}**

### Essentialism DA

#### Essentialism DA: Said's analysis of hegemonic discourses creates a binary of East and West which serves to uphold the very westernism he criticizes -- takes out any links to hegemony too

**Potter 19**(Naomi Potter, Orientalism: in review, Jan 15, 2019,
https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lseupr/2019/01/15/orientalism-in-review/)**//BRownRice**

**[[Said's essentialising of the Western scholars does not constitute
the start and end of his problems in Orientalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Turning to Said's **[[(mis)use]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Antonio
Gramsci's **[[concept of hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}** can help us to
**[[illustrate]{.underline}]{.mark}** instances of
**[[essentialism]{.mark} in categories of East and West in
Orientalism]{.underline}** which goes beyond Western scholars. **[[Said
draws on]{.mark} the role of [hegemony, the presence]{.mark} and
construction [of 'certain cultural]{.mark} [forms which dominate over
others']{.mark}]{.underline}** (2003: 6-7) **[in order [to
demonstrate]{.mark} how [Orientalism]{.mark} managed to take a sustained
position as the [hegemonic discourse]{.mark}, being [internalised by
Western and Eastern cultures alike]{.mark}.]{.underline}** However,
**[[Said does not explore]{.mark} the concept [fully]{.mark}, in
particular he [fails to offer]{.mark} the necessary [depth in Gramsci's
concept of hegemony]{.mark} as distinct from those such as Hegel and
Marx.]{.underline}** For Gramsci, **[[hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
unlike mere domination, **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** not something held
over another group but rather **[[the result of complex
interplay]{.mark} of societal forces and groups]{.underline}** (Stein
and Swedenburg, 2004: 9-10). Hence, Gramsci had a **[[unique focus
on]{.mark} the active nature of [counter-hegemony]{.mark} in history:
its role in the 'war of positions' which helps to [determine]{.mark} the
[character of]{.mark} the [hegemonic forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Chalcraft and Noorani, 2007). A **[complete Gramscian analysis of
hegemony would therefore offer great depth in studying counter-hegemonic
forces as active, autonomous agents in terms of their role, position and
culture]{.underline}** (ibid.). There seems to be a **[distinct lack of
reference to such agency of subaltern groups in [Said's
work]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Ahmad, 1992: 108). Given the time in which
Said was writing and the proliferation of such forces this **[does
[not]{.mark} seem [acceptable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For instance,
James McDougal illustrates the influence that religio-cultural
resistance of Islamic Algerians had on French colonial policy and the
distinctive practice by which the French ruled; such as citizenship
policies regarding the settlers vis-à-vis the colonized (Chalcraft and
Noorani, 2007, 49-66). These Islamic liberation forces such as the
Association of Algerian Muslims had been active for decades before
Orientalism was published (ibid: 56). **[Said [misses]{.mark} the
[importance of the agency of counter-hegemonic forces]{.mark} in terms
of the nature and force of hegemony itself. This has the unfortunate
impact in his work of reflecting a specific idea of the eastern world as
passive and incapacitated, paradoxically leading to the assumption he
wants to criticise: that of an eternally distinct and less powerful
Eastern region.]{.underline}** The essentialist implications of Said's
misuse of Gramsci's concept of hegemony do not end here, however.
**[[Hegemony does not concern just polarized forces but also the way in
which it persists in culture within society at
large]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Said often **[refers in his work to the
role of literature and culture, however, in this exploration he neglects
to consider the many different forms in which culture is constructed,
beyond the dominating group itself.]{.underline}** Melman, in observing
the role of women in constructing parts of the Oriental narrative,
highlights how **['[Europe's attitude towards the Orient was neither
unified nor monolithic']{.mark}]{.underline}** (1992: 7). **[In
particular, she [turns to the role of women from]{.mark} [the
West]{.mark} in depicting Eastern regions. The [perspectives]{.mark} of
these women often [included]{.mark} more [richer self-criticism]{.mark}
towards cultural superiority.]{.underline}** Gramsci's account of
hegemony necessarily involves an extension of analysis to include this
intersectional group who are a subset of the bloc of Europeans who
explored, observed and studies the Middle East in the colonial period.
**[In ignoring the role of women in the construction of Western hegemony
Said makes uncritical assumptions about the core features of Western
culture, locating them in the writings of academics throughout history
and thus essentialising the notion of the 'West' as a perpetually
dominating and uniform region of the world.]{.underline}** Conclusion
**[[Said]{.mark}'s failure to fully utilise the theoretical richness of
the theories and concepts which lay the foundations for his account led
him to [essentialise]{.mark} the categories of [East and West]{.mark} in
Orientalism.]{.underline}** Firstly, in using historical methodology,
Said obscures his attempts at a Foucauldian discourse analysis
generating a historical account which does not do enough to interrogate
the mechanisms by which Orientalism comes about, seemingly presupposing
their existence in Western scholarly writing. Furthermore, this is only
made worse by his neglect of important aspects of the building of
hegemonic discourses which leads him to simplify both Western and
Eastern cultural production, making uncritical assumptions about their
core features of these categories and the extent of variation within
them. Both these errors lead to a paradoxical account from Said as his
intentions were not only to avoid such essentialist narratives but also
to critique them. **[Despite these intentions however his treatment of
East and West does suffer due to his theoretical shortcomings leading to
essentialist construction of the categories.]{.underline}**

### Binary DA

#### **Orientalism causes the problems it attempts to prevent by exacerbating divisions between the east and west**

Back to the Social Sciences **[[When it comes to the immediate reception
of Edward's work, it was not only many Orientalists, or
near-Orientalists, who were upset but also many well versed in what they
regarded as a progressive science of society.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
This certainly applied to persons such as Harry Magdoff, the New York
editor of the Monthly Review, who asked me to review Orientalism, a book
about which he had very mixed feelings. It was also true of colleagues
such as Fred Halliday, who argued that **[[Orientalism]{.mark} could
easily be read as [creating]{.mark} an irreconcilable [division between
East and West]{.mark}, thereby [undermining]{.mark} one of the basic
features of our [universalistic approach.]{.mark}]{.underline}** No less
telling was Fred's second argument that, for many peoples of the Middle
East in the 1970s, works by **[the scholars Edward defined as
[Orientalists]{.mark} were [sometimes the only source of data for
understanding large parts of their own]{.mark} national
[history]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Al-Azm was to make the same point only
a few years later. Several enormously important implications follow. The
first is that **[[we need]{.mark} the social sciences in Middle East
studies not just for their own sake, but also to be able [to continue
to]{.mark} make [use]{.mark} of [works by persons we regard as
Orientalists]{.mark}, though [without falling prey to]{.mark} their
[assumptions and reductionism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is the more
significant as **[[our]{.mark} own [thinking contains]{.mark} either
unexamined [assumptions from the Orientalist period]{.mark} or, at the
very least, questions which we cannot help students to answer properly
because we do not know how to frame them or where to look for
answers.]{.underline}** A good example of this is what used to be called
Islamic legal studies, studied only through certain canonic texts, and
posited on the notion that the master story was one in which modern
legal codes imported tout court from the West quickly supplanted
so-called traditional Shari'a law, confining it simply to the area of
personal status.

### AT: Digital Orientalism

#### Digital orientalism is not the driver behind hardline US foreign policy against China -- American trust in the technological leadership of other Asian countries such as South Korea prove that it isn't orientalism but rather the existential security threat from Chinese hacking and intellectual theft that necessitates US action. 

**Moore '22** \[Gregory J. Moore; Professor of Global Studies and
Politics, Colorado Christian University; 6-3-22; "Huawei,
Cyber-Sovereignty and Liberal Norms: China's Challenge to the
West/Democracies";

accessed 7-19-2022; AH\]

Said's orientalism construct \[26\] is an important contribution to the
study of colonialism, post-colonial thought, international relations and
sociology. There is no reason to challenge it here. It's application to
the digital realm is an interesting and important one. The premise of
the editors of this special issue is that the West expected China to
evolve into a liberal democracy, but that this has not happened, and
moreover this (from the West's perspective "fundamentally illegitimate")
power has been able to increasingly compete head to head with the US and
the West in military, political, economic and technological terms, and
this has created deep fear among Western/democratic leaders. **[[Fear
is]{.mark} a [key part of]{.mark} this [orientalist narrative]{.mark}.
The argument is that it is fear of this digital, political and cultural
other that drives a tough US, Australian, British (for example) policy
toward China, and drives a harsh stand toward Huawei.]{.underline}** To
set this up in a cause and effect framework, then **[[digital
orientalism is]{.mark} the independent [variable that causes fear
in]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} and others [towards China, that brings
about]{.mark} the dependent variable, [harsh policies toward
China]{.mark} and Huawei specifically]{.underline}**. What this would
mean is that other factors would not explain the dependent variable, the
harsh US/Western policy toward Huawei. The question we will pose here
is, is this correct? **[[There are several]{.mark} potential [problems
with this]{.mark} argument. First, [establishing]{.mark} that [fear is
an independent variable is not easy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Despite the
quality of their work generally speaking, the editors have not done the
thick description necessary to establish this. **[[Simply showing tough
rhetoric]{.mark}, hawkish views [on the US]{.mark}/Western/democratic
[side]{.mark} (which are indeed there), [does not]{.mark} really [do the
job effectively]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Second, **[[we]{.mark} [haven't
considered counterfactuals]{.mark} or ruled out other methods
[that]{.mark} might test our hypothesis or [do a better job explaining
the outcome]{.mark} we observe (the harsh US/Western policy toward
Huawei) [than]{.mark} the proposed independent variable, [digital
orientalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Following on from this point, I
would propose a consideration of the hypothesized independent variable,
"**[[China]{.mark} and Huawei [pose credible threats to national
security of the US]{.mark} and other democracies" as a way to understand
the approach the US, Australia, the UK and others have taken toward
Huawei.]{.underline}** Securitization provides a way of looking at this
issue that is helpful in this case. As Buzan, Waever and de Wilde \[3:
25\] put it, Securitization is constituted by the intersubjective
establishment of an existential threat with a saliency sufficient to
have substantial political effects...The way to study securitization is
to study discourse and political constellations: When does an argument
with this particular rhetorical and semiotic structure achieve
sufficient effect to make an audience tolerate violations of rules that
would otherwise have to be obeyed? **[There can be no doubt that [in the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, Australia, India and other countries,
[Huawei's 5G offerings have been securitized]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and
this is evident by the "discourse and political constellations" in those
and other countries, as I've illustrated above. **[Yet [why hasn't this
been the case in all countries]{.mark}?]{.underline}** As Buzan et al.
note, referencing the work of Arnold Wolfers \[3: 30\], security threats
may be objective/real, or subjective/perceived, and where the twain meet
or diverge is not always easy to ascertain. **[It is possible that A.
[China's Huawei is acting as a threat in some countries and not in
others]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It's also possible that B. China's Huawei
and its 5G are a threat wherever they operate but some countries don't
yet understand that or don't believe it. It's also possible that C.
Huawei and its 5G are not a threat and have simply been socially
constructed as a threat, needlessly securitized. The notion that digital
orientalism is the reason for the securitization of Huawei and its 5G
would line up with the last tack, or C. The argument presented here,
however, is that [di**gital [orientalism does not explain]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark}/Western/democratic [response to China's growing illiberal
impact]{.mark} on global internet governance or its worrisome presence,
via Huawei, in more and more national 5G internet infrastructure
schemes**]{.underline}. On the contrary, the hypothesis posed here is
something like B. above, **[that real security concerns do, that the
[securitization]{.mark} of Huawei [is not an irrational response to
Huawei]{.mark} 5G [because of]{.mark} 1. some of [Huawei's]{.mark}
actions/[track record]{.mark}, 2. the nature of its [relations
with]{.mark} the [Chinese state]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} 3. the track
record or broader [actions]{.mark} (now and in the past) of that Chinese
state at home and abroad [as it]{.mark} [regards]{.mark} media
[freedoms, intellectual property theft, human rights problems]{.mark},
and more.]{.underline}** Having said this, digital (or conventional)
orientalism may be lurking in the background and exacerbating
technological and political dynamics. I suspect it is. The editors are
likely not incorrect in that sense, for certainly there is a sense that
China represents a "digital other," a "political other" and a "cultural
other" for Westerners and Liberals in general, and the notion of digital
orientalism may explain certain aspects of that. At the same time, the
argument presented here is that a careful study of **[[China's practices
in the cyber-realm]{.mark}, whether at home or abroad,Footnote9 [make it
clear]{.mark} that [there are]{.mark} very clear [security-centric
reasons for]{.mark} concern about [China's]{.mark} and Huawei's presence
in 5G [internet infrastructure construction]{.mark}, mobile phone
handset production]{.underline}**, and even Chinese apps like TikTok and
WeChat, which India has banned, and both of which the Trump
Administration tried but failed to ban in the US. US, Australian,
British, Swedish and other countries' increasingly robust **[pushback
against Huawei and other Chinese players in the construction of global
5G infrastructure can be easily understood by studying A. China's cyber
practices at home and abroad, and B. the impact they have on the
security (and perceptions of security) of nations they work with. Very
simply, those pushing back see what China is doing, they don't like it,
and they don't want Chinese companies to have any major role in
constructing telecommunications infrastructure inside their
countries.]{.underline}** This is because they believe they know what
that will lead to, and they don't believe that is good from their
perspectives. If China/Huawei was a player like Nokia, Ericsson or
Samsung, the US and these others would not be raising alarms. **[In
fact, the [US]{.mark}, Australia and UK [have not been raising alarms
about Nokia]{.mark}, Ericsson [or Samsung]{.mark}, the other major
players in 5G. Why? Is it digital orientalism? In fact, [given]{.mark}
that [Samsung is Korean, one might expect]{.mark} the [US to push back
against Samsung, for it too is "oriental,"]{.mark}
non-Western]{.underline}**, following the logic of Said. **[[We
don't]{.mark} really [see that]{.mark}, however. [South Korea is a
democratic polity]{.mark} and a US ally, [so there is no]{.mark} angst
on Washington's part, no [concerns about security]{.mark}. Moreover, the
[South Korea]{.mark}n government [does not have]{.mark} a [history of
stealing US IPR, of spying on the US as China has]{.mark} been, or doing
anything that could be considered a national security threat toward the
US, so there has been no pushback from Washington in the face of
Samsung's growing presence in the US or in US 5G operations. [Some
argue]{.mark} that the [US]{.mark} simply [refuses to yield]{.mark} the
[number one spot]{.mark} to anyone, whether in technology or in economic
dominance. [Yet if]{.mark} the [US was pushing back]{.mark} against
Huawei [because]{.mark} the US wanted to be number one, because the [US
wanted to dominate, why wouldn't]{.mark} the US fund AT&T, Apple, Google
or someone else in the US to be number one? Why wouldn't the [US]{.mark}
[hinder]{.mark} the advances of Nokia, Ericsson and/or [Samsung]{.mark}
in the US and elsewhere? We don't really see any of that, however.
Digital [orientalism doesn't]{.mark} really [explain
this]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in this case. I will argue here that it's
because first, **[American thinkers do not think in such hierarchical
terms as their Chinese counterparts do (they aren't unified in an
obsession with being number 1 as is the case with the Chinese state and
its companies; see]{.underline}** \[18\]. Second, **[the US is not
pushing back against Huawei primarily because of market
imperatives/motivations, but rather because of concerns about security
and lack of trust in the Chinese state and Chinese companies that are
subject thereto]{.underline}**. The **[[US trusts]{.mark} the leadership
of [Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung]{.mark}, and [they don't see
their]{.mark} home [governments]{.mark} (Finland, Sweden and South
Korea]{.underline}**, respectively) as **[bent on [spying, stealing IPR
and undermining free expression]{.mark}]{.underline}** at home and
increasingly around the world. **[[It's about]{.mark} the
[Chin]{.mark}ese st[a]{.mark}te's [very bad]{.mark} track [record of
stealing intellectual property, of suppressing free expression,
of]{.mark} cyber-surveillance and [hacking, of suppressing truth]{.mark}
and suppressing dissidents -- increasingly not only inside China but
abroad as well]{.underline}**.Footnote10 **[[Pushing back
against]{.mark} Huawei and [China's cyber-sovereignty]{.mark} model [has
become an existential fight]{.mark} for those who see things in the way
I have depicted here.]{.underline}** In a telling statement by former

Malaysia, and Vietnam indicate growing PRC harassment of their fishing

given that Indonesia and the PRC do not have overlapping territorial

Indian and Chinese troops.\[]{.underline}**11\] **[Current [PRC behavior

well. **[[Australia reports economic pressure for not conforming to

such issues do not receive more treatment by Chan is curious since they
raise questions about PRC's commitment to self-restraint and can
potentially trigger the chain-ganging effects on U.S.-China ties that
Chan warns readers about (21-22, 211-215). Such friction can potentially
harden positions and raise the stakes over an issue such that prevailing
becomes more tied to status and other concerns, driving more aggressive
and even revisionist behavior.\[15\] **[Chan's finding that [misplaced
worries about]{.mark} the [PRC]{.mark} [and]{.mark} its
[intentions]{.mark} stem in part from [misunderstandings of]{.mark}
perspectives on [international politics]{.mark} that are [informed by
theories from "the West"]{.mark} rather than China deserves elaboration
and debate. So-called "Western" international relations theories often
have parallels in the Chinese tradition, broadly
construed.]{.underline}** Work analyzing Spring and Autumn, Warring
States, Song, and Ming documents indicate that the strategic thought
that is prominent in these periods closely resembles statecraft familiar
to those in the contemporary "West."\[16\] **[Texts as varied as the
Han-era annals Records of the Grand Historian and the Ming-era fiction
Romance of the Three Kingdoms will suggest the
same.]{.underline}**\[17\] **[[Parallels between "Western" and "Chinese"
approaches to politics are unsurprising.]{.mark} Several millennia of
collective human experience, thought, and debate over statecraft,
conflict, as well as governance are almost certainly bound to produce
similarities in responses. [Dividing the world into "Western" and
"Chinese"]{.mark} views of the world [ignores]{.mark} the fact the
[PRC]{.mark} has [disagreements with]{.mark} ostensibly
["non-Western"]{.mark} polities such as India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea,
and Vietnam, each with their own distinct philosophical
traditions.\[]{.underline}**18\] Also, despite sharing cultural origins,
people in the **[PRC and]{.underline}** on **[Taiwan disagree
fundamentally issues of political values and rights, not the relatively
simple issues of who should rule China or what a Chinese state should
entail geographically.]{.underline}**\[19\] Moreover, the PRC's ruling
Chinese Communist Party draws at least some of its inspiration from
European thinkers in the form of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.
Successive dynasties from historical China also proved themselves very
adept at conquest---that is how regimes and empires get built.\[20\]
Attributing tensions between the United States and PRC to culture
suggests an overly monolithic view of the rich and varied philosophical
and political traditions both major powers draw from, giving them less
credit than is due.\[21\] **[[To claim]{.mark} that contemporary
international scholarship and [U.S. policy]{.mark} are [unable to

[Orientalizing]{.mark}, it can [encourage]{.mark} a [misplaced
expectation]{.mark} that understanding can bring some sort of happy,
mutually acceptable outcome. Perhaps Beijing and Washington understand
each other well.]{.underline}** They simply disagree fundamentally over
values and interests in ways that make finding mutually acceptable
accommodation increasingly difficult. This does not have to imply that
either side is morally superior or normatively "better" than the other,
just that understanding provides little promise for improving relations
and avoiding confrontation. Better accounting for such possibilities
invites fuller consideration of the roles that agency and contingency
play in major power relations, two features that Chan clearly identifies
as critical in the volume. **[Thucydides's Trap? deserves much credit
for grappling with important, pressing, and difficult questions about
the drivers behind the downturn in U.S.-China relations and possible
ways to address this slide. Yet, Chan's outlook is more similar to
Graham Allison's than he initially lets on. Allison's call for creative
statecraft is possible only if the United States and China are not
locked in a structural situation which neither can escape or beset by
contingent circumstances that prevents Washington and Beijing from
effectively exercising the agency Chan believes is
central.]{.underline}** Chan offers some insight when he points to
divergences in perspectives between Washington and Beijing but may be
overly limiting the ways he conceives of effects of culture and
socialization. Likewise, the **[volume can go further in conceptualizing
the various ways third parties such as regional actors and international
organizations can affect U.S.-China ties, given that world politics is
not just major powers going at each other---a fact both Chan and Allison
recognize. Major power interactions simply do not occur in a vacuum.
Such dynamics may reinforce competition as much as ameliorate them, but
their effects await further clarification and
explanation.]{.underline}**

The key point here is not to debate the pros and cons of these changes
but to note that since Liberation (1949) and especially 1978,
**[[China]{.mark} has [rapidly developed as an advanced technological
society]{.mark}. This development is vital for independence and security
but also a key source of global technological culture. This
[transformation]{.mark} is [not confirmed solely]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
China's [advances in tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nologies, for example,
e.g., quantum computing, artificial intelligence, green energy and space
exploration, or social media. **[[Rather]{.mark}, [in tandem with
China's advanced social and political organization]{.mark}, we can
[note]{.mark}]{.underline}** the widespread presence of **[the [modern
cogito--consciousness,]{.mark} all of which reflect industrial
ratiocination, industrial production, industrial
education]{.underline}** and so on, and **[all of which are consistent
with technological society]{.underline}** \[41, 51\].

Western theorists have long debated the utopian and dystopian aspects
associated with becoming a technological society. **[In the East, in
many instances, modernity emerged at speed when possible to counter
Western tech-supported imperialism]{.underline}** \[81\]; **[but [in the
West]{.mark}, the [development]{.mark} of technological society was
[always resisted by]{.mark} and in negotiations with [traditional values
and practices.]{.mark} [Even]{.mark} in [modern Western
philosophy]{.mark}, the critical tradition [has regarded technological
advances as being mostly negative.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Ellul's
critique and **[Heidegger]{.underline}**'s nightmare have already been
mentioned, but these were inspired by Friedrich Nietzsche, and before
him, Søren Kierkegaard, who saw in 'modern man' an abomination of being
\[3, 18, 79\]. In the post-war period, these concerns were expressed by
the Frankfurt School, but also in Michel Foucault's works, which equated
modernity with totalizing systems of control, with an unrestrained
biopolitics and governmentality manifesting in modern schools,
hospitals, prisons and so on, all of which were driven by the
psychological and physical discipline imposed by the modern market
economy \[55\]. Like **[Nietzsche]{.underline}**,
**[Foucault]{.underline}** romanticized certain aspects of Platonic and
Stoic philosophy, while **[Kierkegaard and Ellul]{.underline}** did
something similar with Christianity---with Ellul going so far as to
describe mankind in modern technological society as the "new demons," as
"mature insects that have nothing left to do but reproduce themselves
and die" (\[13\] vii). In short, **[these theorists have had a profound
influence on Western society]{.underline}**, and all the more so
**[because their [critiques]{.mark} [reflected]{.mark} the [deep
existential fears associated with Western modernity]{.mark}: these have
[included an Orientalist pride in the West for creating modernity,
and]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[unease]{.mark} that [this creation
inescapably has always been]{.mark} a double-movement of [the becoming
and unbecoming of the West itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, a different critical
tradition was **[[established]{.underline}]{.mark}** as **[a [solution
to]{.mark} the]{.underline}** even bigger **[[existential crisis of
foreign domination]{.mark}. On the one hand]{.underline}**, the
**[prolif]{.underline}**eration **[of]{.underline}** Marxism and
especially **[[Marxism-Leninism]{.underline}]{.mark}** substantially
**[[normalized tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological **[[development
as]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[[historically
necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}** step **[for human
progress]{.underline}**, one that **[[viewed
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology **[[and consciousness as advancing and
converging as and through the state itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}** On
the other hand, **[this was not deeply at odds with Chinese tradition,
particularly]{.underline}** the **[Confucian]{.underline}** tradition,
one **[in which]{.underline}** technique in the form of **[ritual (li)
was to be perfected by the individual, whether the emperor, the
gentleman, the father, as exemplars of the ritual that constituted an
advanced state of being]{.underline}** (e.g., see \[50\]). **[Thus,
while some]{.underline}** Chinese **[traditions]{.underline}** certainly
**[resisted development, [China's rapid advancement as a technological
society finds accordance with its traditional and modern philosophical
perspectives on human progress]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and **[[not just
the existential necessity of closing the tech]{.mark}nology [gap to
establish and sustain sovereignty]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

It's **[in this context]{.underline}** that we can view **[broad popular
support for Chinese development as a technological society in China
itself in terms of high rates of new technology adoption]{.underline}**
\[39\], **[popular support for scientific solutions]{.underline}** to
problems, **[and mass positive engagement in public policies that aim
for social advances consistent with]{.underline}** both **[individual
and national transformations]{.underline}** that are
**[forward-reaching, tech-based and]{.underline}**
tech-**[oriented]{.underline}** \[70\]---**[exemplified most recently by
broad popular support for China's "dynamic zero-covid
policies"]{.underline}** (dongtai qingling).

**[display]{.underline}** with **[broad pushbacks over attempts to
formulate effective responses to]{.underline}** the
**[COVID-19]{.underline}** pandemic, **[[we see the opposite in
China]{.mark}. [Broad popular support has greeted, effectively demanded
and made possible dynamic zero-covid policies, along with the rapid
development and deployment of zero-covid
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nologies \[29\]. **[This does not
mean]{.underline}** that **[Chinese people have liked the
costs]{.underline}** associated with the policies \[78\], **[but they
have preferred]{.underline}** the **[benefits over]{.underline}** the
**[absence of effective controls]{.underline}** \[35\]. And **[before
this, surveys indicate]{.underline}** approximately **[80% of
respondents]{.underline}** have **[supported]{.underline}** the
**[development and implementation of China's "social credit
system"]{.underline}** (shehui xinyong tixi), **[although the system is
still incomplete]{.underline}** and some doubt it will achieve its
stated objectives, or do so with reasonable risks to personal privacy
\[33\].

To be fair, **[[not all innovations are popular]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
For example, although it's still early days in the development and
roll-out of China's new digital yuan (shuzi renminbi), anecdotal reports
suggest less than enthusiastic receptions among the general public.
**[Nevertheless, [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**-oriented **[[innovations
are popularly understood as essential for improved governance, including
anti-corruption efforts, poverty alleviation, and market
management]{.mark}, and [they are reinforced with popular regulations
designed to limit the power of tech firms and harmful social
effects]{.mark} associated with tech]{.underline}**nology, like
unhealthy screen times among school age children. Furthermore, **[big
tech advances, like 5G, are celebrated, and names like Huawei are
embraced as a matter of national pride, with domestic sales soaring in
response to international rejections]{.underline}** of the same. **[The
key point]{.underline}** here **[is that [China's actualization as a
technological society that advances with
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology **[[is broadly
popular]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that it's **[[even valorized]{.mark} by
Chinese theorists [as consistent with]{.mark} the [rise of an
"intelligent civilization"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (zhineng wenming), one
**[in which both governance and daily life are substantially supported
by big data, a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence
**[and other forms of digitalization]{.underline}** \[20, 84\], and
**[[consistent with Marxist theories of social
progress]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[76\].

**[This isn't to say that there are no pushbacks, no traditional values
opposing, or again, that we don't see periodic attempts to regulate and
dismantle some technologies and tech firms.]{.underline}** This has
happened quite publicly with new laws policies directed at digital
monopolies and anti-trust practices undercutting fair competition and
governance, as well as other developments considered harmful to social
and individual well-being. This was observed in enforcements against
Alibaba in 2021, with implications for other firms (in 2022, new
policies were announced to ease some big tech restrictions to help
bolster an economy battered by lockdowns, but this does not signal a
significant reversal of capacity or direction). Broadly, these
regulations coincided with new laws related to digital finance and
cryptocurrencies, but also video gaming, including limiting
inappropriate content and imposing strict limits on children's playing
times (2021). Those policies were paired that same year with strict
limits directed at buke---after-school study programs---which along with
video games were assessed as having reached a tipping point of negative
health effects and declining standardized test scores. In fact, these
were new attempts at earlier policies with similar goals, e.g., efforts
to limit teachers from assigning students unregulated, "off-the-books"
homework through social media (initiated in 2018, and reinforced in
2021).

**[Overall, these policies were responses to pressures building over
many years in different sectors]{.underline}**. It bears noting that
**[in the case of policies affecting children]{.underline}**, there had
long been efforts, often quixotic, to reign in China's intensely
industrial model of education \[15, 86\]; but **[these were more fully
addressed at the height of China's response to the pandemic. There is no
evidence]{.underline}** to suggest **[these policies were advanced
because of the pandemic, i.e., when it was clear that online
schooling]{.underline}** in lockdown locations **[along with pandemic
related social restrictions had made children even more vulnerable to
digital exploitation and alienation]{.underline}**, although such fears
were acknowledged by some (see, for example, Wang et al. \[77\], Teng et
al. \[73\], and Jiang, Tong, and Chen \[31\]). And **[they stand in
stark contrast with excessive gaming and increased digital-associated
alienation affecting American children]{.underline}** in the same period
**[and others around the world]{.underline}** \[17, 58\], and for which
**[there were little to no public policy responses.]{.underline}**

But from a holistic perspective, **[these actions]{.underline}** were
not contrary to China's emergence as a technological society but
[**consistent with efforts to manage the well-being of that society as a
whole, one [in which governmentality is]{.mark}** [not **understood as a
conflict between**]{.mark} **the [externality of a state and party
vs.]{.mark} the [internality of a more authentic or liberated individual
existence, but as]{.mark} the [convergence of both as the same]{.mark},
and [broadly consistent with shared thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline},
goals **[[and objectives]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Ideally, this is what a
technological society would do, or else risk being less of a society and
less capable technologically. So **[while we can point to
Heidegger]{.underline}** and **[Foucault and others as being
horrified]{.underline}** by such developments or less dramatically, the
semi-luddite tendencies sometimes observed in European societies today,
in fact, **[China's emergence as a technological society is not horrific
to most Chinese---quite the opposite. [This development connected,
however, to the emergence in the West of a new Sinophobia and
Sino(techno)phobia.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Realism is the true root cause of Wests response to China, not orientalism-doesn't explain other "oriental" companies like Samsung not being pushed away

Gregory **Moore 22**\[Gregory Moore, Professor of Global Studies and
Politics at Colorado Christian University, \"Huawei, Cyber-Sovereignty
and Liberal Norms: China's Challenge to the West/Democracies\",6-3-2022,
SpringerLink,
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11366-022-09814-2, 1LEE\]

There are **[[several potential problems with this
argument]{.underline}]{.mark}**. First, **[[establishing]{.mark} that
[fear]{.mark} [is an independent variable]{.mark} [is not
easy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Despite the quality of their work generally
speaking, the editors have not done the thick description necessary to
establish this. **[[Simply showing tough
rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark}**, hawkish views on the
US/Western/democratic side (which are indeed there), **[[does
not]{.mark}]{.underline}** really **[[do the job]{.underline}]{.mark}**
effectively. Second, we haven't considered counterfactuals or ruled out
other methods that might test our hypothesis or do a better job
explaining the outcome we observe (the harsh US/Western policy toward
Huawei) than the proposed independent variable, digital orientalism.
Following on from this point, I would **[[propose]{.underline}]{.mark}**
a consideration of the hypothesized independent variable,
"**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Huawei **[[pose credible threats
to national security]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the US and other
democracies" as a way **[to understand the approach]{.underline}** the
US, Australia, the UK and others have taken toward Huawei.

**[[Securitization provides a way of looking at this
issue]{.underline}]{.mark}** that is helpful in this case. As Buzan,
Waever and de Wilde \[3: 25\] put it,

**[[Securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
**[[constituted]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[by]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
intersubjective **[[establishment of an existential
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** with a saliency sufficient to have
substantial political effects...The way to study securitization is to
study discourse and political constellations: When does an argument with
this particular rhetorical and semiotic structure achieve sufficient
effect to make an audience tolerate violations of rules that would
otherwise have to be obeyed?

There can be no doubt that in the United States, Australia, India and
other countries, Huawei's **[[5G offerings have been
securitized]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and this is **[[evident by the
"discourse and political]{.underline}]{.mark}** constellations" in those
and other countries, as I've illustrated above. Yet why hasn't this been
the case in all countries? As Buzan et al. note, referencing the work of
Arnold Wolfers \[3: 30\], security threats may be objective/real, or
subjective/perceived, and where the twain meet or diverge is not always
easy to ascertain. It is possible that A. China's Huawei is acting as a
threat in some countries and not in others. It's also possible that B.
China's Huawei and its 5G are a threat wherever they operate but some
countries don't yet understand that or don't believe it. It's also
possible that C. Huawei and its 5G are not a threat and have simply been
socially constructed as a threat, needlessly securitized. The notion
that digital orientalism is the reason for the securitization of Huawei
and its 5G would line up with the last tack, or C.

The argument presented here, however, is that **[[digital orientalism
does not explain the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
US/**[[Western]{.underline}]{.mark}**/democratic **[[response to China's
growing illiberal impact on global internet
governance]{.mark}]{.underline}** or its worrisome presence, via Huawei,
in more and more national 5G internet infrastructure schemes. On the
contrary, the hypothesis posed here is something like B. above, that
real security concerns do, that the
**[[securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Huawei **[[is not an
irrational response]{.mark}]{.underline}** to Huawei 5G because of 1.
some of Huawei's actions/track record, 2. the nature of its relations
with the Chinese state, and 3. the track record or broader actions (now
and in the past) of that Chinese state at home and abroad as it regards
media freedoms, intellectual property theft, human rights problems, and
more. Having said this, digital (or conventional) orientalism may be
lurking in the background and exacerbating technological and political
dynamics. I suspect it is. The editors are likely not incorrect in that
sense, for certainly there is a sense that China represents a "digital
other," a "political other" and a "cultural other" for Westerners and
Liberals in general, and the notion of digital orientalism may explain
certain aspects of that. At the same time, the argument presented here
is that **[a careful study of China's practices in the
cyber-realm]{.underline}**, whether at home or abroad,Footnote9 **[[make
it clear that there are very clear security-centric reasons for
concern]{.mark}]{.underline}** about China's and Huawei's presence in 5G
internet infrastructure construction, mobile phone handset production,
and even Chinese apps like TikTok and WeChat, which India has banned,
and both of which the Trump Administration tried but failed to ban in
the US.

US, Australian, British, Swedish and other countries' increasingly
robust pushback against Huawei and other Chinese players in the
construction of global 5G infrastructure can be easily understood by
studying A. China's cyber practices at home and abroad, and B. the
impact they have on the security (and perceptions of security) of
nations they work with. Very simply, those pushing back see what China
is doing, they don't like it, and they don't want Chinese companies to
have any major role in constructing telecommunications infrastructure
inside their countries. This is because they believe they know what that
will lead to, and they don't believe that is good from their
perspectives. If China/Huawei was a player like Nokia, Ericsson or
Samsung, the US and these others would not be raising alarms. In fact,
the US, Australia and UK have not been raising alarms about Nokia,
Ericsson or Samsung, the other major players in 5G. Why? Is it digital
orientalism? In fact, **[[given that Samsung is
Korean,]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[one might expect the US to push back
against Samsung, for [it too is "oriental]{.mark},"]{.underline}**
non-Western, following the logic of Said. We don't really see that,
however. **[[South Korea is a democratic polity and a US
ally]{.underline}]{.mark}**, so there is no angst on Washington's part,
**[[no concerns about security]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover, the
South Korean government does not have a history of stealing US IPR, of
spying on the US as China has been, or doing anything that could be
considered a national security threat toward the US, so there has been
no pushback from Washington in the face of Samsung's growing presence in
the US or in US 5G operations.

Some argue that the US simply refuses to yield the number one spot to
anyone, whether in technology or in economic dominance. Yet **[[if the
US was pushing back]{.mark}]{.underline}** against Huawei **[[because
the US wanted to be number one]{.underline}]{.mark}**, because the US
wanted to dominate, why wouldn't the US fund AT&T, Apple, Google or
someone else in the US to be number one? **[[Why]{.mark} [wouldn't the
US hinder the advances of Nokia]{.mark}, [Ericsson]{.mark} and/or
Samsung [in the US and elsewhere]{.mark}?]{.underline}** We don't really
see any of that, however.

**[[Digital orientalism doesn't really explain
this]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in this case. I will argue here that it's
because first, **[[American thinkers do not think in such hierarchical
terms]{.underline}]{.mark}** as their Chinese counterparts do (they
aren't unified in an obsession with being number 1 as is the case with
the Chinese state and its companies; see \[18\]. Second, the **[[US is
not pushing back against Huawei]{.underline}]{.mark}** primarily
[because]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **[[market
imperatives/motivations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but rather because of
concerns about security and lack of trust in the Chinese state and
Chinese companies that are subject thereto. The US trusts the leadership
of Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung, and they don't see their home
governments (Finland, Sweden and South Korea, respectively) as bent on
spying, stealing IPR and undermining free expression at home and
increasingly around the world. It's about the Chinese state's very bad
track record of stealing intellectual property, of suppressing free
expression, of cyber-surveillance and hacking, of suppressing truth and
suppressing dissidents -- increasingly not only inside China but abroad
as well.Footnote10 **[[Pushing back against]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Huawei and **[[China's cyber-sovereignty model has become an existential
fight]{.underline}]{.mark}** for those who see things in the way I have
depicted here. In a telling statement by former Obama National Security
Advisor Susan Rice to Canada's CBC about the security threat Huawei
posed to Canada and others, Rice said,

It's hard for me to emphasize adequately without getting into classified
terrain how serious it is...It gives the Chinese the ability, if they
choose to use it, to access all kinds of information. Civilian
intelligence, military, that could be very, very compromising. So as
much as I disagree with the Trump administration on a number of things,
on this I believe they are right \[15\].

Given how much Rice was opposed to Donald Trump and almost all he stood
for, her agreement with him on this issue is striking. It seems clear
that this was no election-year posturing on the Trump Administration's
part, though that is how the Chinese government tends to frame
it.Footnote11 Huawei's building and operation of 5G networks in other
countries poses serious challenges to the security of potentially any
host-country, and what is being argued here is that this is the reason
for the increasing push-back, the securitization moves, China and Huawei
are facing as Huawei tries to expand its 5G operations abroad.

Toward the ends of explaining how and why Huawei 5G gets securitized in
some places and not others, I think it is possible to take Buzan, Waever
and de Wilde's securitization a bit further. I don't see regional
security complexes (a key factor in their work) at play in a prominent
way here, because the array of countries that have aligned in opposition
to Huawei are more diverse than any regional framework could
accommodate, with Sweden, Australia, India, the UK and the US all saying
no to Huawei, whereas Germany, South Korea, and Canada are keeping the
doors open. The US, for example, has close allies on both sides of this
digital divide, and there are members of China's region/neighborhood who
are on both sides of this divide as well, all of which is to say that
**[[neither alliance patterns or regional patterns clearly explain the
digital divide over Huawei.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

I think another concept found in Buzan, Waever and de Wilde's work \[3\]
better explains it, with the help of an expansion of another of their
concepts. The first concept referenced here is that of security
constellations (p. 201). Buzan et al. define them as "a much wider
concept than security complexes, reflecting as it does the totality of
possible security interrelationships at all levels" (p. 201). They add,
"security constellations will almost certainly generate a much fuller
set of nonregional subglobal patterns (such as those created by the sets
of countries that export copper or those countries vulnerable to
seal-level rises" (p. 201--2). Considering the range of Buzan et al.'s
"sectors" (ie, military, environmental, economic, societal and political
sectors), it is not clear where one would locate cyber, however. Given
that the work being referenced was published in 1998, it seems logical
that two new sectors should be added to Buzan et al.'s sectoral
framework, and this is the conceptual expansion referenced above: that
of cyber and space sectors. While space as sector is yet relatively
underdeveloped, cyber is a sector that has grown apace in recent years
and should now be considered a sector in its own right, as might be
evidenced by the addition of "Cyber Commands" and like agencies to the
arsenals of many nations today, whereas none existed only a few short
years ago. With the addition of a cyber sector and the interrelation of
this sector with extant sectors like military, economic and political
sectors, for example, **[[it is clearer to see how a security
constellation encompassing all of these might
interplay]{.underline}]{.mark}** so as to bring about the digital divide
we've seen over Huawei's participation in 5G network construction. For
example, whereas Sweden does not have to worry about a direct military
threat from China as it does from neighbor Russia, it does operate in a
security constellation wherein China's economic interests (and actions)
and the nature of its political sector/system are such that Sweden
perceives a threat. In the same way, whereas South Korea has a more
immediate potential threat from China militarily (after all, S. Korea's
mortal enemy North Korea is China's ally, and S. Korea's ally the US is
China's chief adversary), it does not apparently view China (or at least
Huawei) with as much trepidation as the US does. It may be that it
doesn't see its own interests as being as divergent from China's as the
US does. It may also be that its cool relationship with Japan for
reasons of unresolved history puts it in closer ideational orientation
to China (with which it shares some anti-Japanese historical angst)
than, again, would be the case with the US. Cyber is just one part of a
constellation of security interests between these many players and
**[[so a simple digital orientalist]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
geopolitical, economic or alliance-driven
**[[explanation]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[alone does
not]{.underline}]{.mark}** really **[[do justice to the broader
complexity of interests and issues that drive issues or sectors like
cyber.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Second, **[[we need to continue]{.mark} the good work of [combining
training]{.mark} in languages, history, and culture with training in the
social sciences begun [in]{.mark} most American and European centers of
[Middle Eastern studies. One without the other is no longer
enough]{.mark} --- and is no longer seen to be enough.]{.underline}**
Third, the social sciences provide a necessary additive to works of
analysis which operate simply at the level of discourse and the various
ways this has been used to answer questions with little or no attention
to what I would still want to call material reality. Last, but not
least, and in answer to those critics who accuse Said-influenced social
scientists of managing to avoid most of the important political and
ideological issues of the moment, **[[we]{.mark} now [have the
tools]{.mark} to make important contributions to such vital contemporary
Middle Eastern subjects]{.underline}** as military occupations,
religious politics, the explosive growth of the Gulf port cities, and
Islamic banking, not to mention **[[the enormous impact of
globalization, where]{.mark} a [knowledge of]{.mark} the
[history]{.mark} of the region has to be [combined with an ability
to]{.mark} pick out and to [describe]{.mark} those [underlying
structures]{.mark}, dynamics, and trajectories [which define
them]{.mark} now and will continue to do so in the
future.]{.underline}** All this is good news, and would certainly be
good news to Edward Said himself. Given that the field of modern Middle
East Studies is only some 50 years old, that it had to extract itself
from the hold of a first generation of scholars who still saw the Middle
East in very reductionist, ahistorical terms, and that **[[it takes
time]{.mark} to build up a core of experts versed in language, history,
local knowledge, and the social sciences, we finally have a set of
praiseworthy scholars.]{.underline}** Conclusion **[It is important to
see Edward Said's work, and the mixed reception it received, in the
round. This means [read]{.mark}ing [Orientalism]{.mark} as
[carefully]{.mark} as its author would wish [and]{.mark} then being able
to [understand its role as the first part of a project which required
the construction of alternative methodologies as its
complement]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Inevitably, **[[this
alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}** project **[[proved to be]{.mark} much
more [difficult]{.mark} for reasons [Edward]{.mark} himself could not
anticipate and for which his own [critique shares]{.mark} a small part
of [the blame]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Nevertheless, viewed from the
perspective of modern Middle East studies, **[[the present and the
future look]{.mark} surprisingly [good]{.mark}, with the ever [expanding
production of highly skilled]{.mark} graduate [students]{.mark} around
the world well-supplied with the tools not just to make use of whatever
data the field contains but also to use their knowledge of the various
social science disciplines [to challenge]{.mark} the [conventional
wisdom and]{.mark} the [old paradigms]{.mark} which continue to stand in
the way of a proper understanding of how Middle Eastern societies,
economies, and political systems really work.]{.underline}**

#### Said's goal of Orientalism was to critique an existing system, not establish any sort of alternative.

Given the temper of these times, **[it was also natural that those early
[social science critics]{.mark} of Orientalist scholarship should band
together in workshops around joint projects designed to employ what we
identified as the German-style 19th century "critique" --- both to
[expose the lack of]{.mark} real [explanatory value in]{.mark}
traditional [Orientalism and]{.mark} to begin to [provide]{.mark} what
we took to be [a]{.mark} more [useful way of studying the]{.mark} modern
[Middle East.]{.mark} This [included]{.mark}, among many other issues,
[an attempt to come to terms with]{.mark} the way in which not just the
traditional academic Orientalists but also several of the [founders of
Western social science]{.mark}, most notably Marx and Weber, held
Orientalist-type views concerning a fundamental difference between East
and West.]{.underline}** Furthermore, also in anticipation of Edward
Said, we had begun to discuss the ways in which our own social science
disciplines, anthropology in particular, played a major role in what
Talal Asad called the "Colonial Encounter." Edward [Said]{.mark} himself
was [well aware]{.mark} of what we were attempting --- via our Review of
Middle East Studies --- having had his attention drawn to it by Fred
Halliday, a very important figure in my story. Nevertheless, for a
number of reasons, while Edward could commend us for working, as he put
it, in "disciplines not fields," **[[I do not think he had any real
understanding of what practicing these disciplines actually
involved]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This was partly the result of his
inclinations, character, and training. **[[He was a humanist]{.mark}
through and through, [seeing the world]{.mark} via the optic of
literature, music, and [the arts, not]{.mark} by the use of supposedly
[value-free]{.mark} economics, political science, or
[sociology]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Just as important, as he explained to
me, he had come to the end of his year at the Institute of Advanced
Studies in Palo Alto tired out by writing Chapters 1 and 2 and in such a
hurry to finish that he raced through Chapter 3, "Orientalism now,"
without either thinking through his argument as far as the relationship
between Orientalism and the modern centers of modern Middle Eastern
studies was concerned, or paying much attention to the alternatives
which he left, clearly and specifically, to others. **[As he puts it in
[the book's rushed]{.mark}, last few pages: ... in conclusion, what of
some alternative to Orientalism? Is this book an argument only against
something, and not for something positive?]{.underline}** And then,
having spent a sentence mentioning a number of what he called "new
departures," including the work of my own group --- called the Hull
group after the venue of our first few workshops --- **[[he notes that
he]{.mark} does not attempt to do ... more than mention them or allude
to them quickly. My project has been to [describe]{.mark} a particular
system of [ideas, not]{.mark} by any means to [displace]{.mark} the
system of ideas, not by any means to displace [the system with a new

#### The alt recreates the epistemological failures they try to critique

Criticisms At the same time**[, a number of empirical,
[epistemological]{.mark}, and normative [criticisms]{.mark} have been
raised against attempts to [develop]{.mark} a]{.underline}** Chinese IR
theory and (by extension) '**[[non-Western' IR.]{.mark} Empirically,
[Asian IR are not fundamentally different]{.mark} from those of Europe,
in the sense that anarchy, survival, and the balance of power have been
the key operating principles of state-to-state interactions since the
pre-modern period.]{.underline}** For example, based on a detailed
archive analysis of China's foreign relations under the Song and Ming
dynasties, Yuan-kang Wang concludes that in the 'anarchical'
international environment at that time 'Confucian culture did not
constrain ... \[Chinese\] leaders' decisions to use force; in making
such decisions, leaders have been mainly motivated by their assessment
of the balance of power between China and its adversary' (Wang, 2011:
181). This finding leads Wang to defend the theoretical utility of
structural realism based on the Westphalian system.
**[Epistemologically, too, critics point out that it is ['unscientific'
to emphasise]{.mark} and/or incorporate [a particular]{.mark} culture or
the [worldview]{.mark} of a particular nation or region into IR theory,
for a legitimately 'scientific' theory should seek 'universality,
generality']{.underline}** (Choi, 2008; Song, 2001).
**[Mainstream]{.underline}** (positivist**[) IR theorists and
methodologists argue that [IR studies ought to seek observable general
patterns of states' external behaviour,]{.mark} develop empirically
verifiable 'covering law' explanations, and test their hypotheses
through cross-case comparisons]{.underline}**. For example, Gary King,
Robert Keohane, and Sidney Verba make it clear that generality is the
single most important measure of progress in IR, stressing that 'the
question is less whether ... a theory is false or not ... than how much
of the world the theory can help us explain' (King et al., 1994: 101,
emphasis in original). From this perspective, any attempt to develop an
indigenous IR theory, be it non-Western or Western, is suspect because
it delimits the general applicability of theory. In the case of a
Chinese IR theory, criticism of this kind can increasingly be found in
studies by younger Chinese IR scholars. According to Xinning Song (2001:
68), Chinese scholars, especially younger ones who have studied in the
West, think that it is 'unscientific or unnecessary to emphasize the
so-called Chinese characteristics'. A similar criticism can be found
among Korean IR scholars in regard to attempts to build a 'Korean-style'
IR theory (Cho, 2015). Critics of the 'Korean School' of IR frequently
ask how can we make a distinctively Korean IR theory while trying to be
as generalisable as possible? In Jongkun Choi's (2008: 215) words, 'any
theorising based on Korea's unique historical experiences must be tested
under the principle of generality'. **[[Normative criticisms]{.mark} of
attempts to build a 'non-Western' IR theory [highlight]{.mark} the
[relationship between power and knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Critics point out that **[although theory-building enterprises from the
perspective of the 'non-West' commonly begin by problematising
Western-dominated IR, the ongoing scholarly practices and [discourses
associated with 'non-Western' IR]{.mark} can also
[entail]{.mark}]{.underline}** (or reproduce) **[the [same]{.mark}
hierarchic and [exclusionary structure of knowledge production]{.mark},
which can fall prey to particular national or regional
interests.]{.underline}** For example, in his discussion of Chinese
visions of world order, William Callahan doubts the applicability of
'Tianxia'. He claims that what the notion of Tianxia does is 'blur' the
conceptual and practical 'boundaries between empire and globalism,
nationalism, and cosmopolitanism'. Rather than help us move towards a
'post-hegemonic' world, Tianxia serves to be a philosophical foundation
upon which 'China's hierarchical governance is updated for the
twenty-first century' (Callahan, 2008: 749). Supporting this view,
Ching-Chang Chen (2011: 1) argues that: **[re-envisioning IR in Asia is
not about discovering or producing as many "indigenous" national schools
of IR as possible. [Scholars]{.mark} ... [must]{.mark} also
[recognise]{.mark} and resist the [pitfalls]{.mark} [of equating the
mere increase of non-Western voices]{.mark} with the genuine
democratisation of the field, if they are to live up to their
responsibility to jointly construct a non-hegemonic
discipline.]{.underline}** In a similar vein, Josuke Ikeda (2011:
12--13) argues that '**[[there needs to be a "post-Western" turn rather
\[than a\] "non-Western" \[one\]]{.underline}]{.mark}** ... in order to
address another kind of "Westfailure" in IR theory'. In short, critics
argue that although it is our 'responsibility' to make IR more
pluralistic and democratic, 'most intellectual endeavors to construct
non-Western IRT in Asia run the risk of inviting nativism' (Chen, 2011:
16). Most recently, Andrew Hurrell (2016: 149--150) has added that
although developing culturally specific ways of understanding the world
'undoubtedly encourages greater pluralism', attempts to do so can also
lead to a national and regional 'inwardness' that works to reproduce the
very 'ethnocentricities' that are being challenged.

### Anti-eurocentrism fails

#### **Anti-eurocentrism is flawed and unneeded -- western-centrism's role in IR has decreased exponentially**

'All scholars are Eurocentrics': The **[[limits of
anti-Eurocentrism]{.underline}]{.mark}** What can be seen as a **[[major
problem]{.mark} with critics of Eurocentric IR is their tendency to
[overstate]{.mark} the [impact of Eurocentrism]{.mark} as an ideology by
confusing it with a more geo-historically situated form of Eurocentric
world order.]{.underline}** Stated differently, **[[anti-Eurocentrics do
not differentiate]{.mark} in general [between Eurocentrism as an
ideology]{.mark} (one that sees]{.underline}** Europe, or a more
**[global West as the only active subject of world politics) [and
Eurocentrism as a picture of the world that derives from]{.mark} the
significance of [Europe]{.mark}an powers]{.underline}** at a certain
point in time, basically from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth
centuries. This **[perception leads the critics to [exaggerate]{.mark}
the [extent of Eurocentrism in IR.]{.mark} Virtually all forms of
analysis that give a prominent role to the European (and
Western)]{.underline}** actors in the global political order come to be
seen as Eurocentric. **[[Whenever]{.mark} a scholar chooses to [focus on
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** significance of the European powers (or the
**[impact of the [West]{.mark}]{.underline}**), \[they are\]
**[[targeted as Eurocentric]{.underline}]{.mark}**.3 The extent of this
problem becomes more visible when considering the work of
**[[anti-Eurocentric scholarship,]{.mark}]{.underline}** which
**[[demonstrates an unending circle of intra-IR disciplinary blaming and
bashing]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For instance, feminist IR scholarship
points to the prevalence of Eurocentric biases among their more
mainstream colleagues.4 In turn, they are accused by Hobson of
Eurocentrism. He sees in feminist IRʼs focus on women in the Third World
ʻthe risk of returning us back into the Eurocentric cul-de-sac of
rendering Eastern women as but passive victims of Western power, thereby
stripping them of agencyʼ. 5 Postcolonialists criticise in turn the
approach most closely associated with Hobsonʼs approach, that is,
historical sociology for carrying Eurocentric features.6 **[Finally,
postcolonialists are attacked by advocates of decolonising approaches
who find the presence of Eurocentric positions in the work of the
former.]{.underline}**7 This inherent **[race to the
bottom]{.underline}** in the form of accusing others as Eurocentrics
**[demonstrates that a [mere]{.mark} [proliferation of anti-Eurocentric
analyses will not suffice to de-Eurocentricise IR. Otherwise]{.mark},
disciplinary self-reflexivity will be [reduced to blaming others]{.mark}
for Eurocentrism [without]{.mark} turning to [a broader
contextualisation of]{.mark} and variation between
[Eurocentrisms]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It should be evident that this
would **[help]{.underline}** us **[[neither]{.mark} in [reduci]{.mark}ng
the actual [impact of]{.mark} ideologically motivated
[Eurocentric]{.mark} [analyses]{.mark} in the discipline [nor]{.mark} in
[gain]{.mark}ing a [better understanding of our own]{.mark} positions
and [scholarly motives]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A major aspect in this
context concerns the differences between the continuing impact of
European/Western influences in todayʼs world and the way in which
Western-dominated power-knowledge connections of the nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries are to a certain extent overcome. **[[Although
many scholars criticise IRʼs Eurocentrism]{.mark} for the close
relations they find between knowledge]{.underline}** (production)
**[practices and the supposed power impact of the West, [they overlook
the extent]{.mark} [to which the]{.mark} gradual [decline in the Westʼs
power has also changed these interactions]{.mark}. This means that one
has to approach Eurocentrism in a more nuanced fashion so that the
residual impact of the Western powersʼ relatively decreasing global
significance can be recognised as the instantiation of a gradual process
of de-Eurocentricisation that goes in line with a less Western, more
post-Western world.]{.underline}** Immanuel Wallerstein speaks of
ʻanti-Eurocentric Eurocentrismʼ. According to him, this form of
Eurocentric scholarship asserts either that Europe just interrupted
others from doing what they were doing and did it herself, or that
Europe did something which was just ʻa continuation of what others had
already been doing for a long time, with the Europeans temporarily
coming to the foregroundʼ. To overcome such anti-Eurocentric
Eurocentrism, **[scholars must ʻcease trying to deprive Europe of its
specificity on the deluded premise that we are thereby depriving it of
an illegitimate creditʼ. Wallerstein suggests that ʻ\[[w\]e must fully
acknowledge]{.mark} the particularity of [Europeʼs
reconstruction]{.mark} of the world because [only then]{.mark} [will it
be possible to transcend]{.mark} it.' 8 Following this assumption, even
Hobsonʼs anti-Eurocentrism emerges as an instance of Eurocentrism, for
he tends to look for non-Western origins in virtually all historical
developments of the modern era, overlooking thus the [extent to
which]{.mark} the [Western dominance]{.mark} in the nineteenth century
[made]{.mark} its previous [interactions]{.mark} with the non-Western
actors [less relevant]{.mark} when thinking of Eurocentrism in that
era.]{.underline}**9 I turn to a detailed examination of Hobsonʼs
approach after providing a more differentiated typology between various
forms of Eurocentrism. As another example in which Wallerstein would
have seen anti-Eurocentric Eurocentrism, one can refer to Kerem
Nişancıoğluʼs recent study on the peripheral role given to the Ottoman
Empire in studies of capitalist development. He argues that IR ʻhas been
built on largely Eurocentric assumptionsʼ with the Ottomans being
ʻabsent, passive, or merely a comparative foil against which the
specificity and superiority of Europe has been definedʼ. 10 **[His
counterpoint is that the Ottoman Empire ʻwas arguably the most powerful
actor in the Early Modern periodʼ.]{.underline}** Based on his
employment of Trotskyʼs theory of uneven and combined development, the
combined impact of Ottoman strength and Europeʼs privilege of
backwardness would lead the latter (especially its northwestern parts,
that is, England) to gain ʻthe geopolitical space required to conduct
modern state-buildingʼ. Thus, Nişancıoğlu presents a revision of the
historical sociology of international relations, which he accuses of
being too concentrated on European history. The point of contention is
about conditions affecting the birth of modern capitalism. However, it
is possible to see this as another issue, one that is researchable in a
historical framework without accusations of Eurocentrism. Nişancıoğlu
himself is careful to add that his goal is not ʻto argue that
capitalismʼs origins were entirely extra-Europeanʼ nor to ʻseek to
substantially diminish the centrality or uniqueness of Europe in this
processʼ. 11 These are big caveats that show that even self-declared
non-Eurocentric accounts recognise Europeʼs specific role in the
emergence of the modern world order. Hence, it becomes possible to
reject Nişancıoğluʼs general critique of IRʼs Eurocentrism, for his own
work illustrates that the broader assumptions of IR still hold with
regard to Europeʼs dominant role in the emergence of modern capitalism
and the international order associated with it.

### Asian Futurism fails

#### Asian futurity gets coopeted by the same neoliberal contradictions it tries to overcome

The cover of Kishore Mahbubani's 2008 publication The New Asian
Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East presents
readers with what seems to be the global sign for financial growth:
skyscrapers under construction. Cranes perch atop every tower,
suggestive of the "all-at-once-ness" of growth in Asia. **[The
illuminated construction site stretching into the night sky highlights
the unrelenting pace of growth, which proceeds even as the rest of the
world sleeps. The scene is a familiar one, prefigured by the race for
the tallest building that ran across parts of Asia]{.underline}**
(Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan) in the early 2000s. 1 **[But the
unpainted, all white structures feel eerily hollow and decontextualized.
There's no sign of the human laborers who welded and wired these
structures. The lot is all but empty, with the exception of one
nondescript car parked in the foreground. This scene of speculative
building--- construction predicted but not contracted to sell---feels
like an already haunted future, in which "[New Asia" has become an empty
lot, evacuated of its denizens and prepared to signify the sheer
potential of capital]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Published amid the
financial crisis of 2008, Mahbubani's book, as well as his Financial
Times declaration of a realizable Asian Century that serves as this
essay's epigraph, excite what Alan Greenspan once called "irrational
exuberance." Uttered in a speech Greenspan gave in 1996, in his capacity
as chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the phrase characterized the
"unduly escalated asset values" of Japan's economic bubble. The next
day, Tokyo's stock market fell sharply, closing 3 percent down, and
Greenspan's speech largely presaged the Asian financial crash a year
later. The extent to which economic projections hang on the words of
figureheads like Alan Greenspan demonstrates how such **[[speculations
work as performative speech acts that call the future into
being]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Similarly, **[the [optimism]{.mark}
Mahbubani announces in forward-looking, prophetic tones ("optimism will
deliver the Asian Century"), [affectively structures speculative
investment in Asian futures]{.mark}. This [vision of the new Asian
hemisphere, colonized by empty high-rises reaching toward limitless
horizons and built by deterritorialized workers, projects a future of
automated speculative building, fueled by investment hungry
banks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If Greenspan and Mahbubani both grasp how
their respective declarations of pessimism and optimism will affect the
global economy, they do so with two different Asias in mind: Japan of
the late 1990sand Singapore at the dawn of a "new Asia" in 2008. 2 The
so-called Asian Century, toward which **[Mahbubani's optimism strains,
[functions as a largescale speculative fiction spawned from neoliberal
fantasies that capitalize on a literary genre's already problematic
investments in techno-Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In their
1995examination of techno-Orientalism, David Morley and Kevin Robins
call attention to U.S. and European fantasies of Japan and its shift in
those imaginaries in the 1980s from an exotic playground to a land of
emotionless automatons. Perhaps epitomized by Western dystopian
cyberpunk such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) and William
Gibson's Neuromancer (1984), techno-Orientalism figures the Japanese as
"unfeeling aliens; they are cyborgs and replicants. But there is also
the sense that these mutants are now better adapted to survive in the
future"(170). While Morley and Robins understand techno-Orientalism as
primarily born out of Western anxieties about Japan's challenge to U.S.
economic hegemony, they also suggest more specifically how
**[[techno-Orientalism arises just as Japan emerges as "the largest
creditor and the largest net investor in the
world"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (153). What Morley and Robins never fully
develop, and what I want to explore in more depth here, is this
coordinated turn toward Asian futures in both financial and cultural
forms of speculation. Mathematical models of probability and investment
strategies based on extrapolation are forms of speculative fiction that
project finance capitalism's visions of futurity onto the world.
Interdisciplinary scholarship from the past two decades has pointed to
the performative aspects of economic speculation (MacKenzie, Muniesa,
and Siu), the sociological systems of financial markets (Knorr-Cetina
and Bruegger), the impact on subjectivity of financial instruments such
as derivatives and debt bundling (LiPuma and Lee), and the
"financialization of daily life" (Martin). Because speculative economies
rely ever more on rhetorical tools and narrative strategies to explain
and market the practice of trading on futures and securities, financial
speculation and speculative fiction both participate in the cultural
production of futurity, and futurity becomes the arena in which new
subject formations emerge. **[[Does techno Orientalism register
anxieties about finance capitalism, or does finance capitalism use
techno-Orientalism as a basis for its extrapolations of
futurity?]{.mark} I emphasize the co-constitutive relationship between
the cultural production and financial worlding of Asian
futurity.]{.underline}** A peculiar question arises then, when Asian
economic and political architects themselves participate in the
projection of Asian futurity, all the while drawing on a
techno-Orientalist toolkit. I argue that **[[critical analysis of the
discursive site of Asian futurity reveals points of contradiction in
American neoliberalism as it travels that have to do with earlier forms
of racial and colonial subjugation providing the scaffolding for the
architecture of neoliberalism itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**.3 **[As
[Asia develops its own neoliberal rhetoric, articulating its own
futurity poses certain problems that necessitate a disavowal of the
racism of techno-Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[What stands in
to "smooth" that difficulty is the heteronormativity techno-Orientalism
always espoused that Asian futurity posits anew as part of its road
map,]{.mark} [capitalizing on aspirational teleologies, valuations of
privatized worth, and nationalisms consolidated through processes of
racialization]{.mark}.]{.underline}** I focus my investigation on
techno-Orientalism's role in the production ofa global neoliberal
subject in contemporary Singapore, where a tech economy adopts and
adapts localized versions of seemingly universalized notions of "the
good life." Building on Lauren Berlant's theorization of "cruel
optimism," this essay levies a critique of "the Asian Century" as
imagined by economists around the world. It argues that **[[a
revisionist Asian futurity needs to intervene]{.mark} in the neoliberal
orientations of "the good life" and, in the face of foreclosed futures,
open possibilities of]{.underline}** what Eve Sedgwick has called
**["reparative practices."]{.underline}**

#### Sinofuturism merely flips a Western binary of either a China stuck in the past or one stuck in the future -- that denies China the agency to ever challenge the destruction of their coevalness and instead perpetuates a techno-orientalist fantasy about an exotic futuristic China.

**[This genealogy of temporal othering evidences how both
[sinofuturism]{.mark} and technoorientalism [are]{.mark} not merely
[culpable of propagating exoticizing fantasies about]{.mark} the future
in [China]{.mark} or other Asian contexts, [but also responsible for
perpetuating]{.mark} a more generalized [denial of coevalness]{.mark}.
In contrast with established orientalist tropes and with more recent
liberal-democratic varieties of "sinological orientalism" (Vukovich),
[China is no longer deemed to be trapped in]{.mark} its atemporal
[pastness]{.mark} or condemned to eventually synchronize with modernity:
[instead, it already inhabits the future]{.mark}, arrives from
it,]{.underline}** or beckons a Chinese mode of futurity with global
implications. In all these variants, **[[sinofuturist imaginations deny
China]{.mark} the [possibility of challenging]{.mark} and negotiating
representation in the [coeval present staked out by West]{.mark}ern
knowledge production]{.underline}**. **[The [future is for sinofuturists
what]{.mark} the [past was for orientalists: a foil]{.mark} for steering
representation [by denying coevalness]{.mark}. The [legitimacy of
sinofuturism is premised on]{.mark} a parallelism with other [emerging
articulations of futurity]{.mark}: [the comparative approach]{.mark}
proposed by Armen Avanessian and Mahan Moalemi, for example, [juxtaposes
it with]{.mark} Afrofuturism, gulf futurism and [other
'ethnofuturisms']{.mark}, highlighting the novel emergence of
futureoriented imaginaries from non-Western contexts.]{.underline}**
While this approach cautions that futuristic articulations "outside of
the west and across the Global South and other former peripheries can
also evolve into neo-colonial tendencies" (Avanessian et al. 9),
**[[it]{.mark} also [glosses over]{.mark} a more fundamental [problem of
serializing ethnic]{.mark} or national [futurisms]{.mark}: their
reference to the future might be the only contact point between
otherwise radically different aesthetic and ethical
programs---[something]{.mark} that the history of [Italian futurism
glaringly evidences]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Even Lawrence Lek's artwork
Sinofuturism (1839-2046 AD), which has become a defining reference for
this term, repeatedly reaches for a common tactical repertoire among
"minority movements which share an optimism about speed, velocity, and
the future as a means to subvert the institutions of the present" (Lek).
As proven by Afrofuturism, movements that upend hegemonic and colonial
temporal frameworks are fundamental to reclaiming representational
agency against the denial of coevalness. **[But in order to do so, [they
have to]{.mark} organically [emerge from]{.mark} the [periphery of
Western time, rather than]{.mark} be conjured as part of
[technoorientalist fantasies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Instead,
[while]{.mark} the [post-digital exotic pastiches of sinofuturism have
circulated]{.mark} enough to consolidate into a recognizable aesthetic
appropriated and subverted by local electronic musicians and new media
artists, [it is]{.mark} their less self-aware and [more sensational
variety that continues]{.mark} to find currency in popular
[represent]{.mark}ations of [China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
introductory chapter of William A. Callahan's China Dreams: 20 Visions
of the future, aptly titled "**[China is the future," offers a striking
example of this banal brand of sinofuturism: It's an exciting time to be
Chinese. While in the West the first decade of the 21st century was
defined by pessimism due to 9/11, the Iraq War, and the Great Recession,
Chinese people are very optimistic that the 21st century will be the
"Chinese century."]{.underline}** The fruits of China's three decades of
rapid economic growth are there for all to see: by 2010, the People's
Republic of China (PRC) had the fastest computer in the world and the
smartest students in the world, and it was enthusiastically entering the
space age---just as the United States was retiring its fleet of Space
Shuttles. (Callahan 1) **[This book's first paragraph strings together
many of the tropes highlighted above: national identity, the idea of a
Chinese century, the PRC's economic growth, and the post-reform
developmental leapfrogging indexed by the trifecta of computational
primacy, academic talent and space exploration, all measured against
rusty yardsticks left over from the Cold War era.]{.underline}** To sum
up: sinofuturism responds to a lack of engagement with China's future in
both academic expertise and popular discussions of the country. It does
so provocatively, by speculating on possible future configurations of
wildly different aspects of Chinese history, culture and society,
juxtaposing technological developments and traditional customs, global
trends and local phenomena, political systems and material forces. **[At
the same time, [sinofuturism]{.mark} draws on--- and at times [directly
reproduces]{.mark}---the tropes and [narratives of
techno-orientalism]{.mark}, [reducing China to]{.mark} the last in
[a]{.mark} series of East [Asian countries investing]{.mark} resources
[to accelerate]{.mark} [industrialization]{.mark} and informatization
[and]{.mark} thus [threatening]{.mark} the [Western grip on
technological innovation]{.mark} and transnational supply chains. The
historical superimposition of techno-orientalism with popular culture
genres like cyberpunk offers a convenient route for
[sinofuturism]{.mark} to find success as an aesthetic repertoire that is
legible across contexts: outside China, it [reacts with]{.mark} the
mixture of [fascination and anxiety for]{.mark} the
[illegibility]{.mark} and scale [of China's rise]{.mark}; inside China,
[it lends itself to]{.mark} the [self-orientalizing celebration of
national success]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But this should not obfuscate
its main operation. **[[Sinofuturism, like techno-orientalism, operates
as a denial of coevalness]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In being largely
articulated from the outside as an interpretive discourse, it posits
some sort of equivalence between China and the future: **[[China is the
future]{.mark}, China comes from the future, the future will come from
China, and so on.]{.underline}** **[[These proclaimations are]{.mark} as
enticing as they are [sus]{.mark}pect, for they deploy the future as a
way of deferring participation in contemporariness. The [future
functions exactly as]{.mark} the [past does in orientalist arguments:
as]{.mark} a [temporality through which otherness can be]{.mark} safely
[managed]{.mark} and problematic interactions steered away from. If the
locus of Said's orientalism was the Hejaz region, "a locale about which
one can make statements regarding the past in exactly the same form (and
with the same content) that one makes them regarding the present" (Said
235), the loci of sinofuturism are the skylines of Shanghai, Shenzhen,
and Chongqing, ready to be inscribed with claims about the future.
[Sinofuturism is]{.mark} a [reverse orientalism]{.mark}---[an
orientalism operating]{.mark} its [denial of coevalness through]{.mark}
the [attribution of futurity]{.mark}]{.underline}**
