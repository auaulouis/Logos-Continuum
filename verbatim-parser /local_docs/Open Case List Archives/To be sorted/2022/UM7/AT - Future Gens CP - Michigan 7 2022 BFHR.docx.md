### Alliances Deficit

#### Can't solve alliances.

**Howell & Pevehouse 11** \[William G. Howell and Jon C. Pevehouse, both
associate professors at the University of Chicago\'s Irving B. Harris
School of Public Policy, "Chapter 1: Possibilities of Congressional
Influence," in *While Dangers Gather: Congressional Checks on
Presidential War Powers*, Princeton University Press, 6-27-2011,
p.27-29\]

The Importance of Congressional Appeals/Dissent Because they are legally
binding, legislation and appropriations passed by Congress directly
impinge on a president's discretion to wage war. Not surprisingly, then,
opponents of a president's war typically call on Congress to pass laws
and cut appropriations. But the public debates that precede military
actions also have important consequences for presidential power. Two
stand out. [By [expressing dissent]{.mark}, members of Congress can
[weaken]{.mark} the [presidents ability to credibly convey resolve
to]{.mark} foreign [allies and adversaries]{.mark}, and they can turn
public opinion]{.underline} against him.73 Here, we briefly summarize
both of these avenues of congressional influence. SIGNALING RESOLVE [To
the extent that congressional discontent signals domestic irresolution
to other nations, the job of resolving a foreign crisis is made all the
more difficult]{.underline}. As Kenneth Schultz shows, an "opposition
party can under- mine the credibility of some challenges by publicly
opposing them. Since [this strategy threatens to increase the
probability of resistance from the rival state]{.underline}, it forces
the government to be more selective about making threats"---and,
concomitantly, more cautious about actually using military force.74
[[When members of Congress]{.mark} openly [object]{.mark}]{.underline}
to a planned military operation, [would-be [adversaries]{.mark} of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [may [feel emboldened]{.mark},
believing that the president lacks the domestic support required to see
a military venture through. Such nations, it stands to reason, will be
more willing to [enter conflict]{.mark}, and if convinced that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will back down once the costs
of conflict are revealed, they may fight longer and make fewer
concessions. Domestic political strife, as it were, weakens the ability
of presidents to bargain effectively with foreign states, while
increasing the chances that military entanglements abroad will become
protracted and unwieldy]{.underline}. [A large body of work within the
field of international relations supports the contention that a nation's
ability to achieve strategic military objec- tives in short order
depends, in part, on the head of states credibility in conveying
political resolve]{.underline}. Indeed, [a substantial game theoretic
literature underscores the importance of domestic political institutions
and public opinion as state leaders attempt to credibly commit to
war]{.underline}.75 Confront- ing widespread and vocal domestic
opposition, the president may have a difficult time signaling his
willingness to see a military campaign to its end. While congressional
opposition may embolden foreign enemies, the perception on the part of
allies that the president lacks support may make them wary of committing
any troops at all. The dangers of domestic political dissent are not
lost on presidents and members of Congress. Indeed, for Bush (43) it
constituted an important reason for seeking congressional authorization
to use force against Iraq in the fall of 2002. In a Rose Garden ceremony
on October 2, the presi- dent noted, "The statement of support from the
Congress will show to friend and enemy alike the resolve of the United
States. In Baghdad, the regime will know that full compliance with all
U.N. security demands is the only choice and that time remaining for
that choice is limited."76 Then, in remarks eight days later on the
House's vote to authorize the use of force, the president proclaimed,
"The House of Representatives has spoken clearly to the world and to the
United Nations Security Council: The gathering threat of Iraq must be
confronted fully and finally. Today's vote also sends a clear message to
the Iraqi regime: It must disarm and comply with all existing U.N.
resolutions, or it will be forced to comply. There are no other options
for the Iraqi regime. There can be no negoti- ations. The days of Iraq
acting as an outlaw state are coming to an end."77 [By securing
congressional authorization, it was supposed, the president could
communicate his views and intentions more effectively to the
international community]{.underline} that Iraq's defiance of United
Nations resolutions would no longer pass unnoticed.\'8 In doing so, it
was hoped, Saddam Hussein would finally relent to Bush\'s demands.
Imagine what might have happened during the lead-up to and execu- tion
of the Iraq War had Congress not authorized the use of force. Two
outcomes seem plausible, even likely. First, the president would have
had an even more difficult time assembling an international coalition in
sup- port of military action. Recall, after all, that the president
expressly sought congressional authorization in the hopes that it would
improve the chances of later securing a UN Resolution in support of
military action. Second, and in a more speculative vein, had Congress
not authorized the use of force, the military operation itself might not
have gone so smoothly. Dur- ing the early stages of the Iraq War, the
U.S. military took pains to per- suade the enemy to lay down its arms
and surrender, rather than fight and face certain death. Accompanying
these claims were regular assurances that the United States would see
this war through to the end, that it would not stop until the entire
Hussein regime was dismantled. To substantiate these claims, Congress's
authorization was critical. [For a moment, put yourself in the place of
an Iraqi field officer in the spring of 2003]{.underline}. On the one
hand, the United States military is bearing down upon you, threatening
to kill you and every one of your comrades unless you abandon the fight.
On the other hand, should you surrender prematurely, and should the
United States fail to depose the Hussein regime, then you can expect to
face the wrath of a spurned and spiteful ruler---as the southern Shi'a
did a decade prior, after they had risen up in defiance of the Hussein
regime only to be persecuted the moment that U.S. troops withdrew. Which
option seems preferable critically depends on the likelihood that the
United States will see the campaign to its end. For [if you have reason
to doubt the nation's resolve, and Congress\'s refusal to authorize the
use of force would buoy this concern, then the latter op- tion might be
the right one---producing a longer, bloodier military conflict and
raising the cost to an invading army]{.underline}. [Similar concerns
arose in subsequent years when the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [con- templated troop withdrawals from
Iraq]{.underline}. Though the insurgency contin- ued to take its toll on
U.S. forces, the president's popularity waned, and calls for the Iraqi
government to police its own state intensified. Bush nonetheless refused
to set a firm timetable for troops to leave. And his rea- sons for doing
so were plain enough. The president insisted that insurgents were
watching U.S. politics closely and that a timetable would encourage the
insurgents to "just go ahead and wait us out.\" Setting a fixed with-
drawal date, Bush concluded, simply "concedes too much to the enemy."79
[Whether this prediction was accurate or not, its logic relied on the
realization that [others monitor U.S. politics]{.mark} generally, and
Congress in particular, [to gauge the nation's
resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Veto 

#### Congress vetoes instantly

Michael B. **Rappaport, 10,** director of USD's Center for the Study of
Constitutional Originalism, November, 2010, "REFORMING ARTICLE V: THE
PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE NATIONAL CONVENTION AMENDMENT METHOD AND HOW TO
FIX THEM", http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20788836.pdf?acceptTC=true

Now, consider [a different amendment provision]{.underline}. This
provision [allows Congress to amend the Constitution, subject to
ratification by state legislatures or conventions, but it provides no
other amendment method. Thus, it gives Congress a veto on any
amendments. This provision would also make the Constitution less
reflective of popular views and less desirable.]{.underline} Given the
desire of political entities to maintain and expand their power,
[[**Congress is unlikely** to allow the Constitution to be amended **to
limit its power**]{.mark}. Moreover, because [Congress tends to adopt
the perspective of the federal government]{.mark} generally, Congress
[might not]{.mark} be quick to [limit the power of]{.mark} the [other
branches]{.mark} of the federal government.]{.underline}62 Thus[, if a
change in values or circumstances were to require additional limitations
on Congress or even on the federal government, it is unlikely that an
amendment adopting those changes would be passed]{.underline}.
Moreover[, if Congress were to abuse its power, no constitutional reform
would be forthcoming. Over time, then, one would expect the Constitution
to become increasingly distorted normatively. [The Constitution would
fail to add]{.mark} needed [checks on]{.mark} Congress and [the federal
government, but would]{.mark} grow to [include]{.mark} additional
[limitations on the states]{.mark}]{.underline} (and perhaps the
President). Finally, consider [the existing Article V provisions. We can
see that it ~~is~~ \[are\] largely the same as the one described
immediately above that permits only the congressional amendment
process.]{.underline} Given the defects in the convention process, it is
as if that process does not exist. [Thus, the same **normative
distortions** that apply to a constitution with only **[the
congressional amendment procedure]{.mark}**\--a [bias **in favor of
Congress and the national government**, and against the
states]{.mark}\--apply to the existing Constitution.]{.underline} The
one exception to this claim is that the national convention process
would be available [if matters ever turned catastrophic. At that point,
the state legislatures might be willing to risk a runaway convention and
the other costs to address genuinely overriding problems. But absent
this]{.underline} extraordinary situation, [[the]{.mark} national
convention [process would not be employed and the Constitution would
exhibit **serious normative problems**]{.mark}]{.underline}. My argument
[that the failure of the national convention method undermines the
constitutional amendment process by preventing certain amendments from
being enacted is confirmed by our constitutional history]{.underline}.
The dominant pattern of constitutional amendments reveals an amendment
process that has neither placed checks on Congress or the federal
government, nor provided protections to the states. Instead, it has
often expanded the federal government\'s power or taken actions that
have been largely orthogonal to the federal government\'s interests.

### Delay DA 

#### Delay DA of 203 years

[Even though the steps can be described briefly, actual [ratification
can take much longer]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some amendments, such as
[[the 27th]{.underline}]{.mark} (Congressional pay increases), took many
years to complete the ratification process. It [[was]{.mark}
proposed]{.underline} by James Madison [in 1789, but [not ratified until
203 years later]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This amendment required
that any change in the salary of members of Congress only take effect
after the next general election (so lawmakers were not voting to
increase their own salaries). Congress ratified other amendments in
short order, such as the 18th (Prohibition), which took little more than
a year. [[The length]{.mark} of time [depends upon the gravity of the
issue]{.mark} the amendment is intended to address, [the intensity of
public sentiment]{.mark} concerning the issue, and whether or not a time
limit for ratification was written into the amendment during the
proposal stage]{.underline}.

#### There are too many question marks -- SCOTUS would take years to determine if it's legitimate 

**Olson, 16** -- senior fellow at the Cato Institute's Robert A. Levy
Center for Constitutional Studies and is known for his writing on the
American legal system (Walter, "An Article V Constitutional Convention?
Wrong Idea, Wrong Time", CATO Institute, 1/5/2016,
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/article-v-constitutional-convention)//RCU

Some of these ideas are better than others---Gov. Abbott's 92-page
report
([PDF](http://gov.texas.gov/files/press-office/Restoring_The_Rule_Of_Law_01082016.pdf))
is rather erudite, and lays out its arguments skillfully even if I do
not find all of them sound---but every such scheme to stage an Article V
convention should come with a giant ACME brand stenciled on its side. If
it doesn't just sit there doing nothing, it's apt to blow up on the
spot. [The detonation that skeptics most fear is what's called a runaway
convention, in which the delegates called together to, say, install term
limits or revamp campaign finance decide to venture into other areas as
well, and perhaps start proposing whatever new amendments they think
might be a good idea]{.underline}. Hence Justice Antonin [Scalia's
brusque dismissal: "I certainly would not want a constitutional
convention. Whoa! Who knows what would come out of it?"]{.underline}
Some respected scholars who favor a convention argue that strict
instructions would deter the assembled delegates from venturing beyond
the velvet rope. But if that cannot be made a legal requirement, it
winds up more like an honor code. "[[Congress might try to limit the
agenda]{.mark} to one amendment or to one issue, [but **there is no way
to assure that the Convention would obey**]{.mark}," wrote the late
Chief Justice Warren Burger]{.underline}. Don't believe Scalia or
Burger? Go ahead and read the instruction kit for a convention, such as
it is, in [[Article V]{.mark} of the U.S. Constitution]{.underline}.
It's quite brief. Here's the full relevant text: The Congress, whenever
two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose
amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of the
legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a
convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be
valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when
ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or
by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of
ratification may be proposed by the Congress... Note what this does
\*not\* say. It [[says not a word]{.mark} expressly [authorizing the
states,]{.mark} Congress, or some combination of the two to confine the
subject matter of a convention]{.underline}. It says not a word about
whether Congress, in calculating whether the requisite 34 states have
called for a convention, must (or must not) aggregate calls for a
convention on, say, a balanced budget, with differently worded calls
arising from related or perhaps even unrelated topics. [It says not a
word prescribing that the make-up of a convention, as many conservatives
imagine, will be one-state-one-vote (as Alaska and Wyoming might hope)
or whether states with larger populations should be given larger
delegations]{.underline} (as California and New York would surely
argue). **[[Does Congress, or]{.mark} perhaps [the Supreme Court, get to
resolve these questions]{.mark}]{.underline}**---the same Congress and
Supreme Court that the process is aimed at doing an end run around[? [If
the Supreme Court resolves them]{.underline}]{.mark}[, does [it do
so]{.mark} only [at the very end o]{.mark}f the process, after [years of
national debate]{.mark} have been spent in devising amendments that we
find out after the fact were not generated in proper form]{.underline}?
**[Justice Burger described the whole process as "a grand waste of
time]{.underline}**." One reason is that after advocates get the process
rolling by convincing two-thirds of states, or 34, itself a fairly
demanding number, the amendments that emerge from a convention do not
get ratified unless three-quarters of states ratify, or 38, a quite
demanding number. Put differently, it takes only 13 states to refuse to
act to kill any of these ideas, bad or good, in the end. Sorry, Cenk and
Marco, but so long as we have a nation fairly closely divided between
Blue and Red sentiment, there will be at least 13 states skeptical of
some systemic change so big that you had to go around the backs of both
Congress and the Supreme Court to pull it off. If you're a progressive
who thinks the populist winds blow only in your favor, reflect for a
moment on the success of Donald Trump. If you're a conservative to whom
radio call-ins resound as the voice of the people, consider that state
legislatures confronted with the hard legal issues a convention would
raise might turn for advice and assistance to elite lawyers (yikes) or
even law professors (double yikes).

### Constitution DA 

#### Wrecks the constitution 

**Lucas 16** -- James W. Lucas is an attorney in New York City and
member of the New York Bar., June 2^nd^ 2016, \"To Originate the
Amendment of Errors: Reforming Article V to Facilitate State and Popular
Engagement in Constitutional Amendment by James Lucas :: SSRN,\" No
Publication

Madison was right -- [a convention is procedurally
**unworkable**]{.underline}. In its time the Philadelphia convention of
1787 was not unusual. Many states had then recently held conventions and
other assemblies to write state constitutions and address other matters,
and the convention at Philadelphia had seemed to come off well.109 Of
the framers, only Madison sensed that another national convention would
be a far more difficult matter when left as procedurally vague as in
Article V. [Scholars and advocates have spilt much ink confidently
announcing their numerous and contradictory solutions to these
multitudinous issues]{.underline}. **[However]{.underline}**, [state
legislators]{.underline} who are [charged with the]{.underline}
constitutional [duty to actually decide whether to summon a second
convention have time and time again emerged from the jungle of
**unresolved procedural questions**]{.underline} to find themselves,
[not in the promised land of constitutional reform, but rather at the
edge of a dangerous precipice whose base is shrouded in clouds of
uncertainty]{.underline}. These [legislators have repeatedly shied away
from taking the leap into the unknown]{.underline}. [[No one
can]{.underline}]{.mark} really [[assure]{.mark} these state legislators
**what constitutes a [proper application]{.mark}** for a convention,
whether, how or to what extent **Congress would count their
applications**, [whether]{.mark} the **[convention could be
limited]{.mark}** as to subject matter, or who **would go to the
convention**]{.underline}, [**how they would be selected** and, most
critically, **how their votes would be counted**]{.underline}. **[There
can be no assurance that the federal Congress and/or courts will not
control how these issues are decided]{.underline}** [or]{.underline},
conversely, [if there is any predictable mechanism with certain
authority to sort out all of these fundamental issues]{.underline}.
Instead, [there is a real possibility of]{.underline} the kind of
[constitutional confrontations]{.underline} predicted by Professor Tribe
in testimony before the California state legislature. (Here
"constitutional" does not mean technically legal under the Constitution,
but rather **[[fundamental political conflicts]{.mark} which could [tear
the]{.mark} very [fabric of the governmental system]{.mark} created in
1787]{.underline}**.) These are [[confrontations between
Congress]{.mark} and the Supreme [Court]{.mark}, the Supreme Court and
the [states]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the Congress and the
[convention]{.mark} itself if it ever came into being]{.underline}.110
After surveying these issues during the first great convention drive of
recent years in the 1960s, Professor Robert Dixon concluded that [even
"without exhausting here all of the possible complexities, [the state
petition]{.mark} and federal convention [route]{.mark} to constitutional
amendment [emerges]{.mark} [as a]{.mark} veritable **[can of
worms]{.mark}**, and seems **[unlikely to be]{.mark} used
[successful]{.mark}ly**."]{.underline}111 Experience since then has
proven him right, as well as Madison. There has been no Article V
convention, nor is there any realistic prospect of one. However,
Professor Dixon went on to observe that "[situations can be imagined
even in this age where the disposition of congressional forces,
including a Senate filibuster, could block the initiation of an
amendment which, if submitted, would receive adequate popular support
for ratification.]{.underline}"112 This brings us to our next question.

#### Constitution prevents nuclear war

**Hemesath 00** (Paul A., Georgetown Law Journal, August, 88 Geo. L.J.
2473, Lexis)

[[In]{.mark} the [case]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n offensive
[nuclear attack]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the importance of [a
**coherent**]{.mark} and [**legitimate** decision cannot be
overestimated]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even with the force of a
congressional declaration of war, Harry Truman still faced critics that
questioned the sagacity of his atomic decision in World War II. 183
Although the wisdom of any nuclear use may always remain open to
criticism, the legality of such a decision should be beyond reproach. As
previously noted, the potentially \"unlimited costs\" of a nuclear war
are extremely difficult to fathom, both physically and politically. 184
A legitimate decision to utilize a nuclear weapon thus requires a high
level of legality and consensus\--two qualities that cannot be attained
with a Congress plausibly asserting the nonexistence of the Executive\'s
very constitutional authority to carry out the act.   [Finding a
resolution to nuclear war powers uncertainty is not an obvious
endeavor]{.underline}. However, [the harms associated with an unprepared
and contentious \"on-the-fly\" decisionmaking process are serious enough
to demand [a principled solution based on the Constitution]{.mark} and
not on improvised convenience. [To reach]{.mark} such [a solution,
Congress]{.mark} must cohere in an attempt to draft an unambiguous War
Powers Act and proceed to [pursue remedies]{.mark} in the courts [well
in advance of a **nuclear crisis**]{.mark}. In return, the courts must
either deign to decide the issue on its merits, or provide a definitive
jurisdictional holding upon which the courts and the President may come
to rely]{.underline}.

it is important to remember that [the chaos there [began in]{.mark} a
form of [direct democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. When U.K. voters set in

democracy]{.underline}, a practice that Americans [have long
believed](https://news.gallup.com/poll/163433/americans-favor-national-referenda-key-issues.aspx) leads
to a healthier democratic society.

Recent polls show Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with their
system of representative
democracy. [Many](https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2018/10/31/18042060/poll-dissatisfaction-american-democracy-young) see
sharp and unhealthy partisan divisions and lack confidence that the
system will produce the results they desire.

Against this backdrop, some advocate for greater use of direct
democracy. This includes [ballot initiatives, such as those practiced in
24
states](https://ballotpedia.org/States_with_initiative_or_referendum),
including California, Massachusetts and Michigan.

[Ballot initiatives](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_initiative) bypass
the normal legislative process. They can be written by anyone and
receive a public vote without input from lawmakers, provided enough
petition signatures are obtained to get the initiative on the ballot.

Well-known initiatives have dealt with issues like [same-sex

Progressives' unfulfilled hope Claims promoting the positive benefits of
direct democracy on voter turnout and engagement have appeared
periodically since the wave of [Progressive Era reforms during the early
20th
century](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/timeline/progress/).
Those reforms led to the establishment of the [state ballot initiative
process](https://ballotpedia.org/History_of_initiative_and_referendum_in_the_U.S.).
Americans practice a form of [representative
democracy](https://www.historyonthenet.com/what-is-a-representative-democracy) by
choosing among candidates for office. [Advocates for direct
democracy](https://journals.openedition.org/siecles/1109?lang=en) maintain
that by voting directly on policy proposals, people become more
knowledgeable about government, confident of their own abilities and
positive about the capabilities of others. As political theorist [Ben
Barber
asserted](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520242333/strong-democracy),
the "initiative and referendum can increase popular participation in and
responsibility for government, provide a permanent instrument of civic
education, and give popular talk the reality and discipline that it
needs to be effective." Beginning about two decades ago, some [political
scientists](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/democracy-institutions-and-attitudes-about-citizen-influence-on-government/F6DFDF0A30CE0D9E7A38EA0465D31FBB) [claimed
to find
support](https://www.press.umich.edu/11463/educated_by_initiative) for
the idea that greater use of direct democracy tools, especially the
state ballot initiative, helps people get more interested in and engaged
with politics and spurs more trust in government. Direct democracy has
been popular with both political parties, and liberals as well as
conservatives. Modern-day progressives often claim the ballot initiative
can fix problems like gerrymandering, campaign finance abuses or growing
income inequality. The Ballot Initiative Strategy Center [states
that](https://ballot.org/why-were-here/) "\[W\]e envision a future in
which progressives have harnessed the power of ballot measures as
proactive tools for success -- to increase civic engagement, enact
forward-looking policies, and strengthen progressive infrastructure in
key states." Yet not so long ago, [conventional wisdom
held](https://ballot.org/why-were-here/) that ballot initiatives and
referendums were the [tools of
conservatives](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo3615566.html),
at least in the last 40 years. [In 1978, California passed Proposition
13](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_13,_Tax_Limitations_Initiative_(1978)),
sparking tax-cutting measures across the country. [Before the Supreme
Court ruled that same-sex marriage was
legal](https://guides.ll.georgetown.edu/c.php?g=592919&p=4182201),
states with ballot initiatives and voter-approved constitutional
amendments passed laws defining marriage as between a man in a woman in
more than 30 statewide votes between 1998 and 2011. Conflict and
polarization

[Drawing on a wide variety of data]{.underline}, [we conclude in our
book]{.underline} ["Initiatives without
Engagement"](https://www.press.umich.edu/9993024/initiatives_without_engagement) that
[the [initiative]{.mark} process mainly [encourages greater
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than produces political and social
benefits.

[Ballot initiatives can [increase voter turnout]{.mark}]{.underline},
which seems like positive news. But [they do so through [mobilization of

voters](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2010.00688.x) and
encourage voting commonly [based on fear]{.mark} [without making people
more generally knowledgeable or
engaged](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9993024)]{.underline}.

[[Initiatives can]{.mark} also [be a tool for]{.mark} ideological
[extremists]{.mark} and opportunists]{.underline}. [They use the process
to circumvent the American legislative process]{.underline}, long noted
for its incrementalism and premium on compromise.

[Our research](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9993024) finds that [the
relationship between party identification and [polarized]{.mark} issue
[attitudes]{.mark}]{.underline} -- where Democrats increasingly take the
more liberal position and Republicans take the more conservative
position -- [is about 25%-[45%]{.mark} [bigger in states that]{.mark}
frequently [use the initiative]{.mark} than in noninitiative
states.]{.underline}

Tyranny of the majority

[Our research also confirms that initiatives often inflame occasional
[majority]{.mark} group [voters]{.mark}]{.underline}. They do this [with
measures [target]{.mark}ing the rights of [minority]{.mark} group
members]{.underline}.

This has been the case with attempts to [limit the rights of immigrants,
curb affirmative
action](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00175.x) and [define
marriage as between a man and a
woman](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/72/3/399/1836972).

Examining all post-World War II ballot measures in California, we found
numerous examples of votes that sought to curtail the rights of minority
groups, including the LGBT community, racial/ethnic minorities and
immigrants. Only [one initiative was aimed at expanding
them](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_11,_Fair_Employment_Practices_Act_(1946)).

The 1946 ballot initiative, Proposition 11, was called the "Fair
Employment Practices Act" and [would have barred employers from
discriminating](https://ballotpedia.org/California_1946_ballot_propositions) on
the basis of race, religion, color, national origin or ancestry. It
received only 28% yes votes to 72% no.

This is exactly the "majority tyranny" that worried the American
founders. [James Madison famously
argued](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp) that pure
democracies were incompatible with "personal security" and "property
rights." Given the opportunity, he believed, the masses might vote away
the rights and wealth of the elite. His ultimate point, that majorities
can be myopic, has proven prescient.

Distrust in government

[In the wake of all this conflict [our
research](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9993024) shows that frequent use
of ballot initiatives makes citizens trust government less]{.underline},
not more. This is because [initiative [campaigns]{.mark} often
[stress]{.mark} that [government is broken.]{.mark}]{.underline} Voters
then conclude that we would have fewer direct democracy campaigns if
government was more competent.

5\. Throw the entire Constitution in the garbage. One of the biggest
problems with the Constitution as written is it makes changing anything
nearly impossible. Other countries regularly ditch or overhaul their
constitutions to deal with new problems --- and even America has done so
in the distant past. When the first stab at a U.S. Constitution proved
totally unworkable, Americans of the day didn\'t fuss around with
stipulations that \"the Union shall be perpetual.\" Instead they threw
the whole thing out and started from scratch. When it comes to major
reform, I reckon this is the most likely actual possibility. [One of
these days, a standoff will come to a head, and will lead to some kind
of total breakdown]{.underline}. [Legal mechanisms like a
[con]{.mark}stitutional [con]{.mark}vention [are completely untested and
would]{.mark} probably [create such explosive controversy]{.mark} that
we\'d effectively end up with a new constitution anyway.]{.underline}
Make no mistake, [a constitutional [collapse would be a tremendously
destabilizing]{.mark} and dangerous event]{.underline}, [[and raise a
significant chance of]{.mark} **insurrection, [civil war]{.mark}, or a
military dictatorship.**]{.underline} But if and when it comes, it
won\'t be by choice --- it will be because the ancient, janky mechanisms
of the American Constitution simply failed. If we wish to avoid such a
breakdown, moderating reforms like the ones mentioned above must be
considered and adopted, posthaste.

**Extinction**

James **Pinkerton 03**, fellow at the New America Foundation, \"Freedom
and Survival," 2-4-2003, http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc020403.html

Historically, the only way that the slow bureaucratic creep of
government is reversed is through revolution or war. And that could
happen. But there\'s a problem: [[the **next** ]{.mark}**American
[revolution]{.mark}** won\'t be fought with muskets. It [could]{.mark}
well [be waged with]{.mark} **proliferated
[wonder-weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That is, about the time that
American yeopersons decide to resist the encroachment of the United
Nations, or the European Union---or the United States government---[the
level of [destructive power]{.mark} in a future conflict
could]{.underline} remove the choice expressed by Patrick Henry in his
ringing cry, \"Give me liberty, or give me death.\" [The next big war
[could **kill everybody**]{.mark}, free and unfree alike]{.underline}.
Which leads to the second argument. Spaceship earth may not be as
fragile as a space shuttle, but it\'s still fragile. By all means,
let\'s have homeland defense and missile defense. But let\'s also get
real. [If the weapons get bigger, and the planet stays the same size,
then [prospects for **human survival** shrink]{.mark}
accordingly]{.underline}. For the time being, North Korea seems to have
gotten away with breaking out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Kim Jong Il\'s arsenal could be eliminated in the future, of course, but
in the meantime, the atomic cat is out of the nuclear bag. Writing in
the February 3 Weekly Standard, Henry Sokolski, director of the
Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington D.C., offers up
scenarios for the spread of nuclear weapons that are much more
compelling than the scenarios for their unspreading. Countries such as
Iran, Syria, Egypt, Turkey, Algeria, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, he
writes, have all flirted with the idea of building atomic weapons. And
one could add to Sokolski\'s list other countries, such as Brazil, where
the new president, Lula da Silva, seems to be forming an axis of
anti-Americanism with the likes of Venezuela and Cuba. Meanwhile, [every
one of those potential proliferators could be brought into line, and
we\'d still face the problem of [\"**super-empowered
individuals**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" Yup, the prospect of [[Moore\'s
Law]{.mark}-computer [power doubles every 18 months]{.mark}-affects
cyber-geek and terror-creep alike. Such [computational capacity is
inherently \"dual use\"]{.mark} -the ultimate double-edged sword,
hanging over all of us, to be wielded by some of us]{.underline}. As
technofuturist Ray Kurzweil predicts, \"We\'ll see 1,000 times more
technological progress in the 21st century than we saw in the 20th.\"
Most of that progress will be to the good, but not all. [What could a
hacker-terrorist alliance come up with, weapon-wise? There\'s only one
way to find out]{.underline}. [Sooner or later, Moore\'s Law will meet
Murphy\'s Law, and we\'ll realize just how vulnerable we all
are]{.underline}, six billion souls, crowded into a narrow band of soil,
stone, air and water, hugging the flimsy, filmy, easy-to-rub-off surface
of the earth. Let\'s hope that before we have that rendezvous with
deathly destiny, we\'ve had the foresight to build an escape ladder for
ourselves.

Of course, [there are other ways to reinstitute a general legal
rule]{.underline} that accommodations should be afforded except in cases
of overriding government necessity. Advocates of religious freedom could
seek to convince the Court to abandon Smith and [return to the rule
requiring accommodations]{.underline}; failing that, [they could seek to
amend the Constitution]{.underline} to reverse Smith. Or they could work
at the level of individual states, pushing for such a general standard
through state statutes or constitutional amendments. [[The
**constitutional amendment** process is]{.mark} obviously
**[long]{.mark}** and arduous, and nothing would happen unless the
required three-fourths of the states ratified the
amendment]{.underline}. [The constitutional amendment process
illustrates the power that can be exercised by a few [interest

cases that concern them. [Groups [from **prison**]{.mark} wardens to the

[educators]{.mark}** [to **animal rights**]{.mark} **activists** [could
**force exceptions to be written into the amendment**]{.mark} at the
front end\--or more likely, they could **defeat it entirely** at the
back end by blocking passage in just a few states]{.underline}. The
experience could be similar to that of the Equal Rights Amendment, which
shot out of the starting gate in 1972 but ran into insurmountable
difficulties getting the last few states to ratify.39 [The amendment
process would [also]{.mark} tend to **[sweep in other issues]{.mark}**
in the contentious area of church and state, [such as]{.mark} various
forms of [**prayer in public schools** and **financial aid to religious
schools**]{.mark}-a concern expressed by a number of members of
Congress]{.underline} at hearings held last year in the wake of
Boerne.\'° The state legislative or amendment process is more likely to
produce tangible results, but it too would move very slowly. It also is
practically guaranteed to produce uneven results, with lobbies that are
powerful in particular states enjoying greater ability to force
exceptions to the religious freedom law. Already some states have
proposed to exempt prisoner claims;4 in other states, [lobbyists for
groups on the other side of particular disputes may be able to demand
exceptions]{.underline}.

The Church and Divisiveness in America Because the Catholic Church
ignores the principle of [[separation of church and
state]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is the most divisive force in America.
The March 19, 1984, issue of U.S. News and World Report examined two
secret Catholic elite religious societies in this country: the Knights
of Malta with one thousand U.S. members who are prominent in government,
business, or professional life and Opus Dei with three thousand members
of widely varied backgrounds. The Knights of Malta organiza­tion dates
back to the time of the Crusades; its members include some of our
nation's most prominent Catholics: CIA Director William Casey; William
Wilson; Vernon Walters; Senators Denton and Domenici; Alexander Haig;
William Sloan; and William F. Buckley, creator and leader of Young
Americans for Freedom, from which a large proportion of the Reagan
administration team were drawn. Because many Knights and recipients of
the Order's honors have worked in or around the CIA, critics sometimes
suggest a link between the two. The CIA has been dominated by the
Catholic hierarchy. According to members, the order serves "as an
international defend­er of the Church."\[7\] In June of each year a
ceremony is held in Rome for Knights of Malta which includes the
"swearing of allegiance to the defense of the Holy Mother Church."\[8\]
Herein lies the problem for population growth control and its
recognition as a national security issue. Population growth control
seriously threatens the survival of the Vatican, as discussed in
chapters one and four. Knights are committed to defending the Church.
Only the most devout and obedient are invited to join the Knights and
Opus Dei (which its detractors have compared to mind-controlling
cults).\[9\] If the Vatican has determined that population growth
control threatens the Holy Mother Church, the members of these societies
are obliged to counter this threat by thwarting the development of
population growth control government policies and their execution. It is
inevitable that the best interests of the Vatican and those of the
United States are not always going to be the same. For this reason, no
one can possibly swear complete alle­giance to both and mean it. The acts
and attitudes of the Knights of Malta in the Reagan administration seem
to reflect this complete allegiance to the Catholic Church rather than
to our country. This deep conflict [[has serious ramifications for
**population growth control**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As long as it
exists, it is not possible to effectively deal with the population
problem. [The real population problem is not convincing people that they
must have small families or delivering the family planning services to
them. This we can most certainly achieve in just ten years for 95
percent of the world's population and at a price we can afford. The real
population problem is this conflict between the needs of the Church and
the desperate needs of humanity to control its
proliferation]{.underline}. Consider the intensity of the commitment of
these secret society members as "international defenders of the Church."
It is hardly a secret that one of the most important American advances
in "defend­ing the Church" by Catholic elitists was the creation of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The activities of the CIA go far
beyond intelligence gathering of an international nature.\[10\] The CIA
serves as an agency through which secret "assistance" to the Holy Mother
Church can be provided by secret American society members acting as her
defenders: During the CIA's formative years, Protestants
predominated.... Somehow, however, Catholics wrested control of the
CIA's covert-action section. It was no coincidence that some of the
agency's more grandiose operations were in Catholic countries of Latin
America and the Catholic regime of South Vietnam.\[11\] For creating the
Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the wartime predecessor to the CIA,
and this special arrangement with the Vatican, General William "Wild
Bill" Donovan was decorated in July 1944 by Pope Pius XII with the Grand
Cross of the Order of Saint Sylvester, the oldest and most prestigious
of papal knighthoods. This award has been given to only one hundred
other men in history, who, "by feat of arms or writings or outstanding
deeds have spread the faith and have safeguarded and championed the
Church."\[12\] Donovan did more to safeguard and champion the Church
than any other American, and he was rewarded for his services with the
highest Catholic award ever received by an American. No doubt, thousands
of others have striven with their deeds for similar recognition. What
has this meant in terms of the issues cited in Table I? Communism is the
greatest threat faced by the Church. The Catholic Church and communism
cannot coexist. They are both rival absolut­ists. Both indoctrinate their
children so as to ensure complete rejec­tion of the other. Columnist
Robert Blair Kaiser who covered the Vati­can for Time magazine had a
conversation with Pope John XXIII in August 1962. "For too long, he
\[the pope\] said, the Church had been waging a so-called holy war
against the forces of communism. That was getting us nowhere."\[13\]
This holy war continues in Central America today! \[ Table1 OMITTED \]
It is believed by some historians that the reason the Vatican aided
Hitler in his rise to power was so that he could destroy Russian
commu­nism. When this failed, the Vatican through its defenders called
upon the United States to stop the spread of Russian communism in Europe
and elsewhere. A Vatican-inspired hate campaign against the Rus­sians,
the greatest hate campaign ever endured by Americans, was launched. To
this day, like most other Americans, I am a victim of this campaign
launched during my childhood. In August 1984, President Reagan showed
his intense hatred of the Russian people in his infamous radio
microphone test, "My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today
that I've signed legislation that would outlaw Russia forever. We begin
bombing in five minutes." No doubt, this Vatican-inspired hate campaign
has influenced Mr. Reagan. By this theory, at a cost of hundreds of
billions of American dollars, [we built a war machine for the protection
of Catholicism. For this same reason have we built a nuclear arsenal
powerful enough to destroy the world five times over [and]{.mark} have
we seen the Russians match it? This is, I feel, in great part the origin
of [the other great **threat to civilization**---**nuclear
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent
to protect Catholicism from communism, and one can only conjecture about
the ways in which the world would have been different if this money had
been spent differently and if the first requests to the World Health
Organization by India for population growth control assistance had not
been blocked by the Vatican thirty-four years ago. Our commitment to
saving the Catholic government in South Vietnam from communism (only 5
percent of the people of South Vietnam were Catholic, \[14\] causing
some observers to refer to it as a Vatican colony) can be thought of as
a result of the activities of the "U.S. Catholic defenders of the
Church," largely members of the CIA. The French provided this same
service to the Vatican for eighty years before they gave up on the holy
war in Vietnam.\[15\] A number of issues cited in Table I, including
U.S. military sup­port for El Salvador and other Central American
governments, the Grenada invasion, and maintaining the status quo in
Latin America can be seen as Vatican-inspired actions to prop up
Catholic (Vatican-dominated) governments against popular uprisings. They
are the "holy wars against communism" mentioned by Pope John XXIII.
During a May 1984 fundraising visit to New York, the archbishop of
Managua, Nicaragua, Miguel Obando y Bravo, said his campaign represented
the best-organized opposition in Nicaragua to popular Sandinista
govern­ment efforts.\[16\] Another example is Lebanon. Most Americans are
not aware of the closeness of the Gemayel government to the Vatican.
"Maronite Christians," a minority group in Lebanon, are the Eastern
Catholic Church. "The Maronites are in communion with Rome and have a
college for the education of their clergy in Rome. In the year 1181, at
the time of the Crusades, the Maronites...made peace with Rome and
became attached to the Holy See."\[17\] Gemayel, like his politician
father, was Jesuit trained in a Catholic university.\[18\] The Vatican
wishes to see the Maronites continue to be the dominant power in Lebanon
so that the only country in the Middle East in the Vatican sphere of
influence will remain so. In all of these cases the Vatican, to maintain
and expand its geographical control, seems to be calling upon the
services of the U.S. Defense Department to serve as an instrument of
Vatican foreign policy in much the same way it has in Cold War Europe.
My purpose in presenting this brief discussion of selected foreign
policy initiatives of the Vatican is to show the lengths to which
"defenders of the Church" in the Reagan administration are willing to go
in order to "safeguard" the Church. To these "defenders," Viet­nam, El
Salvador, Grenada, and Lebanon are viewed in part as "holy wars for the
preservation of the Church." They are unquestionably willing to go to
similar lengths to protect the Church from population growth control
activities. Population scientists, field workers, and, more importantly,
journalists must acknowledge the magnitude of this obstacle to solving
the population problem and deal with this problem in its entirety---and
without delay. In the meantime, [the Vatican is enhancing its political
power through generating domestic divisiveness]{.underline}. The
abortion issue is clearly the most important to the Church and one of
the most contentious issues in American history. It has allowed the
Church to mobilize (under the guise of an emotional or "moral" issue)
many Catholics, though a minority of those in this country, for
political purposes. But it has also given the Church the opportunity to
mobilize a large number of non-Catholics, mostly Protestant
fundamentalists, to serve the needs of the Vatican. Just after the
Reagan administration announced the radical change in U.S. population
assistance policy, Senator Bradley of New Jersey sent out a press
release dated August 8, 1984. He sharply con­demned the Reagan
administration policy change in the name of abor­tion restriction. "I
cannot comprehend the logic of this new policy. It is not about
abortion. What the policy is about is denying support for family
planning services.... The administration's new policy will do a great
deal to suppress family planning efforts . . ."\[19\] (emphasis added).
The Vatican's real target here was family planning, and it expects
Americans to be fooled by its strategy. Most Protestant fundamentalists
have no problem with family planning, but they have been used here by
the Vatican to accomplish Vatican goals. Few fundamentalists are opposed
to family planning, international population assistance, or illegal
immigration control. Yet the Vatican uses its "Moral Majority" and the
political force of the fundamentalists to undermine family planning,
international population assistance, and illegal immigration control
through this organization of lobbyists. [Federal aid to public education
has always been opposed by the Church]{.underline}. Between 1925 and
1945, it was blocked by the Catholic lobby\[20\] [because it enhances
the disparity between Catholic education and public education and shifts
some decision-making to the federal level where it is less susceptible
to Church influence than at the local level]{.underline}. The Vatican is
opposed to the United Nations and its agencies because it sees them as a
competitor for the role of international arbitrator and peacemaker.
[[**Parochial school aid** is]{.mark} viewed by the Church as vitally
[important]{.mark}]{.underline}. Only 30 percent\[21\] (about three
million\[22\]) of Catholic children attend Catholic schools. While these
schools produce enough obedient Catholics to advance the Vatican agenda,
[tripling this proportion would substantially enhance the power of the
Church]{.underline}. [[**School prayer** is important]{.mark} because,
the more religious the public schools are made, the easier it is to
justify government assistance to parochial schools]{.underline}. Other
issues appearing in Table I have been discussed elsewhere in this text
and need not be dealt with here. [What is important is that the Church
[**picks up non-Catholic support** on each of these
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, non-Catholic private school
parents who send their children to nonreligious schools support the
Church's political initiatives because they stand to gain from them. The
Vatican has elevated fundamentalist leader Jerry Falwell to a posi­tion
of power and status of which he never dreamed. He is enabled to have
frequent meetings with President Reagan and given an oppor­tunity to be
one of the nation's foremost "moral leaders," delivering "Moral State of
the Union" speeches on nationwide prime-time telecasts. In return,
Falwell provides the Church with a constituency of millions of
fundamentalists to mask as a "Christian" effort the Vatican's lobbying
effort against abortion, the Equal Rights Amend­ment, family planning,
and population assistance issues. [The Vatican's extensive intrusion
into American policy-making is causing considerable national
divisiveness. The Vatican [gains]{.mark} considerable [political
advantage]{.mark} from its allies among non-Catholics [and uses it
to]{.mark} heavily [influence government policy]{.mark} (or to thwart
the making of policy altogether in some areas). Their manipulation has
[frustrate]{.mark}d [mobilization]{.mark} in this country [to deal
with]{.mark} the nation's most pressing problems, such as **[population
growth]{.mark} control**, **[nuclear disarmament]{.mark}**, illegal
immigration control, **[environmental degradation]{.mark}**, including
the pollution of our nation's waters [and]{.mark} soil, **[soil
erosion]{.mark}**, and the "**greenhouse effect**]{.underline}." Our
country is finding itself in a position similar to those in Latin
America which are literally being buried under their problems because
their national interests sometimes differ from Vatican interests.

In 2013, a group called Citizens for Self-Governance (CSG) initiated
[[the Convention of States]{.underline}]{.mark} (CoS)
[[Project]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[seeks to amend]{.mark} the U.S.
Constitution through an Article V Convention. [With funding and support
from]{.mark}]{.underline} conservative entities such as [the Koc[h
Brothers]{.mark} and the American Legislative Exchange
Council]{.underline}, [the [Project promotes amendments]{.mark} designed
[to "impose fiscal restraints on the federal government]{.mark}," "limit
the power and jurisdiction of the federal government," and "limit the
terms of office for federal officials]{.underline}" (Guldenschuh 2015).
[As of early 2019, [fourteen states had issued calls for a
convention]{.mark} to consider these amendments. Another conservative
effort bringing new life into state calls promoting a convention to
adopt a [Balanced Budget Amendment]{.mark} has [generated]{.mark} a
total of [twenty-eight applications]{.mark} as of 2018]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, on the left, a smaller and less well-funded effort has led to
six states issuing calls for an Article V Convention focused on campaign
finance. They seek to amend the Constitution in order to overturn the
Supreme Court decision overturning various campaign-finance limits in
Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010). [Active state Article V
Convention calls continue to be debated in multiple state
legislatures]{.underline}. For example, as of March 2019 the Convention
of States call (pushed by CSG, which modestly describes itself as the
"largest Article V grassroots organization in the country") has been the
subject of active legislation in fourteen state legislatures in 2019
(Convention of States 2019). Arkansas and Utah passed the CoS call in
2019. [Efforts such as these have drawn renewed attention to the state
convention method of amending the U.S. Constitution]{.underline}.
Article V of the Constitution allows two-thirds of the states to call
for a convention of states for proposing Constitutional amendments.
Unlike the alternative and more familiar process of advancing
Constitutional amendments by a two-thirds vote of the Congress, followed
by state ratification, [the power to call for a Constitutional
convention rests with the states.]{.underline} As Article V states, in
part: "The Congress ... on the Application of the Legislatures of two
thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing
Amendments..." [Because the convention method has never been employed
under the U.S. Constitution, the prospect of a convention raises many
questions]{.underline} and alternative assessments. Must all of the
state calls be expressed in identical language? [[Can such a convention
be limited in scope or would it constitute an entity **immune from
preconditions**]{.mark}**?**]{.underline} What role (if any) do the
courts play in deciding such questions? [[Uncertainty]{.mark} about
these and other issues [has long posed a political hurdle]{.mark} to
utilizing the convention approach, with many observers raising [the
prospect of a "**runaway" convention** that might trample on the Bill of
Rights or other provisions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Goldberg 1983).
Accordingly, [these and other aspects of an Article V convention have
prompted [**considerable discussion and analysis** by lawyers, scholars,
and public officials]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.mark}Caplan 1988; Vile
1993). Less is known, however, about why and how states have articulated
Article V applications over time and how contemporary movements to call
a convention may align with or differ from historical patterns. Over the
course of American history, [states have issued at least 354 distinct
calls for an Article V convention. Some, such as the efforts to provide
for the direct election of Senators or to require a balanced federal
budget]{.underline}, [have]{.underline} [come]{.underline} **[close
enough to garnering support from two-thirds of the states that they
provoked a preemptory response from Congress]{.underline}**. Others have
prompted momentary interest and then faded away. Many have been
motivated by states' interest in enhancing their power relative to the
national government, but others have been focused on important policy
issues of the day. Can these and other patterns from the past inform our
understanding of today's efforts to amend the Constitution through a
convention of the states, or are there features of contemporary calls
for an Article V convention that are different and unique?

A. The Fear of a Runaway Convention [[The threat of a runaway convention
is the primary reason why the People are hesitant to call a convention
of states]{.underline}]{.mark}. A runaway convention is a convention
that begins proposing other policies that were not supposed to be
considered, and authority for such consideration was not granted to the
convention at the outset. Hence, [[the fear is a runaway convention
ultimately could throw out the U.S. Constitution and replace it with a
new one.]{.underline}]{.mark} However, commentator Michael [[Stern notes
that]{.mark} when one is evaluating the risk of a runaway convention,
[one must also consider]{.mark} the [risks that may be reduced
with]{.mark} the use of a convention and its [prevention of a "runaway
Congress."]{.mark}]{.underline} 29 [[Advocates]{.mark} for a convention
[think]{.mark} that a [runaway convention is really not a threat]{.mark}
at all [for three reasons: (1) the convention can only be called for a
limited purpose, (2) the Supreme Court would]{.mark} be able to [weigh
in]{.mark} on any violations of specific rules and procedures the
convention creates for itself, [and (3) more states are needed to ratify
the proposals than are needed to call the
convention]{.mark}.]{.underline} [There are several perspectives on
whether the convention can be limited in scope to prevent a runaway
convention]{.underline}.30 First, [some advocates believe that Congress
can limit the scope of the convention and propose rules for it under the
political question doctrine]{.underline}.31 [However, most believe this
is untrue and hold that Congress's calling of the convention is merely
ministerial because the entire purpose of the convention is to
circumvent a corrupt Congress]{.underline}.32 [Since limiting the scope
of the convention is not constitutionally committed to Congress, it
falls outside the political question doctrine]{.underline}.33
[Furthermore, Alexander Hamilton's Federalist No. 85 specifically
mentions Congress's inability to limit the convention]{.underline}.34
Because Federalist No. 85 never mentions a restriction on the states to
place limits on the convention,35 the states are the ones most likely to
implement the limits. [[Under another perspective, opponents of a
convention believe that, based on the original text and meaning of
Article V, there are no limits that can be placed on a convention that
would hold any legal force]{.underline}]{.mark}.36 [They conclude the
states have no authority to limit the scope of the convention for two
reasons]{.underline}. [First, the original text of Article V provides
for making "amendments" plural,]{.underline} therefore precluding any
attempt by the states to limit the convention to proposing one
amendment.37 [This argument fails, however, because the use of
"amendments" only gives discretion to the convention to propose more
than one amendment that will achieve its explicit goal]{.underline}.38
[Second, opponents hold that states have no constitutional grant of
power beyond initiating the convention.]{.underline}39 [This argument at
least partially fails because in order to give states the ability to
circumvent a corrupt Congress, states must be able to limit the
convention to achieve this purpose.]{.underline}40 [Therefore, the
inability of states to limit the scope of the convention would frustrate
the purpose of the Convention Clause]{.underline}. [Instead, while they
may not have direct, explicit authority to limit the procedures of a
convention themselves, states can curtail the convention's scope by
limiting the purpose for which it is formed]{.underline}. [[A third
perspective reveals the debate over whether the convention can propose
anything it so decides or whether it can only propose amendments
covering the subject matter detailed in the states'
applications.]{.underline}]{.mark}41 [If, once the convention is
convened, it can propose anything outside of the subject matter
discussed in the applications, then there is a chance---albeit
remote---that the convention could claim ultimate authority and create a
separate governing body.]{.underline}42 [However, this fear can be
checked by the requirement that three-fourths of the states must ratify
any convention amendments]{.underline}.43 The ratification process can
also place a check on the possibility the convention would exceed its
scope.44 Additionally, the history of the Convention Clause suggests
that the convention is only supposed to act as an aid to the states
rather than as a separate entity in and of itself.45 But again,
questions swirl as to whether the delegates can change the ratification
process and require ratification by a majority of states in the
convention (or something to that effect).46 This idea appears unfounded.
Any convention-made "rule" like this that would affect the Constitution
as it stands today would still require ratification to have any legal
effect on the current U.S. government.47 Another check on the convention
process is that Congress would have the right to not propose to the
states for ratification any amendment that surpassed the convention's
scope.48 This reasoning falls in line with Congress's---and even state
legislatures'---responsibility to uphold the Constitution if the
convention entered the process having limited itself to a single
subject.49 B. The Supreme Court's Potential Role Another area of primary
concern is whether there is any body of government that can enforce any
rules and procedures a convention would make for itself. If the Supreme
Court can rule on issues regarding a convention's rules and procedures,
would this upset the purpose of the convention because a government
branch, which the convention is trying to bypass, is interpreting its
rules and procedures?50 There is no good answer to this question, but it
appears the Supreme Court weighing in on violations of convention rules
would not upset the convention's purpose, as the Supreme Court's duty is
"to say what the law is." 51 C[. Threats to the Convention Process and
the Constitution]{.underline} [[In addition to the concerns already
discussed, there are others worth noting]{.mark}. [First, the convention
could be open to special-interest lobbying]{.mark} from groups that deal
with issues over which the convention would be
deliberating]{.underline}.52 [This [could threaten the integrity of the
negotiations and the proposal of amendments]{.mark}.]{.underline}53
[Also, a [more apocalyptic concern is that a convention of states could
result in a complete overhaul of the
Constitution]{.mark}]{.underline}.[54 This is unlikely for the reasons
explained above, but some commentators still hold this belief based on
the only other convention in American history, the Philadelphia
Convention of 1787]{.underline}.55 There is a debate over whether that
convention stayed within its scope when revising the Articles of
Confederation and producing the current Constitution.56 However, in any
case it would seem all convention "proposals would be subject to the
checks and balances written into the Constitution." 57

**Constitutional amendments are a key mechanism of democratic
backsliding- they're off the table now but reviving them kills
democracy**

of Chicago Law School, \"How to Lose a Constitutional Democracy,\" 65

1\. Constitutional Amendment [[Imagine that a political party
had]{.mark} disciplined [majorities in both houses]{.mark} of Congress
[and the thirty-eight states]{.mark} necessary to utilize Article
V]{.underline}. Or alternatively, [[suppose]{.mark} that the growing
chorus of calls for [a new constitutional convention]{.mark} yielded
fruit]{.underline}.281 **[It [would]{.mark} then [be feasible to reform
core elements of the American Constitution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
[content of such reforms is not hard to imagine. Perhaps, [following
patterns in other illiberal democracies, a first target might be the
Twenty-Second Amendment]{.mark}, which constitutionalized [term
limits]{.mark}]{.underline} in the wake of Franklin Roosevelt's
presidency. [[Or]{.mark} [simply examine the various
liberty-restricting]{.mark} constitutional [amendments that have been
proposed]{.mark} in Congress [over the years,]{.mark} mainly to overturn
court decisions]{.underline}.282 To be sure, there are other amendments
that have been proposed that would enhance liberty. But the point is
that [there is [nothing]{.mark} structural [in Article V that prevents
this]{.mark} disciplined national [majority]{.mark} with sufficient
political support at the state level [from using]{.mark} constitutional
[amendment to entrench its power and restrict
liberty]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nevertheless, we do not think that
constitutional amendment will play a significant role in promoting the
retrogression of constitutional liberal democracy for two reasons.
First, American political parties have historically lacked discipline
relative to their counterparts in other democracies---a complex result
of history, geography, and our electoral system. And the very veneration
of the Constitution suggests that amendments are likely to receive a
good deal of attention, working as focal points for constitutional
resistance by regime opponents.283 As a strategic matter, more subtle
mechanisms are likely to be more effective and hence more likely to be
deployed.284 Second, [Article V of the Constitution establishes "some of
the most onerous hurdles in the world for the ratification of
amendments]{.underline}."285 Indeed, it has been so rarely used that
some scholars have argued that it has fallen into desuetude.286 In most
other [contexts in which [amendment]{.mark} has [played a large role in
facilitating backsliding]{.mark}]{.underline} [from democratic
practices]{.underline}, by contrast, [the amendment rule has been less
demanding]{.underline}.287 There is an irony here: Article V has been
condemned roundly by commentators, especially on the political left.288
Yet [[the **rigidity** of the]{.mark} formal [constitutional procedure
largely takes off the table]{.mark} at least [one]{.mark} potent
[instrument of constitutional retrogression]{.mark} at a moment when
liberal commentators might well feel their priorities most
imperiled.]{.underline}

[One final implication is the most practical of all. If amendments are
in fact a sidelight, then it will usually be a mistake for people
concerned about an issue to try to address it by amending the
Constitution. Their [resources are generally better spent
on]{.mark}]{.underline} legislation, [[litigation]{.mark},]{.underline}
or private-sector activities. [It is true that the effort to obtain a
constitutional amendment may serve very effectively as a rallying point
for political activity]{.underline}. A constitutional amendment may be
an especially powerful symbol, and it may be worthwhile for a group to
seek an amendment for just that reason. [But in this respect
[constitutional amendments are comparable to congressional
resolutions]{.mark}, presidential proclamations, or declarations of
national holidays. If they [bring about change, they do so because of
their symbolic value, not because of their operative legal
effect]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

In this respect, a mature society might be compared to a long-term
contractual agreement. n10 The parties to such contracts often do not
rely solely, or even substantially, on the text of the contract to
govern their day-to-day relationship; they have developed extratextual
understandings. Similarly, in a mature society, **[[people accept
the]{.mark} acts of]{.underline}** legislatures,
**[[courts]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and executive agencies - and the
political and nonpolitical acts of their fellow citizens -
**[[even]{.mark} when those acts [augment or]{.mark} arguably
[conflict]{.mark} with [the foundational text]{.mark}. In a newly formed
political society, any apparent deviation from the words of a
constitution might be seen as revolutionary]{.underline}** and might
cause the society to break apart; **[in a mature society, relationships
and patterns of trust are so well developed that that does not
happen.]{.underline}** As a result, by the time an Article V
supermajority is galvanized into action, chances are good that much of
society has already changed by one of these other means. And if a formal
amendment process were unavailable, society would find another way to
enforce the change it has determined to make - by legislation and
judicial interpretation, or by alterations in social understandings and
private sector behavior. The change might not be accomplished as neatly
or as decisively; outliers might not be brought into line as quickly,
for example. But relatively speaking, that is a detail. Those other
institutions - not supermajoritarian constitutional amendments - will be
the truly important means of constitutional change. This explains why,
when \[\*1463\] society has changed enough to produce a supermajority in
favor of a formal amendment, the amendment is probably unnecessary. One
cannot, however, just say simplistically that any set of political
forces strong enough to bring about a constitutional amendment is strong
enough to change society in some other way, because that is not always
true. **[[A supermajority might]{.mark} act, and [adopt an
amendment]{.mark}, even if society has not fundamentally changed. [An
amendment might represent]{.mark}]{.underline}** a momentary high-water
mark of popular sentiment on a question, or **[[an effective effort by
an interest group]{.underline}]{.mark}** at the height of its power to
secure its position. n11 **[At a later time, many people, even a
majority, might decide that the amendment was a mistake - but there it
is, entrenched in the Constitution]{.underline}**. **[On these occasions
[the formal amendment will be]{.mark} relatively
[insignificant]{.mark}]{.underline}** for a different reason. **[When
there is no lasting social consensus behind a textual amendment, the
change in the text of the Constitution is unlikely to make a lasting
difference]{.underline}** - at least if it seeks to affect society in an
important way - unless society changes in the way that the amendment
envisions. Until that happens, **[[the amendment is likely]{.mark} to be
[evaded, or interpreted]{.mark} in a way [that blunts its
effectiveness]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is, in a sense, the other
side of the fact that **[a mature society has a variety of institutions,
in addition to the text of the Constitution, that can affect how the
society operates. Those institutions can change society without changing
the Constitution;]{.underline}** but they can also keep society
basically the same - perhaps with some struggle, but still basically the
same - even if the text of the Constitution changes. This was, most
notoriously, the story of the Fourteenth and, especially, the Fifteenth
Amendment. The Fifteenth Amendment was somewhat effective in the short
run, but within a generation it had been reduced to a nullity in the
South. n12

Constitutional Originalism, November, 2010, "REFORMING ARTICLE V: THE
PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE NATIONAL CONVENTION AMENDMENT METHOD AND HOW TO
FIX THEM", http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20788836.pdf?acceptTC=true

Now, consider [a different [amendment provision]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This provision [[allows Congress to amend the Constitution]{.mark},
subject to ratification by state legislatures or conventions,
[but]{.mark} it [provides no other]{.mark} amendment [method]{.mark}.
Thus, it gives Congress a veto on any amendments. This provision would
also make the Constitution less reflective of popular views and less
desirable.]{.underline} Given the desire of political entities to
maintain and expand their power, [[**Congress is unlikely** to allow the
Constitution to be amended **to limit its power**]{.mark}. Moreover,
because [Congress tends to adopt the perspective of the federal
government]{.mark} generally, Congress [might not]{.mark} be quick to
[limit the power of]{.mark} the [other branches]{.mark} of the federal
government.]{.underline}62 Thus[, if a change in values or circumstances
were to require additional limitations on Congress or even on the
federal government, it is unlikely that an amendment adopting those
changes would be passed]{.underline}. Moreover[, if Congress were to
abuse its power, no constitutional reform would be forthcoming. Over
time, then, one would expect the Constitution to become increasingly
distorted normatively. [The Constitution would fail to add]{.mark}
needed [checks on]{.mark} Congress and [the federal government, but
would]{.mark} grow to [include]{.mark} additional [limitations on the
states]{.mark}]{.underline} (and perhaps the President). Finally,
consider [the existing Article V provisions. We can see that it ~~is~~
\[are\] largely the same as the one described immediately above that
permits only the congressional amendment process.]{.underline} Given the
defects in the convention process, it is as if that process does not
exist. [Thus, the same **normative distortions** that apply to a
constitution with only **[the congressional amendment
procedure]{.mark}**\--a [bias **in favor of Congress and the national
government**, and against the states]{.mark}\--apply to the existing
Constitution.]{.underline} The one exception to this claim is that the
national convention process would be available [if matters ever turned
catastrophic. At that point, the state legislatures might be willing to
risk a runaway convention and the other costs to address genuinely
overriding problems. But absent this]{.underline} extraordinary
situation, [[the]{.mark} national convention [process would not be
employed and the Constitution would exhibit **serious normative
problems**]{.mark}]{.underline}. My argument [that the failure of the
national convention method undermines the constitutional amendment
process by preventing certain amendments from being enacted is confirmed
by our constitutional history]{.underline}. The dominant pattern of
constitutional amendments reveals an amendment process that has neither
placed checks on Congress or the federal government, nor provided
protections to the states.

Bills have been proposed in Congress setting out procedures that
Congress must follow when calling and conducting a convention upon
general application of the states. See, for example, S. 817, introduced
by Senator Orrin Hatch, and S. 600, introduced by Senator Jesse Helms in
1981. A similar bill was proposed by Senator Sam Ervin in 1967. It
passed the Senate in 1971, but died in the House Judiciary Committee.
Most commentators believe such a law would be helpful in resolving
conflicts in advance. See Article V and the Proposed Federal
Constitutional Convention Procedures Bill, Report and Recommendation to

Id. at 1617. As Senator Sam Ervin said in support of his bill: [\"The
Constitution made the amendment process difficult, and properly so. It

III\. [THE DANGERS OF \"TINKERING**\"**]{.underline} [Even if the
intrinsic difficulty of amendment were less challenging than it is
usually agreed to be, it would still, in our current situation, face
formidable obstacles. That is because any proposed [constitutional
change]{.mark} confronts a presumption that it [poses]{.mark} serious
legal and [political risks]{.mark}]{.underline}.44 [Studies of relative
amendment flexibility have increasingly recognized the importance of
these qualitative factors under the caption of \"amendment
culture.]{.underline} \' 45 The evaluation of such a culture presents
obvious problems of measurement. Tom [Ginsburg and]{.underline} James
[Melton]{.underline} have attempted to \"operationalize amendment
culture as the rate at which a country\'s previous constitution was
amended\" and [concluded that,]{.underline} so measured, [it was a
better predictor of subsequent amendment rates than the formal
attributes of the procedure]{.underline}.46 [There is good reason to
think that the current amendment culture in the United States exhibits a
decided reluctance to change the Constitution]{.underline}. [The
clearest evidence of this attitude is the pronounced anxiety that
appears whenever we get close to reaching the number of state
legislatures necessary to approve a national constitutional convention
47 in light of worries about the extent of the changes such a convention
might propose.]{.underline}48 [The fear that any constitutional reform
is likely to make things worse has a long history]{.underline}. The
original ratification of the Constitution was closely contested and
spawned \"bitter disagreement of great ideological depth. 49 Despite
this inauspicious beginning, the Constitution\'s authority was promptly
accepted on all sides.50 Its former Anti-Federalist opponents, in fact,
were soon citing \"the strict words of this frail Constitution,
insisting on a literal interpretation of a document that many of them
had vilified on fundamental grounds. \' 51 The historian, Lance Banning,
explained that the generation of the Constitution makers, steeped in
classical republican thought, held a deep attachment to a mixed or
balanced government. Maintaining such a government demanded an
\"unremitting attention to the stability of the state. \' 52
\"[According to their favorite histories of England and of Rome,
constitutional change, like water, always flowed
downhill.\"]{.underline}53 [In light of these fears, the Constitution
began to look better, even to those who had been its vigorous
opponents]{.underline}. These beliefs set the stage for what Banning
described as \"constitutional apotheosis. \'54 Even the disagreements
that led to the great crisis of disunion in the mid-nineteenth century
were not about the merits of the Constitution. Southern statespersons on
the brink of secession continued to cite the Constitution in their
defense.55 [The prospects of amendment cannot be evaluated without
taking into account the continued existence of [U.S. \"Constitution
worship."]{.mark}]{.underline}5 6 [This attitude naturally
[discourages]{.mark} any [attempts]{.mark} to improve or replace the
original text]{.underline}.57 When the National Constitution Center\'s
website posted the video of a debate on the propriety of a national
amendment convention, it introduced the subject by noting, \"\[I\]t is
always tempting to invoke Article V to amend the Constitution-to \'fix\'
it, or \'restore\' it, or \'improve\' it. But, on the other hand, there
is a substantial risk to tinkering with the Constitution: many
amendments seem to have unintended consequences. \'58 [Worries about
\"tinkering with the Constitution\" come up whenever constitutional
revision is suggested]{.underline}. 59 [That description connotes
something trivial, something to be contrasted with the solemn majesty of
the Constitution]{.underline}. In 1915, an article with that title, by
Joseph R. Long, was published in the Yale Law Journal. 6° Long
criticized a proposal to amend Article V to make the adoption of new
amendments easier.61 The recent approval of the Sixteenth and
Seventeenth Amendments, he argued, belied the claim that amendment was
near impossible.62 But mainly, like Madison, he worried that too many
revisions would \"impair the dignity of a constitution. \' 63 The
substantive reforms motivating many proposed amendments would be better
accomplished by federal or state legislation. 64 The Constitution, he
conceded, \"is not perfect,\" but a careful and deliberate process was
essential before altering a document that \"is justly regarded as the
greatest instrument of government ever ordained by man. 65 [A more
recent illustration of the same phenomenon is the response to efforts to
procure a constitutional amendment giving Congress the power to punish
desecration of the United States\' flag. These proposals were seriously
mooted in the wake of decisions by the Supreme Court, holding that
prosecutions for flag defilement were prohibited by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments.]{.underline} 66 [Many people considered
disrespect for the flag to be a grave offense, and opinion polls showed
a fairly consistent majority favoring criminal prosecution]{.underline}.
67 [[Opponents]{.mark} of such a constitutional amendment, however, were
able to mount effective arguments exactly along the lines
discussed]{.underline}. 68 [That is, they did not stress the rightness
of constitutional protection for flag burners. Instead, they [emphasized
the dangers of toying with the Constitution]{.mark} and especially with
the Bill of Rights]{.underline}.

***If stopped on the street and asked "What do you think would be the
most likely thing to cause human's extinction?" Most of us would likely
reply with something concerning asteroids crashing down to earth and
causing mass extinctions. But, in truth, one of the symptoms of our
race's** [overpopulation **causing the** extinction **of**]{.underline}
**our race (and [most]{.underline} other [species upon this planet along
with us]{.underline}) [is a profusely]{.underline}** [higher
probability]{.underline}**. The subject of overpopulation is a very
controversial issue. The controversy is mainly left untouched due to the
fact of religious and political standings and of course, peoples'
nonsensical fear of what the 'fix' for the issue that might be implied.
But there is a universal law that applies to every single thing on this
planet: Everything in moderation. Too much of anything can be
self-destructive. It applies on every scale; on a personal level,
economically, nationally, globally, and even in microscopic ecosystems.
It is the universal law of moderation. Humans, animals, bacteria, and
viruses alike are genetically designed to reproduce as much as possible,
it is simple biology. It is the manner in which species carry on their
race for millennia. It is technology and modern medicine that has
permitted us to go far beyond previous population ceilings, therefore,
in combination of these circumstantial events, we are breaking the
universe's ostensible law of moderation. Ensuing [self-destruction of
the human race is]{.underline}** [imminent **with our current course and
figures**]{.underline}**. WE have to be the ones to intervene. No
radical action is necessary, but public awareness is. The growing
gravity of this situation requires the awareness of all of the populaces
living upon the earth. [Earth is being run dry; non-reusable resources
are being depleted at a previously unconceivable rate; and many reusable
resources are being used at a faster rate than they naturally can
replenish themselves]{.underline}. This is not a new problem, but an
evolving one. Martin Luther King in 1966 recognized and addressed the
issue, profoundly saying "Unlike plagues of the dark ages or
contemporary diseases we do not yet understand, the modern plague of
overpopulation is soluble by means we have discovered and with resources
we possess." Even back in 1966, when the world held a mere three billion
people, overpopulation was a serious issue. The human population is now
at more than double that number in less than 50 years later, and the
growing strain upon the earth is palpable. The [global crises such
as]{.underline}** [pollution**,** water shortages**,**
desertification**,** rising sea levels**,** global warming**, animal**
species extinction**, and** economic failures **and recessions are
reactive issues** precipitating from overpopulation **itself.
Overpopulation of any species has proven to kill any environment holding
it. The entire earth is the human environment. The Earth itself is at
risk of** turning into Mars]{.underline}**. The people's collective
decisions and those of the next handful of generations will decide the
fate of Earth. Without Earth the Human species goes extinct. "What is
lacking is not sufficient knowledge of the solution but universal
consciousness of the gravity of the problem and education of the
billions who are its victim." -- Martin Luther King, Jr. The general
populace isn't notified that it is an issue. It isn't shown as an issue
in the media. Schools do not teach about it. It is the issue that stays
in the closet of secrecy. Why? The only way to fix the issue in a moral
manner is to make the public aware of the gravity of the situation, and
how they can do their part. "Nobody's working on a real solution. No one
has the courage. Not U.N. leaders, scientists or billionaires. No one.
It's taboo. All part of a conspiracy of silence. But denial is killing
us. The human race is in a suicidal run to self-destruction. We can't
blame it on the great American conspiracy of climate-science deniers,
Big Oil, the Koch Bros, U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Congress. It's
us."(Farrell) The human rate of reproduction is the problem.
"Overpopulation" means more goods or resources are required than can be
supplied to them. Humans have always had the power to reproduce, to
create life. They now have to have the resolve to not over-use that
power. "The U.N.'s 2,000 scientists know overpopulation is Earth's only
real problem... Your scientific method makes this clear, we are making
too many babies. Population's out of control. And that's the world's No.
1 problem. But we're all in denial."(Farrell) Though one has to ask...
'who is in denial?'. The issue is never brought to light, so the average
person never sees it for being an issue, they simply believe that all
the world's crises are independent of one another and are not related to
a root cause. The effects of human over-population can be seen
everywhere, pollution, desertification, water shortages, contagion
outbreaks, global warming, animal extinction, and the hole in our ozone
layer over Antarctica. "U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change... they're solving the wrong problems."(Farrell) This goes for
more than just climate change, of course. But the U.N. is focusing on
band-aiding the symptoms instead of addressing what they all too well
know is the issue. Pollutants from big oil doing their best to keep
electric and hybrid cars off the roads so they can continue to make many
billions per year, at the cost of earth's atmosphere and future. And
overpopulation, which increases the output of pollutants and over-draws
on resources causing desertification. "The world population is currently
growing by 74 million people per year -- the equivalent of a city the
size of San Francisco every three days." (Saracino) What is the
environmental effect of overpopulation? Every person on the planet takes
up space. Not just the small, physical space we take as people, or that
our homes and yard does. Space is needed for farmland, and forests.
People excrete wastes and cause pollution that flow into water systems
and animal habitats, contaminating water, and killing wildlife. Many
individuals cannot wash themselves or brush their teeth due to the
caustic condition of the water in their neighboring land. Climates are
changing, we can see a pattern in this table from the UN Population
division. \[\[ FGURE OMITTED \]\] There is an obvious correlation here.
The rising average temperatures are also causing the ice caps to melt at
the poles, which in turn raises the sea level. The rising sea level
causes flooding. A long chain of natural disaster cause and effect.
[Forests are being exhausted as more wood and land is required to
support our ever-growing population. The loss of these forests leads to
extinction of plants and animals. These plants could contain cures for
diseases that will never be found]{.underline}. [Water usage is expected
to increase by 50%]{.underline} in developing nations [between 2015 and
2025]{.underline}, and 18% in developed nations. With freshwater supply
already being strained, this demographic is causing a stir in many
countries' governments, whom are scrambling to figure out ways to supply
their people's rising water needs. Being that 97% of the earth's water
is salt water, unfit for consumption, and 67% of the remaining three
percent is frozen, there isn't very much remaining to go around. The
wide-ranging loss of biodiversity, deforestation, extinction of species,
and the pollution of the ocean and other water sources worldwide ought
to be of chief concern to all of humanity, as the devastation and
disregard of the environment will cause insurmountable difficulties for
our perpetually multiplying human population in the not so far future.
This, even currently, is putting colossal pressure on our natural
resources and environment. Regrettably, as long as the disproportionate
world population carries on growing as it is, proportionate economic
growth will be needed to compensate for that population growth. In turn,
that economy requires more consumption of resources. [Oil will be the
first to run dry and]{.underline}** [exhaustion of resources will cease
growth**, both** population growth **and** economic growth**. This will
almost definitely lead to** wars**, embargos, and political and
economical mayhem**]{.underline}**. Size of population and the
fluctuations thereof, have a definite effect on an economy.
Overpopulation means more demand in general. The main issue in
developing countries is they are unable to compensate increasing supply
for mass growth and as a result people starve. First of all, when
countries are overpopulated, the people hardly have enough sustenance to
support themselves, never mind the hope of having an excess to trade to
other countries for the purpose of economic growth. This can cause a low
GDP per Capita which is an effect overpopulation has on the economy.
This causes the gap between upper-class and poverty to widen greatly,
causing the vast majority to be within poverty status and all but
eliminating any type of "middle-class". In an endeavour to save the
people from the starvation, the government will most likely have to
depend on foreign debt. This puts the country in debt at stretches the
government's already inadequate resources. Furthermore, when a nation is
overpopulated, there is a high rate of unemployment because there aren't
enough occupations to support the population. This consequences in a
high level of crime because the people will need to steal things in
order to subsist. Which in turn puts more stress on the economy.
[Overpopulation can also cause]{.underline}** [viruses **to become**
major epidemics**. Every person that a virus comes in contact with there
is a fair chance the virus will mutate, change, and improve itself.
This, in turn, can cause the virus to turn lethal, or become more lethal
than it already is. Compound this over few million individuals and the
virus could be an apocalyptic one**]{.underline}**. Ebola infected many
countries recently. It also came to the US. This was most likely due to
overpopulation. If there weren't so many people in Africa it wouldn't
have spread to that degree, which also means that maybe the person that
brought Ebola to the U.S, might have not contracted Ebola. Possibly
because the overpopulation in Africa caused it to spread to the location
the individual that came to the US was. In that case overpopulation does
cause calamities to spread faster. With human populations being focused
in urban centers, if there was a particularly deadly strand of virus or
other contractible contagion, then it would spread as rapidly as a wild
fire does in a forest with dense dead kindling littering the forest
floor. People would contract it quickly on public transit, hospitals
would become quickly overpopulated, and would cause the disease to
spread there also; many people would begin dying. Overpopulation has
always demonstrated to be abysmal for contagions when we look at times
past. Such as the Black Plague, where people were all residing in a
diminutive area of a city. There is also a social and psychological
repercussion to overpopulation. The detrimental psychological effects of
overcrowding due to overpopulation are made apparent in a common biology
labs. Two rats were put into a cage and allowed to reproduce freely. At
first, they got along well. That soon was no longer the case. The
quantity of rats swelled but they remained in the original enclosure. As
their numbers grew, they began to display anti-social behavior. The
conclusion of overcrowding is the equivalent with human beings. [The
lesser amount of space people have to live in, the more difficult it is
for them to get along. As humans compete, not simply for space but also
for food, water and air, the more antagonistic their conduct
becomes]{.underline}. Crime, and a lack of reverence for other people,
turns out to be more commonplace as personal space is decreased.
Violence is most predominant in highly populated regions, as are
additional forms of criminal behavior. This is, in all probability, due
to hostility and anxiety brought on by a deficiency of personal space.
"Worldwide only 57.4% of women aged 15-49 who are married or in a union
are using modern contraception"(WOA). And for a majority of that
statistic, it is completely unavailable to them. The world's population
grows the most in the areas that are least able to be accommodated.
"Growth is expected to be most rapid in the 49 least developed
countries, which are projected to double in size from around 900 million
inhabitants in 2013 to 1.8 billion in 2050"(WOA). [The solution to human
population is not as complicated as one might think]{.underline}. There
is no need for radical action,** [no necessity for 'population
control'**. "It is the job of the population activists of today to stick
to the** reproductive justice **plan -- every woman should have control
over her own reproductive capacity. This plan has been** proven to
work]{.underline}**. There is no need for 'population control'"(WOA). A
vast majority of conceptions are accidental, if all the women of the
world were to be educated and given the affordable or free option of
contraception a very noticeable result would ensue. In conclusion, the
earth is in danger of being overconsumed past the point of no return.
[The best solution to this growing issue is multi-faceted.
Awareness]{.underline} for the billions who are plagued by it, whom,
currently are unaware. [Free contraceptives in areas of the globe having
the worst issues with this matter]{.underline}. Education of the women
of the world, making it more likely they would have fewer children and
later in their lives. And of course, individuals who could represent the
issue without fearing political or religious ramifications.***

***The effects of civil wars on international orders also differ across
historical eras.** [Civil wars may be fought over principles that
undermine]{.underline} **the** [norms]{.underline} **and rules** [that
undergird an international order. Civil wars may tempt intervention by
great powers, who must learn prudence lest their involvement lead to
direct military confrontation]{.underline}**. The** [spillover of civil
wars can ripple across borders and undermine regional balances of power.
When those regions are of great-power interest]{.underline}**, the**
[containment of civil wars becomes an imperative for international
order]{.underline}**. Much has been asserted about the relationship
between civil war and the post--Cold War international order. During the
last twenty-five years, pundits have repeatedly argued that the mere
occurrence of particular wars, such as Somalia and Bosnia in the 1990s
or Libya and Syria more recently, prove that international order is weak
and tenuous. Civil wars have played an outsized role in a popular
narrative of international disorder. According to this narrative, civil
violence, terrorism, failed states, and the number of refugees are at
unprecedentedly high levels. The world is falling apart, most people are
worse off than they were thirty years ago, and globalization is to
blame. By almost every measure, this narrative is empirically incorrect.
Over the last thirty years, there has been more creation of wealth and a
greater reduction of poverty, disease, and food insecurity than in all
of previous history.1 During the same period, the numbers and lethality
of wars have decreased.2 The success of the post--Cold War era in
managing civil wars--bringing multiple wars to an end and ameliorating
several others--has contributed to a more peaceful world. Great-power
confrontations have been few and great-power war a distant memory. As
measured by increased trade and reductions of arms expenditures as a
percentage of gdp, international cooperation has risen to unprecedented
levels.3 Indeed, international cooperation has been a fundamental
characteristic of the international order since the collapse of the
Soviet Union. Nonetheless,** [the post--Cold War international order is
currently under substantial pressure]{.underline}**, and in some areas,
progress has reversed. The Russian annexation of Crimea and invasion of
Ukraine signals a return to a militaristic approach to its border with
Eastern Europe, while China\'s aggressive policies in the South China
Sea promise that its relations with its neighbors will be tense and
dangerous. And after a fifteen-year historic reduction in the numbers of
civil wars, there has been a recent, major spike, mostly centered in the
Middle East. Russian intervention in Syria and Saudi Arabian
intervention in Yemen, and their indiscriminate use of force, run
counter to the way the United Nations and its member states have managed
civil wars over the past twenty-five years. The paralysis\[**[stasis\]
of the UN Security Council in responding to]{.underline} **the conflicts
in** [Ukraine and Syria conjures up memories of]{.underline} **the Cold
War,** [when proxy competition was the predominant response to civil
wars]{.underline}**.***

**Accessible family planning prevents global nuclear war and
civilizational collapse from population pressure **

***Paul** Ehrlich 3-24**, President, Center for Conservation Biology,

quoted by Sputnik News, "Overconsumption, Inequity \'Lower Chances of
Avoiding Global Collapse\' -- Scholar,"

*[The collapse of civilization in the next few decades is
imminent]{.underline}**, and it could be triggered by a variety of
factors, Paul Ehrlich told Sputnik.  \"It could be caused by a**
[nuclear war, droughts]{.underline} **and floods leading to** [mass
starvation]{.underline}**, a bursting of the debt bubble,** [political
unrest]{.underline} **from refugee flows or increasing economic
inequity,** [trade wars, terrorism or synergizing
combinations]{.underline} **of these and other factors,\" the researcher
said. ** [The main reasons]{.underline} **behind all these negative
predictions are, according to the scientist,**
[overpopulation]{.underline} **and overconsumption. He is confident that
these two factors** [will drive our civilization over the
edge. ]{.underline} **\"**[The basic problem is the wrecking of human
life-support systems]{.underline} **by growth in aggregate consumption
--- and that is** [a product of growth in population size]{.underline}
**and growth in per capita consumption. Various forms of inequity ---
gender, racial, religious could contribute by making it less likely that
people will provide the cooperation required to give the chance of
avoiding a collapse,\" the analyst argued.  In Ehrlich\'s view, the
situation has significantly worsened since he released a corresponding
warning in his book \"The Population Bomb\" 50 years ago.  \"The
population has doubled in size, climate disruption is now much more
thoroughly understood and is already causing problems, there soon will
be more weight of plastics in the oceans than fish; hormone-mimicking
synthetic chemicals are now toxifying earth from pole to pole and are
the likely cause of plunging sperm counts around the world;** [almost
half of wildlife has been exterminated in the greatest mass extinction
episode]{.underline} **in the last 66 million years,\" the analyst
said.  According to him,** [the chances of a global nuclear war wiping
out civilization are]{.underline} **now also \"**[higher
than]{.underline} **at any time during** [the Cold War]{.underline}
**except for the Cuban missile crisis.\"  Although, there have been
numerous warnings about the way humans are threatening life on earth,
governments and the international community have so far failed to reduce
this threat, and Ehrlich believes that there are several reasons for
this.  Among them are \"the lack of education in basic science,
especially among economists and politicians, who think economic growth
is the cure for everything rather than what it is --- the basic
disease,\" the analyst said, adding that a key role is also being played
by such negative traits if a human character as \"greed, stupidity and
arrogance.\"  Answering the question about which**
[measures]{.underline} **he considers** [essential to change the
situation for the better]{.underline}**, the scientist said that, among
other things,** [it\'s important to \"supply everyone with modern
contraception]{.underline} **and backup abortion,\" \"give women equal
rights and opportunities with men,\" \"end racial and religious
discrimination so that all people are free to help solve the human
dilemmas\" and \"redistribute wealth.\" number of sex workers.***

***Simply put,** [climate change is caused by excessive]{.underline}
**production of** [g]{.underline}**reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse**
[g]{.underline}**ase**[s]{.underline}**. As highlighted by the late
Professor Tony McMichael,** [the "cause(s) of the causes" should not be
overlooked]{.underline}**.1** [With climate change]{.underline}
**already** [close to an irreversible tipping point, urgent action is
needed to reduce not only our mean (carbon) footprints but also the
"number of feet]{.underline}**"---that is,** [the growing
population]{.underline} **either already** [creating large footprints or
aspiring to]{.underline} **do so. Wise and** [compassionate promotion of

[g]{.underline}**ase**[s. This]{.underline} **article** [outlines the
evidence for voluntary accessible family planning as a strategy to
reduce]{.underline} **greenhouse gas** [emissions and mitigate climate
change]{.underline}**. What is the relation between population and
environmental impact? During 1971-72, Ehrlich and Holdren identified
three factors that create humanity's environmental (including climatic)
impact, related by a simple equation2: Environmental impact, I =P×A×T in
which A is affluence (material consumption and the concomitant
"effluence" of pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO2) per person); T is
technology impact per person (in which fossil fuels measure more highly
than solar based energy); and P is population (the number of people).**
[Population's effect on the other]{.underline} **two** [factors is
multiplicative. Reducing P can reduce environmental impact if the other
factors are constant]{.underline}**. In fig 1⇓, for example,** [fewer
people requiring food would manifestly reduce the startling 30% of
greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and meat production
combined]{.underline} **(including CO2 from deforestation, methane from
livestock, and nitrous oxide from fertilisers).3 That said, other
contributory factors, including the worldwide trend towards higher meat
consumption, must also be reversed. Population trends Since 1850,
substantial lowering of death rates, first through public health and
later through antibiotics, along with slow falls in birth rates, have
led to a global population of more than 7400 million people by June
2016, a sevenfold increase. The total fertility rate is the projected
mean number of children born to an average woman in her lifetime on
current demographic assumptions or, in shorthand, the "average family
size." Given world average mortality, countries achieving total
fertility rates of 2.1 have replacement fertility, yet their populations
continue to increase for roughly 60 years because of demographic
momentum (see below). Since the mid-20th century the world's mean
fertility rate has reduced from 5.2 to 2.5, and 46% of people live where
the mean family size is equal to or below parental replacement
fertility.4 In 2013 an influential film by Hans Rosling, Don't
Panic---The Facts About Population,5 suggested that the population
problem was essentially solved. However, there is some "bad news."
Firstly, fertility patterns vary by country: 45% of the world lives in
areas where total fertility rates range from 2.1 to 5, and 9% where they
exceed 5. In the 48 countries designated by the United Nations as least
developed, population is projected to triple by 2100.4 In much of
sub-Saharan Africa fertility reduction has stalled.6 7 The UN's latest
median world population projection of 11.2 billion by 2100 is predicated
on continuing reductions in fertility rate; without them, the constant
fertility variant projects to roughly 28 billion by 2100.3 A second
problem is "inexorable demographic momentum" as a result of** [the
population "bulge]{.underline}**" of young people who were born when
fertility rates were higher and are yet to start their families. That
phrase was used in** [a]{.underline} **widely publicised** [scenario
based report Human Population Reduction is not a Quick Fix for
Environmental Problems]{.underline}**.8 However, the** [scenarios have
been criticised for]{.underline} **ignoring country-to-country
variability and hence** [understating the "enormous]{.underline}
**social and economic** [benefits]{.underline} **that** [family planning
adopting nations have experienced in one generation]{.underline}
**compared with their non-adopting neighbours"---that is, the**
[benefits are not long delayed]{.underline}**.9 10 Voluntary family
planning omitted in climate change coverage As already noted, three
factors affect environmental impact,** [yet most climate change
discussions focus only on technology and consumption]{.underline}**.
Even if unremitting** [population growth]{.underline} **is recognised
(as, for example, in the Living Planet Report by the World Wide Fund for
Nature with the Global Footprint Network)11 it** [is usually treated as
a "given]{.underline}**," something to be measured and (hopefully)
adapted to,** [not as something that is sensitive to policy
intervention]{.underline}**.** [This is analogous to monitoring a bucket
that is filled from a running tap and, when it's close to overflowing,
discussing complex measures to make the only available bucket larger,
rather than turning off the tap]{.underline}**. Doctors can have an
important role in putting family planning on to the agenda (box 1).***

*[There is consensus that there is a]{.underline} **relatively** [short
window to reduce carbon emissions before drastic effects
occur]{.underline}**.** [Recent credible projections of the result of
lack of rapid drastic action is an average]{.underline} **temperature
increase of about** [10]{.underline}**o** [F by 2050. This]{.underline}
**change** [alone will be incredibly disruptive to all
life]{.underline}**, but will also cause great weather and climate
change. For comparison purposes, a 10 degree (Fahrenheit) decrease was
enough to cause an ice layer 4000 feet thick over Wisconsin (Co2gether,
2012). Recently relevant information has surfaced about a massive
previous extinction. This is the Permian extinction, which happened 252
million years ago, during which 95% of all species on earth, both
terrestrial and aquatic, vanished. The ocean temperature after almost
all life had disappeared was 15 degrees (Fahrenheit) above current ocean
temperatures. Recent information about** [the Permian
extinction]{.underline} **indicates it** [was caused by a rapid increase
in land and ocean temperatures]{.underline}**, caused by the sudden
appearance of stupendous amounts of carbon in the form of greenhouse
gases (Kolbert, 2014, pp. 102-144). The origin of the carbon in these
enormous quantities is not yet known, but one possibility is the**
[sudden release of methane gases stored in permafrost]{.underline}**.
This** [is also a possibility in our current situation. If
so,]{.underline} [extinction would be a natural side effect of human
processes]{.underline}**. There is also a real but smaller possibility
of what is called "runaway greenhouse," in which the earth's temperature
becomes like Venus' surface temperature of 800o** [The threat of
extinction]{.underline} **here** [is not entirely sudden.]{.underline}
[The threat is, if anything, worse. Changes in the
atmosphere]{.underline}**\--mainly increases in the concentration of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\--** [can start processes that can't
be reversed but which take long periods of time to
manifest]{.underline}**. "Runaway greenhouse" may be the worst. Once
again, suggestions of technological solutions to this situation should
be treated with some skepticism. These proposals are often made by
technophiles ignoring all the evidence that technology is very much
subject to unanticipated side effects and unanticipated failures. What
has happened concerning the depletion of the ozone layer should be a
clear warning against the facile uses of technology through
geoengineering to alter the makeup of the entire planet and its
atmosphere.** [The complicating factor in assessing extinction
likelihood from climate change is]{.underline} **corporations,
especially American** [fossil fuel corporations]{.underline} **such as
Exxon-Mobil and Shell. Through their contributions,** [they have been
able to delay legislation ameliorating]{.underline} **global warming
and** [climate change]{.underline}**. As mentioned before, recently
released papers from Exxon-Mobil show that the corporation did accept
the scientific findings about global warming and climate change. But
they concluded that maintaining their profits was more important than
acting to ameliorate climate change.** [Since it is not a matter of
getting corporations to appreciate scientific facts, the chances of
extinction from climate change are good. To ameliorate climate change,
it is important to leave]{.underline} **a high percentage of** [fossil
fuel reserves in the ground]{.underline}**. But this is exactly what a
profit-seeking fossil fuel corporation cannot do. One can still hope
that because fossil fuel corporations are made up of individuals,
increasingly bad consequences of global warming and climate change will
change their minds about profits. But because of the lag in effects,
this mind change will probably be too late. So I conclude** [we will
probably see something like the effects of the Permian
extinction]{.underline} **perhaps some time** [around
2050]{.underline}**. (The Permian extinction was 95% extinction of all
species.) This assumes the release of methane from the arctic will take
place around then.***

IV\. Results: Amendment Difficulty or Culture? [How well do amendment
culture and amendment institutions predict observed amendment
rates]{.underline}?43 We answer this question by estimating a series of
ordinary least squares regression models, in which the unit of analysis
is the constitutional system. Table 3 presents the results. The
dependent variable is the unweighted amendment rate in columns 1-4 and
the weighted measure of amendment rate in columns 5-9. For each measure
of the amendment rate, two models are estimated on two different
samples, for a total of four regressions. The two samples are the full
sample of countries and a smaller sample of democratic constitutions
only, following the convention adopted by Lutz and Lorenz.44 For each
dependent variable and sample, we estimate one model with covariates and
one without. Recall that the [measures of amendment difficulty are
expected to have a negative, statistically significant effect on the
measures of amendment rate]{.underline}, [and amendment culture is
expected to have a positive effect]{.underline}. \--Table 3 here\-- [The
results are intriguing and consistent with our
expectations]{.underline}. **[The best predictor of constitutional
amendment rates]{.underline}**, it turns out, **[is]{.underline}** what
we have called an **[amendment culture]{.underline}**, as [measured
by]{.underline} the **[frequency of amendment]{.underline}** in the
country's previous constitution. This is particularly true of the first
four models; in each, [amendment culture has a large
effect]{.underline}. When we use weighted amendment rate as the
dependent variable, though, amendment culture is only significantly
related to the amendment rate in democratic constitutions. Notably, the
[coefficient estimates are quite large for the amendment rate,
indicating both their **statistical and substantive
significance**.]{.underline} The [institutional variables]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} **[never statistically significant]{.underline}**,
[and often]{.underline}, they **[do not even have the sign one would
expect]{.underline}**. For instance, large vote thresholds are
positively correlated with the amendment rate, suggesting that higher
vote thresholds actually yield higher amendment rates. Similarly,
requiring votes in multiple parliamentary sessions is associated with
higher amendment rates. The only procedural variable with the correct
sign is the one indicating the number of approving actors. More
approvers decrease the amendment rate, but the magnitude of the
coefficient is not large enough to achieve statistical significance.
Some of the control variables in the model are also interesting. First,
as expected, the length of the constitution is positively correlated
with the amendment rate. Length is a significant predictor in model 3,
where the unweighted amendment measure is used. In that model there is
expected to be about 1 additional amendment every 10 years a
constitution survives for every additional 1,000 words in the
constitution. Scope is statistically significant in the same model. For
an increase from minimum to maximum scope, the expected number of
constitutional amendments is expected to decrease by 2.5 for each 10
years of a constitutions life span. The effect of judicial review is
also interesting. Surprisingly, the presence of judicial review actually
increases the amendment rate. Although the effect is only statistically
significant in model 4, the sign of the variable is consistent across
models. This suggests that de jure judicial review may not substitute
for constitutional amendments, a finding that should be explored further
in future research. From a constitutional design perspective, this
result is a bit depressing. The results suggest, quite strongly, that
constitutional designers have little influence over the observed
flexibility of their product. V. Conclusion: Whither Amendment Culture?
This article has spent a good deal of time on technical issues of
measurement, showing that existing measures of amendment difficulty are
poorly correlated and may not be valid. But even more critically, we
have suggested that a perfectly valid measure may not matter at all in
terms of constraining or facilitating amendment. Our argument is that
[institutions are not the primary determinant of amendment
rates.]{.underline} At the end of the day, it is hard to disagree with
Rasch, who summarizes the situation by noting that the "empirical
relationship between rigidity and amendment is however not very
robust."46 Instead, we argue, **[attitudes about amendments
matter]{.underline}**. Our main claim is that something we are calling
[amendment culture exists and is important.]{.underline} There have been
other efforts to tie particular constitutional amendments to cultural
concerns, even concerns about the nature of writing and change.47 But to
our knowledge no one has articulated the idea of an amendment culture at
the level of a constitutional system.

**One amendment spurs others**

In fact, [flexible]{.underline} and detailed [constitutions]{.underline}
may actually [become]{.underline} [more specific over time]{.underline}.
The [possibility of]{.underline} [frequent constitutional
updating]{.underline} may [encourage]{.underline} a **[variety of
issue-oriented groups to pursue constitutional change]{.underline}** [in
advancing]{.underline} their **[particular]{.underline}** policy
[goals]{.underline}. [As constitutions begin to respond to these groups'
demands, **other groups may follow suit**]{.underline}, [insisting on
the inclusion of new or countervailing instructions]{.underline}. Thus,
the frequent [addition of detailed instructions on a wide range of
policy choices may be a long-term mechanism]{.underline} through which
constitutions require government to abide by the will of the governed.

**One amendment spurs others- history proves that it overcomes
procedural barriers**

**Jackson 15** (Vicki, Thurgood Marshall Professor of Constitutional
Law, Harvard Law School, The (myth of un)amendability of the US
Constitution and the democratic component of constitutionalism,
International Journal of Constitutional Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, July
2015, Pages 575--605, <https://doi.org/10.1093/icon/mov050> )

[Under existing procedures, it is **not at all clear** that the US
amendment process should be regarded as]{.underline}
"**[impossible]{.underline}**" or even "close to impossible." According
to John R. Vile, a leading scholar of the US amendment process, [of the
thirty-three amendments that have been proposed by a two-thirds vote of
both Houses of Congress, only six have failed to be
enacted]{.underline}. 13 This record might be read to suggest that [the
major hurdle for amendments is the Congress]{.underline}, since [the
great majority of proposals that emerge are passed]{.underline}. [How
difficult is it to obtain agreement of two-thirds of both houses on
proposals? It is not easy]{.underline}, to be sure. [But if we consider
the other situation in which the Constitution requires action by
two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, the two-thirds of both houses
requirement does not appear to be an "impermeable" barrier.]{.underline}
To propose an amendment to the states requires two-thirds of both
houses; to override a presidential veto also requires two-thirds of both
houses. [There have been approximately 110 congressional overrides of
presidential vetoes since 1789]{.underline} (including 15 during the
highly confrontational presidency of Andrew Johnson). 14 Although this
number is under 5 percent of the total number of presidential vetoes,
even this data suggests that [it is far from impossible to obtain
agreement from the two houses by a two-thirds vote]{.underline} on
substantive issues. Moreover, more meaningful figures focus on only
those "regular" vetoes that were not "pocket vetoes" (which do not go
back to Congress for possible override), 15 and on public (rather than
private) bills. 16 Focusing on these categories of presidential vetoes
of legislation likely to be of consequence and capable of being
overridden by Congress, one finds that a significantly higher percentage
have been overridden. For example, a 2013 study finds that looking only
at "regular vetoes" since 1961, thirty-seven out of 233 vetoes were
overridden---for a rate of 15.9 percent. 17 If two-thirds of both Houses
of Congress can join together to override Presidential vetoes at these
rates, then perhaps the requirement that two-thirds of each House join
in proposing amendments may not, by itself, be quite so large an
obstacle to proposing amendments as might be thought; and as noted,
[most amendments proposed by Congress have been ratified by the
states.]{.underline} On the other hand, there are differences between
veto overrides and proposals for amendment relating to ease of
formulation, 18 and prior congressional investment, 19 that may make it
more difficult for Congress to propose amendments than to override
vetoes. The most recent proposal for an amendment from Congress---the
Equal Rights Amendment proposed in 1972---failed to be ratified;
although garnering ratifications in 35 states, it fell three states
short of the 38 needed, illustrating that the requirement of
ratification by three-fourths of the states poses an additional and real
obstacle. Moreover, the first 12 amendments occurred very early in US
history---by 1804. [There may]{.underline}, then, [be political
phenomena that exist now, that did not exist before, that make amendment
particularly difficult]{.underline}. 20 Indeed, to the extent that an
amendment becomes a highly partisan issue, under conditions of
relatively even partisan divide, the amending formula will pose a very
substantial obstacle. 21 Whether in the long run that is a good or bad
effect is debatable; slowing down amendment in times of intense partisan
divides is not necessarily a bad thing. 22 Overriding presidential
vetoes also appears to have varied in rate over time; the first override
of a presidential veto was not until 1845 (Tyler's administration), and
the pace of overrides has varied with the political makeup of the
Congress and the President (with thirty overrides, for example, from the
beginning of President Nixon's term until the end of President
Reagan's). 23 [A different way of looking at things is to introduce the
possibility of variation in **amendment pace** over different time
periods]{.underline}. 24 [The United States has had several long periods
without amendments]{.underline}: from 1804 to 1865; from 1870 to 1913;
and from 1971 to the present (with the bizarre exception of the 27th
Amendment). 25 Between 1865 and 1870, there were three important
amendments in the wake of the Civil War; and between 1913 and 1971 there
were eleven amendments. [We may not]{.underline}, then, [know the extent
to which the Article V process is "dead," or simply
**quiescent**]{.underline}, [as it has been in the past]{.underline}.
There is at least a possibility that **[enacting amendments makes
enacting other amendments]{.underline}** somewhat **[more
likely]{.underline}**---and conversely, that [disuse of the amending
procedures]{.underline} may [increase the political or cultural
resistance to their use]{.underline}. 26

**Reaction to Citizens United proves amendments aren't happening now
because they're seen as impossible- the aff reverses that and
revitalizes them as a means of change**

**Jackson 15** (Vicki, Thurgood Marshall Professor of Constitutional
Law, Harvard Law School, The (myth of un)amendability of the US
Constitution and the democratic component of constitutionalism,
International Journal of Constitutional Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, July
2015, Pages 575--605, <https://doi.org/10.1093/icon/mov050> )

2.3. [Predictions of failure]{.underline} and normative objections may
both [contribute to disuse of amendment]{.underline} [What may increase
the difficulty of formal amendment in the United States is
a]{.underline} seemingly [widespread view that constitutional change
**cannot , as a practical matter, be sought through
amendment**]{.underline}, and that as a normative matter amendments
should not be the vehicle for legal change (but rather changes in
judicial interpretation should be sought). [Taking account of these
aspects of political culture in assessing the effects of the different
amendment procedures is consistent with some recent studies indicating
that the **formal rigidity of amending formula has**, at best, **limited
value in predicting rates of amendment**]{.underline}. 37 Although I
cannot offer conclusive proof in this paper that empirical [beliefs in
impossibility]{.underline} and normative attitudes of constitutional
veneration contribute to disuse of the Article V amendment process, the
suggestion that they [may be **causal factors**]{.underline} is
[consistent with emerging work on the significance of culture as a
factor influencing amendment rates.]{.underline} 38 On the first of
these---overstatements of the difficulty of using the amendment
process---as already noted, Levinson entitled a chapter in his book,
"The Impermeable Article V," and refers to Article V as making it
"practically impossible" to enact constitutional change. 39 He is by no
means alone in doing so. Professor William Eskridge describes the
failure of the Equal Rights Amendment as having apparently been the
"death" of the Article V amendment process. 40 Joel Colón-Ríos describes
Article V as "creat\[ing\] almost insuperable constraints on
constitutional change." 41 These statements are widely echoed in the
scholarly literature. [Predictions of impossibility]{.underline} often
combine with asserted reverence for the Constitution, related normative
resistance to proposing changes in its text, and, sometimes, fears that
any resort to the amendment process will invite populist movements to
amend in undesirable ways; these all may [cause hesitation to resort to
the amendment process even when it would seem a logical
response]{.underline}. [Consider]{.underline} the [reactions from groups
that disagreed with]{.underline} the Court's decision in [Citizens
United]{.underline} v. Federal Election Comm'n . 42 Public opinion polls
after the decision indicated that public sentiment, among both
Republican and Democratic voters, was running strongly against the
decision. 43 [One might have thought this was an opportune moment to go
the people, through the amendment process]{.underline}, to obtain
constitutional authorization for regulation of campaign expenditures and
contributions. [Yet]{.underline} some combination of reasons---which may
include concerns for overriding the Supreme Court through amendment,
reluctance to amend in any way the First Amendment, as well as a [belief
in the futility of the amendment process]{.underline}, and support for
the decision by influential minorities---[prevented any groundswell of
support for a responsive amendment]{.underline} in the first years after
the decision came down. Yet an immediate response through constitutional
amendment (as occurred, for example, after Oregon v. Mitchell ) had some
compelling reasons behind it, including the benefits of acting before
spending and fundraising patterns adjusted to the new regime under
Citizens United and expectations by politicians and corporations became
entrenched. 44 A leading public interest group that opposed the Citizens
United decision was the Brennan Center for Justice at New York
University School of Law. The Brennan Center devoted considerable effort
to developing strategies for responding to the decision, including
hosting conferences and preparation of research/policy papers. The
nature of the organization's early response is illustrated by a paper,
Renewing Democracy After Citizens United, which proposed three
strategies toward renewing democracy: enacting legislation for small
donor public financing; increasing voter registration; and developing
new jurisprudence, that is, new doctrinal arguments to persuade future
courts of a different view. 45 In 2011, the Brennan Center held a
conference, Accountability After Citizens United , also on responses to
Citizens United , that focused on statutory approaches through
securities and corporate law; activating administrative agencies, like
the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Federal Communications Commission
(FCC), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS); and, again, developing new
jurisprudence around the issue. 46 The Brennan Center's failure in those
responses to devote any attention to the possibility of an amendment as
a form of "democratic renewal," or "accountability," speaks volumes
about its belief in the possibility, and/or desirability, of amendment.
Similarly, an issue analysis prepared for another public interest group,
the American Constitution Society (ACS), soon after the Citizens United
decision, addressed several issues. 47 They included the need to have
better factual records for "strict scrutiny" review to support the
claimed need for regulation; increasing disclosure requirements;
addressing disclosures and expenditure issues through corporate law and
requirements of shareholder approval; moving towards public funding of
campaigns; modernizing voter registration; and appointing as Supreme
Court justices those with a "voter-centric" view of the First Amendment.
48 Despite its thoughtfulness and seemingly comprehensive overview of
possible responses (including the constitutional politics of
appointments to the Court), this memo for ACS did not mention the
possibility of constitutional amendment. 49 To be sure, [some critics of
Citizens United]{.underline} have [tried]{.underline}, and with some
success, [to promote a constitutional amendment]{.underline} in
response. At least fourteen proposals were introduced in Congress within
two years of the decision; these range from amendments sweeping broadly
to say that corporations do not hold rights under the Constitution, to
those authorizing legislatures to regulate corporate, or all, campaign
contributions and expenditures, to those excluding campaign expenditures
from First Amendment protections, to those establishing a substantive
rule, for example, banning corporate contributions or expenditures. 50
An organization called "Move to Amend" seeks petition signatures for a
proposed amendment to "our Constitution to firmly establish that money
is not speech, and that human beings, not corporations, are persons
entitled to constitutional rights"; they reportedly had about 300,000
signatures in mid-2013. 51 Another organization, "Free Speech for
People," supports amendments to "(1) enable Congress and the states to
limit campaign spending and (2) to make it clear that corporations do
not have constitutional rights;" in 2013 it claimed to be "one-third" of
the way to succeeding with a constitutional amendment. 52 In 2014, the
"Democracy for All" amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 19, 113th
Congress, did not receive the necessary two-thirds vote, notwithstanding
majority support in the Senate. 53 Some well-established public interest
groups, including People for the American Way, 54 and Public Citizen, 55
have supported amendment as an approach, as have some legal scholars. 56
[But]{.underline} other [influential]{.underline} non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and political [actors]{.underline} who disagreed
with the decision in Citizens United nonetheless **[ruled out seeking an
amendment]{.underline}**, either [because they believed it
is]{.underline} so **[unlikely to succeed]{.underline}** and/or because
they believe other approaches have normative advantages. It is possible
that those groups that did not include amendment as a possible response
to Citizens United did so because they believed a constitutional
amendment is a bad idea for reasons other than its unlikelihood of
enactment. 57 They might believe that an amendment would be too hard to
craft to achieve its goals in the hands of an uncertain Supreme Court;
or that entrenching provisions relating to the subject is a bad idea for
democratic politics; or even that "progressives" who oppose Citizens
United should not seek amendment lest it encourage "conservatives" to
seek amendments that progressives disagree with. 58 But a significant
part of the opposition to amendment---among those who would like to
overturn the effects of Citizens United ---has to do with a belief that
it would be impossible. For example, Mark Schmitt, Senior Fellow of the
Roosevelt Institute, advanced a series of arguments, which appear mostly
bottomed on the unlikelihood of an amendment passing. 59 In one debate
with proponents of amendment, he stated that proceeding with an
amendment would imply to those working on other approaches that "we
can't do anything until we have a constitutional amendment," and argued
that "under the current circumstances, 'We can't do anything until we
have a constitutional amendment' is exactly the same as saying, 'We
can't do anything.'" 60 Later remarks made clear he was not
substantively opposed to amendment insofar as it related to campaign
finances, and that he agreed that Citizens United was wrongly decided,
61 though he also raised questions about the capacity to draft an
adequate amendment. 62 Thus [evidence suggests that opposition to
amendment is based in part on **concerns that it would be
impossible**]{.underline} and in part on normative worries about
amendment as opposed to other mechanisms of change.

**[Audience Member]{.underline}**: I think it\'s safe to say, or at
least a consensus or a soft majority of the academic community would
agree, that the Constitution should be amended in certain places. But
the problem with that being that you need a pretty strong majority to
accomplish that. I\'m going to harken back to something Professor
Levinson hit on. [In this country where the Constitution is viewed as
this absolute, almost biblical, document in its original sense, [is
there a way to repackage the republican view that it is important to
amend the Constitution]{.mark}]{.underline} but alternatively that maybe
the Constitution has served as sort of a baseline**[?]{.underline}**

**[Kay]{.underline}**: I can\'t say that it\'s impossible. **[[Nothing
lasts forever]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This [Constitution has lasted a
long time and [things in this country are really different now]{.mark}.
Different in a way that I\'ve never experienced in my unfortunately very
long life. [So, yes, it\'s possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. I think what
you need is a crisis though that\'s kind of a tough thing to wish for.
But, we may not see it. I won\'t see it.

Lisa Miller: Thank you very much, Richard. That was really interesting.
I was intrigued by your comment about the amendments that were passed in
the 19-teens at a moment you know when it looked like they weren\'t
going to happen again. And it put me in mind me of a quote that I think
is attributed to Winston Churchill, \"That the Americans always do the
right thing, but only after they\'ve tried everything else first.\" And
I think it\'s true that there have been moments where just enough people
have said we\'ve had it. Right, we\'re just going to think about the
Twenty-Fourth Amendment, the poll tax, let\'s just be done with this.
That\'s somewhat encouraging to me. I\'m wondering if you have any
thoughts on what issue or, issues or features of the Constitution might
be, you know, close to in the next decade or so bubbling up.

**[Kay]{.underline}**: [[There have been]{.mark} these
[periods]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[the progressive era in the 19-teens is
not the only time it\'s happened]{.underline}]{.mark}. My colleagues
will know better than I do. [[In the \'60s, there were a whole bunch of
amendments too]{.underline}]{.mark}, mainly about representation and
voting. [So,]{.underline} [**[once you get one amendment through, and
the world doesn\'t fall apart, then maybe there\'s room for
another]{.mark}** one if they are modest]{.underline}.

**Just like "horse-trading" could be the link to an agenda politics DA-
it could also work for amendments**

In addition to constitutional failure, these ideas cast light on an
important question of constitutional evolution: When to amend and when
to convene? Article V authorizes two methods for changing the text of
the Constitution: amendments and conventions.146 Other constitutions
offer the same basic choice.147 Amendments are more likely to fit the
spatial models, which assume decisions happen on one issue at a time.
Thus, changing law through amendment will more likely produce the
incrementalism and instability described above.
[[Conventions]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, often [[involve
bargaining across **multiple issues**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Such
bargaining can generate meaningful change]{.underline}. Returning to
Figure 5, [[voter]{.underline}]{.mark} l will not, without more, approve
replacing SQ with a law at m. She [might]{.underline}, however,
[[support]{.underline}]{.mark} such a [[change if she gets a change on
another issue]{.mark} in ex change]{.underline}. Suppose the dimension
in Figure 5 reflects rights for religious minorities, and another
unpictured dimension reflects the right to educa tion. [Voter l opposes
moving rights for religious minorities further from her ideal
point---which going from SQ to m would do---but she would nevertheless
support it as part of a deal that simultaneously moves the right to
education closer to her ideal point.]{.underline} Thus, [bargaining can
produce large change even when law is entrenched and the incrementalism
and pace principles operate]{.underline}. In short, the solution to the
constitutional predicament described above is a convention. [Voters or
their representatives must **bargain across issues, not vote
individually on each one**]{.underline}. Returning to the case of
France, after the constitution collapsed in 1958, General de Gaulle\'s
government drafted a new one. [Voters cast one vote on the **complete
package**]{.underline}; [they did not vote on each
provision]{.underline}. According to a key parliamentarian, the new
constitution \"embodied\] the reforms envisaged earlier,\" meaning the
amendments considered but rejected during the Fourth Republic.148

*SRH services = sexual and reproductive health *

Yet, in most low-income countries, family planning is donor-dependent
and heavily subsidized by users themselves. However, donor funding is
insufficient and stagnant. At the same time, [**many low-income
countries are graduating to middle-income status and losing eligibility
for donor funds. As a result, public financing is necessary to ensure**
sustainability of sexual **and reproductive health and
rights**]{.underline} (SRHR) investments.  [In response,
many]{.underline} sexual and reproductive health [advocates have focused
on domestic resource mobilization]{.underline} (DRM) from the
perspective of creating budget lines and tracking associated allocations
and expenditures at the national and subnational levels. Fewer, however,
have been engaged in DRM with respect to health financing strategies
under the umbrella of achieving universal health coverage (UHC). Yet,
not only are the principles behind these strategies consistent with the
achievement of sexual and reproductive health and rights; they perhaps
represent the next best opportunity to shore up funding for sexual and
reproductive health in the current funding and political environment. 
[A large part of UHC will involve establishing or reforming countries'
insurance schemes]{.underline}. These [discussions will dictate whether
insurance systems are pro-poor, include SRH services in benefits
packages, or pay for certain or all portions of services]{.underline}.
To ensure financial sustainability and equitable access, insurance
schemes and respective packages of services must include SRH information
and services including family planning, safe abortion and post-abortion
care, pregnancy-related services and STI prevention and treatment---and
[**now is the time to advocate** for **their inclusion**. This
environment represents an opportunity for SRHR priorities that champions
of SRH cannot afford to miss]{.underline}.  The Opportunity **[Universal
health coverage is gaining momentum at the global and national
levels]{.underline}** as one of the key health Sustainable Development
Goals. [Many **countries are**]{.underline} therefore **[embarking on
large-scale policy reforms and restructuring their health system
priorities and national health financing strategies to achieve universal
health coverage]{.underline}** by, or near, the 2030 SDG target date.
They are either proposing major reforms to the existing health insurance
schemes or creating them for the first time with the specific goal of
using them as a mechanism to achieve UHC. **[Benefits packages may or
may not include family planning]{.underline}** and SRH services. Though
the timeframe is 2030 achievement, these reforms take time to construct,
implement, and yield results. That means **[governments are defining the
structure of insurance systems and benefits packages that will implicate

now]{.underline}**.

***The capacity of people to access and realise their sexual and
reproductive health and rights (SRHR) has long been influenced by the
shifting tides of politics and the various configurations of political
power that hold sway in specific times and specific places. As the
articles in this issue make clear, pronounced [shifts towards
far]{.underline}** [right-wing **and** conservative politics **are
threatening hard-won progress in SRHR \[sexual and reproductive health
and rights\]**]{.underline}**. This is happening** [globally**,
regionally, nationally and locally, affecting progress in many areas,
such as access to safe abortion, access to contraception, the protection
of the sexual and reproductive rights of migrants and refugees including
those in humanitarian settings, and the advancement of the rights of
LGBTI+ individuals**]{.underline}**. Taken together, the articles paint
a compelling picture of how governments, political leaders, activists,
non-governmental organisations (NGOs), lawyers, and others are all
engaging in the politics of SRHR, with profound impacts, both positive
and negative, on the everyday lived realities of people around the
world. As these articles illustrate, [the impacts of politics on SRHR
are often the greatest for the most vulnerable or marginalised
populations]{.underline}, who themselves may have limited opportunity to
influence political outcomes on their own behalf. The embodied
consequences of SRHR politics [Political decisions have embodied
consequences]{.underline}. [Decisions made in the corridors of power in
one part of the world can]{.underline}** [reverberate across the
globe**, with very real implications for the lives and health of
individuals in other parts of the world**]{.underline}**. It is the
bodies and lives of women and girls that are most often impacted by
domestic and international political decisions related to SRHR. For
example, in the 2017 reinstatement and expansion of the Mexico City
Policy, or Global Gag Rule, [under US President Trump, we are witness to
the devastating international impacts of a political decision
taken]{.underline}** [in the US]{.underline} **to prohibit any foreign
NGO that receives US global health funds from engaging in "certain
abortion-related activities, including providing abortion services,
information, counselling and referrals, and advocating to expand access
to safe abortion services."1 Against public health evidence, [such
politics and politically-driven decisions restrict the life choices and
undermine the fundamental human rights of some of the]{.underline}**
[most marginalised people in the world**. For many
women**]{.underline}**, such as those forced in the circumstances to
seek unsafe abortions, [they are]{.underline} also [a]{.underline}**
[matter of life and death]{.underline}**.***

***America has a history of promoting comprehensive reproductive
healthcare around the world, so why are American women still fighting
for birth control? Yesterday, the Supreme Court of the United States
(SCOTUS) ruled 5-4 that \"closely held corporations cannot be required
to provide contraception coverage for their employees.\" In the case of
Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court voted that privately owned
for-profit corporations, like Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Woods, can
refuse to cover birth control in their company\'s insurance plans
because of religious beliefs. Despite the anti-contraception movement in
the US being separate from the anti-abortion movement, the Hobby Lobby
ruling relates to both because it demonstrates how women\'s health and
rights are continuously compromised in the US. Just last week, the
Supreme Court voted against a law allowing abortion clinics to have a
buffer zones. Yesterday the highest court in America told women that our
bodies do not belong to us. But** [this ruling is not just about
American women. It has implications for women around the
world]{.underline} **mainly** [because policies made in Washington
impact the health and rights of women around the world]{.underline}**.**
[The US is one of the largest donors]{.underline} **of global health
programs,** [and]{.underline} **often** [what it promotes at home it
advocates for abroad as well]{.underline}**, as we saw with abstinence
only sex education that skyrocketed during the Bush-era in domestic and
overseas programs. It is also not uncommon for the US to implement
policies that would be ruled unconstitutional in the US in its foreign
aid programs, one of the best examples being the Global Gag Rule, a
deeply partisan policy (Republican Presidents traditionally implement
it, while Democratic Presidents repeal it) which prohibits overseas
non-profits that receive US funding from doing any kind of abortion
related work. Feminist writer, Soraya Chemaly states that** [the
court\'s decision]{.underline} **on Hobby Lobby** [proves]{.underline}
**that** [patriarchy is alive and well in one of the most powerful
democracies in the world]{.underline}**:** [\...The Court's decision
displays the profound depth of patriarchal norms that deny women
autonomy and the right to control our own
reproduction]{.underline}**---norms that privilege people's "religious
consciences" over women's choices about our own bodies, the welfare of
our families, our financial security and our equal right to freedom from
the imposition of our employers' religious beliefs\...SCOTUS' decision
is shameful for its segregation of women's health issues and its denial
that what should be valued as "closely held" in our society is a woman's
right to make her own reproductive decisions.** [If women\'s health and
rights are being rolled back in America, it is just a matter of time
before the ripple effects are felt around the world]{.underline}**.
Worse,** [rulings like this could make its way into programs the US
implements abroad]{.underline}**. In a nutshell,** [bad news for
American women is bad news for all women]{.underline}**. ** [How can the
US be considered a beacon for democracy]{.underline}**, or even pretend
to be,** [when women are still fighting for contraceptives]{.underline}
**in 2014? What is the difference between the five men who voted in
favor of denying women contraception coverage, and the mullahs in the
villages of Bangladesh who refuse women the same right? ***
