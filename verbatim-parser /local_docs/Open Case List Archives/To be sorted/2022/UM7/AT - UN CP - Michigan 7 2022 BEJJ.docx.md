Despite the laudable, if somewhat unexpected, success of the OEWG and
the GGE, a [number of **substantive** and procedural issues remain
unresolved.]{.underline} First, the [path towards greater discussion,
much]{.underline} **[less agreement]{.underline}**, on [how
international law applies to cyberspace is unclear]{.underline}.
Although the compendium of national views on the application of
international law called for in the GGE is helpful, given the political
sensitivities of this topic, further progress in the UN setting is
unlikely in the near term. That is unfortunate as greater understanding
and agreement on the application of international law can be beneficial
to both restraining disruptive state conduct and accountability for
transgressors. As more countries articulate their own views, however,
there may be some room for discussion, if not agreement, in the UN in
the future. Second, although the [two reports help further articulate
cyber norms or rules of the road, there is **little if any discussion**
in either **report on accountability**]{.underline}. [Rules of the road
and even international law are **little more than words on paper** if
there is no way to hold violators accountable]{.underline} [or dissuade
them from engaging in such conduct in the future]{.underline}. The
increase in cyberthreats over the last several years, including the
penchant of some [states to continue to turn a blind eye to malicious
conduct emanating from their territory, is a testament that rules and
other pronouncements are **not enough** in the absence of reasonable
consequences]{.underline}. Like international law, however, the iss[ue
of accountability is a **politically charged** one and there are
**unlikely to be major developments** in the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations. Although there is good language in the
reports on the peaceful settlement of disputes and the use of UN
mechanisms, these [mechanisms may have **limited effect** when the
aggressor and/or victim state are members of the Security Council and
can veto any action]{.underline}. Third, although the focus on cyber
capacity building in both reports is welcome, as is the exhortation that
states and other stakeholders should support these efforts, [**cyber
capacity building** remains **under resourced** and under
**prioritised**.]{.underline} [Cyberstability is not just the province
of a few developed countries but requires the participation of countries
and other stakeholders around the globe]{.underline}. Capacity building
is the key to this greater participation. Here, the UN can do more and
go beyond the language of the two reports -- including expressly stating
at a high level that cyber capacity building is foundational to
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and leveraging existing
multistakeholder platforms outside the UN, such as the Global Forum on
Cyber Expertise whose mission is to promote and help coordinate cyber
capacity building efforts.

### No Solvency -- Spoilers

#### China and Russia undermines UN legitimacy -- Noko proves

sanctions on North Korea for first time since 2006\"; CNN; Accessed:

[Russia and China on Thursday vetoed a US-drafted United Nations
Security Council resolution to strengthen sanctions on North
Korea]{.underline} in a vote the US ambassador to the UN called
**[dangerous, disappointing]{.underline}** [and likely to fuel
Pyongyang\'s program to develop nuclear-capable missile
systems.]{.underline} The move comes after **[more than a
dozen]{.underline}** [North Korean ballistic missile tests this year,
all of which violated previous UN resolutions]{.underline} and which US
officials argued necessitated another international response. [A
resolution needs nine \"yes\" votes and **no vetoes** by the permanent
members of Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom or the United
States to be adopted by the UN]{.underline} Security Council. The 13
other members of the Security Council voted to adopt the resolution. US
Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield blasted the vetoes from
Russia and China, which hadn\'t blocked any of the nine previous
sanction votes made since 2006, saying the gravity of the threat from
North Korea\'s weapons program has not changed. \"For the first time in
15 years, a [UN Security Council member has used a **veto to stop the
council** from fulfilling its responsibility to hold the DPRK (North
Korea) accountable for its unlawful proliferation]{.underline},\" the US
envoy said in a statement made on behalf of the US, Japan and South
Korea. \"The vetoes today are dangerous. Those [members today have taken
a stance that not only undermines the Security Council\'s previous
action to which they have committed but also **undermines our collective
security.\"**]{.underline} Speaking in a session at UN headquarters,
Thomas-Greenfield added: \"These [council members have decided to
**shield a proliferator** from facing the consequences of its actions
and they have **demonstrated the worthlessness** of their word by giving
an explicit nod of approval to the DPRK.\"]{.underline} North Korea has
tested missiles on at least 16 occasions this year, the latest on
Wednesday, when it fired three missiles. [At least one of North Korea\'s
tests this year was believed to be of an **intercontinental ballistic
missile** that **could hit the US mainland.**]{.underline} China\'s
ambassador to the UN argued new sanctions on North Korea would not stop
its weapons program and may instead increase its level of testing. New
sanctions could also put further pressure on the humanitarian situation
in North Korea as it grapples with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic,
Ambassador Zhang Jun said. Russia\'s envoy also cited the Covid
situation in North Korea as a reason for its veto. \"The strengthening
of the sanctions pressure on Pyongyang is not only useless but it\'s
extremely dangerous from the humanitarian consequences of such
measures,\" Russian Ambassador to the UN Vasily Alekseevich Nebenzya
said in translated comments after the vote. Nebenzya said the past 15
years of sanctions pressure on North Korea had not worked. \"Starting in
2006, many restrictive resolutions were adopted against Pyongyang,
however as history has shown us, the paradigm of sanctions has still not
been able to guarantee security in the region or resolve issues of
missile and nuclear non-proliferation,\" the Russian envoy said. Leading
up to the vote, [both China and Russia had urged Washington to issue a
presidential statement instead of introducing the draft Security Council
resolution]{.underline}. But Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador, said
[**China and Russia** were **not even open to discussion** of new
sanctions on Pyongyang]{.underline}. \"We have been [circulating a draft
of this resolution for nine weeks.]{.underline} In that time, the
[**countries vetoing** this resolution have **refused to engage** on the
text, despite our commitment to inclusivity and flexibility]{.underline}
during consultations,\" she said.

#### Chinese division with Taiwan divides up member states

WELLINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - The [foreign minister of **Tuvalu pulled
out** of the United Nations Ocean Conference opening in Portugal on
Monday after China blocked the participation of three
Taiwanese]{.underline} included in the tiny Pacific island nation\'s
delegation list, according to Radio New Zealand. [Taiwan, which China
claims as its own territory, is not a member of the United
Nations]{.underline} and its citizens are unable to attend U.N. events
as representatives of Taiwan. [Tuvalu Foreign Minister Simon Kofe
withdrew from the conference after China challenged the accreditation of
three Taiwanese delegates included in Tuvalu\'s delegation]{.underline},
Radio New Zealand reported on Monday. The nation of 12,000 people has
had diplomatic ties with Taiwan since 1979, and is one of 14 countries
that continues to have diplomatic relations with Taiwan rather than
China. Taiwan is largely excluded from international organisations that
have China as a member. [Taiwan\'s Foreign Ministry thanked Tuvalu for
its support, and expressed condemnation of China.]{.underline}
\"[**China\'s arbitrary pressure** on (U.N.) member states has only once
again revealed its nasty nature]{.underline},\" the ministry said.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian reiterated Beijing\'s
stance that Taiwan is part of China.

### No NB -- Credibility

#### UN credibility is tanked -- Russia vetos all effective action

On Feb. 24, after years of tension and months of anxiety, Russia
launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. With social [media users
sharing an almost blow-by-blow account of the conflict online, the world
has looked on in horror as Ukrainian forces defend their
democracy]{.underline}. The crisis has [plunged]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[N]{.underline}**ations **[into
chaos]{.underline}**. Although the [U.N. Security Council convened
immediately after the invasion, **Russia used its veto power** to block
a draft resolution that would have deplored the invasion as a violation
of international law "in the strongest terms."]{.underline} The Security
Council then called an emergency special session of the General
Assembly---the first in 40 years---to discuss another resolution
condemning Russia. But here, too, [reaching any kind of agreement is
likely to be a **cumbersome and sluggish** process]{.underline}. And
this, of course, is simply the most recent example of how the "scourge
of war" continues to plague the world. With [conflicts also raging in
Yemen, Ethiopia and Afghanistan---to name just a few---the United
Nations is **clearly falling short** of the high expectations set by its
founders]{.underline}. With the [U.N. seemingly **ill-suited** to both
prevent and resolve conflict]{.underline}, it is no wonder that so [many
people around the world today feel that the organization is **irrelevant
and outdated**]{.underline}. For instance, more than half of the young
[people surveyed by the U.N. in 2020 said they see it "as **remote from
their lives** and don't know much about it."]{.underline} Adding to this
sense of failure, this week saw the release of the second chapter of the
[International Panel on Climate Change's sweeping climate
assessment]{.underline}, which focuses on "Impacts, Adaptation, and
Vulnerability." [U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was quick to
summarize the report as "an atlas of human suffering" and a "**damning
indictment of failed leadership**"]{.underline}---a criticism that
encompasses the very organization over which he presides.
