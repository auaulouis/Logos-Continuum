### Russia War Good\-\--1NC

#### We'd respond to Russian attacks against the US or allies with a devastating counterforce that crushes them

**Lonsdale 19** \[David Lonsdale is the Director of the Centre for
Security Studies at the University of Hull, UK, "The 2018 Nuclear
Posture Review: A return to nuclear warfighting?," *Comparative
Strategy* 28:2, pub. online, May 17, 2019\]

The important question is: [what objectives would the U.S. pursue within
a nuclear conflict]{.underline}, and how would they be achieved? It
appears [that **the primary objectives sought would be damage
limitation**]{.underline} (an important component of warfighting) and
the reestablishment of deterrence. This fits with the preliminary
qualifying statement to this section of the review, in which it is
stated that the U.S. would use nuclear weapons in compliance with the
law of armed conflict.86 Indeed, [[the NPR]{.mark}]{.underline} is at
pains to note that nuclear forces would only be used for defensive
purposes. One assumes that this [rules out counter-value targeting
(deliberate attacks against enemy population centers). **This [leaves
counterforce]{.mark} operations [as the only option. Strikes
against]{.mark}** enemy [nuclear]{.mark} forces and their **[command and
control, in conjunction with]{.mark}** active ballistic missile defenses
([**BMD**), would]{.mark} help [ensure damage limitation]{.mark} for the
U.S. and its allies]{.underline}.[87 A focus on counterforce options is
reminiscent of later Cold War strategy]{.underline}, when the U.S.
increasingly procured weapon systems with increased accuracy and
penetrative capability designed for warfighting. Indeed, [Lieber and
Press argue that **[increases in accuracy]{.mark} and remote sensing
[have enhanced the potency]{.mark}** [of counterforce]{.mark} **options,
[to the point that low-casualty]{.mark} counterforce [options are
possible for the first time]{.mark}**]{.underline}.88 One can reasonably
assume, although it is not explicitly noted in the review, that the
restoration of deterrence would be achieved through a combination of
intra-war deterrence by denial (as noted above in relation to
counter-escalation strategies) and punishment for coercive purposes.
Inclusion of the latter is premised on references to "unacceptable
consequences" resulting from nuclear attack elsewhere in the NPR. 89
However, in the face of no counter-value targeting, it is reasonable to
question how these costs would be inflicted. There are three possible
answers, although none of them is discussed in the NPR. First, it may be
that the enemy values highly their nuclear forces; so that the loss of
them would inflict unacceptable costs. Alternatively, there may be an
unwritten assumption that counterforce strikes would inevitably produce
"bonus" counter-value damage. Much of the nuclear force infrastructure
(including command and control, airbases, etc.) is within or near
population centers. Thus, even a limited counterforce strike is likely
to have a significant detrimental effect on counter-value targets. This
assumption, however, is somewhat thrown into question by [the stated
desire to procure accurate limited-yield weapons and to operate within
the norms of the war convention. Low-yield accurate weapons would be
ideal for counterforce missions and would minimize damage to
counter-value target sets]{.underline}. [Thus, **bonus damage** is
likely to be limited]{.underline}. Finally, although again not
explicitly noted in the NPR, perhaps [there is a return to the notion of
attacking targets associated with political control]{.underline}. Yet
again, though, concerns over collateral damage would likely restrict a
campaign aimed at the means of political control. We are, thus, left
with many questions concerning how the coercive effects of nuclear
weapons would be administered. This is problematic, for as Thomas C.
Schelling eloquently noted, "The power to hurt can be counted among the
most impressive attributes of military force." 90 It has to be concluded
that the uncertainties in this area of strategy reflect either a paradox
or incomplete strategic thinking in the NPR. Clarity on these matters
would be welcome, especially as it would enhance deterrence credibility
still further. Although countervailing is back on the agenda in the 2018
NPR, there is no mention of prevailing in a nuclear conflict. Indeed,
the review quotes Defense Secretary Mattis, echoing the early thoughts
of Brodie, that nuclear war can never be won, and thus must never be
fought.91 This is both curious and disappointing from a warfighting
perspective, and speaks to the need for the further development of
strategic thinking in U.S. nuclear strategy under Trump. Damage
limitation and the reestablishment of deterrence are perfectly admirable
goals within the context of nuclear conflict. However, if the U.S. is to
achieve its objectives in a post-deterrence environment, it must have a
comprehensive theory of victory. Damage limitation and the
reestablishment of deterrence are limited negative objectives. They do
not provide a positive driving force for the use of nuclear weapons. To
reiterate, victory refers to a policy objective that must be achieved in
the face of the enemy. And, as Clausewitz reminds us, [[**the** **will
of the enemy must be broken by destroying**]{.mark}]{.underline} his
[[**ability to resist**, or putting]{.mark}]{.underline} him
[[in]{.mark} such [a position as]{.mark}]{.underline} his [[defeat is
inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}.92 [If we consider the conditions under
which U.S. [nuclear weapons could be used, as stipulated by the]{.mark}
2018 [NPR,]{.mark} then we can assume that [an enemy power]{.mark}
([likely]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, China,
North Korea, or a state-sponsored terror group) [has [launched a
substantial attack on]{.mark} either [the U.S. or one of its
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [We can think in terms of a Russian
assault on the Baltic States,]{.underline}]{.mark} [a North Korean
attack on South Korea,]{.underline} or perhaps a Chinese invasion of
Taiwan. Alternatively, the U.S. may have been subjected to a substantial
strategic attack, involving either weapons of mass destruction
(including biological or chemical) or a crippling cyberattack. In any of
these scenarios, more expansive objectives would be required. As Lieber
and Press note, "In some cases, wars may be triggered by events that
compel U.S. leaders to pursue decisive victory, conquest, and/or regime
change." 93 Thus, in order to achieve its objectives, the U.S. would
variously need to: punish an aggressor to reinstate deterrence; defeat
enemy forces for damage limitation or to reclaim lost territory; and, in
the North Korean case, presumably overthrow a communist regime. In some
of these cases, damage limitation and the reestablishment of deterrence
would not be enough. Enemy forces would have to be defeated, removed,
destroyed, or coerced (to withdraw from allied territory). Any
operations in pursuit of these goals would need a theory of victory
built on a detailed understanding of the use of nuclear weapons in the
service of military objectives; i.e., nuclear warfighting. This could
include defeating enemy nuclear forces for force protection of U.S. and
allied conventional forces. Alternatively, U.S. nuclear forces may be
required to defeat regionally superior enemy conventional forces. And
yet, as previously noted, the NPR rules out a return to nuclear
warfighting. This is a significant disjuncture in U.S. nuclear strategy.
It is even more curious when one considers [the range of modern forces
the Trump administration seeks to acquire under the 2018
NPR.]{.underline}

#### We could initiate a strike in 22 minutes \-\-- that would force a surrender

**Johnson 17** \[Sarah Johnson, Writer for BillTrack50, citing Jeffrey
Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program for the James
Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute
of International Studies at Monterey, April 27, 2017, "U.S. Nuclear
First Strike Policy; Be Afraid,"
<https://www.billtrack50.com/blog/in-the-news/u-s-nuclear-first-strike-policy-be-afraid>\]

For example, if Russia launched a nuclear weapon, the US has the 30
minute flight time of the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to
assess their desire to "launch under attack". [The [many different steps
in the notification process take]{.mark} up [about
22]{.mark}]{.underline} of the 30 [[minutes]{.mark}; like the time it
takes for the missiles to break through clouds, detection of the launch,
transmitting different messages, informing the president and
authenticating orders to launch.]{.underline} All of this effectively
gives the president eight minutes to decide to whether or not to blow up
the world. The second situation is a preemptive strike --- a
[first-strike attack with nuclear weapons carried out to destroy an
enemy's capacity to respond.]{.underline} Preemptive strikes can be
based on the assumption that the enemy is planning an imminent attack,
but don't have to be. [The methodology behind a preemptive nuclear
strike is to [attack the enemy's strategic nuclear weapon
facilities]{.mark} (missile silos, submarine bases, bomber
airfields),]{.underline} command and control sites and storage depots
first. [By hitting these targets first [the enemy will be so
wounded]{.mark} with so little of their resources left that [they will
be **forced to surrender with minimal damage to the attacking
party.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Limited nuclear war won't cause extinction, but solves future use

**Deudney 18** \[Daniel H. Deudney, Associate Professor of Political
Science at Johns Hopkins University, March 15, 2018, "The Great Debate,"
The Oxford Handbook of International Security, www.oxfordhandbooks.com,
doi:10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198777854.013.22\]

Although nuclear war is the oldest of these technogenic threats to
civilization and human survival, and although important steps to
restraint, particularly at the end of the Cold War, have been achieved,
[the nuclear world is increasingly changing in major ways, and in almost
**entirely dangerous directions**]{.underline}. The third "bombs away"
phase of the great debate on the nuclear-political question is more
consequentially divided than in the first two phases. [Even more
ominously, most of the momentum lies with the forces that are pulling
states **toward nuclear-use**, and with the radical actors bent on
inflicting catastrophic damage on the leading states in the
international system, particularly the United States]{.underline}. [In
contrast, the arms control project, although intellectually vibrant, is
**largely in retreat** on the world political stage. The arms control
settlement of the Cold War is **unraveling**]{.underline}, and the world
public is more divided and distracted than ever. [With the recent
election of]{.underline} President Donald [**Trump**, the United States,
which has played such a dominant role in nuclear politics since its
scientists invented these fiendish engines, now has an **impulsive and
uninformed leader**, boding **ill for nuclear restraint and effective
crisis management**.]{.underline} Given current trends, it is prudent to
assume that **[[sooner or late]{.mark}r]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} and
probably sooner, [**[nuclear weapons will again be the used in
war]{.mark}**. But this bad news may contain a **"silver lining" of good
news**[. Unlike a **general** nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline} that
might have occurred during the Cold War, such [a [nuclear event now
would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably **[[not mark the end of]{.mark}
civilization (or]{.underline}** of [[**humanity**), due
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the great [**[reductions in nuclear
forces]{.underline}** [achieved at the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Furthermore, **politics**]{.underline} [on
"the day after" could have **immense potential for positive change**.
The survivors would not be likely to envy the dead, but would surely
have a **greatly renewed resolution for "never again."**]{.underline}
[[Such an event]{.mark}, completely unpredictable in its particulars,
[would **unambiguously put the nuclear-political question back at the
top of the world political agend**]{.mark}**a**. It [would unmistakeably
remind leading states of their **vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[It might also [trigger more robust efforts to achieve]{.mark} the
**[global regulation of nuclear capability]{.mark}**. Like the bombings
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that did so much to catalyze the elevated
concern for nuclear security in the early Cold War, and like the
experience "at the brink" in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, **the now
bubbling nuclear caldron [holds the possibility of inaugurating]{.mark}
a major period of institutional innovation and [adjustment toward a
fully "bombs away" future]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### Striking now is key -- otherwise, Russia will continue developments and beat us later with new super weapons

"Russia\'s Massive Nuclear Weapons Arsenal Is a Threat," National
Interest, May 29,
2019, <https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russias-massive-nuclear-weapons-arsenal-threat-59947>\]

[The U.S. mainstream view of Russia has changed quite a bit in the last
twenty years]{.underline}, particularly in the last five. [[We have
moved from the fantasy that there was no threat from
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} after the demise of the Soviet Union [[to a
**recognition of a serious**]{.mark} **Russian [threat]{.mark}** to the
U.S. and its allies]{.underline}, including a nuclear threat in the last
two years of the Obama administration and the Trump administration.
However, characterizing the relationship between the U.S. and Russia as
"competition" as it now appears in U.S. Government documents, does not
go far enough. Lockheed and Boeing compete; [[Russia]{.mark} threatens
**preemptive nuclear attack**.]{.underline} [It is unilaterally [trying
to create a **sphere of influence** in Eastern Europe]{.mark} and the
former Soviet states in the classic 19th Century sense while **building
the largest nuclear arsenal** in the world. There is no competition here
but rather a **serious threat from Russia**.]{.underline} Russia and
Nuclear Weapons [[Putin]{.underline}'s]{.mark} economic policies are a
disaster for Russia; yet he [[continues to modernize and expand Russia's
military]{.mark} and nuclear [capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
January 2017, Russian Defense Minister General of the Army Sergei Shoigu
stated that [[development]{.mark} of the strategic nuclear force was
Russia's first priority, noting that Russia [will **"...continue a
massive program of nuclear rearmament**]{.mark}, deploying **modern
ICBMs** on land and sea, \[and\] **modernizing the strategic bomber
force."**]{.underline} The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review report agrees
stating, "In addition to modernizing 'legacy' Soviet nuclear systems,
[Russia is **developing and deploying new nuclear warheads and
launchers.**]{.underline} [These efforts include multiple upgrades for
every leg of the Russian nuclear triad of strategic bombers, sea-based
missiles, and land-based missiles. Russia is [also **developing** at
least two new intercontinental range systems, a **hypersonic glide
vehicle**, and a]{.mark} new intercontinental, nuclear-armed,
nuclear-powered, **[undersea autonomous torpedo]{.mark}**."]{.underline}
Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and National Nuclear Security
Administration Director Lisa Gordon-Hagerty in April 2019 told the
Senate Armed Services Committee,
"[Russia](https://m.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/) and
[China](https://m.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/) are investing
massive resources into upgrading and expanding their nuclear arsenals,
all at a time when they seek to challenge U.S. interests and unravel
U.S. alliances around the world.

#### Russia is developing [genetically-engineered super soldiers]{.underline} -- makes the [future war unwinnable]{.underline} and [causes extinction]{.underline}

operations**]{.mark}"]{.underline} [technology which they say
"**scares** the **crap** out of us".]{.underline} [[Super-soldiers are
fast becoming a **reality**]{.underline}]{.mark} as armies across the
world search for ways to beef up their troopers to make them stronger,
faster, and more deadly. But while [most future weapons are based around
robotics, lasers and
exoskeletons](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/533525/Super-Weapons-Future-Tech-Energy-Weapons-Cyber-Attacks-Aircraft-Nuclear-World-War-3),
[defense bigwigs in the United States believe [Russia is going **one
step beyond**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to create the **ultimate super
soldie**]{.mark}**r**]{.underline}. Military science experts have
predicted [super soldiers could be **very close to the horizon** and
**Russia could be leading the way**]{.underline}. [Steroids and other
performance enhancing drugs can be pumped into soldiers bodies to make
them tougher on the battlefield.]{.underline} The drugs would allow
troops to march for longer distances faster, carry more gear, and fight
more fiercely in close combat. **[[Brain implants]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[can also be embedded into soldiers heads to allow them to shoot with
better aim or be more susceptible to orders.]{.underline}
**[[Microscopic technology]{.underline}]{.mark}** [could also be
implanted into men which would fix their wounds on the battlefield
without need for a medic]{.underline}.
**[[Bionics]{.underline}]{.mark}** [could also be used to allow men to
control machines or extensive prosthetics **with their
minds**]{.underline}. [Pentagon commander Bob Work, the deputy secretary
of defense, said]{.underline}: "[Our adversaries]{.underline}, quite
frankly, [are pursuing enhanced human operations]{.underline}. **[And it
scares the crap out of us,]{.underline}** really." The former artillery
battalion commander said the US is working on tech to assist soldiers
such as exoskeletons-- as opposed to the suggested biological Russian
gear to enhance soldiers. He added the United States is facing a "big,
big decision on whether or not we are comfortable going that way\" in a
speech. America's secret science DARPA division is already exploring the
tech needed to create super soldiers. Their scientists have researched
mind-altering pain vaccines, drugs which mean soldiers can stay awake
for longer periods, and microscopic magnets which would seal wounds in
the wave of a hand. Russia's [superhuman schemes extend to their
athletes where a state-sponsoring doping programme landed them in
trouble](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/531215/Rio-2016-Putin-Russia-Olympics-prank-doping-scandal)
at the Olympics. Maria Sharapova was caught out using the drug Meldonium
-- which [the Soviet Union used to bolster their soldiers during the
Cold War]{.underline}. The pharmaceutical was unwittingly necked by
Russian troopers during the superpower's invasion of Afghanistan after
being given it by military chiefs to boost their endurance. The drug's
inventor Ivar Kalvins told a Latvian newspaper in a 2009 interview "They
were all given meldonium. They themselves were not aware they were using
it. No one was being asked if they agree to it back then". Russia is not
the only power to have been experimenting with superhuman technology --
as America said they suspect China could also be working on "enhanced
human operations". Nazis during World War 2 also used performance
enhancers to boost the Third Reich's soldiers -- using pills based on
Crystal Meth to make them fight longer as they stormed across Europe.
The British Ministry of Defence is looking into the feasibility of super
soldiers in the next 30 years according to papers made public in 2013 --
featuring augmented bodies and even telepathy by signalling from
electronic chips in their brain. US Air Force Colonel Dave Shunk, now
retired, described the possibilities of America's war against supermen
in a report about soldiers of the near future. He wrote: "[The Army must
come to terms not only with]{.underline} creating---or **[fighting
against]{.underline}**---[enhanced soldiers]{.underline} [but also with
understanding the **unforeseen ethical challenges**]{.underline} He
added: "[[The soldier of the future likely will be enhanced
through]{.mark} neuroscience, [biotechnology]{.mark}, nanotechnology,
genetics, and drugs]{.underline}." [Stephen Hawking has

#### Russia is developing military AI -- causes extinction

**Rybarczyk 21** \[Katarzyna Rybarczyk is a Political Correspondent for
Immigration News, a media platform affiliated with Immigration Advice
Service, \"Russia's Weapons of the Future: How AI Could Escalate Global
Conflicts\", Geopolitics,
https://thegeopolitics.com/russias-weapons-of-the-future-how-ai-could-escalate-global-conflicts/\]
GBS-HW

Vladimir Putin once said 'Whoever becomes the leader in AI will become
the ruler of the world.' In recent months, it has been evident that
[Russia is **dedicated** to surpassing other countries in the
development and use of AI for military purposes.]{.underline}

[Russia has been working on developing robots equipped with artificial
intelligence that would be **capable of fighting
independently**.]{.underline} Finally, on May 20, Russia's defence
minister Sergey Shoygu announced that the country has launched mass
production of the new weapons.

As the Russian military is becoming more sophisticated, other countries
also make substantial investments in AI. It seems, therefore, like the
world is facing an AI arms race that risks disrupting international
peace and stability.

Russia's concerning technologies

[The combat robots that are the newest addition to the Russian military
will be able to assess a combat situation and react accordingly. They
will be **faster and more accurate** when attacking targets than human
fighters. Russian officials say that **by 2025 they hope to substitute a
significant proportion of regular soldiers with machines**]{.underline}
and deploy an army composed solely of robots into some combat
operations.

The robots are not the only AI-dependent weapons that Russia has
developed. [The country has been manufacturing a new type of
technologically advanced helicopter drones that can be used to eliminate
opponents' drones.]{.underline} Russia also has been working on
producing surface and underwater vehicles equipped with a high level of
Artificial Intelligence.

The main threat of the Russian military placing a great effort on
developing AI-controlled weapons is integrating AI into nuclear command.
[Such a scenario would increase the risk of conflicts between nations
**escalating to nuclear use.**]{.underline}

Are we facing a military AI arms race?

Russia is not the only country that has been putting more emphasis on
developing AI-driven weapons. In fact, it can be argued that the main
reason for the escalation of Russia's efforts to manufacture them has
been the need to keep up with the two frontrunners in the field, the US
and China.

China has a goal of becoming the global leader in AI research by 2030,
and the US has been a proponent of using AI for military purposes for
over 60 years. Both the US and China have been producing AI-powered
weapons such as target recognition systems, AI-enhanced drones, and
cyberattack programmes that do not require human intervention.

When one power increases investment in AI, others feel threatened and
also endeavour to make their weapons more sophisticated. In turn, the
never-ending cycle of trying to prove their superiority over others
challenges global stability and risks escalating conflicts between
nations.

The rapidly advancing AI arms race is evident. For years, the field was
dominated by the US and China. Now, however, [Russia is realising
Putin's ambition and is gradually becoming the most prominent developer
of AI-dependent weapons.]{.underline}

Using AI on the battlefield might come at a price

[AI can be used to conduct complex military operations, including
underwater ones, without putting soldiers' lives at risk. In theory, it
can do a lot of good and prevent innocent lives from being lost. In
practice, however, it represents a **new type of global
threat.**]{.underline}

'Lethal autonomous weapons -- machines with the power to kill on their
own, without human judgment and accountability -- are bringing us into
unacceptable moral and political territory', said Antonio Guterres, UN
Secretary-General.

None of the countries wants to fall behind so the AI arms race is only
intensifying and technologically advanced weapons that were once viewed
as sci-fi are being invented.

[AI-controlled weapons have the potential to be **extremely
destructive**. There are no humans involved in operating them, so armed
conflicts can quickly reach epic proportions. Furthermore, when AI is
responsible for making decisions on the battlefield, instances of lethal
force being used unjustifiably are likely to happen.]{.underline}

Concerns have been raised about the possibility of 'AI undermining human
control and states manufacturing AI-controlled weapons lacking ethical
self-restraints', Breaking Defense reported.. [Hence, it is imperative
that the international community keeps an eye on Russia's grand
AI-related ambitions and intervenes when the military AI race starts
posing a tangible **existential threat to humanity**.]{.underline}

#### Russia is developing directed energy weapons\-\--in the future, they'll overtake the US 

**Atherton 20** \[Kelsey D. Atherton is a defense technology journalist,
\"Russia Working On Directed Energy Weapon\", Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/kelseyatherton/2020/07/14/russia-working-on-directed-energy-weapon/?sh=16998423287b\]
GBS-HW

Since humans have bent electricity to war, there has been a hunt for a
special weapon that renders the technology particularly useless. Lurking
in the annals of weapon design, and periodically re-emerging as a novel
solution to some new machine, exist tools that target electronics, and
electronics only.

[Early in July, Russian media described a weapon that roughly fits into
this tempo, using the phrase "**EMP cannon**."]{.underline} EMP, or
electro-magnetic pulse, is a real, observable phenomenon, but the
primary way to produce the effect at scale is to use a nuclear weapon.
When the nuke is detonated low to the ground, an electromagnetic pulse
is one effect of many, limited in range and whose effect is largely
overshadowed by the fire and death of the nuclear blast. When the nuke
is detonated at high altitude, in the lower reaches of space, the pulse
can travel quite a distance, though the effect is mitigated by hardening
of second-strike nuclear weapons and the almost certain nuclear
retaliation that would follow.

This Russian EMP cannon is neither of those effects, which makes the
moniker vexing[. Instead, the weapon as described more **closely
resembles microwave guns**, a kind of directed energy weapon that's
seeing modern usage as an anti-drone tool.]{.underline}

[In that sense, the weapon can be seen as "an extension of Russia\'s
pledge to develop **breakthrough capabilities** to counter what they
perceive as the current Western overmatch in hi-tech and
\[Precision-Guided Munition\] weapons]{.underline}," says Samuel
Bendett, adviser to the think tank CNA's Russia program, who specializes
in Russian unmanned military systems.

[**Creating a directed energy weapon** that can specifically disable
drones is one way to **leap-frog into the future of war**, as
human-piloted and robotic aircraft look to contest skies filled with
hostile machines.]{.underline} TASS notes that such a weapon is expected
to be incorporated in the remotely piloted version of any
sixth-generation fighters Russia produces.

"The cannons as described would also fit into Russia\'s overall
counter-drone research, development, testing, and evaluations," says
Bendett. "This work is carried out as an extension of Russia\'s
counter-drone lessons learned from its Syria experience, as well as part
of defense against Western high-altitude drones that currently conduct
surveillance missions near Russian borders."

[Whatever the nature of the anti-electronics weapon actually being
developed, the future of war is likely to see far **more new energy
weapons**, put to familiar use.]{.underline}

#### Extinction\-\--outweighs nuclear war

sensors for IBM and Honeywell for over 30 years; "The Game of Cat and
Mouse," War at the Speed of Light: Directed-Energy Weapons and the
Future of Twenty-First-Century Warfare, U of Nebraska Press, p. 13-64\]

A new revolution is coming in warfare, and, if you will pardon the pun,
it is coming at the speed of light. This revolution concerns the
emergence of [[directed-energy weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
[[promise to be even **more potent than nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark}. If you are skeptical about this
statement, let me relate a scenario involving a laser as a weapon to
provide insight into the potency of directed-energy weapons.

[Imagine [a]{.mark} land-based **[laser]{.mark}** capable of generating
the power equivalence of a nuclear weapon. Now imagine [bouncing]{.mark}
the laser's beam [off a **satellite\'s mirror**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[reflecting]{.underline}** [the beam [to
**hit**]{.mark} **a target [anywhere]{.mark} on Earth**]{.underline}.
What would its effect be on the target? The target would become plasma,
the fourth state of matter, a jumble of excited nuclei, atoms stripped
of their electrons. **[[All life]{.mark} and structures]{.underline}**
[within the diameter of the laser beam [would be
**destroyed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Next, imagine the target is the city
of Beijing. [[In an **instant**, **21**]{.mark}**.5 [million]{.mark}
people**]{.underline} would [[**die**. In]{.underline}]{.mark} another
fraction of a second, the laser could attack another target; [in a
**minute**, it could **destroy China**]{.underline}. I only used Beijing
and China as an example. [The same scenario would hold for]{.underline}
[**[New York]{.mark}** City]{.underline} and [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, or for any city and
any country.

If you are incredulous, let me give you some facts. [**[Numerous
countries]{.mark} around the world** [are making]{.mark} powerful

According to Yampolskiy and Spellchecker (2016), [[the **probability**
and **seriousness** of AI failures]{.mark} will **[increase with
time]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We estimate that they will reach their peak
between the appearance of the first self-improving AI and the moment
that an AI or group of AIs reach global power, and will later diminish,
as late-stage AI halting seems to be a low-probability event. [[AI
is]{.mark} an [**extremely powerful** and **completely
unpredictable**]{.mark} technology, **[millions of times more powerful
than nuclear weapons]{.mark}**. Its [existence could create **multiple

imagine**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We present several dozen separate global
risk scenarios connected with AI in this article, but it is likely that
some of the most serious are not included. [[The **sheer number of

"[Success]{.underline} in creating AI [would be]{.underline} [[the

"[Humans]{.underline}, limited by slow biological evolution, **[couldn't

called AI "[our **greatest existential threat**]{.mark}"]{.underline} in
a 2014 interview with MIT students at the AeroAstro Centennial
Symposium. "I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some
regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level,
just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish."13 Musk has
invested in a number of AI technologies through startups including
DeepMind, acquired by Google for the rumoured sum of \$400m (£285m) in
201414, and claims this is as a means to "just keep an eye on what's
going on with artificial intelligence"15. [**Bill Gates** has also
expressed concerns about AI]{.underline}. During a Q&A session on Reddit
in January 2015, Gates said: "I am in the camp that is concerned about
super intelligence. First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and
not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well.
A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be
a concern. [[I agree]{.mark} with Elon Musk and some others on this
[and]{.mark} **[don't understand why some people are not

### AI Development\-\--2NC

#### Development is at an all-time high.

[Russia is]{.underline} **[spearheading]{.underline}** [its AI strategy
with]{.underline} **[heavy investments in military]{.underline}**,
**[state-sponsored actors and the private sector]{.underline}**. [It has
been stated that with Russia's]{.underline} **[increasing
adoption]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[futuristic
technologies]{.underline}** and modern battlefield capabilities, [the US
might be]{.underline} **[outmatched]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the
areas of **[armour]{.underline}**, **[artillery]{.underline}**, **[air
defence]{.underline}**, **[space]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[cyberspace]{.underline}**.2

[Russia's AI strategy **gained momentum**]{.underline} in 2014 [when the
Russian Ministry of Defence]{.underline} (MoD) [adopted the concept for
the use of Robotic Systems for military use by 2030]{.underline}, with
30 per cent of combat power being robotised to partial or complete
autonomy. In 2016, the strategy of scientific and technological
development of the Russian Federation was approved with the priority on
the creation of systems for Big Data, AI and ML. In 2017, [Russia
launched its AI-enabled virtual assistant Alice by Yandex and a
cooperation agreement was signed between Yandex and Gazprom Neft to
implement machine learning projects in the oil industry]{.underline}.3
[The same year]{.underline} Vladimir **[Putin declared]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} "**[whichever country]{.underline}** [becomes the
leader in]{.underline} artificial intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**)
[will]{.underline} **[become the ruler of the world]{.underline}**".4
Despite this, [Russia is]{.underline} **[still behind]{.underline}**
[when compared to US and China in terms of AI capabilities]{.underline},
according to a report by the US government-funded Center for Naval
Analyses.5 [Russia was not a leader in communication
networks]{.underline} **[but]{.underline}** [used this technology
for]{.underline} **[weaponising itself]{.underline}** [for advanced
cyber capabilities and]{.underline} **[became a leader]{.underline}**.
[Considering Russia's capabilities in advanced weapon
systems]{.underline}, **[it is likely]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
**[it will soon be a leader in AI-enabled warfare]{.underline}**. In
2018, the Russian MoD hosted a joint conference with the Ministry of
Education and Science and the Russian Academy of Sciences, which led to
the 10-point statement that specifically focuses on innovative and
AI-driven solutions.6 In 2019, another initiative was led by the Russian
government for National Strategy for the Development of AI with AI
Federal Project inclined towards the private sector. The AI Roadmap
drafted by SberBank estimated an investment of US\$ 5.13 billion, which
was later revised to US\$ 3.83 billion.7

In **[2021]{.underline}**, [the Russian President again stated
that]{.underline} 2021 will be the year of [Science and Technology in
Russia with a **breakthrough in technology**]{.underline}, economy and
social progress.8 [In the modernisation of Russian armed
forces]{.underline}, [AI has been highlighted as a]{.underline}
**[priority]{.underline}** [for integrating autonomous and robotic
weapon systems]{.underline}. For this, the National Defence Management
Centre has been established to set up coordination between various
military units.9

#### Russia is scaling up its AI development -- will rival the United States 

**Tadjdeh 21** \[Yasmin Tadjdeh is a Defense Reporter, "Algorithmic

GBS-HW

[Russia]{.underline} --- which has made no secret of its artificial
intelligence ambitions --- [is building a cadre of AI-enabled,
autonomous weapon systems that could one day **threaten the United
States**]{.underline}.

["The Russian military seeks to be a **leader in weaponizing AI
technology**,"]{.underline} Lt. Gen. Michael Groen, director of the
Pentagon's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, told National Defense.

The JAIC --- which has been working to facilitate AI adoption across the
Defense Department since 2018 --- recently commissioned a report by CNA,
a research organization based in Arlington, Virginia, to examine
Russia's developments.

[The report --- titled "Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy in Russia"
--- identified **more than 150 AI-enabled military systems** in various
stages of development]{.underline}, Groen said in an email in June. Key
areas of interest include autonomous air, underwater, surface and ground
platforms.

[The nation wants to use AI for electronic warfare, intelligence,
surveillance, reconnaissance and strategic decision-making processes as
leaders pursue information dominance on the battlefield, Groen
said.]{.underline}

While Russia is not a leader in commercial and academic AI research ---
as the United States and China are --- it would be a grave mistake for
the Pentagon to take its eyes off the threat, he said.

"Russia was not a major leader in the development of the internet or
computer networking, but Russia has become a leader in weaponizing those
technologies for advanced cyberattacks and cybercrime capabilities," he
noted.

The Russian military has taken significant steps to reform and improve
the organization of its research and development enterprise, he noted.
This was done in part because Moscow believed its previous structures
were stifling innovation in technology areas such as AI.

The scale of these reforms --- such as creating a new advanced R&D
organization modeled on the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency --- demonstrates the nation's seriousness about fielding
an AI-enabled fighting force, he said.

Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. John Hyten noted that
Russia has invested enormous resources into the development of
artificial intelligence, big data and software technologies.

The country is moving quickly across many areas, including nuclear
weapons, space and cyber, he said during remarks at the Defense
Department's AI Symposium in June. Embedded in each of those elements is
new software, processing and artificial intelligence systems.

"Russia is a significant threat, especially in the near term," he said.
"It is a challenge to not just keep up with them but stay ahead of
them."

Like the United States, [**Russia is working to digitize its military**.
Its Ministry of Defense recently announced it intends to **create a
specialized department to develop AI**]{.underline}, according to the
CNA report. It is even working on developing a military information
sharing structure that resembles the Pentagon's joint all-domain command
and control, or JADC2, effort.

#### Pentagon reports [prove]{.underline}.

[Russia is on the]{.underline} **[fast track]{.underline}** [to
developing]{.underline} a range of **[autonomous weapon
systems]{.underline}** [in a]{.underline} **[challenge]{.underline}**
[to US military dominance]{.underline}, [according to a report

"**[The Russian military seeks to be a leader in weaponizing AI

Michael **[Groen]{.underline}** [recently told National
Defense]{.underline}.

AI in Russia

[Titled]{.underline} **[Artificial Intelligence and
Autonomy]{.underline}** in Russia, [the report details more
than]{.underline} **[150 AI-enabled military systems]{.underline}** at
various points of development in the country, [including autonomous
**land**]{.underline}, **[sea]{.underline}**, **[air]{.underline}**,
**[space]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[cyber
platforms]{.underline}**.

The [goal of these platforms is]{.underline} "information **[dominance
on the battlefield]{.underline}**," according to Groen, something the
agency considers a potential threat to America and its allies.

"Russia was not a major leader in the development of the internet or
computer networking, but [Russia]{.underline} **[has
become]{.underline}** [a leader in weaponizing those technologies
for]{.underline} **[advanced cyberattacks]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[cybercrime capabilities]{.underline}**," Groen
noted.

Ratcheting up Development

According to Gen. John Hyten of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, [Moscow
has]{.underline} recently **[accelerated]{.underline}** [its investments
in **big data**]{.underline}, **[software]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[artificial intelligence]{.underline}**.

The [country has rapidly accelerated development in areas such as
**cyberspace**]{.underline}, **[next-gen nuclear weapons]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[space]{.underline}**, [he explained at a June
Defense Department AI Symposium]{.underline}. Enhanced AI systems
feature prominently in this multi-pronged military approach.

"**[Russia is a significant threat, especially in the near
term]{.underline}**," he said. "[It is a]{.underline}
**[challenge]{.underline}** [to not just keep up with them but stay
ahead of them]{.underline}."

#### AI weaponization is Russia's [top priority]{.underline}\-\--proven by [direct quotes]{.underline} from Putin.

Natalia **Slavina 21**, Grand Reporter for the Regional Voice Magazine,
"Artificial intelligence may cause breakthrough to improve weapons\'
parameters --- Putin," 11/3/21, https://tass.com/defense/1357611/micahw

The [use of]{.underline} **[artificial intelligence]{.underline}** [in
the armed forces is acquiring]{.underline} **[top
priority]{.underline}**, [because]{.underline} such [technologies can
bring about a]{.underline} **[breakthrough]{.underline}** [in improving
weapons\']{.underline} **[combat parameters]{.underline}**, Russian
President Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}** [said at]{.underline} another
[conference devoted to defense issues]{.underline} on Wednesday.

\"Let me stress one fundamental aspect. [The use of artificial
intelligence technologies has]{.underline} **[top
priority]{.underline}** [in creating]{.underline} these and other
[weapon systems of the]{.underline} **[future]{.underline}**,\" [Putin
said]{.underline} while [speaking about]{.underline} **[hypersonic
systems]{.underline}**.

[He stressed that AI technologies]{.underline} \"[must bring about
a]{.underline} **[qualitative breakthrough]{.underline}** [in
**enhancing weapons\' combat capabilities**]{.underline}.\"

\"Such [technologies should be used]{.underline} more
**[actively]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[personnel]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[weapons command systems]{.underline}**,
**[communication]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[data
transmission]{.underline}** means [and]{.underline} also **[high
accuracy missiles]{.underline}**,\" [Putin believes]{.underline}.

[Of]{.underline} **[no less importance]{.underline}**, he said, [is the
introduction of AI technologies in creating new]{.underline} **[highly
autonomous robots]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} in the **[remote
control of drones]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} deep **[submergence
vehicles]{.underline}**.

\"[All these priorities and tasks must be reflected to the]{.underline}
**[full extent]{.underline}** in the new state program for armaments
extending till 2033[,\" he said]{.underline}.

[Putin stressed that the work on a unified system of reference data for
shaping the program was]{.underline} **[already underway]{.underline}**
[at the Defense Ministry]{.underline}.

#### Russia is using AI to expand geopolitical influence\-\--they [perceive]{.underline} US AI development as existential.

**[Artificial intelligence]{.underline}** [technologies are turning into
a tool of]{.underline} **[geopolitical influence]{.underline}**,
[Russian Security Council Deputy Secretary]{.underline} **[Oleg
Khramov]{.underline}** [said]{.underline}, [addressing the Army-2021
International Military-Technical Forum]{.underline} on Tuesday.

\"[Artificial intelligence technologies are one of the]{.underline}
**[key aspects]{.underline}** [of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and
**require attention**]{.underline} [in terms of]{.underline} **[ensuring
security]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[protecting national
interests]{.underline}**. State agencies, research organizations,
manufacturers and private companies actively seek to implement
technologies capable of simulating human cognitive functions,\" [he
pointed out]{.underline}. \"In a completely digitalized world,
[artificial intelligence technologies turn into a **tool of geopolitical
influence**]{.underline},\" Kharmov added. Moreover, in his words, [the
research community is discussing **possible scenarios**]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} **[future conflicts]{.underline}** between human
civilization and the community of machines.

[The Russian Security Council deputy secretary]{.underline}
**[emphasized]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} developed countries,
primarily [the]{.underline} **[United States]{.underline}** and its
closest allies, [are promoting]{.underline} \"certain [approaches to the
basic rules for the development and use of artificial intelligence
systems in various fields]{.underline}, [which they can take advantage
o]{.underline}f.\" \"**[Clearly]{.underline}**, [the countries that have
succeeded in the development of such rules and standards and seek
to]{.underline} **[enshrine them internationally]{.underline}** look
[for new opportunities to gain global dominance in a changing historical
environment]{.underline},\" Khramov stressed.

\"[This situation]{.underline} **[creates threats to Russia's national
security and makes it necessary to respond
appropriately]{.underline}**,\" [he concluded]{.underline}.

#### Putin is [committed]{.underline} to AI.

Alexei **Nikolsky 20**, Political Reporter and Photographer for The
Moscow Times, "Artificial intelligence is not about hype, it will not
\'fade away\' over time --- Putin," 12/4/20,
<https://tass.com/economy/1231575/micahw>

[Artificial intelligence is]{.underline} **[not about
hype]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} it **[will not \"fade
away\"]{.underline}** over time, Russian President Vladimir **[Putin
said]{.underline}** [at a plenary session of the international online
conference Artificial Intelligence Journey]{.underline} (AI Journey).

\"[We are allocating]{.underline} **[serious resources]{.underline}**,
both financial and administrative ones, [on creation and development of
technologies]{.underline}. It is not about spending these funds,
purchasing high-status gadgets and other household appliances.
[Artificial intelligence is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** about [a
so-called fashion hype or a prestigious trend]{.underline}, [that will
fade away]{.underline}, vanish tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
[No]{.underline}, **[this will not happen]{.underline}**,\" **[the
president noted]{.underline}**.

[He recalled that]{.underline} \"**[global history]{.underline}** [knows
many cases when]{.underline} large, global corporations and even
[countries]{.underline} literally **[slept through]{.underline}** [a
technological breakthrough and were]{.underline} **[swept off the
historical stage overnight]{.underline}**.\"

\"**[We must remember this]{.underline}**. I want my colleagues in
ministries, departments, regions of the Russian Federation, in state
companies, research centers and universities to hear me now: **[we have
to tackle issues of a fundamentally new level of
complexity]{.underline}**,\" **[the head of state said]{.underline}**.

#### It\'s Putin's [top interest]{.underline}.

Peter **Suciu 21**, Michigan-based writer who has contributed to more
than four dozen magazines, newspapers, and websites. He regularly writes
about military small arms, "Putin Wants Russia to Lead the Way in AI
Weapons,"
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/putin-wants-russia-lead-way-ai-weapons-195808/micahw

Even as numerous leaders in the tech world have repeatedly warned of the
dangers that artificial intelligence- (AI) enabled weapons could present
for the future of mankind, Russian Federation president Vladimir [Putin
has]{.underline} **[long been]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} **[firm
supporter of AI weapons]{.underline}**. In 2017, [Putin proclaimed that
the country that **leads AI development**]{.underline} [could have
a]{.underline} **[significant advantage]{.underline}** [over its
rivals]{.underline}.

Putin also admitted that the development of AI could present challenges
for humanity.

"[Artificial intelligence **is the future**]{.underline}, not only for
Russia, but **[for all humankind]{.underline}**," Putin remarked. "[It
comes with]{.underline} **[colossal opportunities]{.underline}**,
[but]{.underline} also **[threats that are difficult to
predict]{.underline}**. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will
become the ruler of the world."

[Fast forward]{.underline} to this week [and Putin seems]{.underline}
**[more than willing]{.underline}** [to overlook]{.underline} any of
those [difficulties to predict threats]{.underline}---[as he
**stressed**]{.underline} [the need for Russia to introduce]{.underline}
advanced technologies including **[AI]{.underline}**, which could be
used [in]{.underline} **[unmanned combat aircraft]{.underline}**.

"[We need to continue work on]{.underline} \[**[unmanned aerial
vehicles]{.underline}**\], [keep working as intensively as we have been
doing lately]{.underline}," the Russian leader said at a defense
industry meeting in Sochi, TASS reported. "[I also mean using artificial
intelligence]{.underline}, state-of-the-art achievements of technology
and science.\"

[Putin]{.underline}, who [said that there were **more than 2,000
drones**]{.underline} [operational in the Russian Army]{.underline} at
present, also recommended that the Russian domestic defense industry
should use the analytical data from those autonomous devices that have
already been employed in combat.

### \-\--AT: Ukraine Thumps

#### Even if Ukraine devastated Russia, they'll still hang onto AI weaponization.

Dr. Christopher **Whyte 22**, assistant professor of homeland security
and emergency preparedness at Virginia Commonwealth University,
"Russia's AI setbacks will likely heighten its cyber aggression,"
<https://www.csoonline.com/article/3656957/russias-ai-setbacks-will-likely-heighten-its-cyber-aggression.html/micahw>,
language edited.

With the weight of Western sanctions ~~crippling~~ \[damaging\] parts of
the Russian economy, [the]{.underline} **[consensus]{.underline}**
[seems to be that Moscow's ambitions of being a major player in the
development of machine learning]{.underline}, robotics, natural language
processing [and other]{.underline} artificial intelligence
(**[AI]{.underline}**) [tools are]{.underline} **[functionally
dead]{.underline}**. The [consequences of the war waged against Ukraine
on Russia's **wealth**]{.underline}, **[workforce]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[access]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
sophisticated [imported product]{.underline}s such as microprocessors
used to operate everything from mobile devices to automobiles **[are
immense]{.underline}**.

[Without]{.underline} **[capital]{.underline}**,
**[talent]{.underline}** [and a line on **critical commodities and
technologies**]{.underline}, [Russia will struggle to be competitive in
everything from medical technology development to national security
practice]{.underline}. This likely result of increasing isolation seems
doubly assured with AI. Russia's relatively weak fundamentals and strong
competition from both China and the West virtually guarantee vast
opportunity costs to Russia in years to come. This outcome might be seen
as a positive development that will cede techno-strategic advantages to
defense communities in North America, Europe and East Asia\--those most
concerned about Russia's military capabilities and intentions.

There may be some truth in that assumption **[but to equate the
recession of Russia's ability to build cutting-edge AI with diminished
likelihood of conflict centered on AI would be
disingenuous]{.underline}**. [Practitioners and policymakers across the
West would do well to recognize that the subversive character of AI
design and deployment creates **perverse incentives toward conflict**
even]{.underline}, almost [especially for actors that do not lead the
field]{.underline}. **[In no place is this coming uptick in conflict
more likely to manifest than in cyberspace]{.underline}**.

#### Ukraine proves that Russia is INCREASING investment in AI weaponization.

[The]{.underline} ongoing **[Russia--Ukraine conflict]{.underline}**
[showcases how various technologies can be]{.underline} **[vehemently
used]{.underline}** [on the battlefield]{.underline} through both land
and air. [With Russia's **advanced air combat
capabilities**]{.underline}, it has reportedly used only Tu-22M3
bombers, Ka-52 attack helicopters, SU25, Su27 flanker and Su30 fighters
[to destroy Ukraine's military bases and other critical
infrastructures]{.underline}. Russia's new Artificial Intelligence
(**[AI]{.underline}**) **[capabilities]{.underline}**
[include]{.underline} **[AI-enabled robotic weapons]{.underline}**,
**[autonomous tanks]{.underline}**, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(**[UAVs]{.underline}**), [and]{.underline} **[long-range
strikes]{.underline}** involving high-precision missiles.1 [Russia is
**heavily committed**]{.underline} [to the use of AI for military
systems for intelligence gathering]{.underline}, C4ISR, logistics and
development of autonomous weapons.

Despite having advanced AI-based military capabilities, Russia has not
used any lethal autonomous weapon systems in the recent conflict.
Moreover, [Russia's]{.underline} **[development and use]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[weaponised AI]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[not
only]{.underline}** [attributed to the]{.underline} **[quest of
power]{.underline}** [or the]{.underline} **[global AI
race]{.underline}** [but]{.underline} **[also]{.underline}** to
[the]{.underline} **[strategic implications]{.underline}** [and risks
involved with autonomy]{.underline}. The technological modernisation
with AI has been declared as one of the key areas for the future of
defence strategy. [One significant aspect of AI is that it is not a
weapon but a range of functions and technologies that can be devised
through integrating it with systems to gain a **strategic advantage over
adversaries**]{.underline}.

Today, [countries with geopolitical conflicts are using]{.underline}
**[AI]{.underline}** and Machine Learning (ML) [in]{.underline}
**[cyberattacks]{.underline}**, **[misinformation]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[disinformation campaigns]{.underline}** [to their
advantage]{.underline}. This has been [visible in the
**current**]{.underline} [Russia--Ukraine conflict]{.underline}, [where
Russia has been suspected of having used **asymmetric
warfare**]{.underline} [by using]{.underline} **[AI-based
cyber-attacks]{.underline}**, **[electronic warfare]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[information weapons]{.underline}** [on Ukraine's
infrastructure like electrical grids and communication
systems]{.underline} before the incursion. Russia has in the past also
used this discreet use of technology for destabilising its opponents'
infrastructures. The discourse on [the use of weaponised AI]{.underline}
in such conflicts [entails]{.underline} **[domestic
challenges]{.underline}** [in addition to geopolitical
implications]{.underline}. Therefore, Russia is being careful and
heading with a strategised course of action in using this technology on
battlefield.

### DEWs\-\--2NC

#### Russia is developing DEWs -- causes them to leapfrog the US militarily

**CTG 21** \[The Counterterrorism Group is a Security service based in

DEVELOPMENTS AND UTILIZATION\",
https://www.counterterrorismgroup.com/post/executive-summary-directed-energy-weapons-recent-developments-and-utilization\]
GBS-HW

[China and Russia have developed several new technologies in recent
years that might **threaten the supremacy of the US** in the military
sphere, including **Directed Energy Weapons** (DEWs).]{.underline} These
weapons systems belong to the category of \"non-lethal weapons,\'\'
which complement the conventional ones and, in many cases, even replace
them and are available in technologically advanced countries. DEWs use
beams of intense energy to target people, vehicles, and other weapons to
disable or destroy them, which can be in the form of lasers, radiation,
microwave, and sound. The principle of operation of guided energy
weapons is the concentration of energy in small rays or microwaves and
the concentration of energy at a point for the destruction of the
electronic equipment of the battle platform[. China\'s and Russia's
willingness to rapidly develop emerging technologies on a massive scale
means that it is **highly likely** their military will **quickly reap
the benefits** of any scientific progress and potential military
operation, despite the US efforts to respectively advance such weapons
so that it can face its competitors.]{.underline}

China has been working on several different types of DEWs, the most
prominent of which is the anti-satellite weapon system (ASAT) that will
use a beam of energy to disable the satellite. China, in recent years,
has been working on perfecting this weapon and has utilized it against
the US in 2006 to strike US satellites in orbit.\[2\] If China were able
to perfect this weapon, it could be used to take out any military or
intelligence satellites in orbit, causing an increase in tensions
between all countries involved. In addition, at the International
Aerospace Exhibition in Moscow in 2019, China's Aerospace Science and
Industry Company demonstrated the LW-30 laser weapon system, which could
use high-energy emitted lasers to instantly track and intercept various
aerial targets from photoelectric guidance equipment to aircraft, guided
bombs, and mortar shells.\[3\] For instance, utilizing this weapon in
any potential military operations in the South China Sea, where China is
particularly aggressive in the recent months deploying more forces,
would be highly efficient for the defense and protection of its already
militarized artificial islands in these disputed waters, and for
encountering the US navy armed forces.

Furthermore, microwave weapons are widely used in China\'s large surface
warships. For example, Type 055 is equipped with a high-power microwave
launcher (HPM) missile system, which combines microwave weapons with
indoor pistols and defense missiles to form a complete missile
network.\[4\] Undoubtedly, China is one of the most important competing
forces that the US has to face, not only economically and commercially,
but also in armaments. The advanced weapons systems of both countries
seek to gain the upper hand so that the technological advantage becomes
a victory lead on the battlefield in a possible US-China war. China\'s
State Broadcasting Corporation (CCTV) has released footage showing a new
system of guided energy weapons or the Chinese laser weapon, but details
of the development of this new weapon were not disclosed.\[5\] According
to identified sources, the system was designed to immediately eliminate
offshore enemy threats, such as small boats, warships, and unmanned
vehicles and aircrafts.\[6\] However, the Chinese Type 055 equipped with
the microwave launcher and integrated electric power plant is highly
likely to be used against low-level asymmetric threats and, if
successful, will likely be made part of the People\'s Liberation Army
Navy arsenal, as it is expected that the new system could have
escalating levels of power, depending on the purpose it seeks to
achieve, whether it is preventing suspicious forces or destroying enemy
targets.

On November 11, 2020, there were claims by the expert Jin Canrong that
the Chinese PLA soldiers had used DEWs (laser weapons) against the
duration of clashes at the Ladakh border.\[7\] According to these
claims, the Chinese military made innovative use of high-powered
microwave weapons when Indian soldiers were in control of Ladakh peaks.
The army was able to emit microwaves from the mountain base to the top
of the mountain, where the Indian soldiers took up positions, turning it
into an \'oven,\' causing the Indian soldiers to withdraw from their
dominant positions quickly.\[8\] Such an incident demonstrates that a
direct energy attack is impossible or difficult to be prevented and
proves that the utilization of DEWs is effective for secret military
missions.

Another incident identifying the utilization of DEWs was when US
diplomats posted in China and Cuba, who have been reported to experience
severe headaches, memory loss, dizziness, hearing loud noises, and then
loss of hearing, balance and concentration problems, along with
concussion symptoms and other issues since early 2016. The mysterious
condition became unofficially known as \"Havana Syndrome,\" and it is
suspected that these officials were attacked with laser weapons and
guided microwaves.\[9\] A recent report claimed that a CIA investigation
revealed that Russian agents were using a secret laser weapon to inflict
brain damage on US spies and diplomats worldwide - even on US
soil.\[10\] The waves helped implant information errors in the embassy
walls, paving the way for US intelligence to infiltrate Russian
communications networks. Moreover, the US is investigating attacks in
Syria in 2021 that appear to have the characteristics of directed energy
strikes against US troops, which appear to be mysteriously ill in Syria,
and the Pentagon suspects Russia.\[11\] If true, this would mean that
DEWs could be utilized in areas where Russia wants to be involved and
still stay undetected and could be rapidly advanced further to be
deployed for the major attack in a conflict as they can disable almost
the entire personnel of the troops.

[Along with China, Russia is also making plans to develop DEWs. Some of
the weapons that Russia is pursuing include **laser weapons,
radio-electric weapons, and sonic weapons**.\[]{.underline}12\] The
Peresvet, a mobile laser system mounted to a truck, targets satellites
and attempts to blind or dazzle them. It does this to keep the
satellites from collecting intelligence such as geographical
images.\[13\] Russia is also working on an electronic countermeasures
system called Khibiny. This system can be mounted on aircraft and other
vehicles and interrupts the electronic system of an opposing target. The
Russian military claims to have used this weapon in 2014 against the USS
Donald Cook; however, there is no actual evidence that this took
place.\[14\] While the claims of its use have not been substantiated,
Russia is continuing to develop the weapon and mount it on its
aircraft.\[15\] It is expected that these systems will momentarily
disrupt the electronics of a targeted vessel or vehicle, but it is
unlikely to cause severe impacts[. If Russia did develop this weapon to
be as effective as hoped, it could prove **nearly impossible** for the
US and its allies to track aircraft, thus giving Russia an advantage. If
Russia were to gain a military advantage over the US and its allies, the
nation would likely be more willing to **launch military action** in
Eastern Europe.]{.underline}

[to create the]{.underline} **[ultimate super soldier]{.underline}**.

**[Military science experts]{.underline}** have [predicted super
soldiers could be]{.underline} **[very close]{.underline}** [to the

way]{.underline}**.

Steroids and other [performance enhancing drugs can be pumped into

The drugs would [allow troops to]{.underline} **[march for longer

wounds on the battlefield]{.underline} **[without]{.underline}** [need

Bionics could also be used to allow men to [control machines or
extensive prosthetics with their minds]{.underline}.

[Pentagon commander]{.underline} **[Bob Work]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} **[deputy secretary of defense]{.underline}**,
[said]{.underline}: "Our [adversaries]{.underline}, quite frankly, [are
pursuing]{.underline} **[enhanced human operations]{.underline}**. [And
it **scares the crap out of us**]{.underline}, really."

The [former artillery battalion commander said the US is working on tech
to assist soldiers such as **exoskeletons**]{.underline}-- as [opposed
to the suggested biological Russian gear to enhance
soldiers]{.underline}.

He added [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited

way]{.underline}\" in a speech.

America's secret science **[DARPA]{.underline}** division
[is]{.underline} already [exploring the tech needed to create super
soldiers]{.underline}.

Their [scientists have researched]{.underline} **[mind-altering pain
vaccines]{.underline}**, [drugs which mean soldiers can]{.underline}
**[stay awake for longer periods]{.underline}**, and **[microscopic
magnets]{.underline}** [which would seal wounds in the wave of a
hand]{.underline}.

[Russia's superhuman schemes]{.underline} **[extend to their
athletes]{.underline}** [where a **state-sponsoring doping
programme**]{.underline} [landed them in trouble at the
Olympics]{.underline}.

Maria Sharapova was caught out using the drug
**[Meldonium]{.underline}** -- which the Soviet Union [used to
bolster]{.underline} their [soldiers during the Cold War]{.underline}.

The [pharmaceutical was]{.underline} **[unwittingly
necked]{.underline}** [by Russian troopers during the superpower's
invasion of Afghanistan after being given it by military chiefs to
**boost their endurance**]{.underline}.

The drug's inventor Ivar Kalvins told a Latvian newspaper in a 2009
interview "They were all given meldonium. **[They themselves were not
aware they were using it]{.underline}**. [No one was being asked if they
agree to it back then]{.underline}".

Russia is not the only power to have been experimenting with superhuman
technology -- as America said they suspect China could also be working
on "enhanced human operations".

Nazis during World War 2 also used performance enhancers to boost the
Third Reich's soldiers -- using pills based on Crystal Meth to make them
fight longer as they stormed across Europe.

The British Ministry of Defence is looking into the feasibility of super
soldiers in the next 30 years according to papers made public in 2013 --
featuring augmented bodies and even telepathy by signalling from
electronic chips in their brain.

**[US Air Force Colonel]{.underline}** [Dave Shunk]{.underline}, now
retired, [described the]{.underline} **[possibilities]{.underline}** [of
America's war against]{.underline} **[supermen]{.underline}** in a
report about soldiers of the near future.

He wrote: "[The Army must come to terms]{.underline} not only with
creating---or **[fighting against]{.underline}**---[enhanced
soldiers]{.underline} but also with understanding the unforeseen ethical
challenges

He added: "[The soldier of the future likely will be enhanced
through]{.underline} neuroscience, **[biotechnology]{.underline}**,
nanotechnology, genetics, [and drugs]{.underline}."

Stephen Hawking has warned humanity\'s [pursuit of]{.underline}
**[deadlier weapons]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[new
technology]{.underline}** [could lead to]{.underline} **[arms
race]{.underline}** which would spell our doom.

Moscow archives also show a superhuman programme as early as the 1920s.

Allegedly soviet dictator Stalin told scientist Ilya Ivanov "I want a
new invincible human being, insensitive to pain, resistant and
indifferent about the quality of food they eat."

The **[Kremlin]{.underline}** [passed a request to]{.underline} Russia's

COMMENT: [Russian]{.underline} fascist and [Duma member]{.underline}
Vladimir [**[Zhirinovsky]{.underline}** [has made **threatening
statements** about using **weather weaponry** against
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} [perceived as [threatening
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} Financed by German fascist Gerhard Frey,
Zhirinovsky has always been viewed as a loose cannon. [[His
comments]{.mark} about the existence of environmental weaponry **[should
not be dismissed out of hand]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} however.
This is NOT to say that his hints about the Fukushima disaster can be
taken at face value. Nor should we automatically dismiss them. With the
U.S./U.S.S.R. treaty thirty-plus years in the past, the possibility that
other countries have developed such technology should be carefully
considered. That devastating tragedy may well have been a natural
occurrence. For the record, so to speak, I am NOT saying, necessarily,
that HAARP was involved in the Japan quake. As discussed in FTR #272,
other nations are developing or have developed such systems. Another
thing to consider is just WHO is controlling HAARP? Might Underground
Reich elements have access to the technology? "Secret Weather Weapons
Can Kill Millions, Warns Top Russian Politician"; The Nation; 5/18/2011.
EXCERPT: . . . Zhirinovsky made reference to the recent tsunami in
Japan, suggesting that the "new weapons" to which he refers are related
to weather control technology, which has been intensely studied by both
the U.S. and Russia since the 1950′s and is commonly used today.
Threatening to annex Georgia completely, [Zhirinovsky
warned]{.underline}, "And then [there will be another
tsunami,]{.underline} [on the other side of the planet, in the
Caucasus."]{.underline} Zhirinovsky's reference to the Kuril Islands in
connection with the devastating tsunami that hit Japan in March is a not
so subtle suggestion that Russia had something to do with causing the
natural disaster that killed thousands, led to the Fukushima crisis and
threatened to derail Japan's economic recovery. [Zhirinovsky also warned
of a coming "third world war" emerging from the current turmoil in the
Middle East]{.underline} and North Africa [that would lead to the
collapse of current global institutions]{.underline} like the EU and the
WTO [and the rise of a new international order **led by
Russia**]{.underline}. . . . . . . However, [as the revelations of
weather modification expert Ben Livingston, a former Navy Physicist who
briefed President Lyndon B. Johnson]{.underline} on the effectiveness of
weather control back in the 1960′s during the Vietnam era, [have
documented]{.underline}, as far back as the early 1950′s [the United
States was funneling money into programs aimed at using the weather as a
weapon]{.underline} during the cold war. **[[It would be naive to think
that the Russians weren't engaged in]{.mark} similar
[research]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Moreover, in an April 1997 speech to
the University of Georgia, Athens, then [US Secretary of Defense William
Cohen spoke of the threat of an "eco-type of terrorism whereby [they can
**alter the climate**, **set off earthquakes**, **volcanoes
remotely**]{.mark} through the use of electromagnetic
waves."]{.underline} For many years, suspicions have circulated around
the purpose of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program
(HAARP), an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the US Air
Force, the US Navy, the University of Alaska and DARPA. In his
underground bestseller Angels Don't Play This HAARP, author Nick Begich
summarizes the evidence that suggests HAARP is involved in weather
control for nefarious purposes. [[Scientists at NASA have
discovered]{.mark} "[A close link between **electrical disturbances on
the edge of our atmosphere** and **impending quakes on the ground
below**]{.mark}]{.underline}," which has led to claims that earthquakes
are being artificially induced as a form of modern warfare by HAARP.
[[The technology]{.mark} to which Zhirinovsky refers [is **rapidly
moving out of the realms of science fiction**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[into scientific]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[fact]{.underline}]{.mark}** as we progress further into the 21st

#### Extinction

**Hill 13 \[Michael**, Professor and Chair of the Humanities @
SUNY-Albany. "Ecologies of War", eBook\]

In the mid-1970s, [the Soviet Union]{.underline}, who had its own long
standing ENMOD programs, [publicized]{.underline} previous [US
activities in Indochina]{.underline}. Since 1977, then, [the final
version of the treaty defines [ENMOD]{.mark} to [encompass:]{.mark} any
technique for changing---through **[the deliberate manipulation of
natural processes]{.mark}**---the dynamics,]{.underline} composition or
structure [of the earth, including the biota, lithosphere, hy -
drosphere, and atmosphere]{.underline}, or of outer space, so as to
cause effects such as earthquakes and tsunamis, an upset in the
ecological balance of a region, or changes in weather patterns (clouds,
precipitation, cyclones of various types and tornado storms), in the
state of the ozone layer or atmosphere, in cli - mate patterns or in
ocean currents. However, the conditions under which this treaty was
ratified, a ma - jor point of contention between the opposing Cold War
blocks, was the US insistence that "each State Party to the Convention
undertakes not to engage in military or any other hostile use of
environmental modifi - cation techniques having widespread, long-lasting
or severe effects as the means of destruction, damage or injury to
another State Party" (empha - sis mine). By attaching the definition of
"severe" to the time-space caveats of "widespread and long-lasting," the
DOD aligned US delegates to the UN introduced a provision that would
allow for a future deployment of environmental war. They managed to put
key loopholes around the most important variables in war: as we have
seen above in the context of emer - gent war technology, the control of
space and time. These variables be - gan to be re-introduced in a
serious way as recently as 1996. In a paper, collectively authored by 7
Air Force Officers, called "Weather as Force Multiplier: Owning the
Weather in 2025," the idea of "full spectrum con - flict" presents
weather manipulation as a "more important weapon than the \[atomic\]
bomb" (House 5). "Air Force 2025" measures hurricane energy in terms of
bomb capacity, noting that a worthwhile "tropical storm is equal 10,000
one megaton hydrogen bombs" \[House 18\]). The 45,000 lightning strikes
that hit the planet daily are said to contain "elec -
tro-potential\...with offensive military benefit" that might be induced
by "atmospherically buoyant\...microscopic" computer drones, designed to
seed the sky with the chemistry necessary for "aimed and timed lighten -
ing strikes" (House 27). [The connection between this version of
electro- potential and brain wave interface is not an immediate one,
since the lat - ter interface, insofar as it absorbs the human in the
war machine, is more akin to ENMOD by default]{.underline}. With
specific focus on the ionosphere (the atmospheric layer 1200 miles above
earth where radio waves are reflect - ed as a natural mirror), [AF
2025]{.underline} also [evokes the]{.underline} High-frequency Active
Auroral Research Program ([HAARP]{.underline}). Established in 1992 and
based in Gokona Alaska, [HAARP is an array of 180 tower
transmitters,]{.underline} 72 feet in height mounted on thermopiles
spaced 80 feet apart in a 12 by 15 rect - angular grid. 26 Put simply,
[HAARP is an ionospheric heater designed to excite low atmospheric
particles, the largest such machine ever built]{.underline}. 27 Thus
[ENMOD]{.underline} by design [is]{.underline} **[by no means off the
military table]{.underline}** (and note: the American Meteorological
Society now endorses an ENMOD approach to curb global warming), but it
is not as fully apparent in (pub - licly assessable) doctrinal
discussion in the way that ENMOD by default currently is
("Re-engineering" 7). [The time-and-space **caveats** attached to the
1977 UN [ENMOD]{.mark} convention have taken on unprecedented
significance]{.underline} given the current climate change reality,
which is no longer overtly dodged by the current US ruling apparatus
(military, govern - ment, corporate). Rather, [climate change is
embraced as a target enhancing operational environment,]{.underline} the
purest form of ENMOD by default. [This adaptation to,]{.underline}
indeed embracing of, **[planetary risk [makes military strategy]{.mark}
out of [a]{.mark} forgone conclusion of [anthropogenic climate
catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, anthropogenesis---a crucial
qualification---does not at all translate to the preservation of the
human being. Consistent with both military technology and national
security policy, [ENMOD]{.underline} by default [disintegrates the
efficacy as much of human will as of the human being]{.underline} as
such. [Humanity may appear to determine war in the aerial empire, but we
are by no means in control of the new dynamics of planetary
violence]{.underline}. [At 350 ppm, we are at---]{.underline}and are
surpassing---**[a level of "[dangerous anthropogenic
interference]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (DAI), with CO2 levels to approach
450 parts per million by 2012 (Kolber 42). 28 (China's toleration proves
higher, at 550 ppm and even 750 ppm.) [Ice caps are melting, sea levels
rising]{.underline}, faster than the conservative International Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) 262 Mike Hill predicted in 2007. At the current
pace of extinction more than half the earth's animal species will be
gone by the end of the century, and accord - ing to a 2009 MIT
Integrated Global Systems model, it will be too late to stem
eco-catastrophe much sooner than predicted. IPCC panel head Rejendra
Pachauri cites 2012, the expiration date of the US rebuked Kyo - to
Protocol, as the planet's next tipping-point (qtd. in Vanderheiden xi).
The same 2009 Strategic Studies Institute (SSI) document that we cited
by way of introducing drono-spheric SkyOps several moves above also
displaces the human-centered notion of ENMOD by deliberate design à la
Operation Popeye with a far more complicated (if not also suicidal)
strategy of ENMOD by default: adaptation to, as much as mobilization of,
the destructive power unleashed by coal-produced CO2 gases. Here the
term climate change moves the problem of ecology from the limited
context of anthropogenesis toward a more perversely expansive morpho -
genic realm of agitated particles, chance compounds, and aleatory
aggre - gates that are given human purpose only in the wake of this or
that event of mass crisis. [The ecology of war is seen here as a way of
fighting so- called cross-border wars that are not merely trans
-national]{.underline} (as across na - tional lines) [but]{.underline}
are [also]{.underline} [infranational]{.underline} (as within nations)
**[because war is phylogenic]{.underline}** now. [[Climate change
becomes an accelerant and a multiplier]{.mark} of military
force]{.underline} ( TSC 4) that eventually turns on its masters. We
have seen the mutation of space and acceleration of time as noted in the
SSI climate change materials already at work in brain-machine in -
terface technologies (BMI), and in the drono-sphere, examined above.
Here, recall, we found a set of innovative war applications that fused
ma - chinery and meat. Let's also emphasize that, given the blurriness
of con - temporary security doctrine and the twenty-first century war
machine, [we]{.underline} also [detected an elaborate data-driven war
analytic that no longer cares to divide war from peace, foe from friend,
risk from security]{.underline}, al - terity from homeland, state power
from civility, and so on and so forth [with the traditional divisions of
Western modernity]{.underline}. [The notion of climate change as a form
of tactical enhancement may also be applied to the way in
which]{.underline} fractals and [chaos]{.underline} [are being
considered with renewed pervasiveness in emergent military
systems]{.underline}. A 1996 Navel War College paper, "Chaos Theory: the
Essentials of Military Applications," provides a theoretical
foreshadowing of drone technology, using chaos analysis in a precisely
analogous way that De Landa's uses the term machinic phy - lum. In the
temporal sense, [chaos is defined]{.underline}, apropos James Gleick's
well- known work, as "behavior that is not periodic, \[but is\]
apparently random , where the system response is still recurrent (the
pendulum still swings back and forth) but no longer in a predictable way
" ( James 14; emphasis origi - nal). 29 By the chance synchronizing of
aleatory time signatures that both cut across and recombine biotic and
non-biotic strata (for example, cli - mate change and human beings),
[computer technology produces]{.underline} similar [mutations of
space]{.underline}. Like fractal media, chaos theory allows us to
identify " transitions between various dynamics, that are common to many
sys - tems" (14). But again these dynamics cannot be visualized in an
intelligi- bly useful way without the mathematical reading ability
brought about by electronic machine vision. Algorithms turn chaos into
otherwise invisi - ble new phylogenic lines. Consistent with fractal
media, the chance event is seized upon to coordinate unforeseen
alignments between unlike enti - ties, as drone vision produces a
probable calculus---Las Vegas style---of a virtual battlefield that we
cannot simply model in advance. "[Chaotic flow generates time intervals
with **no periodicity of apparent pattern**]{.underline}" (15), [which
is the operational equivalent of security predicated on **proximate and
perpetual war**]{.underline}. And most importantly for understanding the
relations of violence in the aerial imperium, [the intra-systemic
dynamics of chaos gain military application by modeling weapons on
climate at several lev - els. Climate change is conceived of in the
literal sense with ENMOD]{.underline} by design. In turn,
**[[ENMOD]{.mark} by default eventuates in a stage of war that
[transcends humanity's capacity to control]{.mark}]{.underline}** what
we might as well summarize as **[[an atmospheric army about to go
rogue]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Chaos theory seeks military benefit by
reorganizing war according to the asymmetrical systems of "weather
dynamics and clouds." And [on the order of the machinic phylum,
[twenty-first century war]{.mark} is [predicated on]{.mark} non-linear
similar turbu - lence events, **[wind patterns, storm systems,
lightening-bombs, ecological weapons, that are]{.mark}**]{.underline}
literally **[[tipped by mechanical "swarms]{.underline}]{.mark}** where
battle - fields are filled with new clouds that carry lethal
capabilities" ( James 79). [[Climate change]{.mark} is a
new]{.underline}---[and [will become the
predominant]{.mark}]{.underline}[---**[means of
waging]{.underline}**]{.mark} if not also of modeling **[[war. The
atmosphere has now become a weapon]{.mark} both by design]{.underline}**
and by default. And [to]{.underline} the same extent, related
technologies such as BCI and fractal media efface and **[reabsorb the
human being]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline}
effacement/[reabsorption]{.underline} [happens]{.underline}, in the
first instance, [as]{.underline} [the war machine has wedged a new
machinic phylum across carbon- and non-carbon based life
forms]{.underline}; secondly, and more dramatically, this process of
effacement/[absorption happens in the sense that [humanity has **stacked
the odds against its long-term survival**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
victory for this or that side of the global human population is no
longer a presumptive goal in the context of an aerial imperium. As
mentioned above once be - fore, [there are 50 million environmental
refugees]{.underline} in 2010, and according to UN estimates there will
be more than 200 million by 2050, marking an epoch of population culling
if not also a set of re-divisions within the human species (Glenn and
Gordon 2). [In the **eco-suicidal**]{.underline}
**[register]{.underline}** that is coterminous with ENMOD by default,
[[humanity]{.underline}]{.mark} itself [[becomes]{.underline}]{.mark} a
side, **[[a losing side, within a meshwork of trans-biotic
agency]{.underline}]{.mark}** that wins by en - veloping its human
other. Rather than being apparent as a category that might be divisible
into simply national oppositions, so-called [transna - tional war means
that the human being is becoming **barely traceable as a fading
bio-political ideal**]{.underline}. With the 1925 Geneva protocols
against chemi - cal warfare in mind, the International Committee of the
Red Cross "urges \[us\] to\...remember our common humanity"
(International Committee of the Red Cross 3). **[Within the aerial
empire, [remembering humanity may be all we are going to
have]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

### Kinetic Weapons\-\--2NC

#### Otherwise, they'll develop military [future tech]{.underline} -- specifically, [kinetic energy]{.underline} weapons

**RBTH 16** \[Russia's Armed Forces put prototype laser weapons in

[[Russian specialists developing a weapon based on **new physical
principles**]{.underline}]{.mark} [The first prototype laser weapons
have been made]{.underline} operational with Russia's Armed Forces,
Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov said. Borisov made this
statement on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Russian Federal
Nuclear Center - All-Russian Research Institute of Experimental Physics
(RFNC-VNIIEF). \"This is not something unusual. [These are
prototype]{.underline} rather than experimental [weapons. We have
already put several laser weapons into operation]{.underline},\" Borisov
said, adding that [weapons based on **new physical principles** were
**[becoming a reality]{.mark}** in our days]{.underline}. As Borisov
said earlier, [the development of a weapon based on new physical
principles]{.underline} should be [[**included** in the **new state
armament program** for]{.underline}]{.mark}
2018-[[2025]{.underline}]{.mark}. [As a source in Russia's defense and
industrial sector told]{.underline} TASS, Russian [[specialists]{.mark}
developing a weapon based on new physical principles [are aware of the
work on a **directed energy**]{.mark} **[weapon]{.mark}**]{.underline},
which is being carried out abroad. According to the source, [[the main
weapons]{.mark} based on new physical principles]{.underline}
[[included]{.underline}]{.mark} laser, acoustic, holographic and
**[[kinetic weapons.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Extinction

Planetary K.E. Munitions. [[The]{.mark} current [**title-holder in pure
destructive force** is]{.mark} the planetary **[K.E.
munition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Consisting of a large rock (typically
tens of cubic km of rock) with a full Shield drive, these weapons are
expensive. However, [[for]{.underline} [a typical large
asteroid]{.underline}]{.mark} (160 km^3^) [at 0.5c]{.underline} (the
limit of a standard Shield drive), [[the impact energy
is]{.underline}]{.mark} [42,464x10^12^ tons of TNT]{.underline}. This is
[[more than 10 million times the destructive potential of the

planetary munition [will exterminate entire continents. The]{.mark}

There is no report of any of these ever being deployed.

### AT: War Doesn't Solve Impacts

#### Russia will surrender

**Martel 81** \[William, DPhil, UMass Political Science, "A nuclear
war-fighting strategy for the United States",
<https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2900&context=dissertations_1>\]

In the second model, [[surrender occurs when a nation ceases to fight
**after the war has begun**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In contrast to the
first option in which the United States would surrender before beginning
a futile nuclear war, [in this case it would surrender **[after a
nuclear exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The criteria]{.mark} for this
decision rests on the costs of the first exchange]{.underline}: **[[U.S.
versus Soviet losses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[the size of U.S. and
Soviet reserve forces]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and]{.underline} **[the
relative standing]{.underline}** [of the United States]{.underline}.
Thus, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[pressure to
surrender]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[could be
**irresistible**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[if a nation sees itself in a
**losing position**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although surrender is not as
\"overt\" as passing the sword from the defeated to the victorious
general, unilateral cessation of hostilities by the United States is
symbolic, especially if the Soviet Union sustains less casualties. In
summary, [nuclear war is limited if the]{.underline} United States or
the [Soviet Union terminates hostilities before its nuclear arsenal is
depleted.]{.underline} **[This is]{.underline}**, therefore, **[the
definition of limited nuclear war]{.underline}**.

#### Escalation dominance proves

**Wirtz 14** \[James J., Dean of the School of International Graduate
Studies at the US Naval Postgraduate School, and Director of the Global
Center for Security Cooperation for the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency, April 2, 2014, Limited Nuclear War Reconsidered," On Limited
Nuclear War in the 21st Century, Stanford University Press\]

[In the event of a failure of deterrence---if nuclear first use by an
opponent appears imminent or has already occurred---[the need for war
**termination**]{.mark}]{.underline} on grounds favorable to US
interests [[will become **painfully apparent**]{.underline}]{.mark} to
US policymakers. [Under these circumstances, the goal of disarming the
opponent using **minimal amounts**]{.underline} [of nuclear
firepower]{.underline} in an effort to limit collateral damage [will
appear]{.underline} as a [desirable]{.underline} strategy. In other
words, a denial strategy that relies on a mix of conventional
precision-strike weapons, missile defenses, and low-yield nuclear
weapons should appear even more credible to an opponent during a crisis
or the early stages of a nuclear war, as circumstances increase the
incentives for US policymakers to actually execute deterrent threats. At
the same time, [[the ability of the United States to inflict
**catastrophic levels of death and destruction**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[in a **massive** nuclear attack creates a **further incentive** for an
opponent to **terminate** ]{.mark}**a nuclear conflict
[quickly]{.mark}** [rather than suffer]{.mark} **existential
[retaliation]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} US [escalation dominance creates an
incentive for the opponent **not to unleash its remaining
weapons**]{.mark} **in some spasmodic attack**, while conventional and
possibly nuclear counterforce attacks quickly degrade its remaining
capabilities.]{.underline}

#### Russia without nukes couldn't compete with us on [anything]{.underline}

**Weitz 18** \[Richard, Director, Center for Political-Military Analysis
@ Hudson, "Exploiting Sino-Russian Nuclear Divergence," Hudson,
<https://www.hudson.org/research/14601-exploiting-sino-russian-nuclear-divergence>\]

Several possible reasons explain these contrasting responses. First,
[[Russian leaders are preoccupied with nuclear]{.mark} capabilities
because [Moscow **relies on them to maintain great power
status**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[Without nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[Russians]{.mark} rightly [fear their
country would become a **regional power** of **limited**]{.mark}
**international [influence]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- the dread of
Russian strategists.

#### They wouldn't even be a [sovereign state]{.underline}

**Couretas 9** \[John, "Patriarch Kirill: Russia needs nuclear weapons",
<http://www.aoiusa.org/patriarch-kirill-russia-needs-nuclear-weapons>\]

The head of Russia's Orthodox Church said on Friday that Russia needed
nuclear weapons. [Speaking in the Volga Region town of
Sarov]{.underline}, Patriarch [[Kirill of Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}
and All Russia [[said]{.mark} that]{.underline} while the Church was in
favor of "a world without weapons," **[[Russia required nuclear
arms]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to ensure that it was able to "**remain a
sovereign state**]{.mark}." Sarov is the center of Russia's nuclear
weapon industry]{.underline} and closed to foreigners. Speaking before
several thousand young people, the patriarch said "the reason for war is
sin and evil in man's heart," and that peace can only be guaranteed by
"fighting against sin." "[[You can have excellently developed systems of
international law]{.underline}]{.mark}, [international organizations,
**[but fall into the abyss of war]{.mark}**]{.underline}," he added.

#### A nuclear war would prevent future tech development

**Caldwell 3** \[Joseph G. Caldwell, 2003, Economic Growth Supervisor
with a PhD in Mathematical Statistics, "The End of the World, and the
New World Order,"
<http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.693.9552&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf>\]

[[Of the anthropogenic factors that might reduce mankind's destruction
of the biosphere]{.mark} -- famine, plague, and war -- [it appears that
**famine and plague would have little effec**]{.mark}**t** on stopping
the mass species extinction.]{.underline} [[They may cause a **temporary
reduction** in human numbers, but the population would
**rebound**,]{.mark} and high levels of industrial production would
continue, and damage to the biosphere would continue.]{.underline} The
industrial nations of the world, which account for most of the global
energy use, would likely continue in numbers and in industrial activity
pretty much as before. These eventualities would do little to stop the
destruction of the biosphere and the mass species extinction. Bu[t
**[war is different]{.mark}**. The main difference is not [that it may
reduce human numbers faster]{.mark} or to a greater degree than famine
or plague, [but]{.mark} [that it can cause a **catastrophic decrease**
in]{.mark} the level of [industrial production, which is the major cause
of environmental destruction]{.mark}. Also, it can occur at any time --
it does not have to wait until fossil fuels run out, after many more
species have been destroyed. [It can]{.mark} occur tomorrow, and
[prevent the species loss that would otherwise occur]{.mark} over the
last half century of the petroleum age.]{.underline} By reducing
industrial activity by a large amount, it could reduce the current
horrific rate of consumption of fossil fuels, [**[leaving some for many
future generations]{.mark}** to take advantage]{.underline} of -- to use
for mankind's benefit, rather than for a few generations' mindless
pleasure. (Of course, economics does not distinguish between production
spent on war 7 or video games or tourism or religion or art or
philosophy, and the discounted "present value" of things in the far
distant future is negligible, so this argument is of little consequence
in today's world.) And the likelihood of its occurrence is increasing
fast.

#### Every empirical example of effective arms control followed a nuclear crisis

**Fuhrmann 16** \[Matthew, associate professor of political science at
Texas A&M University, November 2016, "After Armageddon: Pondering the
Potential Political Consequences of Third Use," Should We Let the Bomb
Spread?," edited by Henry D. Sokolski, United States Army War College
Press, <http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1021744.pdf>\]

The discussion in this section so far assumes that the third use of
nuclear weapons would negatively affect the nonproliferation regime. It
is also possible, and somewhat paradoxical, that [[nuclear use would
result in a **stronger regime**]{.underline}. [The international
community]{.underline}]{.mark} [often [reacts to disasters by
instituting **sweeping reforms**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Most of the
major improvements to the nonproliferation regime since 1970 resulted
from **crises of confidence** in existing measures. [India's nuclear
test]{.mark}]{.underline} in 1974 [[led to]{.mark} the creation of
the]{.underline} Nuclear Suppliers Group
(**[[NSG]{.underline}]{.mark}**), a cartel designed to regulate trade in
nuclear technology and materials. [[Iraq's violations of the NPT]{.mark}
prior to the 1991 Persian Gulf War [caused]{.mark} the international
community to give the]{.underline} International Atomic Energy Agency
(**[[IAEA]{.underline}]{.mark}**), the main enforcer of the NPT, [more
teeth through the 1997 Additional Protocol. In addition, the
international community sought to strengthen global export controls by
passing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 after the public
exposure of the A. Q. Khan network, a Pakistani-based operation that
supplied nuclear weapon-related technology to Iran, Libya, and North
Korea. As these examples illustrate, **[sweeping reforms are sometimes
possible in a time of crisis]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [The third use of
nuclear weapons would no doubt be horrific. It might, therefore, create
a **broad international consensus to strengthen nonproliferation
norms**]{.underline} [in an attempt to lower the odds that the bomb
would be used a fourth time]{.underline}. This does not imply that the
third use of nuclear weapons would be a good thing. The negative
consequences would outweigh any marginal improvement in the
nonproliferation regime resulting from nuclear use.

#### Movements will [literally overthrow recalcitrant governments]{.underline}. Nuclear use makes the audience costs [huge]{.underline}

**David 18** \[David, Professor of Political Science at Johns Hopkins
University, 2018, "The Nuclear Worlds of 2030," Fletcher Forum of World
Affairs, vol. 42, pp. 107--118\]

CATASTROPHE AND THE END OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS In the year 2025, the world
very nearly came to an end. Smarting after several years of economic
downturn and angry at American efforts to encircle it with NATO bases,
Russia responded to a \"plea\" for help from co-ethnics in the Baltic
states. Thousands of Russian troops, disguised as contract
\"volunteers\" dashed across international borders allegedly to protect
Russian speakers from governmental assaults. The Baltic countries
invoked Article 5 of the NATO Treaty while American forces, deployed
there precisely to deter this kind of aggression, clashed with Russian
troops. Hundreds of Americans were killed. Washington warned Moscow to
halt its invasion to no avail. The United States then prepared for a
major airlift of its forces to the beleaguered countries, with Moscow
threatening America with \"unrestrained force\" if it followed through.
Washington ignored the threat and Moscow, seeking to \"de-escalate by
escalating,\" destroyed the American base of Diego Garcia in the Indian
Ocean with a nuclear-armed cruise missile. The United States responded
with **[[limited nuclear strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}** against Russian
bases in Siberia. Thus far, the collateral damage had been kept to a
minimum, but this bit of encouragement did not last. Fearing a massive
American pre-emptive strike aimed at disarming its nuclear arsenal,
**[Russia]{.underline}** struck first [against the]{.underline} range of
**[US]{.underline}** nuclear forces both in the United States and at
sea. America responded with its surviving weapons,
[destroying]{.underline} much (but not all) of the
**[remaining]{.underline}** Russian **[nuclear arms]{.underline}**. And
then, both sides took a breather, but it was too late. [Although
**cities**]{.underline} [had been largely spared,
**millions**]{.underline} had **[died]{.underline}** [on each
side]{.underline}. Making matters worse, predictions of nuclear winter
came to pass - producing massive changes in the weather and killing
millions more, especially in developing states. The world finally had
enough. [[A dawning realization **emerged** that leaders]{.mark} of
countries [simply **could not be trusted** with weapons that could
destroy humankind]{.mark}]{.underline}[.3 **[Protests
swept]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the globe [calling for total
disarmament]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Mass]{.underline}
[**[demonstrations]{.underline}** [engulfed the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[and]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}** [[demanding the **replacement
of their existing governments**]{.underline}]{.mark} [with ones
**committed to ending nuclear weapons.**]{.underline} [Voices calling
for more moderate disarmament that would preserve a modest nuclear
deterrent were angrily (and sometimes violently) quashed. The
[possession of nuclear weapons became **morally
repugnant**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[unacceptable]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** [No longer
were the]{.underline} **[intricacies]{.underline}** [of nuclear doctrine
or force levels subject to debate. The only question remaining was **how
one could get rid of these loathsome weapons as quickly as
possible**]{.underline}. Under the auspices of the United Nations, a
joint committee composed of the Security Council members, other
countries known to possess nuclear arms, and several non-nuclear powers
was established. Drawing on the structure and precedent of the Chemical
Weapons Convention, this UN body drew up the Treaty that called for the
complete disarmament of nuclear arms by 2030. The development,
possession, and use of nuclear weapons was prohibited. [[An airtight
inspection regime, enhancing]{.mark} the [procedures]{.mark} already [in
existence through the Non-Proliferation Treaty]{.mark}, was established
to first account for **all nuclear arms and fissile
material**]{.underline} [and then]{.underline} **[monitor]{.underline}**
the **[destruction]{.underline}** of the nuclear weaponry. [All
countries were subject to the Treaty, whether they maintained nuclear
facilities or not. Violations would produce a range of punishment from
global economic sanctions to]{.underline} **[massive conventional
attack]{.underline}**.\' 6 [[By 2030, all the nations of the world had
agreed to the Treaty. No violations occurred]{.mark}. Armed conflicts
persisted, but]{.underline} they [proved to be of]{.underline} **[modest
scale]{.underline}**, erupting only within countries but not between
them. [Insofar as the fear of nuclear weapons helped keep the peace
during the Cold War and post-Cold War eras, the]{.underline}
**[horror]{.underline}** [of nuclear use now made war]{.underline}
**[all but unthinkable]{.underline}**. [A feeling of]{.underline}
**[relief]{.underline}** [swept the globe as the specter]{.underline} of
nuclear holocaust [vanished]{.underline}, tempered only by the painful
regret that it took the death of millions to realize a goal that for so
many had been self-evident since 1945.

## US Wins/Defense

### US Wins\-\--2NC

#### Biden would strike first.

Sara **Sirota 04-11**-22 \[Sara Sirota is a Politics Reporter at The
Intercept. She was previously an Air Force reporter at Inside Defense,
The Intercept, "Biden's Nuclear Strike Policy is the Same as Russia's,"
https://theintercept.com/2022/04/11/nuclear-weapons-biden-russia-strike-policy///ZW\]

DURING HIS CAMPAIGN for president, Joe [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}
penned an article in Foreign Affairs titled "Why America Must Lead
Again." In it, he [laid out his thoughts on the most dangerous arms in
the U.S. stockpile]{.underline}. "I believe that the sole [purpose of
the U.S. nuclear arsenal should be
deterring]{.underline}---[and]{.underline}, if necessary, [retaliating
against---a nuclear attack]{.underline}," the then-candidate wrote. "As
president, [I will work to put that belief into practice]{.underline},
in consultation with the U.S. military and U.S. allies." The declaration
gave arms control advocates hope that the president would adopt a
no-first-use policy --- meaning that the U.S. would commit to never
initiating a nuclear conflict. [Current [policy allows the president to
strike first]{.mark} in an extreme circumstance]{.underline}, like in
response to a devastating chemical attack, which can lower the threshold
for nuclear war to break out. But now, at a time when the world is
closer to a nuclear exchange than ever, thanks to Russian President
Vladimir Putin's devastating war against Ukraine, Biden has gone back on
his word. On March 29, the White House released a short summary of
[Biden's]{.underline} upcoming [strategy]{.underline} on nuclear forces
indicating his decision: "[The United States [would]{.mark} only
[consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend
the vital interests of the United States]{.mark} or its allies and
partners]{.underline}." This [effectively makes the U.S. stance on
nuclear employment indistinguishable from Russia's]{.underline}.
According to its military doctrine, [Russia may use a nuclear weapon if
it faces an "existential" threat]{.underline} --- a fact of which Putin
has reminded observers around the world in recent weeks as he pummels
Ukraine. Biden's decision to keep U.S. policy so similar to Russia's
amounts to a missed opportunity to build an international coalition
against nuclear conflict, disarmament advocates say. Sen. Ed Markey,
D-Mass., co-chair of the Nuclear Weapon and Arms Control Working Group,
took to the Senate floor on March 31 to indict the policy:
"Unfortunately, our American democracy and Russia's autocracy do share
one major thing in common: Both our systems give the United States and
Russian presidents the godlike powers known as sole authority to end
life on the planet as we know it by ordering a nuclear first strike."
According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported [[Biden's
decision to maintain first-strike authority on March
25]{.underline}]{.mark}, the president faced pressure from allies to
renege on his campaign pledge. He met with European partners late last
month amid apparent concerns that Russia may use a nuclear or chemical
weapon as part of its war against Ukraine. (NBC reported last week that
three U.S. officials admitted there is no evidence that Russia brought
chemical weapons near Ukraine.) Tom Collina, policy director at the
nuclear arms control group Ploughshares Fund, argued that rolling back
the strike authority could have benefited international efforts against
Russia. "Putin is threatening the first use of nuclear weapons to hold
Ukraine hostage and keep the US and NATO out," he wrote to The
Intercept. "This is nuclear blackmail, and its a dangerous precedent
that we must oppose. Its therefore deeply disappointing that the Biden
administration just missed a key opportunity to reject first use.
Instead, Biden's policy also allows first use and is essentially the
same as Russia's, and this undermines Biden's ability to build
international opposition to what Putin is doing." That may be the case
for lawmakers of at least one ally. On April 1, dozens of members of the
Progressive Caucus of Japan, a minority coalition to the left of the
conservative Liberal Democratic Party fronted by Japanese Prime Minister
Fumio Kishida, joined American lawmakers in the Congressional
Progressive Caucus to call on Biden to commit to a no-first-use policy.
"A U.S. declaration stating that it would never start a nuclear war,
supported by Japan, would breathe new life into international efforts to
reduce and eventually eliminate the danger of nuclear war," the letter,
led by CPC Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said. The lawmakers cited the
importance of such a policy as tensions between the U.S. and China, also
a nuclear power, continue to worsen. (China owns significantly fewer
nuclear weapons than the U.S. or Russia, but the Defense Department says
it's engaging in a buildup.) Other [Democrats have]{.underline} remained
quiet or indicated [tacit support of the status quo]{.underline}.
Republicans took advantage of a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing
with the head of U.S. Strategic Command, Adm. Charles Richard, last
month to defend the logic of first-strike authority. When Richard said
that [[changes to declaratory policy would harm relationships with
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, the panel's chair, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I.,
did not question the argument, and no other Democrats broached the
subject. Despite the dangers that nuclear weapons pose, Democrats are
allowing their fear of appearing weak amid Russia's war on Ukraine to
triumph over meaningful reform that could make the world safer. "I'm
certainly in favor of making it clear that the United States is not
going to be the first to use nuclear weapons," Sen. Chris Murphy,
D-Conn., told The Intercept. "I'd have to think a little bit more about
whether this is the right time or what the mechanism would be to make
that policy." He downplayed the idea, though, that the U.S.'s strike
policy is indistinguishable from Russia's: "Russia's policy is whatever
is in Vladimir Putin's head at the moment." While maintaining
first-strike authority, Biden's nuclear policy is slated to roll back
certain nuclear weapon programs started under the Trump administration.
According to the Wall Street Journal, he's planning to get rid of the
B83 gravity bomb, the largest in the U.S. nuclear stockpile, which was
on track for retirement until the previous White House decided to keep
it around. Biden's also planning to get rid of a nuclear-armed,
sea-launched cruise missile that the Trump administration had
greenlighted. "If media reports are true, President Biden has missed an
historic opportunity to reduce the role of existential nuclear weapons
in U.S. military strategy." [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} has, however,
reportedly decided to stick with the Trump administration's plan to
[[deploy the "low-yield"]{.mark} W76-2 [warhead on nuclear
submarines]{.mark}]{.underline}. This class of weapons has [[lower
explosive power compared with the most destructive nuclear
weapons,]{.underline}]{.mark} like intercontinental ballistic missiles,
potentially lowering the threshold for nuclear war. Russia notoriously
has more low-yield nuclear weapons than the U.S., which has raised
concerns about their potential use in the war against Ukraine,
especially if Putin believes that he has no other way to defeat the
resistance. Murphy called for the U.S. to take action to prevent their
proliferation worldwide. "I think it's time for us to lead a global
conversation around the proliferation of these smaller tactical nuclear
weapons, because they will ultimately allow a madman to justify using it
and believing they can ultimately get away with it," he said. In the
meantime, Biden has foregone his primary chance to rally allies around
the push for a no-first-use policy. "If media reports are true,
President Biden has missed an historic opportunity to reduce the role of
existential nuclear weapons in U.S. military strategy," said Markey in a
statement following the Wall Street Journal report. "Retaining a
warfighting role for U.S. nuclear weapons is a triumph for the
trillion-dollar defense industry, but it is a tragedy for everyone
counting on the President to keep his campaign promise to make
deterrence the sole purpose of nuclear weapons."

[The US nuclear forces modernization program]{.underline} has been
portrayed to the public as an effort to ensure the reliability and
safety of warheads in the US nuclear arsenal, rather than to enhance
their military capabilities. In reality, however, that program [has
implemented **revolutionary new technologies**]{.underline} [that will
**vastly increase** the **targeting capability** of the US ballistic
missile arsenal]{.underline}. [This increase in capability is
astonishing]{.underline}---[boosting the overall killing power of
existing US ballistic missile forces by a **factor of roughly
three**]{.underline}---[and it creates exactly what one would expect to
see,]{.underline} [if a nuclear-armed state were planning to have the
capacity to fight and win a nuclear war by **disarming enemies with a
surprise first strike**. [Because of improvements in the **killing power
of US**]{.mark} **submarine-launched ballistic
[missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [those [submarines now patrol
with]{.mark} more than [**three times** the number of warheads needed
to]{.mark} [destroy **the entire fleet of Russian**]{.mark} **land-based
[missiles]{.mark} in their silos**.]{.underline} [US submarine-based
missiles can carry multiple warheads, so hundreds of others, now in
storage, could be added to the submarine-based missile
force]{.underline}, [**making it all the more lethal.** The
revolutionary increase in the lethality of submarine-borne US nuclear
forces comes from [a "**super-fuze" device**]{.mark} that since 2009
[has been incorporated]{.mark} into the Navy's W76]{.underline}-1/Mk4A
[warhead]{.underline} as part of a decade-long life-extension program.
[We estimate that **all warheads deployed on US ballistic missile
submarines** now have this fuzing capability]{.underline}. Because the
innovations in the super-fuze appear, to the non-technical eye, to be
minor, [**[policymakers]{.mark}** outside of the US
government]{.underline} (and probably inside the government as well)
**[have completely [missed its revolutionary
impact]{.mark}]{.underline}** [on military capabilities and its
important implications for global security.]{.underline} Before the
invention of this new fuzing mechanism, even the most accurate ballistic
missile warheads might not detonate close enough to targets hardened
against nuclear attack to destroy them. But [the new super-fuze is
designed to destroy fixed targets by detonating above and around a
target in a **much more effective way**]{.underline}. [Warheads that
would otherwise overfly a target and land too far away will now, because
of the new fuzing system, **detonate above the target.**]{.underline}
FIGURE 1. The deployment of the new MC4700 arming, fuzing, and firing
system on the W76-1/Mk4A significantly increases the number of hard
target kill-capable warheads on US ballistic missile submarines. [[The
result]{.mark} of this fuzing scheme is [a **significant increase in the
probability that a warhead will explode close enough**]{.mark} to
destroy the target even though the accuracy of the missile-warhead
system has itself not improved. As a consequence]{.underline}, **[the US
submarine force]{.underline}** [today is much more capable than it was
previously against hardened targets such as **Russian ICBM
silos**]{.underline}. [A decade ago, only about 20 percent of US
submarine warheads had hard-target kill capability]{.underline};
**[today they all do]{.underline}**. (See Figure 1.) [This vast increase
in US nuclear targeting capability]{.underline}, which has largely been
concealed from the general public, [has serious implications for
strategic stability and perceptions of US nuclear strategy and
intentions.]{.underline} Russian planners will almost surely see the
advance in fuzing capability as empowering an increasingly feasible US
preemptive nuclear strike capability---a capability that would require
Russia to undertake countermeasures that would further increase the
already dangerously high readiness of Russian nuclear forces. Tense
nuclear postures based on worst-case planning assumptions already pose
the possibility of a nuclear response to false warning of attack. The
new kill capability created by super-fuzing increases the tension and
the risk that US or Russian nuclear forces will be used in response to
early warning of an attack---even when an attack has not occurred. The
increased capability of the US submarine force will likely be seen as
even more threatening because [[Russia]{.underline} **[does not
have]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a functioning space-based [infrared early
warning system]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[but relies primarily on
**ground-based**]{.mark} **early warning [radars]{.mark}** to detect a
US missile attack]{.underline}. [Since these radars cannot see over the
horizon]{.underline}, **[[Russia has less than half as much
early-warning time as the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}**. (The
United States has about 30 minutes, Russia 15 minutes or less.) The
inability of Russia to globally monitor missile launches from space
means that [Russian military and political leaders would have **no
"situational awareness"**]{.underline} [to help them assess whether an
early-warning radar indication of a surprise attack is real or the
result of a technical error.]{.underline} The combination of this lack
of Russian situational awareness, dangerously short warning times,
high-readiness alert postures, and the increasing US strike capacity has
created a deeply destabilizing and dangerous strategic nuclear
situation. When viewed in the alarming context of deteriorating
political relations between Russia and the West, and the threats and
counter-threats that are now becoming the norm for both sides in this
evolving standoff, it may well be that the danger of an accident leading
to nuclear war is as high now as it was in periods of peak crisis during
the Cold War. How the new accuracy-enhancing fuze works. The significant
increase in the ability of the W76-1/Mk4A warhead to destroy hardened
targets---including Russian silo-based ICBMs---derives from a simple
physical fact: Explosions that occur near and above the ground over a
target can be lethal to it. This above-target area is known as a "lethal
volume"; the detonation of a warhead of appropriate yield in this volume
will result in the destruction of the target. The recognition that the
killing power of the W76 warhead could be vastly increased by equipping
it with a new fuze was discussed in a 1994 alternate warhead study
conducted by the Defense and Energy departments. The study calculated
the number of warheads that would be needed for the W76 to attack the
Russian target base, if START II were implemented. At the time, W76/Mk4
warheads had a fixed height-of-burst fuze (meaning the fuze could not
adjust its detonation at an optimal location if it were falling short or
long of a target). With those fixed-height fuzes, submarine-launched
nuclear missiles were mainly aimed at softer targets such as military
bases. But the study found that an enhanced Mk4A reentry-body with a new
fuze that provided for an adjustable height-of-burst as it arrives would
have significant capabilities against harder targets, compared to
warheads with the earlier fuzes. The study assumed that a smaller number
of Mk4 nuclear warheads with higher killing power per warhead could
cover the Russian target base and be more effective than multiple
attacks on targets with less destructive warheads. In other words, an
enhanced fuze would allow the United States to reduce the number of
warheads on its ballistic missile submarines, but increase the targeting
effectiveness of the fleet. Figure 2 illustrates the kill distribution
of US submarine-launched nuclear missiles equipped with the earlier,
fixed height-of-burst fuzes. The dome-shaped volume outlined in gray
shows the lethal volume within which a 100-kiloton nuclear explosion
will generate 10,000 pounds per square inch or more of blast pressure on
the ground. In other words, if a target on the ground cannot survive a
blast of 10,000 pounds per square inch or more, it will be destroyed if
a 100-kt nuclear weapon detonates anywhere within that dome-shaped
volume. To show the physical relationship of the lethal volume for a
particular ground target of interest---in this case a Russian SS-18 ICBM
silo---Figure 2 was drawn to scale. Also shown to scale is the
approximate spread of warhead trajectories that correspond to a missile
that is accurate to 100 meters, a miss distance roughly the same as what
is achieved by the Trident II sea-launched ballistic missile. Miss
distances are typically characterized in terms of a quantity called the
"circular error probable," or CEP, which is defined as the radius of a
circle around the aim point within which half of the warheads aimed at a
target are expected to impact. In the case of a Trident II 100-kt W76-1
ballistic missile warhead, the lethal distance on the ground and the CEP
are roughly equal. As a result, roughly half of the warheads equipped
with the old, fixed-height fuze system could be expected to fall close
enough to detonate on the ground within the lethal range. The new
super-fuze for W76-1/Mk4A has a flexible height-of-burst capability that
enables it to detonate at any height within the lethal volume over a
target. Figure 3 shows how the new fuze vastly increases the chances
that the target will be destroyed, even though the arriving warheads
have essentially the same ballistic accuracy. The super-fuze is designed
to measure its altitude well before it arrives near the target and while
it is still outside the atmosphere. This measurement would typically be
taken at an altitude of 60 to 80 kilometers, where the effects of
atmospheric drag are very small. At this point, the intended trajectory
is known to very high precision before the warhead begins to
substantially slow from atmospheric drag. If the warhead altitude
measured by the super-fuze at that time were exactly equal to the
altitude expected for the intended trajectory, the warhead would be
exactly on target. But if the altitude were higher than expected, the
warhead could be expected to hit beyond the intended aim point.
Likewise, if the altitude is lower than that expected, the warhead would
likely hit short of the intended aim point. Testing has established the
statistical shape and orientation of the expected spread of warhead
locations as they fly towards the target. In the case of Trident II, the
spread of trajectories around the intended trajectory is so small that
the best way to increase the chances of detonating inside the lethal
volume is to intentionally shift the aim point slightly beyond the
location of the target. (Note that the intended trajectory in Figure 3
is shifted slightly down range.) By shifting the aim point down range by
a distance roughly equal to a CEP, warheads that would otherwise fall
short or long of the target using the conventional Mk4 fuze instead will
detonate---at different heights dictated by the super fuze---within the
lethal volume above a target. This shift in the down-range aim point
will result in a very high percentage of warheads that overfly the
target detonating in the lethal volume. The end result is that with the
new Mk4A super-fuze, a substantially higher percentage of launched
warheads detonate inside the lethal volume, resulting in a considerable
increase in the likelihood that the target is destroyed. The ultimate
effect of the super fuze's flexible burst-height capability is a
significantly increased target kill probability of the new W76-1/Mk4A
warhead compared with the conventional warhead of the same type. Figure
4 shows the probability that warheads will detonate close enough to
destroy the ground-target for both the conventional fuze and the
super-fuze. As can be seen from figure 4, the probability of kill using
a submarine-launched warhead with the new super-fuze (W76-1/Mk4A) is
about 0.86. This 86 percent probability is very close to what could be
achieved using three warheads with conventional fuzes to attack the same
target. To put it differently: In the case of the 100-kt Trident II
warhead, the super fuze triples the killing power of the nuclear force
it has been applied to. [Many Russian targets are **not** hardened to
10,000 pounds per square inch blast overpressure]{.underline}. [[Figure
5 shows the]{.mark} same [probability of kill curves for]{.mark} the
case of [a target that is]{.mark} only [hard to 2,000 pounds]{.mark} per
square inch or more of blast overpressure]{.underline}, **[which is [the
actual case for almost all targets]{.mark} hardened to nuclear
attack]{.underline}**---[ICBMs and supporting command posts, hardened
structures at strategic airbases, submarines at pierside or in protected
tunnels, hardened command posts at road mobile missile bases and
elsewhere, etc. In this case]{.underline}, **[[the super-fuze achieves a
probability of kill of about 0.99]{.mark}---or very [near
certainty]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This case also is equivalent to
achieving a probability of kill associated with using three warheads
with a 0.83 probability to achieve a 0.99 probability of kill. The
probability of kills revealed by figures 4 and 5 have enormous security
ramifications. [[The US military **assumes**]{.mark} that Russian SS-18
and [TOPOL missile silos are **hardened** to withstand]{.mark} a
pressure of [10,000 pounds]{.mark} per square inch or more]{.underline}.
[Since with the new super-fuze]{.underline}, **[[the probability of kill
against these silos is]{.mark} near [0.9]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [the
entire force of 100-kt W76-1/Mk4A Trident II warheads now **"qualifies"
for use** against the hardest of Russian silos]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline}, in turn, [means that essentially all of the
higher-yield nuclear weapons (such as the W88/Mk5) that were formerly
assigned to these Russian hard targets **can now be focused on other,
more demanding missions,**]{.underline} [including attacks against
**deeply-buried underground command facilities.**]{.underline} [In
effect, the significant increase in the killing power of the W76 warhead
allows the United States to use its submarine-based weapons **more
decisively** in a **wider range of missions** than was the case before
the introduction of this fuze.]{.underline} The history of the US
super-fuze program. The super-fuze is officially known as the arming,
fuzing and firing (AF&F) system. It consists of a fuze, an arming
subsystem (which includes the radar), a firing subsystem, and a thermal
battery that powers the system. The AF&F is located in the tip of the
cone-shaped reentry body above the nuclear explosive package itself. The
AF&F developed for the new W76-1/Mk4A is known as MC4700 and forms part
of the W76 life-extension program intended to extend the service life of
the W76---the most numerous warhead in the US stockpile---out to the
time period 2040-2050. The new super-fuze uses a technology first
deployed on the high-yield W88/Mk5 Trident II warhead. The Navy's
Strategic Systems Program contracted with the Lockheed Missile and Space
Corporation in the early 1980s to develop a new fuze that included "a
radar-updated, path-length compensating fuze ... that could adjust for
trajectory errors and significantly improve the ability to destroy a
target. This was an early and sophisticated use of artificial
intelligence in a weapon." It was the radar-updated, path-length
compensating fuze---combined with the increased accuracy of the Trident
II missile---that gave an SLBM the ability to hold a hardened target at
risk. Efforts to incorporate the W88/Mk5 fuze capability into the
W76/Mk4 was part of the Energy Department's Warhead Protection Program
in the mid-1990s to permit "Mk5 fuzing functionality (including
radar-updated path length fuzing, and radar proximity fuzing) as an
option to replacement of the much smaller Mk4 AF&F," according to the
partially declassified 1996 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan
(emphasis added). Apart from the inherent drive to improve military
capabilities whenever possible, the motivation for increasing the target
kill capability of the submarine-borne W76 was that the Air Force's
hard-target killer, the MX Peacekeeper ICBM, was scheduled to be retired
under the START II treaty. The Navy only had 400 W88 hard-target kill
warheads, so a decision was made to add the capability to the W76. In an
article in April 1997, Strategic Systems Program director Rear Adm.
George P. Nanos publicly explained that "just by changing the fuze in
the Mk4 reentry body, you get a significant improvement. The Mk4, with a
modified fuze and Trident II accuracy, can meet the original D5
\[submarine-borne missile\] hard target requirement," [Nanos
stated](https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/W76nanos.pdf). Later
that same year, the Energy Department's Stockpile Stewardship and
Management Plan formally described the objective of the fuze
modernization program "to enable W76 to take advantage of \[the\] higher
accuracy of \[the\] D5 missile." By 1998, the fuze modernization effort
became a formal project, with five SLBM flight tests planned for
2001-2008. Full-scale production of the super-fuze equipped W76-1/Mk4A
began in September 2008, with the first warhead delivered to the Navy in
February 2009. By the end of 2016, roughly 1,200 of an estimated 1,600
planned W76-1/Mk4As had been produced, of which about 506 are currently
deployed on ballistic missile submarines. The implications. [The newly
created capability to destroy Russian silo-based nuclear forces with
100-kt W76-1/Mk4A warheads---the most numerous in the US
stockpile]{.underline}---[vastly expands the nuclear warfighting
capabilities of US nuclear forces.]{.underline} [**[Since only part of
the W76 force would be needed to eliminate Russia's silo-based
ICBMs]{.underline}**, [the United States will be left with an **enormous
number of higher-yield warheads**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that would then
be available to be **reprogrammed for other missions.**]{.underline}
Approximately 890 warheads are deployed on US ballistic missile
submarines (506 W76-1/Mk4A and 384 W88/Mk5). [Assuming that the 506
deployed W76-1s equipped with the super-fuze were used against Russian
silo-based ICBMs]{.underline}, **[essentially all 136 Russian silo-based
ICBMs could be potentially eliminated by attacking each silo with two
W76-1 warheads---a total of 272 warheads]{.underline}**. [This would
consume **only 54 percent** of the deployed W76-1 warheads]{.underline},
[leaving roughly 234 of the 500 warheads **free to be targeted on yet
other installations**]{.underline}. [And hundreds of additional
submarine warheads are in storage for increasing the missile warhead
loading if so ordered]{.underline}. The Trident II missiles that are
deployed today carry an average of four to five W76-1 warheads each.
However, each missile could carry eight such warheads if the US were to
suddenly decide to carry a maximum load of W76 warheads on its deployed
Trident II ballistic missiles. And the missile was tested with up to 12
warheads. Essentially **[all the 384 W88 "heavy" [Trident II
warheads]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with yields of 455 kt, **[[would also
be available]{.mark} for use against deeply-buried
targets]{.underline}**. In addition, [[about]{.underline} **[400
Minuteman]{.underline}**]{.mark} III
**[[warheads]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [with yields of about 300 kt, could
be used to target hardened Russian targets]{.underline}. In all, **[[the
entire Russian silo-based forces could]{.mark} [potentially be destroyed
while leaving the US with 79 percent of its ballistic missile warheads
unused]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Even after Russia's silo-based missiles
were attacked, the US nuclear firepower remaining would be
**staggering**---and certainly of concern to Russia or any other country
worried about a US first strike. Because of the new kill capabilities of
US submarine-launched ballistic missiles]{.underline} (SLBMs), [the
United States would be able to target huge portions of its nuclear force
against non-hardened targets, the destruction of which would be crucial
to a "successful" first strike. One such mission would likely involve
the destruction of **road-mobile ICBMs** that had **left their garrisons
to hide in Russia's vast forests in anticipation of
attack**]{.underline}. [The garrisons and their support facilities would
probably be destroyed **quickly**]{.underline}, [and some of the
dispersed road-mobile launchers would also be quickly destroyed as they
were in the process of dispersing]{.underline}. [To destroy or expose
the remaining launchers]{.underline}, [United States planners would have
the nuclear forces needed to undertake truly **scorched-earth
tactics**]{.underline}: [Just]{.underline} [[125 US Minuteman III
warheads]{.mark} [could]{.mark} set fire to some]{.underline} [8,000
square miles]{.underline} of forest area where the road-mobile missiles
are most likely to be deployed. This would be the equivalent of a
circular area with a diameter of 100 miles. [Such an attack would be
potentially aimed at [destroy]{.mark}ing **[all road-mobile
launchers]{.mark}** either as they disperse or after they have taken up
position some short distance from roads that give them access to
forested areas. Many of the nearly 300 remaining deployed W76 warheads
could be used to attack all **command posts** associated with Russian
ICBMs]{.underline}. [A very small number of Russia's major leadership
command posts are deeply buried,]{.underline} to protect them from
direct destruction by nuclear attack. [The US military would likely
reserve the **highest-yield warheads** for those targets]{.underline}.
[Figure 7 below shows an example of a structure that is roughly the size
of the US Capitol building that is postulated to have rooms and tunnels
as deep as 800 feet or more. Shelters that have rooms and tunnels at
even greater depths could be sealed by using **multiple nuclear
warheads** to crater every location where an entrance or exit might
conceivably have been built.]{.underline}

MISSILE DEFENSE. [U.S. offensive nuclear capabilities will]{.underline}
**[grow]{.underline}** [as the United States deploys a **national
missile defense**]{.underline} (NMD) **[system]{.underline}**. In [2001
the United States withdrew from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and
began to build a missile shield]{.underline}. [The first contingent

[but this step]{.underline} **[is only the starting point]{.underline}**
[for a **large, multilayered missile defense system**]{.underline}. To

defense [raise]{.underline} two important [**critiques** regarding its

missile defense system based on intercepting warheads outside the
Earth's atmosphere is impractical because it is extremely difficult to

shield]{.underline}** [could be a **powerful
complement**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to the offensive capabilities of

[destroy six warheads]{.underline}. [Furthermore, [the problem of

The US nuclear forces modernization program has been portrayed to the
public as an effort to ensure the reliability and safety of warheads in
the US nuclear arsenal, rather than to enhance their military
capabilities. In reality, however, that program has implemented
revolutionary new technologies that will vastly increase the targeting
capability of the US ballistic missile arsenal. This increase in
capability is astonishing---boosting the overall killing power of
existing US ballistic missile forces by a factor of roughly three---and
it creates exactly what one would expect to see, if a nuclear-armed
state were planning to have the capacity to fight and win a nuclear war
by disarming enemies with a surprise first strike. Because of
improvements in the killing power of US submarine-launched ballistic
missiles, those submarines now patrol with more than three times the
number of warheads needed to destroy the entire fleet of Russian
land-based missiles in their silos. US submarine-based missiles can
carry multiple warheads, so hundreds of others, now in storage, could be
added to the submarine-based missile force, making it all the more
lethal. The revolutionary increase in the lethality of submarine-borne
US nuclear forces comes from a "super-fuze" device that since 2009 has
been incorporated into the Navy's W76-1/Mk4A warhead as part of a
decade-long life-extension program. We estimate that all warheads
deployed on US ballistic missile submarines now have this fuzing
capability. Because the innovations in the super-fuze appear, to the
non-technical eye, to be minor, policymakers outside of the US
government (and probably inside the government as well) have completely
missed its revolutionary impact on military capabilities and its
important implications for global security. Before the invention of this
new fuzing mechanism, even the most accurate ballistic missile warheads
might not detonate close enough to targets hardened against nuclear
attack to destroy them. But the new super-fuze is designed to destroy
fixed targets by detonating above and around a target in a much more
effective way. Warheads that would otherwise overfly a target and land
too far away will now, because of the new fuzing system, detonate above
the target. FIGURE 1. The deployment of the new MC4700 arming, fuzing,
and firing system on the W76-1/Mk4A significantly increases the number
of hard target kill-capable warheads on US ballistic missile submarines.
The result of this fuzing scheme is a significant increase in the
probability that a warhead will explode close enough to destroy the
target even though the accuracy of the missile-warhead system has itself
not improved. As a consequence, the US submarine force today is much
more capable than it was previously against hardened targets such as
Russian ICBM silos. A decade ago, only about 20 percent of US submarine
warheads had hard-target kill capability; today they all do. (See Figure
1.) This vast increase in US nuclear targeting capability, which has
largely been concealed from the general public, has serious implications
for strategic stability and perceptions of US nuclear strategy and
intentions. Russian planners will almost surely see the advance in
fuzing capability as empowering an increasingly feasible US preemptive
nuclear strike capability---a capability that would require Russia to
undertake countermeasures that would further increase the already
dangerously high readiness of Russian nuclear forces. Tense nuclear
postures based on worst-case planning assumptions already pose the
possibility of a nuclear response to false warning of attack. The new
kill capability created by super-fuzing increases the tension and the
risk that US or Russian nuclear forces will be used in response to early
warning of an attack---even when an attack has not occurred. The
increased capability of the US submarine force will likely be seen as
even more threatening because Russia does not have a functioning
space-based infrared early warning system but relies primarily on
ground-based early warning radars to detect a US missile attack. Since
these radars cannot see over the horizon, Russia has less than half as
much early-warning time as the United States. (The United States has
about 30 minutes, Russia 15 minutes or less.) The inability of Russia to
globally monitor missile launches from space means that Russian military
and political leaders would have no "situational awareness" to help them
assess whether an early-warning radar indication of a surprise attack is
real or the result of a technical error. The combination of this lack of
Russian situational awareness, dangerously short warning times,
high-readiness alert postures, and the increasing US strike capacity has
created a deeply destabilizing and dangerous strategic nuclear
situation. When viewed in the alarming context of deteriorating
political relations between Russia and the West, and the threats and
counter-threats that are now becoming the norm for both sides in this
evolving standoff, it may well be that the danger of an accident leading
to nuclear war is as high now as it was in periods of peak crisis during
the Cold War. How the new accuracy-enhancing fuze works. The significant
increase in the ability of the W76-1/Mk4A warhead to destroy hardened
targets---including Russian silo-based ICBMs---derives from a simple
physical fact: Explosions that occur near and above the ground over a
target can be lethal to it. This above-target area is known as a "lethal
volume"; the detonation of a warhead of appropriate yield in this volume
will result in the destruction of the target. The recognition that the
killing power of the W76 warhead could be vastly increased by equipping
it with a new fuze was discussed in a 1994 alternate warhead study
conducted by the Defense and Energy departments. The study calculated
the number of warheads that would be needed for the W76 to attack the
Russian target base, if START II were implemented. At the time, W76/Mk4
warheads had a fixed height-of-burst fuze (meaning the fuze could not
adjust its detonation at an optimal location if it were falling short or
long of a target). With those fixed-height fuzes, submarine-launched
nuclear missiles were mainly aimed at softer targets such as military
bases. But the study found that an enhanced Mk4A reentry-body with a new
fuze that provided for an adjustable height-of-burst as it arrives would
have significant capabilities against harder targets, compared to
warheads with the earlier fuzes. The study assumed that a smaller number
of Mk4 nuclear warheads with higher killing power per warhead could
cover the Russian target base and be more effective than multiple
attacks on targets with less destructive warheads. In other words, an
enhanced fuze would allow the United States to reduce the number of
warheads on its ballistic missile submarines, but increase the targeting
effectiveness of the fleet. Figure 2 illustrates the kill distribution
of US submarine-launched nuclear missiles equipped with the earlier,
fixed height-of-burst fuzes. The dome-shaped volume outlined in gray
shows the lethal volume within which a 100-kiloton nuclear explosion
will generate 10,000 pounds per square inch or more of blast pressure on
the ground. In other words, if a target on the ground cannot survive a
blast of 10,000 pounds per square inch or more, it will be destroyed if
a 100-kt nuclear weapon detonates anywhere within that dome-shaped
volume. To show the physical relationship of the lethal volume for a
particular ground target of interest---in this case a Russian SS-18 ICBM
silo---Figure 2 was drawn to scale. Also shown to scale is the
approximate spread of warhead trajectories that correspond to a missile
that is accurate to 100 meters, a miss distance roughly the same as what
is achieved by the Trident II sea-launched ballistic missile. Miss
distances are typically characterized in terms of a quantity called the
"circular error probable," or CEP, which is defined as the radius of a
circle around the aim point within which half of the warheads aimed at a
target are expected to impact. In the case of a Trident II 100-kt W76-1
ballistic missile warhead, the lethal distance on the ground and the CEP
are roughly equal. As a result, roughly half of the warheads equipped
with the old, fixed-height fuze system could be expected to fall close
enough to detonate on the ground within the lethal range. The new
super-fuze for W76-1/Mk4A has a flexible height-of-burst capability that
enables it to detonate at any height within the lethal volume over a
target. Figure 3 shows how the new fuze vastly increases the chances
that the target will be destroyed, even though the arriving warheads
have essentially the same ballistic accuracy. The super-fuze is designed
to measure its altitude well before it arrives near the target and while
it is still outside the atmosphere. This measurement would typically be
taken at an altitude of 60 to 80 kilometers, where the effects of
atmospheric drag are very small. At this point, the intended trajectory
is known to very high precision before the warhead begins to
substantially slow from atmospheric drag. If the warhead altitude
measured by the super-fuze at that time were exactly equal to the
altitude expected for the intended trajectory, the warhead would be
exactly on target. But if the altitude were higher than expected, the
warhead could be expected to hit beyond the intended aim point.
Likewise, if the altitude is lower than that expected, the warhead would
likely hit short of the intended aim point. Testing has established the
statistical shape and orientation of the expected spread of warhead
locations as they fly towards the target. In the case of Trident II, the
spread of trajectories around the intended trajectory is so small that
the best way to increase the chances of detonating inside the lethal
volume is to intentionally shift the aim point slightly beyond the
location of the target. (Note that the intended trajectory in Figure 3
is shifted slightly down range.) By shifting the aim point down range by
a distance roughly equal to a CEP, warheads that would otherwise fall
short or long of the target using the conventional Mk4 fuze instead will
detonate---at different heights dictated by the super fuze---within the
lethal volume above a target. This shift in the down-range aim point
will result in a very high percentage of warheads that overfly the
target detonating in the lethal volume. The end result is that with the
new Mk4A super-fuze, a substantially higher percentage of launched
warheads detonate inside the lethal volume, resulting in a considerable
increase in the likelihood that the target is destroyed. The ultimate
effect of the super fuze's flexible burst-height capability is a
significantly increased target kill probability of the new W76-1/Mk4A
warhead compared with the conventional warhead of the same type. Figure
4 shows the probability that warheads will detonate close enough to
destroy the ground-target for both the conventional fuze and the
super-fuze. As can be seen from figure 4, the probability of kill using
a submarine-launched warhead with the new super-fuze (W76-1/Mk4A) is
about 0.86. This 86 percent probability is very close to what could be
achieved using three warheads with conventional fuzes to attack the same
target. To put it differently: In the case of the 100-kt Trident II
warhead, the super fuze triples the killing power of the nuclear force
it has been applied to. Many Russian targets are not hardened to 10,000
pounds per square inch blast overpressure. Figure 5 shows the same
probability of kill curves for the case of a target that is only hard to
2,000 pounds per square inch or more of blast overpressure, which is the
actual case for almost all targets hardened to nuclear attack---ICBMs
and supporting command posts, hardened structures at strategic airbases,
submarines at pierside or in protected tunnels, hardened command posts
at road mobile missile bases and elsewhere, etc. In this case, the
super-fuze achieves a probability of kill of about 0.99---or very near
certainty. This case also is equivalent to achieving a probability of
kill associated with using three warheads with a 0.83 probability to
achieve a 0.99 probability of kill. The probability of kills revealed by
figures 4 and 5 have enormous security ramifications. The US military
assumes that Russian SS-18 and TOPOL missile silos are hardened to
withstand a pressure of 10,000 pounds per square inch or more. Since
with the new super-fuze, the probability of kill against these silos is
near 0.9, the entire force of 100-kt W76-1/Mk4A Trident II warheads now
"qualifies" for use against the hardest of Russian silos. This, in turn,
means that essentially all of the higher-yield nuclear weapons (such as
the W88/Mk5) that were formerly assigned to these Russian hard targets
can now be focused on other, more demanding missions, including attacks
against deeply-buried underground command facilities. In effect, the
significant increase in the killing power of the W76 warhead allows the
United States to use its submarine-based weapons more decisively in a
wider range of missions than was the case before the introduction of
this fuze. The history of the US super-fuze program. The super-fuze is
officially known as the arming, fuzing and firing (AF&F) system. It
consists of a fuze, an arming subsystem (which includes the radar), a
firing subsystem, and a thermal battery that powers the system. The AF&F
is located in the tip of the cone-shaped reentry body above the nuclear
explosive package itself. The AF&F developed for the new W76-1/Mk4A is
known as MC4700 and forms part of the W76 life-extension program
intended to extend the service life of the W76---the most numerous
warhead in the US stockpile---out to the time period 2040-2050. The new
super-fuze uses a technology first deployed on the high-yield W88/Mk5
Trident II warhead. The Navy's Strategic Systems Program contracted with
the Lockheed Missile and Space Corporation in the early 1980s to develop
a new fuze that included "a radar-updated, path-length compensating fuze
... that could adjust for trajectory errors and significantly improve
the ability to destroy a target. This was an early and sophisticated use
of artificial intelligence in a weapon." It was the radar-updated,
path-length compensating fuze---combined with the increased accuracy of
the Trident II missile---that gave an SLBM the ability to hold a
hardened target at risk. Efforts to incorporate the W88/Mk5 fuze
capability into the W76/Mk4 was part of the Energy Department's Warhead
Protection Program in the mid-1990s to permit "Mk5 fuzing functionality
(including radar-updated path length fuzing, and radar proximity fuzing)
as an option to replacement of the much smaller Mk4 AF&F," according to
the partially declassified 1996 Stockpile Stewardship and Management
Plan (emphasis added). Apart from the inherent drive to improve military
capabilities whenever possible, the motivation for increasing the target
kill capability of the submarine-borne W76 was that the Air Force's
hard-target killer, the MX Peacekeeper ICBM, was scheduled to be retired
under the START II treaty. The Navy only had 400 W88 hard-target kill
warheads, so a decision was made to add the capability to the W76. In an
article in April 1997, Strategic Systems Program director Rear Adm.
George P. Nanos publicly explained that "just by changing the fuze in
the Mk4 reentry body, you get a significant improvement. The Mk4, with a
modified fuze and Trident II accuracy, can meet the original D5
\[submarine-borne missile\] hard target requirement," [Nanos
stated](https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/W76nanos.pdf). Later
that same year, the Energy Department's Stockpile Stewardship and
Management Plan formally described the objective of the fuze
modernization program "to enable W76 to take advantage of \[the\] higher
accuracy of \[the\] D5 missile." By 1998, the fuze modernization effort
became a formal project, with five SLBM flight tests planned for
2001-2008. Full-scale production of the super-fuze equipped W76-1/Mk4A
began in September 2008, with the first warhead delivered to the Navy in
February 2009. By the end of 2016, roughly 1,200 of an estimated 1,600
planned W76-1/Mk4As had been produced, of which about 506 are currently
deployed on ballistic missile submarines. The implications. The newly
created capability to destroy Russian silo-based nuclear forces with
100-kt W76-1/Mk4A warheads---the most numerous in the US
stockpile---vastly expands the nuclear warfighting capabilities of US
nuclear forces. Since only part of the W76 force would be needed to
eliminate Russia's silo-based ICBMs, the United States will be left with
an enormous number of higher-yield warheads that would then be available
to be reprogrammed for other missions. Approximately 890 warheads are
deployed on US ballistic missile submarines (506 W76-1/Mk4A and 384
W88/Mk5). Assuming that the 506 deployed W76-1s equipped with the
super-fuze were used against Russian silo-based ICBMs, essentially all
136 Russian silo-based ICBMs could be potentially eliminated by
attacking each silo with two W76-1 warheads---a total of 272 warheads.
This would consume only 54 percent of the deployed W76-1 warheads,
leaving roughly 234 of the 500 warheads free to be targeted on yet other
installations. And hundreds of additional submarine warheads are in
storage for increasing the missile warhead loading if so ordered. The
Trident II missiles that are deployed today carry an average of four to
five W76-1 warheads each. However, each missile could carry eight such
warheads if the US were to suddenly decide to carry a maximum load of
W76 warheads on its deployed Trident II ballistic missiles. And the
missile was tested with up to 12 warheads. Essentially all the 384 W88
"heavy" Trident II warheads, with yields of 455 kt, would also be
available for use against deeply-buried targets. In addition, about 400
Minuteman III warheads, with yields of about 300 kt, could be used to
target hardened Russian targets. In all, the entire Russian silo-based
forces could potentially be destroyed while leaving the US with 79
percent of its ballistic missile warheads unused. Even after Russia's
silo-based missiles were attacked, the US nuclear firepower remaining
would be staggering---and certainly of concern to Russia or any other
country worried about a US first strike. Because of the new kill
capabilities of US submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), the
United States would be able to target huge portions of its nuclear force
against non-hardened targets, the destruction of which would be crucial
to a "successful" first strike. One such mission would likely involve
the destruction of road-mobile ICBMs that had left their garrisons to
hide in Russia's vast forests in anticipation of attack. The garrisons
and their support facilities would probably be destroyed quickly, and
some of the dispersed road-mobile launchers would also be quickly
destroyed as they were in the process of dispersing. To destroy or
expose the remaining launchers, United States planners would have the
nuclear forces needed to undertake truly scorched-earth tactics: Just
125 US Minuteman III warheads could set fire to some 8,000 square miles
of forest area where the road-mobile missiles are most likely to be
deployed. This would be the equivalent of a circular area with a
diameter of 100 miles. Such an attack would be potentially aimed at
destroying all road-mobile launchers either as they disperse or after
they have taken up position some short distance from roads that give
them access to forested areas. Many of the nearly 300 remaining deployed
W76 warheads could be used to attack all command posts associated with
Russian ICBMs. [[A very small number of Russia's]{.mark} major

[buried]{.mark},]{.underline} to protect them from direct destruction by

[China](https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2016%20China%20Military%20Power%20Report.pdf)
has constructed the world's largest hypersonic wind tunnel to realize

up to Mach 10 -- more than double the speed of most current BMD systems.

that "U.S. ICBM survivability will once again become a concern" if

ICBMs play in nuclear deterrence, this is a scary prospect indeed. [[How
will the U.S. address the looming gap]{.mark} in BMD
capabilities?]{.underline} The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is
developing three primary solutions: directed energy weapons, railguns,
and "left-of-launch" capabilities. Directed energy weapons (DEW),
including lasers and high-power microwaves, provide one potential answer
to the threat posed by hypersonic glide vehicles and other ballistic
missile enhancements.
[DEW](https://my.nps.edu/documents/105988579/106076800/SEA-19B_DEW_Final_Report.pdf/eaaa7ba9-fe90-4bb5-9522-1efd6b1358f3)

high albedo gasses. MDA is actively working to overcome these challenges
and eventually plans to "deploy lasers on high altitude, long endurance
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms,"
[according](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Syring_04-13-16.pdf)
to MDA Director Vice Admiral James D. Syring. Utilized for boost-phase
intercept -- which engages targets before they reach hypersonic speeds
or enable other countermeasures -- this system has the potential to
revolutionize BMD. Railguns, another platform currently being explored
by MDA, also act to close the speed gap created by hypersonic attacks.
Presently capable of firing projectiles reaching speeds beyond Mach 5,
[railguns](http://www.janes.com/article/60546/general-atomics-commits-private-funding-to-develop-10-mj-medium-range-railgun)
allow for multiple attempts at destroying missiles as they approach.
While current railgun systems face
[questions](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a21174/navy-electromagnetic-railgun/)
regarding the endurance of their components, the ability to engage
fast-moving targets on their final approach remains a vital component of
MDA's [full spectrum](https://www.mda.mil/system/elements.html) BMD
system. Finally, [**[left-of-launch]{.underline}**
[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [methods meant to stop a missile

of the role left-of-launch tactics play in MDA's BMD toolkit, the
unlikelihood that the U.S. will be able to stay ahead of every attack
means, according to Winnefield, there will always be a need for a "solid
right-of-launch capability." None of this is to say that [development

More than ten years ago Kier A. [Lieber and]{.underline} Daryl G.
[Press]{.underline} [forged a productive co-authorship]{.underline} and
in "The End of MAD? The Nuclear Dimension of U.S. Primacy" questioned
entrenched beliefs about the strategic nuclear balance supposedly
existing between the United States and Russia. They then warned that
"for the first time in decades, it \[United States\] could conceivably
disarm the long-range nuclear arsenals of Russia or China with a nuclear
first strike."\[1\] In "The New Era of Counterforce: Technological
Challenge and the Future of Nuclear Deterrence," Lieber and Press return
to the topic of the survivability of modern nuclear forces. To Lieber
and Press, nuclear deterrence no longer appears. Their sobering analysis
of the impacts of ongoing technological changes on the survivability of
nuclear forces demonstrates an increased possibility of counterforce
attacks. Technological changes, from minor improvements to major
breakthroughs like the development of intercontinental ballistic
missiles (ICBMs), hardened missile silos, multiple independent reentry
vehicle warheads (MIRVs), and submarine launched ballistic missiles
(SLBMs), were major driving forces shaping American and Soviet nuclear
postures and expected deterrence requirements for a better part of the
Cold War. Both superpowers committed enormous resources to constantly
improving their nuclear arsenals. As the superpowers' arsenals were
growing in size to the tens of thousands, too many scholars and pundits
started to take it for granted that sufficient capacities to deliver
nuclear retaliation would be always available. [[By a **fresh
contribution**]{.mark} discussing the impacts of technological
development on the nuclear-armed state's capacity to fulfill the threat
of nuclear retaliation]{.underline}, which is the cornerstone of nuclear
deterrence, [[Lieber and Press bring a **welcome advancement** of the
debate about nuclear deterrence]{.mark} in the twenty-first
century]{.underline}. They argue that hardening, concealment, and
redundancy -- three legs that have historically helped ensure
survivability of nuclear arsenals vis-à-vis any realistic attempts to
destroy them in the first strike -- are steadily being undermined.\[2\]
First, hardening seems an increasingly unviable strategy for protecting
nuclear forces due to the increased accuracy of modern nuclear weapons'
delivery systems. Even hardened structures like ICBM silos cannot
typically survive a direct hit by a nuclear weapon. Reinforced
structures can protect missiles, bombers, and command and control
facilities from incoming weapons exploding close to the target, but not
from those exploding very close to it. Lieber and Press illustrate the
effects of improved accuracy with an example of the evolution of the
U.S. nuclear arsenal from 1985 to 2017. Whereas roughly a quarter of the
1985 ICBMs and virtually all of the 1985 SLBMs would have missed small
hardened targets like the enemy's ICBM silos, and exploded too far from
the target to destroy it, there would be no missed targets today
(19-21). Hence, usefulness of hardening for a nuclear force protection
wanes against highly accurate weapons. Lieber and Press further argue
that increased accuracy of nuclear weapons eliminates the problem of
'fratricide' that prevents further immediate attacks on the same
target.\[3\] Even today, some attacking weapons will likely fail, but no
will miss. Since no targets will be missed in a modern nuclear first
strike, there will also be no fratricide. Therefore, more than one
attacking weapon can be assigned to any single target to compensate for
a weapon that might fail in flight, and consequently all targets that
can be located can also be destroyed (21-27). Furthermore, the increased
accuracy lets the attacker use lower-yield nuclear weapons. Accurate low
yield weapons can be set to explode above the fallout threshold and
still destroy a hardened target. Without nuclear fallout, the likely
number of civilian causalities of a nuclear first strike drops radically
(27-32). The cumulative effects of increased accuracy introduce a novel
strategic situation when it is possible to destroy the enemy's hardened
nuclear arsenal with few civilian casualties, a development that greatly
enhances the attractiveness of the first strike, especially during a
crisis. The second common strategy to protect a nuclear arsenal,
mobility and concealment, is undermined by improvements in remote
sensing. Traditional sensor platforms like satellites and manned
aircraft are improved and supplemented by new systems such as remotely
piloted aircraft, underwater drones, autonomous sensors, and
cyberspying. State-of-the-art sensors collect "a widening array of
signals for analysis using a growing list of techniques" and, in
contrast to the Cold-War generation of sensors, the twenty-first century
monitoring is persistent and data are transmitted in the real time (33).
The aggregate effects of this development put the survivability of
systems like submarines and mobile missile launchers in jeopardy. These
systems have always been relatively easy to destroy, but historically it
had been nearly impossible to locate all of them. Lieber and Press argue
that modern sensors make locating and destroying possible. However
persuasive [[Lieber and Press's analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
effects of the revolution in remote sensing is, it [[is not without some
imperfections]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, the heavy secrecy that
shrouds the real capabilities of modern nuclear submarines and their
opponents' capabilities in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) precludes Lieber
and Press from using current data to assess how vulnerable the
submarines are. They must rely on the data about the vulnerability of
Soviet Cold-War submarines to the United States' ASW capabilities to
support their general argument about the vulnerability of this weapon's
platform. Consequently, the article can show how vulnerable the
submarines were and illustrate how vulnerable the submarines could be,
but it remains uncertain how vulnerable they actually are. While
logically sound, Lieber and Press's deductive argument about the
vulnerability of modern submarines is inevitably not without some
speculation. [It is also possible to argue that a reader can easily get
a somewhat exaggerated impression about the degree of vulnerability of
mobile missiles launchers]{.underline} to remote detection. Whereas
Lieber and Press provide an impressive geospatial analysis of the
possible remote-sensing coverage of North Korea's road network to show
how vulnerable North Korea's mobile missiles are to detection and
subsequent destruction, in a footnote they admit that such results
cannot be directly applied to much bigger countries like Russia and
China (fn. 98). **[[Yet while the degree of vulnerability]{.mark} of
submarines and mobile launchers to detection [might have been slightly
exaggerated, Lieber and Press certainly identify the trends that
unequivocally undermine nuclear arsenals'
survivability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Furthermore, Lieber and Press
rightly point out that the development of conventional arms, a trend out
of the scope of their study, puts the survivability of nuclear forces in
a further jeopardy. In fact, the increasing usefulness of conventional
weapons in nuclear counterforce might be -- at least in the long term --
an even greater challenge to the survivability of nuclear arsenals than
similar improvements in the accuracy of nuclear weapons. The historical
data from past crises when a preventive strike against nuclear arsenal
was contemplated show that would-be attackers tend to harbor strong
preferences for conventional weapons to knock out the enemy's nuclear
arsenal.\[4\] With the pinpoint accuracy of modern conventional weapons,
even hardened targets such as ICBM silos can be knocked out in a
conventional strike.\[5\] Arguably, great powers will be able to
maintain highly survivable nuclear postures as long as they remain ready
to bear the costs. But smaller regional powers might be unable to
compete in the possible arms races between increasingly effective
first-strike forces and an increasingly difficult nuclear force
protection. Then, as Lieber and Press insightfully point out, "in
extreme circumstances---for example, if an adversary threatens
escalation (or begins to escalate) during a conventional war---the
temptation to launch a disarming strike may be powerful" (16). How
dangerous and how novel this strategic situation is remains an open
question. Lieber and Press identify the trends undermining survivability
of nuclear arsenals. Decreased survivability of nuclear forces might be
quite a novel challenge for countries like the United States and Russia,
whose second- strike forces have been largely considered invulnerable at
least since the 1970s. Countries with sophisticated medium-sized nuclear
arsenals like France and Britain will face an even greater challenge.
Likely the most important question, however, is how the technological
change influences already unstable relations between smaller nuclear
powers that face much stronger, first strike capable enemies (North
Korea is a prime example). For small nuclear powers a dubious
survivability is much less novel. Survivability of small nuclear
arsenals has always been uncertain, and disarming attacks on the nuclear
arsenals of small nuclear powers were contemplated by their stronger
enemies. Yet none of the historical crises between a small nuclear power
and a first strike-capable great power culminated in a disarming strike
on the small nuclear power's nuclear weapons. Various factors, most
prominently conventional deterrence, but also alliance dynamics, norms,
and geography contributed to the absence of disarming strikes.\[6\] The
importance of previously stabilizing factors will likely grow with the
declining survivability of nuclear arsenals. It remains open to further
inquiry how exactly technological changes analyzed by Leiber and Press
impact these historical 'stabilizers'. [[Lieber and Press's
contribution]{.mark} to the debate about nuclear deterrence **[is an
important one]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It points to the trends that will
likely shape the international security in years to come and shows what
is possible with the state-of-the-art military
technologies]{.underline}. [Lieber and Press not only answer important
questions, but also open equally important ones.]{.underline} Whether we
are in the 'new era of counterforce' depends on how 'the technologically
possible' matches 'the politically desirable.' [This is a pertinent
question that needs to be addressed by further research.]{.underline}

### AT: Russia Goes First

#### US would strike first -- destroys Russian second-strike capacity and solves the impact 

**Abramowicz 22** \[Victor Abramowicz is PhD candidate and sessional
academic at Curtin University, specializing in defense policy and
strategy, military technology, security relations in East Asia and
Eastern Europe, and military history. He is also the Principal of Ostoya
Consulting, which provides advisory and business development services to

GBS-HW

In particular, while the United States and Russia's primary aim is to
avoid a nuclear war, should this arise both of course still seek to
minimize harm to themselves, including by saving the lives of millions
of their citizens. In turn, both sought to achieve this imperative in
many common ways -- such as storing medicines or building civil bunkers.

[Yet one key means, referred to as "**damage limitation**" appears to
have **only been pursued by America**, perhaps because of its
**extraordinary expense**. Damage limitation refers to the vastly
complex task of seeking to be able to destroy (mainly by atomic attack)
most and ideally all of Russia's missiles before they are launched,
including fixed silo-based and mobile land and sea-based
weapons.]{.underline}

[Washington's interest in being able to pre-emptively ruin all these
types of rockets is **obvious and arguably even benign**: they present a
threat to millions of US lives]{.underline}. But by potentially
successfully seeking such a capability it has also dramatically
increased, from Moscow's perspective, the risk of nuclear war.

This outcome reflects that both sides' mobile assets in particular have
been the crux of stability by enabling an "assured second strike". That
is, by being moveable and hence hard to destroy in an atomic first
strike, such weapons helped ensure such an attack would never come as
they promised obliteration in return.

In a real nuclear crisis, what would a future president do if advised
that America had a possibly fleeting fix on all of Russia's weapons?

[Yet if America is able to target all of Russia's missiles, this creates
an incentive for the United States to try a damage‑limiting preventative
attack that otherwise it would never have attempted.]{.underline}

It is within this situation that the Kremlin's concern over even limited
BMD can be placed, as any such defenses further-increase the imperative
to attack. [So, while some Russian rockets would almost certainly
survive a first strike, their reduced numbers are much **more likely to
be defeated** by even a handful of interceptors. And should Washington
manufacture more, even out of purely defensive intent, the **appeal of a
pre-emptive attack increases in turn**.]{.underline}

In this light, Moscow's novel weapons appear much more rational. They do
not require unreasonable American malevolence, simply a recognition of
Washington's aim to save US lives.

After all, in a real nuclear crisis, what would a future president do if
advised that America had a possibly fleeting fix on all of Russia's
weapons? What if, in such a scenario, Washington realized that Moscow
had detected -- and might at any moment fire upon -- an American attack
submarine that had been trailing a Russian missile‑sub, noting such
vessels each hold enough warheads to wipe out the United States?

[In such situations the **incentives to strike first would be
enormous**. And to offset this grim calculus, even small numbers of
BMD-immune weapons can disproportionately rebalance the scales and thus
present a **sensible investment**.]{.underline}

Chinese or [Russian non-nuclear strikes against the United States could

assets]{.mark}]{.underline} (including early-warning and communication
satellites, as well as ground-based radars and transmitters). [Even if
conducted exclusively for the purpose of winning]{.underline} (or at
least not losing) **[a conventional war]{.underline}**, [such
non-nuclear attacks [could be misinterpreted by Washington
as]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[preparations]{.mark} for nuclear
use]{.underline}**. [As a result, **[Washington might]{.mark} come to
[believe]{.mark}**]{.underline} (wrongly) **[[that it was about to
become the victim of]{.mark} a [nuclear]{.mark}
attack]{.underline}**---[an effect termed misinterpreted
warning]{.underline}. For example, China or [Russia might attack U.S.
early-warning satellites to enable their regional non-nuclear ballistic
missiles]{.underline} ([or]{.underline}, perhaps, [non-nuclear ICBMs or
boost-glide weapons in the future]{.underline}) [to penetrate U.S.
missile defenses]{.underline}. However, [such an attack might be
**misinterpreted** by the United States as an attempt to **disable
missile defenses**]{.underline} [designed to protect the homeland
against limited nuclear strikes]{.underline}. **[[Even if the United
States did not believe that nuclear use]{.mark} by an adversary [was
imminent, it might still worry that non-nuclear strikes]{.mark} against
its dual-use C3I assets [could compromise its ability to limit]{.mark}
the [damage]{.mark} it would suffer if the war turned nuclear at some
later point.]{.underline}** [Such [damage-limitation
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which are]{.underline}]{.mark} [an
acknowledged [part of U.S. nuclear strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[would probably involve nuclear]{.underline}**]{.mark} or non-nuclear
**[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** [on the adversary's nuclear forces
backed up by missile defenses]{.underline}. [To have any chance of
success, these operations would]{.underline} [require very sophisticated
C3I capabilities]{.underline} (to target mobile missiles, for example).
[Attacks on---or **[even perceived threats
to]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[these C3I [assets]{.mark}]{.underline}
(many of which are dual use) could [[lead to concerns in Washington
that]{.underline}, **[unless it took action]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[now]{.underline}**, [effective [damage limitation might be
**impossible**]{.mark}]{.underline}---that is, the damage-limitation
window might already have closed---if the war turned nuclear. [The
United States]{.underline} might [respond to either of these
concerns]{.underline} **[in ways that could further escalate the
crisis]{.underline}**. [Washington would probably take steps to protect
surviving C3I capabilities]{.underline}. It might, for example, attack
anti-satellite weapons that were seen as particularly threatening. Such
strikes could prove especially escalatory if they were conducted deeper
inside the adversary's borders than the United States had previously
struck. Alternatively, or additionally, Washington might issue explicit
or implicit nuclear threats against nuclear use or further attacks on
C3I assets. In fact, [[the]{.mark} 2018 U.S. [N]{.mark}uclear
[P]{.mark}osture [R]{.mark}eview even goes so far as to]{.underline}
threaten to [**[use nuclear weapons in response]{.mark} to attacks on
C3I assets. Risk mitigation** will likely prove
**challenging**]{.underline}. China may not want to disentangle its
nuclear and non-nuclear forces because doing so might weaken its ability
to deter U.S. attacks against the latter and because such
disentanglement might prove challenging organizationally for the
People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (which operates China's land-based
nuclear forces). [For Russia, the financial costs associated with
disentanglement are likely to be a significant barrier]{.underline}.
[Moreover, [inadvertent escalation is **not** generally **regarded** as
a serious risk in]{.mark}]{.underline} China or
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Unfortunately, the belief that
inadvertent escalation is unlikely actually makes it more probable
because it leaves political and military leaders less
inclined]{.underline}, in peacetime, [to take steps that could mitigate
the risks and more inclined, in wartime, to interpret ambiguous events
in the **worst possible light.**]{.underline} Although there is more
acceptance of the possibility of inadvertent escalation in the United
States, [there is **little evidence** that the U.S. government and
military have fully factored the risks of entanglement into procurement
policies and war planning]{.underline}. [[There is also little evidence
that]{.mark} the administration of]{.underline} President Donald
[**[Trump]{.underline}** [is willing to invest]{.underline}]{.mark}
[significant political capital [in **reducing the risk**]{.mark} of

For example, the military doctrine issued in 1997 allowed for the use of
nuclear weapons \"in case of a threat to the existence of the Russian
Federation.\" The doctrine published in 2000 expanded the circumstances
when Russia might use nuclear weapons to include attacks using weapons
of mass destruction against Russia or its allies \"as well as in
response to large-scale aggression utilizing conventional weapons in
situations critical to the national security of the Russian
Federation.\"[82](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20190117_RL32572_4df6b9c2e0db93313c8fd6a9cf0317d1c50ca37f.html#fn82)
In mid-2009, when discussing the revision of Russia\'s defense strategy
that was expected late in 2009 or early 2010, Nikolai Patrushev, the
head of Russia\'s Presidential Security Council, indicated that Russia
would have the option to launch a \"preemptive nuclear strike\" against
an aggressor \"using conventional weapons in an all-out, regional, or
even local
war.\"[83](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20190117_RL32572_4df6b9c2e0db93313c8fd6a9cf0317d1c50ca37f.html#fn83)
**[However]{.underline}**, [[when]{.mark} [Russia published the final
draft]{.mark} of the doctrine, in early 2010]{.underline}, **[[it did
not specifically authorize]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[the preemptive use
of nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Instead, it stated that
\"Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in response to a use
of nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction]{.underline} against her
and (or) her allies, and in a case of an aggression against her with
conventional weapons that would put in danger the very existence of the
state.\"[84](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20190117_RL32572_4df6b9c2e0db93313c8fd6a9cf0317d1c50ca37f.html#fn84)
[[Instead of expanding the range of circumstances when Russia might
use]{.mark} nuclear weapons,]{.underline} **[[this actually seemed to
narrow the range]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [from the 2000 version that
allowed for nuclear use \"in situations critical to the national

**[Hence]{.underline}**, [[there is **little

on President Donald Trump's 2020 defense budget request. The
chairman]{.underline} of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [came out with
several important remarks]{.underline} regarding the current US military
doctrine and its expected actions [in the event of conflict with **some
"adversary".** Dunford warned against changing the current US military
policy which allows the country to be the first to use nuclear weapons
during a possible conflict.]{.underline} The general emphasized that he
"absolutely" believes that "the current policy is the right policy". "I
wouldn't make any decisions to simplify an adversary's decision-making
calculus. I can also imagine a few situations where we wouldn't want to
remove that option from the president", he stressed. [Dunford added that
cyber weapons will **unlikely replace nuclear forces**]{.underline}, but
stressed that the US should be ready to carry out offensive cyber
operations. Describing the need for cyber operations, he mentioned China
and Russia as well as cyber attacks allegedly conducted by these two
states as the reason behind this need. [These remarks come in crouse of
the newly appearing US military doctrine, which actively employs
**nuclear threats**, cyber attacks and 'fifth columns' in order to
contain and defeat supposed US 'adversaries']{.underline}. [This
doctrine was in details described by the Chief of the General Staff of
the Armed Forces of Russia General Valeriy Gerasimov earlier in
March](https://southfront.org/vectors-of-development-of-russian-military-strategy-in-current-conditions/).
"Pentagon started to develop a qualitatively new strategy of military
operations which has already been dubbed the "Trojan horse". [It amounts

escalation. [Any threat (nuclear or otherwise) to raise the costs of

escalate and threaten to do so fairly regularly as they seek to convince
adversaries to rethink plans. The fact is that most escalation is

holds](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/15/trump-needs-a-russia-policy-or-putin-will-force-one-on-him/)
that Russia simply likes escalation]{.underline}, nuclear and otherwise.
[The notion that Russia might use nuclear weapons on the
battlefield]{.underline} may [originate in arguments in a 1999 paper
published in the Russian military journal Voennaia Mysl]{.underline}.
The authors, military officers and analysts V. I. Levshin, A. V.

that the use of nuclear weapons in a heretofore conventional conflict
could demonstrate credibility and convince the adversary to stand down
for fear of further escalation. [The argument for more nuclear steps on
the escalation ladder has been made more recently as
[well](http://nvo.ng.ru/concepts/2015-11-27/1_stairway.html)]{.underline}.
[It was even promised by a senior Russian official prior to the release
of a new military doctrine almost a decade
[ago](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/14/10/2009/5703d6e19a7947733180bb63).]{.underline}

[previously](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine),
[the official statements]{.underline}, followed by a doctrine that did
not deliver on them, [suggest that [**proponents** of a lowered

advocates occasionally publish an article]{.mark}, still hoping to

a conventional conflict]{.underline}. **[To the contrary]{.underline}**,
[[military doctrine clearly states that nuclear weapons will be used
**only in response to**]{.mark} **an adversary using nuclear or other
[weapons of mass destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline} and/or "when the
very existence of the state is [in](https://rusemb.org.uk/press/2029)
[jeopardy.](http://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/3054726)"
One can argue what does and does not qualify as existential jeopardy,
but [the scenarios in which Western analysts envision Russian nuclear
escalation]{.underline} --- most of which involve ending a conventional
conflict --- **[seem to fall short by most definitions.]{.underline}**
In the past, Russia's bar for nuclear use has been both higher and
lower. In 1993, [Moscow dropped the no-first-use
pledge](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/04/world/russia-drops-pledge-of-no-first-use-of-atom-arms.html)
it inherited from the Soviet Union. In 2000, however, following the NATO
air campaign in Yugoslavia, Russia's new military doctrine allowed for
first use in case of large-scale conventional aggression against Russia
or its [allies](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2000_05/dc3ma00). It is
plausible that at this time, plans indeed looked something like
"escalate to de-escalate." But soon after that, proponents of reliance
on nuclear weapons found their views eclipsed by Russian government
decisions to instead invest in conventional
[forces](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/107537). At the time, this
was mainly because Russia believed [most of its battles would be
smaller-scale](http://milrf.ru/conference/cf_030604/5ru_esin.htm).
Today, however, Russia is [increasingly
confident](https://sputniknews.com/russia/201701121049508492-precision-weapons-russia/)
that its conventional capabilities can play at least some of the
strategic deterrence roles historically played by nuclear weapons. A
Secret Plan to Escalate? [[Those who believe]{.mark} in a lowered
Russian threshold for nuclear use thus [believe that Russia's formal
doctrine is intentionally disingenuous]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed,
speculation about a secret annex to the doctrine that clandestinely
lowers the nuclear threshold
[abounds](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017-02/escalate-de-escalate).
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} as [Kristin ven Bruusgaard has pointed
out](https://warontherocks.com/2017/09/the-myth-of-russias-lowered-nuclear-threshold/)
in in War on the Rocks, **[[if Russia's goal is
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[a stated strategy]{.mark} of
restraint [at odds with a real strategy]{.mark} of escalation [seems
**counterproductive**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Deterrence works best when
the adversary **understands** which actions will trigger an undesirable
response. Three categories of evidence are offered to support the
argument that Russia's true nuclear threshold today is lower than its
doctrine indicates: **exercises**, **capability**, and
**rhetoric**]{.underline}. Like other nuclear states, [[Russia runs
exercises]{.mark} that involve [nuclear

[The vast majority of these test strategic readiness, command and

[nuclear](https://jamestown.org/program/belarus-and-russia-prepare-zapad-2013-military-exercise/)
use was simulated in otherwise conventional Russian exercises,
supposedly boosting the evidence for "escalate to de-escalate." **[[It
does not]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [[appear that
scenarios]{.mark} for these exercises [fit the model of a small-scale
nuclear strike **early in a conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}---as one of
us has argued in the
[past](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/160504_Oliker_RussiasNuclearDoctrine_Web.pdf).
[If one believes the strikes happened, conditions of a battlefield
defeat posing an existential threat to the state are **more
plausible**]{.underline}. However, as Bruno Tertrais explains, the
evidence for simulated nuclear use in large conventional exercises is
itself not fully
[convincing](https://www.iiss.org/en/politics%20and%20strategy/blogsections/2018-4cda/february-e91d/does-russia-really-include-limited-nuclear-strikes-bf12).
Importantly, [[Russia's most recent]{.mark} large-scale [military
exerci]{.mark}se]{.underline} focused on its Western flank, Zapad 2017,
**[[did not have any evident nuclear
[strike](https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/five-things-know-about-zapad-2017-military-exercise)]{.mark}
[component](https://news.err.ee/650543/michael-kofman-what-actually-happened-during-zapad-2017)]{.underline}**,
despite positing a conflict with the NATO alliance. [Then there's
Russian **capability**]{.underline}, [specifically smaller-scale,
shorter-range nuclear capabilities]{.underline} suitable for the
battlefield. Russia maintains a substantial legacy
[arsenal](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL32572.pdf) of nonstrategic
weapons, which some may believe suggests a willingness to use them.
Moreover, in recent years, Moscow has emphasized the development of new
warfighting systems that can be deployed with either nuclear or
conventional firepower, the oft-touted Iskander being one
[example](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine).
Russia is also working on hypersonic
[systems](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine).
Finally, the "accidental" leak of plans (in the form of a presentation
slide) for a nuclear
[torpedo](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34797252) in 2015 fueled
speculation that Russia is thinking creatively about nuclear warfighting
(although the destructive power of the purported weapon would surely
have strategic, not merely "de-escalatory," effects). [Some may argue
that capability is evidence enough of possible "escalate to
de-escalate]{.underline}" plans, and the West should therefore respond
in kind. **[This is wrong]{.underline}**, for two reasons: First,
[weapons can be used for all sorts of things, and one cannot plan for
all possible contingencies]{.underline} --- only those that seem
plausible. [Russia could also, in principle, plan to set off **all of
its nuclear weapons at once**]{.underline}, [or fire some of them into
**space**]{.underline}. [If a possible strategy is not supported by the
evidence, **it should not drive planning.**]{.underline} Second, the
argument that capabilities prove intent works both ways. The United
States also has low-yield nuclear capabilities (and will have more if
proponents have their way). Should Russia therefore expect the United
States to use nuclear weapons first if American conventional forces were
losing, say in a fight against Russia over Ukraine? Indeed, such an
approach would be consistent with the American doctrine outlined in the
new Nuclear Posture Review. But while the review may make this scenario
less ludicrous than it was in the past, Russia would still be
dangerously paranoid to base its planning on the possibility. There is
no evidence of U.S. plans to start an offensive war against a major
nuclear power like Russia or China, much less to use a preemptive
nuclear strike to "de-escalate" a conventional conflict once it went
wrong. [So what is Russia's very large nonstrategic arsenal
for]{.underline}, and why is it emphasizing dual-use systems? First, as
regards the nonstrategic arsenal as a whole, [Russia is quite simply
loath to give up something it has a lot of without getting something
else in return]{.underline}. Second, [Moscow knows that its nuclear
capabilities make Brussels and Washington nervous]{.underline}.
[Russians did not discuss a nuclear role for the Iskander---and, indeed,
rejected the possibility---**until** the Western press started
describing the system as
[**dual-capable**.](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine)]{.underline}
To be blunt, if not reassuring, Moscow has noticed that an emphasis on
dual-capable systems keeps the West off-balance, and sees that as a
clear benefit. [This brings us to the last category of evidence for a
clandestine lowered threshold: Russian **rhetoric**]{.underline}. [While
some Russian pundits recklessly talk of turning countries to
[ash](https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-kiselyov/russia-can-turn-us-to-radioactive-ash-kremlin-backed-journalist-idUSL6N0MD0P920140316),
senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin]{.underline},
**[have been far more careful with their threats]{.underline}**. [Putin
may
[mention](https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/16/europe/russia-putin-crimea-nuclear/index.html)
that the Crimea crisis could, in some contingencies, have led him to
place nuclear weapons on alert. However, this never happened, and it is
something of a stretch to interpret that as meaning he would have used a
tactical nuclear weapon to end a conventional conflict]{.underline}.
Moreover, in the face of recent nuclear
[rhetoric](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F03%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-nuclear-authority%2Findex.html)from
America's own president, the comments Putin has made seem almost
circumspect. [[Putin's rhetoric is meant not to signal plans to use
nuclear weapons recklessly]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[but rather to
remind any who may have forgotten that Russia is a nuclear weapons
state]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [While this is prospectively
destabilizing, [it does not indicate a deep occult doctrine]{.mark},
much less a doctrine that has been consistently and publicly
rejected]{.underline}. Russian rhetoric reflects the fact that Russia,
much like the Soviet Union before it, sees NATO posing a threat that
needs to be deterred. Moscow continues to believe, and Russian generals
in private conversations emphasize, that any conventional conflict with
NATO risks rapid escalation without "de-escalation" --- into
all-destroying nuclear war. It must therefore be avoided at all costs.
This logic is consistent with that put forward by American scholars who
have [argue](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1962764)d
[that](http://www.newsweek.com/how-nuclear-weapons-can-keep-you-safe-78907)
nuclear weapons kept the peace during the Cold War. The success of the
nuclear peace, in this view, lay in the threat of extreme escalation,
not the bespoke step-by-step deterrence the Nuclear Posture Review seems
to advocate and that the postulated Russian "de-escalation" doctrine
would implicitly endorse.

GBS-HW

[Joe Biden campaigned in 2020 as a nuclear arms-control enthusiast,
declaring that "the United States does not need new nuclear weapons" and
embracing a "sole purpose" policy]{.underline} that would narrow the
circumstances in which he might direct the military to use one.
[Fourteen months into his presidency, he has been **forced to abandon
both commitments**.]{.underline}

[Two intervening events explain the change.]{.underline} First, in 2021,
[satellite images made public the construction of as many as **300
silos**, apparently **for intercontinental ballistic missiles**, in
western China]{.underline}. The extent of Beijing's nuclear ambitions
could no longer be ignored.

[Then Russia invaded Ukraine while rattling its nuclear
saber.]{.underline} Nuclear weapons haven't been used, but they've
already set the terms for the conflict: It's only because of these
weapons that Russia's military can fight a conventional war in Ukraine
without a credible threat of direct Western intervention.

Specifically, Vladimir Putin's war has highlighted Russia's yawning
advantage over the United States in nonstrategic, or "tactical," nuclear
weapons, which have shorter ranges and smaller yields. Moscow's military
doctrine exploits its roughly 10-to-1 advantage in the smaller weapons,
and greater diversity of delivery systems, by contemplating their use on
the European battlefield in a conventional war with NATO. If an American
president has fewer options for a proportionate response to a limited,
tactical nuclear strike, such a strike might look more attractive to
Russia. It could gamble that the president (no matter America's official
policy) would back down rather than risk escalating toward a
full-fledged, or "strategic," nuclear exchange.

The administration has responded to the changed circumstances. [Biden
reportedly told European heads of state last week that **he would not
formally weaken the United States' nuclear-use policy**, as some of them
feared.]{.underline} [Meanwhile, his fiscal 2023 defense budget released
this week **funds several nuclear weapons programs** initiated in the
Trump administration that are under attack from disarmament
advocates.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, it may not be enough. The budget still terminates the
Pentagon's development of a tactical nuclear weapon delivered by a
sea-launched cruise missile (or SLCM, sometimes pronounced "slick-em").
This decision, announced in the middle of Putin's war on NATO's
doorstep, could needlessly create doubt in Moscow about Washington's
will in a nuclear standoff. Putin has a huge advantage in the kind of
nuclear weapon he would be most likely to use The commander of U.S.
forces in Europe is already sounding the alarm. In testimony before the
House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, Gen. Tod Wolters said the
United States should continue developing the SLCM. "Having multiple
options," Wolters said, "exacerbates the challenge for the potential
enemies" probing for ways to circumvent our nuclear deterrent. Multiple
options means more than one type of low-yield weapon for a president to
choose from to respond to a limited Russian nuclear strike on a NATO
ally. The aim would be to restore deterrence without unduly escalating.
The defense budget wisely doesn't seek to dismantle the W76-2, a
submarine-launched low-yield weapon that Biden opposed when it was first
deployed in 2019. In an email, a senior Pentagon official cited "the
deterrence contribution of the W76-2," as well as cost constraints, to
explain the cancellation of the SLCM. But the W76-2 is delivered by a
long-range ballistic missile, which means it can't be carried on most
Navy submarines and would look like a "strategic" weapon on enemy radar.
The Pentagon fielded it as a second-best alternative to the SLCM only
because it could be ready earlier. To Biden's credit, the budget
maintains funding to develop the planned Long-Range Standoff Weapon, a
nuclear cruise missile launched from an Air Force bomber. But planes are
easier to detect than submarines and might take longer to get into
position. The SLCM --- which was also deployed late in the Cold War ---
is a powerful complement to the Air Force's planned weapon. It's true
that NATO's conventional firepower could overwhelm Russia's military.
But consider that early in the Cold War, the roles were reversed. The
Soviet Union had the more powerful land army in Europe, while the United
States, under its doctrine of "massive retaliation," planned to use
nuclear weapons to meet a conventional attack. There is nothing
especially irrational, then, about Russian threats of nuclear force in a
conventional war against a superior opponent. The solution is to show
Moscow that it has no hope of victory from a limited nuclear escalation
because of NATO's ability to match it at every step.

Nuclear deterrence can be debated endlessly because there's mercifully
little empirical evidence against which to test theories of how it works
(or doesn't). [But **China's nuclear rise** and the simultaneous
**return of war in Europe have shattered**, at least for the foreseeable
future, **any claim that unreciprocated American nuclear disarmament is
a realistic path to peace**.]{.underline}

[DURING HIS CAMPAIGN for president, Joe Biden penned an article in
Foreign Affairs titled "Why America Must Lead Again."]{.underline} In
it, he laid out his thoughts on the most dangerous arms in the U.S.
stockpile. "[I believe that the sole purpose of the U.S. nuclear arsenal
should be deterring---and, if necessary, retaliating against---a nuclear
attack]{.underline}," the then-candidate wrote. "As president, I will
work to put that belief into practice, in consultation with the U.S.
military and U.S. allies."

The declaration gave arms control advocates hope that the president
would adopt a no-first-use policy --- meaning that the U.S. would commit
to never initiating a nuclear conflict. [Current policy allows the
president to strike first in an extreme circumstance, like in response
to a devastating chemical attack, which can lower the threshold for
nuclear war to break out. But now, at a time when the world is closer to
a nuclear exchange than ever, thanks to Russian President Vladimir
Putin's devastating war against Ukraine, **Biden has gone back on his
word**.]{.underline}

On March 29, the White House released a short summary of Biden's
upcoming strategy on nuclear forces indicating his decision: "The United
States would only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme
circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its
allies and partners."

[This effectively makes the U.S. stance on nuclear employment
**indistinguishable from Russia**'s.]{.underline} According to its
military doctrine, Russia may use a nuclear weapon if it faces an
"existential" threat --- a fact of which Putin has reminded observers
around the world in recent weeks as he pummels Ukraine.

Biden's decision to keep U.S. policy so similar to Russia's amounts to a
missed opportunity to build an international coalition against nuclear
conflict, disarmament advocates say.

Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., co-chair of the Nuclear Weapon and Arms Control
Working Group, took to the Senate floor on March 31 to indict the
policy: "Unfortunately, our American democracy and Russia's autocracy do
share one major thing in common: [Both our systems give the United
States and Russian presidents the godlike powers known as sole authority
to end life on the planet as we know it by ordering a nuclear first
strike."]{.underline}

[According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported Biden's
decision to **maintain first-strike authority** on March
25]{.underline}, the president faced pressure from allies to renege on
his campaign pledge. He met with European partners late last month amid
apparent concerns that Russia may use a nuclear or chemical weapon as
part of its war against Ukraine. (NBC reported last week that three U.S.
officials admitted there is no evidence that Russia brought chemical
weapons near Ukraine.)

Tom Collina, policy director at the nuclear arms control group
Ploughshares Fund, argued that rolling back the strike authority could
have benefited international efforts against Russia. "Putin is
threatening the first use of nuclear weapons to hold Ukraine hostage and
keep the US and NATO out," he wrote to The Intercept. "This is nuclear
blackmail, and its a dangerous precedent that we must oppose. Its
therefore deeply disappointing that the Biden administration just missed
a key opportunity to reject first use. [Instead, Biden's policy also
allows first use and is essentially the same as Russia's, and this
undermines Biden's ability to build international opposition to what
Putin is doing."]{.underline}

long-standing US nuclear doctrine and will instead adopt existing
policies that **reserve America's right to** use nuclear weapons in a
**first-strike** scenario.]{.underline}

The new Nuclear Posture Review says the US would only use nuclear
weapons under "extreme circumstances," similar to language used in
previous reviews.

[Instead, Biden's most recent Nuclear Posture Review reiterates that
nuclear **deterrence is the nuclear arsenal's "fundamental role"** and
not its "sole purpose,"]{.underline} U.S. officials told the Wall Street
Journal.

Though the difference in wording may seem minor, Biden's proposed
"single purpose" doctrine sparked apprehension among allies from Europe
to Japan, who feared the change in stance would embolden opponents.

[And given Vladimir Putin's recent moves against Ukraine, **NATO
allies** in particular **feared** that a change of course would
encourage Russia to launch new conventional attacks or use chemical
weapons, knowing that a **US nuclear response was out of the

### AT: Nuclear Taboo\-\--2NC

#### The nuclear taboo is correlation not causation- nuclear use is determined by specific geopolitical factors

VI\. THE NUCLEAR TABOO TODAY [The argument presented here is that the
norm of nuclear non-use is the product of political, strategic, and
technological factors]{.underline} filtered through Just War
considerations [rather than the establishment of a universal
constitutive norm. Freed of bipolar balancing considerations, the
expanding set of nuclear-armed actors, influenced by technological
developments in conventional weaponry, precision delivery systems, and
missile defense, will perceive an increasingly more conducive
environment to nuclear use.]{.underline} Tannenwald asserts that a
nuclear taboo benefits small states and arose "despite consistent and
long-standing official U.S. resistance to it" (Tannenwald 1999, 435 n.7;
2005, 11). Conversely, Gavin contends that since 1945, the United States
has consistently "highlight\[ed\] the dangers of nuclear weapons and
encourage\[d\] a norm against their possession and a taboo against their
use" (Gavin 2015, 25). [In reality, [the idea of a taboo has been
supported]{.mark} or opposed [by various states depending on]{.mark}
what they perceived to be in [their interests at the
time]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, [[the Soviet Union engaged in
public diplomacy demonizing nuclear use during]{.mark} the period of
Soviet nuclear [inferiority]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tannenwald 1999, 449).
Having rejected demobilization following World War II and thus enjoying
conventional superiority vis-à-vis the United States, this was natural.
[As [the Soviets obtained greater nuclear parity,]{.mark} [such rhetoric
diminished]{.mark}. When the Soviet economy collapsed]{.underline}, and
with it the ability to support a massive conventional military force,
[the Russians began to see the idea of a taboo as a U.S. ploy to exploit
the new U.S. conventional edge. Since then, [Russia]{.mark} has
[abandoned]{.mark} the "[No First Use"]{.mark} pledge]{.underline}
(Feiveson and Hogendoorn 2003, 3; Koblenz 2014, 12), that advocates of
the taboo previously presented as evidence of the taboo's international
strength (Paul 1995, 705; Gizewski 1996, 413). Russia has fully
integrated tactical nuclear arms into its military forces (Roberts 2015,
136), while conspicuously rattling the nuclear saber during Putin's
expansionist activity. Meanwhile, during periods of Soviet conventional
superiority, U.S. officials such as Eisenhower and Dulles sought to
"regularize" nuclear arms. [As the balance shifted[, U.S. rhetoric
adopted a more favorable stance to the]{.mark} idea of a [taboo]{.mark}.
Today, the elimination of nuclear arms as usable instruments would
benefit no one as much as it would the United States, due to the
enormous conventional edge]{.underline} the U.S. military holds over
other states. 1. Balance of Power During the Cold War, superpowers
exercised greater ability to control the actions of states within their
respective blocs. By the second decade of the nuclear age, both sides
sought to prevent proliferation of nuclear arms. This was in part to
secure their own preeminent positions, but also to prevent the
possibility of allies using, or threatening to use, nuclear arms as a
catalyst to prod their superpower benefactor into action on their
behalf, thereby risking U.S. -- Soviet confrontation. The collapse of
the Soviet Union resulted in the weakening of the balance of power,
leading to overly ambitious U.S. military extension and to a weakening
of the U.S.-led Western alliance system. In turn, popular discontent
with the results of U.S. interventionism has caused domestic political
blowback in the United States, leading to U.S. hesitance to use force in
defense of the existing balance of power. A resurgent nationalist
Russia, a newly capable China, an emboldened Iran, and violent jihadist
terrorist organizations have each taken advantage of this to expand
their own influence in various regions. Whether characterized as a
leaderless unipolar system or a return to multipolarity, the current era
has yet to settle into a functional balancing arrangement. In such an
environment, there are fewer constraints on nuclear use. Whereas the
bipolar balance constrained great power interventions, [today's smaller
powers, such as North Korea and Iran, see nuclear weapons as a necessary
guarantee of regime survival.]{.underline} Moreover, [the possession of
nuclear arms permits states to engage in conduct that might otherwise
result in military threats to the ruling regime]{.underline}, as with
Iranian support for Hezbollah and Hamas, or Pakistani support for
Islamist attacks in Kashmir. [Nuclear arms can also be used for
coercion]{.underline}. For example, Russia can invade and annex Crimea
using conventional force, and then threaten nuclear escalation should
the international community attempt to act to reverse it. [A
nationalist-energized China could react to moves toward Taiwanese
independence by attempting a rapid conventional military operation,
backed by threats to escalate to nuclear use should the United States
attempt to intervene]{.underline}. These threats can succeed where the
balance of interests favors the threatening party, so that although it
might be materially weaker, it has greater resolve than its adversary --
and the adversary in the case knows it (Kahn 1965; Roberts 2016, 68-73).
Indeed, the conventional military dominance of the United States spurs
others to consider asymmetric options in this manner, as purely
conventional threats of escalation are not backed by the requisite
capabilities. This greater facility of use contradicts claims of a
steadily strengthening taboo. 2. Proliferation In the 25 years of the
post-Cold War era, nuclear proliferation has been on the rise. Iraqi
efforts at developing a nuclear capability were uncovered in 1991 and
addressed via economic, diplomatic, and military means over the next
several years. India and Pakistan both became declared nuclear weapons
states in 1998. North Korea has carried out a series of five nuclear
tests to date, demonstrating an evolving nuclear capability, while also
undertaking an exceptionally active missile testing program. Syria's
effort to construct a secret nuclear reactor with North Korean
assistance was discovered and subjected to a preemptive Israeli military
strike in 2007. Iran's nuclear program has been the subject of extensive
diplomatic exchange, leading to a negotiated delay of Iranian uranium
enrichment efforts[. Along with new nuclear-armed states, the
possibility of non-state actors acquiring nuclear arms is greater than
ever. Not only have there been greater opportunities due to
international proliferation rings like that of A.Q.]{.underline} Khan,
[but]{.underline} there is [greater willingness]{.underline} among
non-state groups to engage in mass murder. Transnational terrorist
organizations such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State promote a violent
revolutionary ideology that places minimal value on human life and
engages in brutal conduct for the sake of shock. If either group were to
obtain a nuclear weapon, there is little doubt that such weapon would be
detonated to maximize loss of life. This proliferation is not due to any
lack of effort or concern by nuclear states. [Nuclear non-proliferation
efforts have regularly been used by nuclear powers to try to lock in
exclusive possession of nuclear arm]{.underline}s.12 The nuclear
non-proliferation regime boasts an impressive array of treaties,
organizations, and advocates.13 However, [if there was an international
nuclear taboo in place, derived from an internalized conception of
identity, then non-proliferation efforts would not be needed. States
would be able to rely on this taboo to know such arms were unusable. Yet
non-proliferation remains a key security concern for states around the
world.]{.underline} States continue to invest significant efforts in
countering proliferation, primarily through supply-side controls, which
implies demand exists -- a fact irreconcilable with a universally
accepted taboo. In addition to proliferation of new nuclear powers, the
nuclear arsenals of existing nuclear-armed states have also increased.
While the United States and Russia have significantly reduced the
numbers of deployed strategic nuclear warheads, other nuclear powers,
including China, India, and Pakistan, have amassed larger arsenals.
Nearly all of the nuclear-armed states are now engaged in modernization
efforts of their nuclear arms. (Bracken 2016). Even the European Union
has reportedly broached discussion of a "Eurodeterrent" force (Fisher
2017). 3. Modern Technology Nuclear arms have advanced significantly
since the first generation of highyield indiscriminant weapons.
[Tactical nuclear arms with sub-kiloton yields are now possible. These
weapons can be delivered using modern precision guidance systems
exponentially superior to those available in Brodie's era. Scenarios
where such weapons could be used in a discriminant fashion are now
imaginable]{.underline}. For example, [low-yield nuclear weapons could
be used against deeply-buried and hardened targets such as underground
biological-weapons facilities]{.underline}. Using timedelayed fuses that
permitted missiles to use kinetic energy in burrowing through packed
earth or cement before the nuclear payload detonates could minimize
fallout and other collateral damage, while the associated energy could
destroy the labs and the radiation could prevent reconstitution. Or a
state could detonate largeyield nuclear weapons high in the atmosphere
above an adversary with the intent of generating a wide-ranging
electromagnetic pulse that knocks out electrical systems without causing
casualties from blast effects or radiation release. Having degraded the
adversary's communications, intelligence, and command and control
systems, it could then demand certain concessions via coercive threats
of additional strikes. Technology has also rendered the assumption that
there is no defense against nuclear-armed missiles suspect. Ballistic
missile defense systems, while far from perfect, are now fielded at a
variety of locations. U.S. ground-based interceptors, Aegis ship-borne
and ashore missile defense, and theater high-altitude area defense
(THAAD) are among the larger U.S. systems that other states fear could
provide the United States with a strategic advantage. As missile defense
advances, it could diminish the operation of nuclear deterrence,
lessening the perceived costs of nuclear use. Technological
breakthroughs in conventional arms can also impact the cost / benefit
analysis surrounding nuclear use. Current research on hypersonic systems
suggests new means may soon be available to destroy an adversary's
hardened targets. Indeed, a state could possibly launch a disarming
first-strike against another state's immobile nuclear forces using
solely conventional arms, holding its strategic nuclear arms in reserve
to deter the target state's nuclear retaliation. Suc[h weapons threaten
to erode the rationalist's firebreak between conventional and nuclear
arm]{.underline}s[. As with non-proliferation efforts, missile defense
and hypersonic technology would not rate the heightened attention they
receive if a nuclear taboo functioned as asserted]{.underline}. China
would be far less concerned with U.S. deployment of THAAD to South Korea
if Chinese leadership believed a nuclear taboo was in operation. VII.
CONCLUSION Th[e fact that nuclear arms have not been detonated
militarily since 1945 serves as the strongest argument in favor of the
existence of a nuclear taboo. Yet there are multiple facts inconsistent
with the claim of a constitutive norm.]{.underline} If a nuclear taboo
were truly in place today, nuclear deterrence could not remain a key
feature of international relations. Even granting a "taboo exception"
for so-called "rogue" states, large powers well-socialized into the
existing international system demonstrate a conduct inconsistent with an
internalized norm prohibiting the thought of nuclear use. [These [powers
spend billions of dollars to modernize "unusable" weapons]{.mark}; they
spend time and resources in [pursuit]{.mark} of [arms control
agreements]{.mark} aimed at reducing the numbers of "unusable" nuclear
arms; they place non-proliferation efforts at the top of the
international political agenda; and they resist or overturn no-first-use
pledge]{.underline}s. The development of ballistic missile defense
generates intense reactions by world powers that fear diminution of
deterrence. Consideration of building sub-kiloton yield nuclear weapons
produces visceral opposition. [[If nuclear arms]{.mark} of all types
[were]{.mark} the [subject of a taboo]{.mark} based on an internalized
repudiation of nuclear weapons, [these behaviors would represent an
indomitable puzzle]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The nuclear taboo likely
receives widespread scholastic acceptance in part because of ideological
preferences]{.underline}. Works such as Tannenwald (1999, 2005, 2007)
and Farrell and Lambert (2001) [demonstrate a clear normative desire for
nuclear- zero]{.underline}. Prior scholastic works have assigned causal
significance to normative factors, only to have subsequent research
indicate material factors played a larger role than thought. For example
Perkovich (2001) argued that India had made a conscious decision to
abstain from weaponizing nuclear arms, while the recent work of Kampani
(2014) argues persuasively that India's delay was due to a combination
of technological, organizational, and political factors. [Given the
prevailing perception of nuclear arms as incapable of anything but mass
destruction, such preferences are attractive on a broad scale. Yet
assertions of a stronger prohibition on nuclear use than is supported by
the political, strategic, technological, and normative factors that
actually exist is dangerous. Claims that norms of non-use have been
internalized]{.underline}, and identities [have been transformed to
reflect a taboo,]{.underline} threaten to lessen the attention paid by
policymakers to ensure that nuclear arms are not used. [[As political
and technical barriers to nuclear use are reduced]{.mark}, the
[strategic opportunities]{.mark} for use [multiply]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[A clear-eyed assessment of the interest driven, [conditional nature of
nuclear non-use is a]{.mark} necessary [foundation]{.mark} to
policymaking that aims to avoid nuclear detonation in the
future]{.underline}.

#### Counterforce targeting [massively]{.underline} limits fallout -- kills less than 700 people 

**Lieber and Press 9** \[Keir Lieber is Director of the Security Studies

Service at Georgetown University. He holds a joint appointment in the

Nukes We Need: Preserving the American Deterrent,"
https://www.jstor.org/stable/20699714?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\]

To illustrate the growth in U.S. counterforce capabilities, we applied a
set of simple formulas that analysts have used for decades to estimate
the effectiveness of counterforce attacks. We modeled a U.S. strike on a
small target set: 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles (icbms) in
hardened silos, the approximate size of China\'s current long range,
silo-based missile force. The analysis compared the capabilities of a
1985 Minuteman icbm to those of a modern Trident II submarine launched
ballistic missile.1 In 1985, a single U.S. icbm warhead had less than a
60 percent chance of destroying a typical silo. Even if four or five
additional warheads were used, the cumulative odds of destroying the
silo would never exceed 90 percent because of the problem of
\"fratricide,\" whereby incoming warheads destroy each other. Beyond
five warheads, adding more does no good. A probability of 90 percent
might sound high, but it falls far short if the goal is to completely
disarm a 90 percent chance of destroying each target, the odds of
destroying all 20 are roughly 12 percent. In 1985, then, a U.S. icbm
attack had little chance of destroying even a small enemy nuclear
arsenal. Today, a multiple-warhead attack on a single silo using a
Trident II missile would have a roughly 99 percent chance of destroying
it, and the probability that a barrage would destroy all 20 targets is
well above 95 percent. Given the accuracy of the U.S. military\'s
current delivery systems, the only question is target identification:
silos that can be found can be destroyed. During the Cold War, the
United States worked hard to pinpoint Soviet nuclear forces, with great
success. Locating potential adversaries\' small nuclear arsenals is
undoubtedly a top priority for U.S. intelligence today. The revolution
in accuracy is producing an even more momentous change: it is becoming
possible for the United States to conduct low yield nuclear counterforce
strikes that inflict . A U.S. Department or Defense computer model,
called for the United States to tne Hazard Prediction and Assessment
Conduct nuclear Strikes Capability (hpac), estimates the dispersion of
deadly radioactive fallout in a given region that inflict relatively few
after a nuclear detonation. [The software uses Casualties. the
warhead\'s explosive power, the height of the burst, and data about
local weather and demographics to estimate how much fallout would be
generated, where it would blow, and how many people it would injure or
kill.]{.underline} Hpac results can be chilling. In 2006, a team of
nuclear weapons analysts from the Federation of American Scientists
(fas) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (nrdc) used hpac to
estimate the consequences of a U.S. nuclear attack using high-yield
warheads against China\'s icbm field. Even though China\'s silos are
located in the countryside, [the]{.underline} [model predicted that the
fallout would blow over a large area, killing 3-4 million
people]{.underline}. U.S. counterforce capabilities were useless, the
study implied, because even a limited strike would kill an
unconscionable number of civilians. But [the United States can already
conduct nuclear counterforce strikes at a tiny fraction of the human
devastation that the fas/nrdc study predicted, and small additional
improvements to the U.S. force could dramatically reduce the potential
collateral damage even fur]{.underline}ther. The United States\'
[[nuclear weapons are now so accurate]{.mark} that it can conduct
successful counterforce attacks using the smallest-yield war heads in
the arsenal]{.underline}, rather than the huge warheads that the
fas/nrdc simulation modeled. [And to further reduce the fallout, [the
weapons can be set to detonate as airbursts, which would allow]{.mark}
most of [the radiation to dissipate in the upper atmosphere]{.mark}. We
ran multiple hpac scenarios against the identical target set used in the
fas/nrdc study but modeled low-yield airbursts rather than high-yield
groundbursts.]{.underline} **[[The fatality estimates plunged from 3-4
million to less than 700]{.underline}]{.mark}** [a figure comparable to
the number of civilians reportedly]{.underline} [killed]{.underline}
since 2006 in Pakistan [by U.S. drone strikes]{.underline}. One should
be skeptical about the results of any model that depends on
unpredictable factors, such as wind speed and direction. But in the
scenarios we modeled, the area of lethal fallout was so small that very
few civilians would have become ill or died, regardless of which way the
wind blew. Critics may cringe at this analysis. Many of them,
understandably, say that nuclear weapons are and should remain unusable.
But if the United States is to retain these weapons for the purpose of
deterring nuclear attacks, it needs a force that gives U.S. leaders
retaliatory options they might actually employ. If the only retaliatory
option entails killing millions of civilians, then the U.S. deterrent
will lack credibility. Giving U.S. leaders alternatives that do not
target civilians is both wise and just

#### If they're right, only city strikes can cause extinction 

**Armstrong 12** \[Stuart Armstrong, James Martin Research Fellow,
Future of Humanity Institute, University of Oxford, March 16, 2012, "Old
threats never die, they fade away from our minds: nuclear winter,"
<http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2012/03/old-threats-never-die-they-fade-away-from-our-minds-nuclear-winter>\]

In 1983, scientists published a paper on nuclear winter. This boosted
the death toll of all-out nuclear war from 'only' 200-500 million to the
very real possibility of the complete extinction of the human race\*.
But some argued the report was alarmist, and there did seem to be some
issues with the assumptions. So -- a military phenomena that might cause
megadeaths, possibly true but requiring further study, and a huge
research defense budget that could be used to look into this critical
phenomena and that was already spending millions on all aspects of
nuclear weapons -- can you guess what happened next? Correct -- the
issue was ignored for decades. For over twenty years, there were but a
tiny handful of papers on the most likely way we could end our own
existence, and a vague and persistent sense that nuclear winter had been
'disproved'. But in 2007, we finally had a proper followup -- [with the
help of modern computers, better models and better observations, what
can we now say]{.underline}? Well, that [nuclear winter is still a major
threat;]{.underline} the initial fear was right. Their most likely
scenario was: [A global average surface cooling of --7°C to --8°C
persists for years, and after a decade the cooling is still
--4°C]{.underline} \[...\]. Considering that [the global average cooling
at the depth of the last ice age 18,000 yr ago was about --5°C, **this
would be a climate change unprecedented**]{.underline} in speed and
amplitude in the history of the human race. The temperature changes are
largest over land \[...\] [Cooling of more than --20°C occurs over large
areas of North America and of more than --30°C over much of Eurasia,
including all agricultural regions.]{.underline} Also, [precipitation
would be cut in half and we'd lose most of the ozone layer]{.underline}.
But there was a more worrying development: it also seems that a
small-scale nuclear war could generate its own mini nuclear winter. It's
important to understand that [[**nuclear winter would not be a direct
consequences of the nuclear explosions, but of the burning of our
cities** in the wake of the war]{.mark} (given enough heat, even roads
and pavements will burn), [generating clouds of very black smoke that
rise into the stratosphere. The **clouds** do **need to reach these
heights: any lower and they'll get rained
out**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} This is what happened during the burning
of the Kuwaiti oil wells in 1991: Carl Sagan, one of the fathers of the
theory, predicted a nuclear winter-like scenario. But he wasn't paying
attention to the climate models: as they predicted, the local damage was
severe, but the smoke didn't reach the stratosphere, and global damage
was avoided.

[To [quantitatively account for]{.mark}]{.underline} natural and forced
[[variability in the climate system]{.mark}, we created two
ensembles]{.underline}, one for the natural, unforced system and a
second ensemble using a range of realistic vertical profiles for the BC
aerosol forcing, consistent with our detailed fire simulation. The
control ensemble was generated using small atmospheric temperature
perturbations (Kay et al., 2015). Notably, the overall spread of
anomalies in both ensembles is very similar. [These ensembles were then
used to create "super ensembles" using a statistical emulator, which
allows a robust statistical comparison of our simulated results with and
without the carbon forcing. Our]{.underline} primary [result
is]{.underline} the [**decreased impact on global climate indices**,
such as]{.underline} global average [surface temperature and
precipitation]{.underline}, relative to standard scenarios considered in
previous work (e.g., Robock et al., 2007a; Stenke et al., 2013; Mills et
al., 2014; Pausata et al., 2016). [With our finding of **substantially
less [BC]{.mark} aerosol [being lofted to stratospheric
heights]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., over a factor of four less than in
most of the scenarios considered by previous studies),
[these]{.underline} globally averaged [anomalies [drop to
**statistically insignificant levels**]{.mark} after the first several
years]{.underline} (Figures 14 and 16). [Our results are]{.underline}
generally [comparable to]{.underline} those predicted by
[other]{.underline} [studies]{.underline} that considered exchange
scenarios [in which only]{.underline} about [1 Tg of soot is emitted in
the upper troposphere]{.underline} (Robock et al., 2007a; Mills et al.,
2008; Stenke et al., 2013). There are more subtle suggestions of
regional effects, notably in the extent of the region over which sea
surface temperature differences between ensembles remain significant in
the final years of simulation (Figure 17). Further work is required to
adequately analyze these and other potential regional effects.
[[Historical analysis of several large volcanic eruptions
and]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[recent]{.mark}]{.underline} large
[[fire]{.mark} also [supports this result]{.mark}. For
example,]{.underline} Timmreck et al. (2010) claim that [nonlinear
[aerosol effects of the Toba Tuff eruption]{.mark}]{.underline} 74,000
years [ago [helped **limit significant global cooling**
i]{.underline}]{.mark}[mpacts to a **two-year time period** and that any
cooling beyond this time period could be due to other
effects]{.underline}. It should be noted that [this eruption was
estimated to have produced **106 Tg** of ash]{.underline} and comparable
amounts of other gases, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), [while [the
estimated amount of soot produced by a regional exchange is]{.mark} on
the order of **10 Tg**, or **[5 orders of magnitude smaller than the
ash]{.mark}**]{.underline} (not including gases) [**[produced by the
Toba eruption]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Noting that a nuclear exchange is
not identical to volcanic events, it has been asserted that [BC
particles produced by fires]{.underline} should [have a **greater impact
on**]{.underline} **[absorbing solar radiation]{.underline}**
[than]{.underline} even [has]{.underline} the [significantly larger
amounts of ash]{.underline} and various gases [produced by large
eruptions]{.underline} (e.g., Robock and Toon 2010). Likewise, [recent
work in analyzing BC emissions]{.underline} [from large fires suggests
that]{.underline} in such fires, [similar to large volcanic eruptions,
**[coating of soot]{.mark} particles with other particles**]{.underline}
in convective eddies **[[tends to increase their size and]{.mark} hence
increase their subsequent [rainout]{.mark}]{.underline}** (China et al.,
2013) [before they can reach the stratosphere]{.underline}. In fact, the

[Different types of]{.underline} possible [catastrophes suggest
different scenarios for how survival could happen on an island. What is
important is]{.underline} that [the island should have
properties]{.underline} [which]{.underline} [protect against the
specific dangers of]{.underline} particular global [catastrophic
risks]{.underline}. [Specifically, different islands will provide
protection against different risks, and their natural diversity will
contribute to a higher total level of protection:]{.underline}
**[Quarantined island survives pandemic]{.underline}** . An island could
impose effective quarantine [if it is sufficiently remote and
simultaneously able to protect itself]{.underline}, possibly using
military ships and air defense. **[Far northern aboriginal people
survive an ice age]{.underline}**. Many far [northern people have
adapted to survive in extremely cold]{.underline} and dangerous
[environments]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} under the right
circumstances [could]{.underline} potentially [survive the return of an
ice age]{.underline}. However, their cultures are endangered by
globalization. If these people become dependent on the products of
modern civilization, such as rifles and motor boats, and lose their
native survival skills, then their likelihood of surviving the collapse
of the outside world would decrease. Therefore, [preservation
of]{.underline} their [survival skills may be important as a defense
against the risks connected with **extreme cooling**.]{.underline}
[Remote polar island with high mountains survives]{.underline} brief
[global warming of]{.underline} median surface temperatures, [up to
50˚C]{.underline}. There is a theory that the climates of planets
similar to the Earth could have several semi-stable temperature levels
(Popp et al., 2016). If so, [because of climate change]{.underline}, the
[Earth could transition to a]{.underline} second semi-stable [state with
a median global temperature of around]{.underline} 330 K, about
[60˚C]{.underline}, or about [45˚C above current global mean
temperatures]{.underline}. But [even in this climate, **some regions of
Earth could still be survivable for humans**, such as the Himalayan
plateau at elevations above 4,000 m, but below 6,000]{.underline} (where
oxygen deficiency becomes a problem), [or on polar islands with
mountains]{.underline} (however, global warming affects polar regions
more than equatorial regions, and northern island will experience more
effects of climate change, including thawing permafrost and possible
landslides because of wetter weather). In the tropics, the combination
of increased humidity and temperature may increase the wet bulb
temperature above 36˚C, especially on islands, where sea moisture is
readily available. In such conditions, proper human perspiration becomes
impossible (Sherwood and Huber, 2010), and there will likely be
increased mortality and morbidity because of tropical diseases. [If
temperatures later returned to normal]{.underline} -- either naturally
or through climate engineering -- **[[the]{.mark} rest of the [Earth
could be repopulated]{.mark}.]{.underline}** ''Swiss Family Robinsons''

Most AI researchers ignore medium-term AI risks, which are neither
near-term risks, like unemployment, nor remote risks, like AI
superintelligence. But a large drone army -- if one were produced --
could receive a wrong command or be infected by a computer virus,
leading it to attack people indiscriminately. Remote islands without
robots could provide protection in this case, allowing survival until
such a drone army ran out of batteries, fuel, ammunition or other
supplies: [Primitive tribe survives civilizational

**Becker 18** \[Zachariah Becker, President of High Street Consulting

Essential Reference Guide, ABC-CLIO\]

**[Several studies]{.underline}** [on the possibility of nuclear winter
were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, the most]{.underline}
**[famous]{.underline}** [being]{.underline} the 19X3
**[[TTAPS]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Turco, Toon, Ackerman. Pollack, and
Sagan) study. [This [study incorporated]{.mark} factors such
as]{.underline} [[**forest fires**, burning]{.underline} [**fossil
fuels**, and intense]{.underline} **[smoke]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[covering the earth for periods lasting for]{.underline} [**weeks or
months**. The authors of the study further postulated that a period of
darkness would exist that could plunge average temperatures by as much
as 40 degrees Fahrenheit]{.underline} (thus, the term nuclear winter).
[[Many scientists]{.underline} **[disputed the
idea]{.underline}**]{.mark} of a nuclear winter, [saying that [it did
not follow normal meteorological processes]{.mark} and that the **[smoke
would quickly disperse]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In 1990, a more
detailed study (TTAPS 1990) incorporated extensive meteorological
modeling. Although the new study revealed that 10 25 percent of the
ejected soil would fall to the ground by immediate precipitation (black
rain, such as was seen at Hiroshima), it also showed that the smoke
would spread through different hemispheres, reducing temperatures within
one to two weeks. [The [long-term effects]{.mark} of a nuclear winter
could last from one to two years and [kill an
estimated]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[1]{.mark}-2 [billion
people]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Since the fall of the Soviet Union and
the slashing of strategic arsenals, [nuclear winter studies]{.mark} have
become **passe**. Almost all of them [were based on a nuclear exchange
in the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**5,000-megaton range**, which now

[In the case of]{.underline} high altitude [[nuclear bursts]{.mark},
two]{.underline} main [EMP types come into play]{.underline}, ["fast
pulse" and]{.underline} the ["slow pulse."]{.underline} The fast pulse
EMP field is created by gamma ray interaction with stratospheric air
molecules. It peaks at tens of kilovolts per meter in a few nanoseconds,
and lasts for a few hundred nanoseconds. The broad-band frequency
content of (0-1000 megahertz) enables it to couple to electrical and
electronic systems in general, regardless of the length of their
penetrating cables and antenna lines. Induced currents range into the
1,000s of amperes. The "slow pulse" EMP is caused by the distortion of
the earth's magnetic field lines due to the expanding nuclear fireball
and rising of heated and ionized layers of the ionosphere. These
[effects are limited to Earth\'s Ionosphere]{.underline}, a range of
altitude between 50 and 600 miles above the earth's surface. The
strength of EMP's are limited bt the Gamma ray release of the nuclear
explosion. [A bomb not specifically designed to enhance this will [not
normally result in a high field strength value and **the EMP will do
little permanent as a result.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

As an example, [the chart above shows the effect of prompt Gamma ray
output and how it affects field strength.]{.underline} \[67\] [The 1.4
MT Starfish Prime test produced a 1.4kt prompt Gamma Ray]{.underline}
output which resulted in a peak field strength of about 50,000 v/m.
[This is]{.underline} about [the minimum energy needed to do substantial
damage to a country\'s electrical systems but even at that level **many
things would be left unharmed** as the danger diminishes with distance.
Starfish produced the largest fields]{.underline} of the high-altitude
detonations; [they caused outages of the]{.underline} series-connected
[street-lighting systems]{.underline} of Oahu (Hawaii), [probable
failure of a microwave repeating station on Kauai]{.underline}, [failure
of the input stages]{.underline} of ionospheric sounders [and damage to
rectifiers]{.underline} in communication receivers, Other than the
failure of the microwave link, no problem was noted in the telephone
system. No failure was noted in the telemetry systems used for data
transmission on board the many instrumentation rockets. [There was [no
apparent increase in radio or television repairs]{.mark}]{.underline}
subsequent to any of the Johnson Island detonations. [The [failures
observed were generally in the unprotected input stages of

transients on the power line probably caused the rectifier failures.
There was one failure in the unprotected part of an electronic system of
the LASL Optical Station on top of Mount Haleakala on Maui Island.\[68\]
DoD EMP SIMULATIONS TESTS [[We tested]{.mark}]{.underline} a sample of
[[37 cars in an EMP simulation]{.mark} laboratory]{.underline}, with
automobile vintages ranging from 1986 through 2002. \... [The most
[serious effect observed on running automobiles was that the motors in
three cars stopped]{.mark} at]{.underline} field strengths of
approximately [30 kV/m or above]{.underline}. [In an actual EMP
exposure, these vehicles would glide to a stop and require the driver to
restart them.]{.underline} Electronics in the dashboard of one
automobile were damaged and required repair. [Based on these test
results, we expect few automobile effects at EMP field levels below 25
kV/m]{.underline}. Approximately 10 percent or more of the automobiles
exposed to higher field levels may experience serious EMP effects,
including engine stall, that require driver intervention to correct.
[Five of the 18 trucks tested did not exhibit any anomalous response up
to]{.underline} field strengths of approximately [50 kV/m. Based on
these test results, we expect few truck effects at EMP field levels
below approximately 12 kV/m]{.underline}. At higher field levels, 70
percent or more of the trucks on the road will manifest some anomalous
response following EMP exposure. Approximately 15 percent or more of the
trucks will experience engine stall, sometimes with permanent damage
that the driver cannot correct. Results indicate that some computer
failures can be expected at relatively low EMP field levels of 3 to 6
kilovolts per meter (kV/m). At higher field levels, additional failures
are likely in computers, routers, network switches, and keyboards
embedded in the computer-aided dispatch, public safety radio, and mobile
data communications equipment. \... none of the radios showed any damage
with EMP fields up to 50 kV/m. While many of the operating radios
experienced latching upsets at 50 kV/m field levels, these were
correctable by turning power off and then on.\[69\] [[Contrary
to]{.mark} many [sensational headlines, **the US Military is well
protected from most EMP's**. ]{.mark}]{.underline}For decades now the
military has defined systems around survivability. The details of such
are contained here: E.6 Military Standards [DTRA]{.underline} and its
predecessor agencies have [developed, and regularly update]{.underline},
[military standards]{.underline} (MIL-STDs) [designed to aid
in]{.underline} the design, development, test, and evaluation of [DoD
systems subjected to nuclear and EMP environments. These MIL-STDs cover
nuclear-generated **EMP survivability of aircraft, maritime, and other
systems** in coordination with the Air Force and the Navy]{.underline},
as well as the broader community of stakeholders. The following are some
of the relevant MIL-STDs: [MIL-STD-1766]{.underline}, Nuclear Hardness
and Survivability Program Requirements for ICBM Weapon Systems [defines
nuclear hardness and survivability requirements and practices for use
during]{.underline} the concept exploration, demonstration and
validation, full-scale development, [production, and

life-cycle of [ICBM weapon systems. MIL-STD-2169C]{.underline}, HEMP
Environment Standard (Classified) [defines high-altitude EMP
environments for]{.underline} system hardness [design and
testing]{.underline}. [MIL-STD-3023,]{.underline} HEMP Protection for
Military Aircraft [establishes]{.underline} design margin, [performance
metrics, and]{.underline} test [protocols for]{.underline} HEMP
[protection of military aircraft with nuclear EMP
survivability]{.underline} at three hardness levels. This MIL-STD may
also be used for aircraft that support multiple missions. Subsystems of
the aircraft required to fully comply with the provisions of the
standard are designated as Mission-Critical Subsystems having a HEMP
survivability requirement. This approach also allows for consideration
of platforms not yet addressed in this standard, such as Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles. MIL-STD-188-125, HEMP Protection for Ground-Based C4I
Facilities Performing Critical, Time Urgent Missions is in the process
of being updated. DTRA is investigating present capabilities and
shortfalls of power filters as well as utilizing test results from EMP
simulators. [MIL-STD-4023]{.underline}, Maritime EMP Standard
[establishes performance metrics]{.underline}, test protocols, and
hardness margin levels [for HEMP protection of military surface
ships]{.underline} that must function when subjected to a HEMP
environment. Satellite System Nuclear Survivability ([SSNS]{.underline})
Environment Standard [defines nuclear weapon environment levels for
evaluating satellite system performance in nuclear
scenarios.]{.underline} Comprehensive Atmospheric Nuclear Environments
Standard (CANES) provides detailed nuclear environments and effects for
a number of different nuclear weapon-types as a function of height of
burst. A supplement to this MIL-STD covers nuclear-disturbed
communication environments and nuclear ground burst environments.\[70\]
[[DoD]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[adopted protective priorities using
commercial]{.mark}]{.underline} protective
[[equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Department of Defense (DoD) has
experience in prioritizing and protecting systems since the 1960s. [The
DoD has prioritized and has protected selected systems against
EMP]{.underline} (and, by similitude to E3, GMD effects). DoD places
emphasis on protecting its strategic triad and associated command,
control, communications, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems.
**[Nuclear EMP will burn]{.underline}** out **[every exposed electronic
system is FALSE]{.underline}**. [The DoD and Congressional
EMP]{.underline} Commission's EMP [test data demonstrates that smaller,
self-contained systems that are not connected to long-lines tend **not
to be affected by EMP fields**]{.underline}**.** [Examples]{.underline}
of such systems [include vehicles, hand-held radios, and disconnected
portable generators]{.underline}. If there is an effect on these
systems, it is more often temporary upset rather than component burnout.
\[71\] The NRC on Nuclear Power Facilities Vulnerabilities "[The [most
probable effect of EMP on a modern nuclear power plant is an unscheduled
shutdown]{.mark}]{.underline}. EMP may also cause an extended shutdown
by the unnecessary activation of some safety-related systems. In
general, [EMP would be a nuisance to nuclear plants, **but it is [not
considered a serious threat to plant safety]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Counter-measures to minimize the effects of EMP have been recommended.
Implementation of these recommendations would also increase the
protection of the plant against damage by lightning, switching, and
electromagnetic interference transients as well as general failures in
electrical, control, and instrument power. "\[72\] As part of a larger
EMP study in the 1980's [Sandia Laboratories analyzed the **"worst case"
scenario** and concluded that **EMP poses no substantial threat
to**]{.underline} such ([**nuclear) plants** based upon both analysis
and simulated EMP tests]{.underline}.\[73\] The NRC's current statement
The NRC requires U.S. nuclear power plants to be able to shut down
safely in the face of many extreme events -- tornados, hurricanes and
earthquakes. But the NRC also takes into account far more unusual
events, like solar flares and man-made electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Both
can affect generators, transformers and other parts of the electric grid
-- which in turn could affect nuclear power plants. [The NRC has been
examining]{.underline} these [issues for more than 30
years]{.underline}, starting in the late 1970s when the agency studied
how EMP could affect nuclear power plant safe-shutdown systems. In
February 1983 [the]{.underline} NRC issued the study's [conclusion:
nuclear power plants' safety systems can do their jobs after an EMP
event.]{.underline} The agency revisited the issue in 2007 to account
for the increasing use of digital computer systems in nuclear plants,
which potentially could be more susceptible to EMP. [The agency
continued to conclude as recently as two years ago that nuclear power
plants can safely shut down following an EMP event.]{.underline}
Additional research in 2010 analyzed and compared solar or
geomagnetically-induced current events to those of the EMP events
previously analyzed. This work led to the same conclusion as the EMP
studies -- U.S. nuclear power plants can safely shut down if a solar
storm disrupts the grid. The edge of the NRC's authority lies in a
nuclear power plant's electric switchyard, where our rules mesh with
those of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the
nation's electric grids. Another body, the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation develops and enforces grid reliability
standards. The NRC works closely with FERC and NERC on grid reliability
issues, including the effects of solar or geomagnetic storms and EMP. In
2015 FERC began the process of creating reliability standards to protect
the grid against these events.\[74\] This new standard was made into law
on November, 17, 2016.\[75\]\[76\] The NRC continues to update operator
guidelines and requirements with changes in technology or new
understandings on issues previously not covered such as the events at
Fukushima in 2011. Safety enhancements on topics like spent fuel cooling
pools are covered in regular NRC updates, the latest being 2015 titled
Mitigation of Beyond-Design-Basis Events\[77\] . EMP Comparisons with
lightning Lightning shares many of characteristics of E2, but contrary
to what is often quoted, its magnitude can exceed even the peak E1
fields in the discharge region. Research on lightning indicates that a
stroke may contain significant components with rise-time of less than
10−7 sec and electric fields greater than 106V/m---more than a order of
magnitude greater than even the highest peak E1 fields, from the biggest
nuclear devices. The implications of lightning research for EMP
vulnerability is a critical topic to include in any future peer-reviewed
study of the EMP threat.\[78\]

#### No meltdown impact

**Kaiser 11** \[Tiffany, Writer for Daily Tech, citing Nuclear
Regulatory Commission Report, August 2, 2011, "NRC: Far Fewer People

The nuclear crisis at Fukushima Daiichi in Japan has caused a nuclear
frenzy where leaders around the world are questioning the safety of
their plants. For instance, French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for
global nuclear review after visiting Japan, and U.S. senators demanded
that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) repeat an expensive
inspection of the country\'s nuclear power. But now, [[the NRC]{.mark}
is close to [completing a **large nuclear study** that]{.mark} may
[ease]{.mark} a few [worried minds]{.mark}]{.underline}. The NRC has
been working with Sandia National Laboratories (a Department of Energy
lab) on a [study that revises previous projections of how quickly and
how much cesium 137, which is a radioactive material made when uranium
is split, could release from a plant after a nuclear core
meltdown]{.underline}. The NRC has been working on the study for six
years, and it will not be completely finished until next spring. But the
nuclear watchdog group, Union of Concerned Scientists, has [obtained an
early copy of the report through a Freedom of Information Act
request]{.underline}. The new study is based on how much and how quickly
cesium 137 could escape an American nuclear plant if a total blackout
were to occur[. A total blackout means complete loss of power from the
grid, and backup diesel generators and batteries have failed as well.
This leads to a nuclear meltdown]{.underline}. NRC scientists said that
[a total blackout would be rare]{.underline} at an American plant, but
it is better to be safe than sorry. In addition, the NRC wanted to
update previous projections related to cesium 137. The NRC focused on
two different types of reactors in the U.S.: the Peach Bottom Atomic
Power Station in Pennsylvania, which has boiling-water reactors like
Fukushima Daiichi, and the Surry Power Station in Virginia, which has
pressurized-water reactors[. **[Over 100 different plants were
studied]{.mark}**. Through computer models and engineering analyses, the
NRC has concluded that the [meltdown of a typical American reactor would
lead to \"far fewer deaths\" than previously
thought]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to the new study, [[only 1 to 2
percent of]{.mark} a reactor core\'s [cesium]{.mark} 137 [could escape
during a total blackout]{.mark}]{.underline}. Previous [NRC estimates
concluded that 60 percent of the cesium inventory could
escape]{.underline}. In addition, the new study found that one person in
every 4,348 within a 10-mile radius of a nuclear meltdown would develop
a \"latent cancer\" from radiation exposure. In previous estimates, it
was one person in every 167. The NRC said that [[large releases of
radioactive material would not be \"immediate]{.mark},\" meaning that
people within a 10-mile radius would have plenty of time to evacuate the
premises]{.underline}. It concluded that [[the **chance of
death**]{.mark} **from acute radiation exposure** within a 10-mile
radius **[would be near zero]{.mark}**,]{.underline} but some would be
exposed to high enough doses to experience fatal cancers decades later.
\"Accidents progress more slowly, in some cases much more slowly, than
previously assumed,\" said Charles G. Tinkler, a senior adviser for
research on severe accidents and an author of the study. \"Releases are
smaller, and in some cases much smaller, of certain key radioactive
materials.\"

Another major threat to ozone comes from nuclear explosions. [Nitric
oxide is produced]{.underline} essentially [by the \'burning\' of
nitrogen in the atmosphere,]{.underline} and [this occurs]{.underline}
whenever air temperatures are sufficiently hot: in automobile engines,
in aircraft engines and [in nuclear explosions]{.underline}. Studies of
the creation of oxides of nitrogen by nuclear explosions were first
undertaken as part of the SST debate, to determine whether the nuclear
weapons tests in the 1950s and 1960s had reduced observed ozone
levels.\[28\] It was only in 1974 that John Hampson made a point which
had been overlooked, namely that large-scale nuclear war could cause a
major and disastrous reduction in ozone levels.\[29\] Calculations made
in the mid-1970s assuming large nuclear arsenals with many high-yield
explosions concluded that reductions of ozone could reach 50 per cent or
more in the northern hemisphere, with smaller reductions in the southern
hemisphere.\[30\] But [[since the number of high-yield weapons]{.mark}
in [present]{.mark} nuclear arsenals [is]{.mark} now [smaller, much less
oxides of nitrogen would be deposited]{.mark} in the stratosphere by
nuclear war [than assumed]{.mark} in earlier calculations, [and so
significant]{.mark} [ozone reductions are
unlikely]{.mark}.]{.underline}\[31\] This conclusion remains tentative.
The actual behaviour of stratospheric ozone is quite complicated,
involving many chemical compounds and numerous chemical reactions, the
changing effects of temperature, the angle and intensity of sunlight,
and the effect of air motions. Computer models of the effects of nuclear
war on ozone are able to take into account only a part of this
complexity, and new information about chemical reaction rates in
particular have led in the past to periodic revisions in the calculated
effects of added oxides of nitrogen. [If significant ozone reduction did
occur, the most important direct effect on humans would be an increase
in skin cancer]{.underline}. However, [this is seldom lethal, and could
be avoided by reducing exposure to sunlight.]{.underline} Potentially
more serious would be effects on crops.\[32\] Some of the important
grains, for example, are sensitive to uv. Whether the net effects on
crop yields would be significant is hard to estimate. But [whatever the
reduction in ozone, [ozone levels would return pretty much to normal
after a few years]{.mark}.]{.underline}\[9\] It seems unlikely that [in
the context of a major nuclear war the changes in uv alone would be of
serious concern]{.underline}. In particular, [[the threat of **human
extinction** raised by]{.underline}]{.mark} Jonathan
[[Schell]{.mark}]{.underline} in The Fate of the Earth,\[33\] based
mostly on effects of increased uv from ozone reduction, [[seems **very
small**]{.mark} indeed. It is sometimes claimed that nuclear war could
destroy ozone to such an extent that humans and animals would be blinded
by excess uv. Even if large numbers of high-yield weapons were exploded,
this possibility seems very unlikely except for a contribution to snow
blindness in the far north. [Stratospheric ozone can never be completely
removed]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} but at most reduced greatly.
[[Even if a **50 per cent**]{.mark} or more [reduction]{.mark} in ozone
[occurred]{.mark}]{.underline} - and as noted [this seems improbable
with present nuclear arsenals - [protection]{.mark} from uv for humans
[could be obtained from **sunglasses**]{.mark} or just ordinary glasses,
which absorb uv. [For animals]{.mark}]{.underline}, the following
considerations are relevant. [[Ozone levels vary considerably]{.mark}
from place to place and from time to time]{.underline}, both seasonally
and daily (sometimes by up to 50 per cent). Sunlight at the equator
typically passes through only half as much ozone as at the
mid-latitudes, yet animals at the equator are not known to go blind more
often than elsewhere. Furthermore, [[most ozone reductions]{.mark} from
a nuclear war [would be in the mid and high latitudes, where ozone
levels are higher to start with]{.mark} [and]{.mark} where the [\'path
length\' of sunlight]{.mark} through ozone [is increased]{.mark} due to
its oblique angle of incidence]{.underline}. But this does not mean
complacency is warranted, as the concerns of John Hampson illustrate.

#### The ozone layer doesn't matter

Sciences, The Times. September 15, 2014. "The ozone hole isn't fixed.

[How much damage did the ozone hole ever threaten to do
anyway?]{.underline} It is fascinating to go back and read what the
usual hyperventilating eco-exaggerators said about ozone thinning in the
1980s. [As a result of the extra ultraviolet light coming through the
Antarctic ozone hole, [southernmost parts of Patagonia and New Zealand
see about 12 per cent more UV light]{.mark} than expected]{.underline}.
This means that the weak September sunshine, **[[though it feels much
the same]{.underline}]{.mark}**, has the power to cause sunburn more
like that of latitudes a few hundred miles north. **[[Hardly
Armageddon]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The New York Times reported "an
increase in Twilight Zone-type reports of sheep and rabbits with
cataracts" in southern Chile. Not to be outdone, Al Gore wrote that
"hunters now report finding blind rabbits; fisherman catch blind
salmon". [[Zoologists]{.mark} briefly [blamed the near extinction of
many amphibian species on thin ozone]{.mark}. Melanoma in people was
also said to be on the rise as a result.]{.underline} [**[This was
nonsense]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Frogs were dying out because of a
fungal disease spread from Africa --- nothing to do with ozone. Rabbits
and fish blinded by]{.underline} a little [extra sunlight proved to
be]{.underline} as [mythical]{.underline} as unicorns. An eye disease in
Chilean sheep was happening outside the ozone-depleted zone and was
caused by an infection called pinkeye --- nothing to do with UV light.
[And [melanoma incidence in people actually levelled out during the
period when the ozone got thinner]{.mark}.]{.underline} Then remember
that [the ozone hole appears when the sky is dark all day, and over an
uninhabited continent.]{.underline} **[[Even if it persists into the
Antarctic spring and spills north briefly, the hole allows 50 times less
ultraviolet light through than would hit your skin at the equator at sea
level]{.underline}]{.mark}** (let alone at a high altitude) in the
tropics. So [it would be bonkers to worry about UV as you sailed round
Cape Horn in spring, say, but not when you stopped at the Galapagos: the
skin cancer risk is 50 times higher in the latter place.]{.underline}

the remainder of 2018, nor has the Kremlin offered a concrete
development timeline. So, [where is Sarmat? Potentially **right around
the corner**, according to a recent series of Kremlin
statements.]{.underline} At a [Kremlin military
ceremony](https://ria.ru/20190411/1552596646.html) held last week, Putin
gave a speech on the need to "meld Russian military tradition with the
latest, cutting-edge knowledge, technology, and ability to effectively
apply them..." Recounting the recent examples in this vein, Putin
mentioned that "Kinzhal" hypersonic missiles and the "Peresvet" laser
system are already being delivered to the Russian armed forces before
briefly turning to Sarmat, which
[he [announced](https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/6323225) is "successfully
undergoing final testing."]{.underline} "Successfully undergoing final
testing" is a carefully worded statement if there ever was one. This can
suggest any number of timelines, depending on the scale of the "final
testing" and how far along Sarmat is in that process; [it can put
Sarmat's delivery date anywhere from right-around-the-corner to several
years away.]{.underline} Skepticism would not be wholly unfounded, given
Sarmat's prolific history of delays. Ejection tests originally slated
for 2015 were pushed back to 2016, and [then

technical flaws with the ejection mechanism, further complicating Sarmat

situation with [the

casts this timeline in a justifiably dubious light, though more recent

newfound cause for optimism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Several months ago,
Chairman of the Scientific and Technical Council at Roscosmos [Yuri
Koptev](http://tass.com/defense/1043450) suggested that Russian
engineers had finally managed to put Sarmat's technical troubles behind
them: \"A very serious stage was held last year. This involved pop-up
tests, which confirmed the correctness of all the basic technical
solutions." The nature of these "technical solutions" is unknown, but
they seem compelling enough to Roscosmos CEO Dmitry Ragozin, who
personally reassured Putin in early February that the testing is
proceeding as planned and will wrap up by 2020.

risers]{.underline}** alike, **[such signals are

uncertain about any rising state's future intentions. This exacerbates
the security dilemma, and gives declining states strong incentives to
take preventive action even against risers that have exhibited
cooperative behavior.

[The no-rubble simulation produces]{.underline} a [significantly more
intense fire]{.underline}, [with more]{.underline} fire
[spread]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} consequently [a significantly
stronger plume with larger amounts of BC reaching into the upper
atmosphere]{.underline} than the simulation with rubble, illustrated in
Figure 5. [While the no-rubble simulation **represents [the worst-case
scenario]{.mark}** involving vigorous fire activity]{.underline},
[**[only a relatively small amount of carbon makes its way into the
stratosphere]{.mark}**]{.underline} during the course of the simulation.
But while small compared to the surface BC mass, stratospheric BC
amounts from the current simulations are significantly higher than what
would be expected from burning vegetation such as trees (Heilman et al.,
2014), e.g., the higher energy density of the building fuels and the
initial fluence from the weapon produce an intense response within
HIGRAD with initial updrafts of order 100 m/s in the lower troposphere.
Or, in comparison to a mass fire, wildfires will burn only a small
amount of fuel in the corresponding time period (roughly 10 minutes)
that a nuclear weapon fluence can effectively ignite a large area of
fuel producing an impressive atmospheric response. Figure 6 shows
[vertical profiles of BC]{.underline} multiplied by 100 (number of
cities involved in the exchange) from the two simulations. The total
amount of BC produced is in line with previous estimates (about 3.69 Tg
from no-rubble simulation); however, the majority of BC
[reside]{.underline}s **[below the stratosphere]{.underline}** (3.46 Tg
below 12 km) [and can be **readily impacted by scavenging from
precipitation** either via pyro-cumulonimbus produced by the fire
itself]{.underline} (not modeled) [or other synoptic weather
systems]{.underline}. While the impact on climate of these more
realistic profiles will be explored in the next section, it should be
mentioned that [**[these estimates are]{.mark} still [at the high
end]{.mark}**, [considering the inherent simplifications]{.mark} in the
combustion model [that lead to **overestimating BC
production**]{.mark}.]{.underline} 3.3 Climate Results [Long-term
[climatic effects]{.mark} critically [depend on]{.mark}]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} initial injection [[height]{.mark} of the soot, with
larger quantities reaching the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere
inducing a greater cooling impact because of longer residence
times]{.underline} (Robock et al., 2007a). Absorption of solar radiation
by the BC aerosol and its subsequent radiative cooling tends to heat the
surrounding air, driving an initial upward diffusion of the soot plumes,
an effect that depends on the initial aerosol concentrations. [**[Mixing
and sedimentation]{.mark}**]{.underline} tend to [[**reduce this
process**, and low altitude emissions are]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[significantly impacted by precipitation]{.underline}]{.mark} if aging
of the BC aerosol occurs on sufficiently rapid timescales. But once at
stratospheric altitudes, aerosol dilution via coagulation is hindered by
low particulate concentrations (e.g., Robock et al., 2007a) and lofting
to much higher altitudes is inhibited by gravitational settling in the
low-density air (Stenke et al., 2013), resulting in more stable BC
concentrations over long times. [[Of the initial BC]{.mark}]{.underline}
mass [released in the atmosphere]{.underline}, most of which is emitted
below 9 km, [**[70% rains out within the first month]{.mark}** and
78%]{.underline}, or about 2.9 Tg, [is removed within the first two
months]{.underline} (Figure 7, solid line), with the remainder (about
0.8 Tg, dashed line) being transported above about 12 km (200 hPa)
within the first week. This outcome differs from the findings of, e.g.,
Stenke et al. (2013, their high BC-load cases) and Mills et al. (2014),
who found that most of the BC mass (between 60 and 70%) is lifted in the
stratosphere within the first couple of weeks. This can also be seen in
Figure 8 (red lines) and in Figure 9, which include results from our
calculation with the initial BC distribution from Mills et al. (2014).
In that case, only 30% of the initial BC mass rains out in the
troposphere during the first two weeks after the exchange, with the
remainder rising to the stratosphere. In the study of Mills et al.
(2008) this percentage is somewhat smaller, about 20%, and smaller still
in the experiments of Robock et al. (2007a) in which the soot is
initially emitted in the upper troposphere or higher. In Figure 7, the
e-folding timescale for the removal of tropospheric soot, here
interpreted as the time required for an initial drop of a factor e, is
about one week. This result compares favorably with the "LT" experiment
of Robock et al. (2007a), considering 5 Tg of BC released in the lower
troposphere, in which 50% of the aerosols are removed within two weeks.
By contrast, the initial e-folding timescale for the removal of
stratospheric soot in Figure 8 is about 4.2 years (blue solid line),
compared to about 8.4 years for the calculation using Mills et al.
(2014) initial BC emission (red solid line). The removal timescale from
our forced ensemble simulations is close to those obtained by Mills et
al. (2008) in their 1 Tg experiment, by Robock et al. (2007a) in their
experiment "UT 1 Tg", and © 2018 American Geophysical Union. All rights
reserved. by Stenke et al. (2013) in their experiment "Exp1", in all of
which 1 Tg of soot was emitted in the atmosphere in the aftermath of the
exchange. Notably, the e-folding timescale for the decline of the BC
mass in Figure 8 (blue solid line) is also close to the value of about 4
years quoted by Pausata et al. (2016) for their long-term "intermediate"
scenario. In that scenario, which is also based on 5 Tg of soot
initially distributed as in Mills et al. (2014), the factor-of2 shorter
residence time of the aerosols is caused by particle growth via
coagulation of BC with organic carbon. Figure 9 shows the BC mass-mixing
ratio, horizontally averaged over the globe, as a function of
atmospheric pressure (height) and time. [The BC
distributions]{.underline} used [in]{.underline} our
[simulations]{.underline} [imply that]{.underline} the [upward transport
of particles]{.underline} [is substantially less efficient compared to
the case in]{.underline} [which]{.underline} 5 Tg of [BC is directly
injected into the upper troposphere]{.underline}. The semiannual cycle
of lofting and sinking of the aerosols is associated with atmospheric
heating and cooling during the solstice in each hemisphere (Robock et
al., 2007a). During the first year, the oscillation amplitude in our
forced ensemble simulations is particularly large during the summer
solstice, compared to that during the winter solstice (see bottom panel
of Figure 9), because of the higher soot concentrations in the Northern
Hemisphere, as can be seen in Figure 11 (see also left panel of Figure
12). Comparing the top and bottom panels of Figure 9, the BC reaches the
highest altitudes during the first year in both cases, but the
concentrations at 0.1 hPa in the top panel can be 200 times as large.
Qualitatively, [the difference can be understood in terms of the air
temperature increase caused by BC radiation emission]{.underline},
[which is several tens of kelvin degrees in]{.underline} the
[simulations]{.underline} [of Robock]{.underline} et al. (2007a, see
their Figure 4), [Mills]{.underline} et al. (2008, see their Figure 5),
[Stenke]{.underline} et al. (2013, see high-load cases in their Figure
4), Mills et al. (2014, see their Figure 7), [and Pausata]{.underline}
et al. (2016, see one-day emission cases in their Figure 1), [due to
high BC concentrations, but]{.underline} it [amounts to only about 10 K
in our]{.underline} forced [ensemble simulations]{.underline}, as
illustrated in Figure 10. Results similar to those presented in Figure
10 were obtained from the experiment "Exp1" performed by Stenke et al.
(2013, see their Figure 4). [**In that scenario as well, somewhat less
that 1 Tg of BC remained in the atmosphere after the initial
rainout**.]{.underline} As mentioned before, the BC aerosol that remains
in the atmosphere, lifted to stratospheric heights by the rising soot
plumes, undergoes sedimentation over a timescale of several years
(Figures 8 and 9). This mass represents the effective amount of BC that
can force climatic changes over multi-year timescales. In the forced
ensemble simulations, it is about 0.8 Tg after the initial rainout,
whereas it is about 3.4 Tg in the simulation with an initial soot
distribution as in Mills et al. (2014). Our more realistic source
simulation involves the worstcase assumption of no-rubble (along with
other assumptions) and hence serves as an upper bound for the impact on
climate. As mentioned above and further discussed below, our scenario
induces perturbations on the climate system similar to those found in
previous studies in which the climatic response was driven by roughly 1
Tg of soot rising to stratospheric heights following the exchange.
Figure 11 illustrates the vertically integrated mass-mixing ratio of BC
over the globe, at various times after the exchange for the simulation
using the initial BC distribution of Mills et al. (2014, upper panels)
and as an average from the forced ensemble members (lower panels). All
simulations predict enhanced concentrations at high latitudes during the
first year after the exchange. In the cases shown in the top panels,
however, these high concentrations persist for several years (see also
Figure 1 of Mills et al., 2014), whereas the forced ensemble simulations
indicate that the BC concentration starts to decline after the first
year. In fact, in the simulation represented in the top panels,
mass-mixing ratios larger than about 1 kg of BC © 2018 American
Geophysical Union. All rights reserved. per Tg of air persist for well
over 10 years after the exchange, whereas they only last for 3 years in
our forced simulations (compare top and middle panels of Figure 9).
After the first year, values drop below 3 kg BC/Tg air, whereas it takes
about 8 years to reach these values in the simulation in the top panels
(see also Robock et al., 2007a). Over crop-producing, midlatitude
regions in the Northern Hemisphere, the BC loading is reduced from more
than 0.8 kg BC/Tg air in the simulation in the top panels to 0.2-0.4 kg
BC/Tg air in our forced simulations (see middle and right panels). The
more rapid clearing of the atmosphere in the forced ensemble is also
signaled by the soot optical depth in the visible radiation spectrum,
which drops below values of 0.03 toward the second half of the first
year at mid latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, and everywhere on the
globe after about 2.5 years (without never attaining this value in the
Southern Hemisphere). In contrast, the soot optical depth in the
calculation shown in the top panels of Figure 11 becomes smaller than
0.03 everywhere only after about 10 years. The two cases show a similar
tendency, in that the BC optical depth is typically lower between
latitudes 30º S-30º N than it is at other latitudes. This behavior is
associated to the persistence of stratospheric soot toward
high-latitudes and the Arctic/Antarctic regions, as illustrated by the
zonally-averaged, column-integrated mass-mixing ratio of the BC in
Figure 12 for both the forced ensemble simulations (left panel) and the
simulation with an initial 5 Tg BC emission in the upper troposphere
(right panel). The spread in the globally averaged (near) surface
temperature of the atmosphere, from the control (left panel) and forced
(right panel) ensembles, is displayed in Figure 13. For each month, the
plots show the largest variations (i.e., maximum and minimum values),
within each ensemble of values obtained for that month, relative to the
mean value of that month. The plot also shows yearly-averaged data
(thinner lines). The spread is comparable in the control and forced
ensembles, with average values calculated over the 33-years run length
of 0.4-0.5 K. This spread is also similar to the internal variability of
the globally averaged surface temperature quoted for the NCAR Large
Ensemble Community Project (Kay et al., 2015). These results imply that
surface air temperature differences, between forced and control
simulations, which lie within the spread may not be distinguished from
effects due to internal variability of the two simulation ensembles.
Figure 14 shows the difference in the globally averaged surface
temperature of the atmosphere (top panel), net solar radiation flux at
surface (middle panel), and precipitation rate (bottom panel), computed
as the (forced minus control) difference in ensemble mean values. The
sum of standard deviations from each ensemble is shaded. Differences are
qualitatively significant over the first few years, when the anomalies
lie near or outside the total standard deviation. Inside the shaded
region, differences may not be distinguished from those arising from the
internal variability of one or both ensembles. The surface solar flux
(middle panel) is the quantity that appears most affected by the BC
emission, with qualitatively significant differences persisting for
about 5 years. The precipitation rate (bottom panel) is instead affected
only at the very beginning of the simulations. The red lines in all
panels show the results from the simulation applying the initial BC
distribution of Mills et al. (2014), where the period of significant
impact is much longer owing to the higher altitude of the initial soot
distribution that results in longer residence times of the BC aerosol in
the atmosphere. When yearly averages of the same quantities are
performed over the IndiaPakistan region, the differences in ensemble
mean values lie within the total standard deviations of the two
ensembles. The results in Figure 14 can also be compared to the outcomes
of other previous studies. In their experiment "UT 1 Tg", Robock et al.
(2007a) found that, when only 1 Tg of soot © 2018 American Geophysical
Union. All rights reserved. remains in the atmosphere after the initial
rainout, temperature and precipitation anomalies are about 20% of those
obtained from their standard 5 Tg BC emission case. Therefore, the
largest differences they observed, during the first few years after the
exchange, were about - 0.3 K and -0.06 mm/day, respectively, comparable
to the anomalies in the top and bottom panels of Figure 14. Their
standard 5 Tg emission case resulted in a solar radiation flux anomaly
at surface of -12 W/m2 after the second year (see their Figure 3),
between 5 and 6 time as large as the corresponding anomalies from our
ensembles shown in the middle panel. In their experiment "Exp1", Stenke
et al. (2013) reported global mean surface temperature anomalies not
exceeding about 0.3 K in magnitude and precipitation anomalies hovering
around -0.07 mm/day during the first few years, again consistent with
the results of Figure 14. In a recent study, Pausata et al. (2016)
considered the effects of an admixture of BC and organic carbon
aerosols, both of which would be emitted in the atmosphere in the
aftermath of a nuclear exchange. In particular, they concentrated on the
effects of coagulation of these aerosol species and examined their
climatic impacts. The initial BC distribution was as in Mills et al.
(2014), although the soot burden was released in the atmosphere over
time periods of various lengths. Most relevant to our and other previous
work are their one-day emission scenarios. They found that, during the
first year, the largest values of the atmospheric surface temperature
anomalies ranged between about -0.5 and -1.3 K, those of the sea surface
temperature anomalies ranged between -0.2 and -0.55 K, and those of the
precipitation anomalies varied between -0.15 and -0.2 mm/day. All these
ranges are compatible with our results shown in Figure 14 as red lines
and with those of Mills et al. (2014, see their Figures 3 and 6). As
already mentioned in Section 2.3, the net solar flux anomalies at
surface are also consistent. [This]{.underline} overall agreement
[suggests that [the **inclusion of organic carbon aerosols**]{.mark}**,
and** ensuing **coagulation** with BC, **[should not dramatically alter
the climatic effects]{.mark}** resulting from our forced ensemble
simulations. Moreover, [aerosol growth]{.mark} would likely **[shorten
the residence time of the BC]{.mark} particulate in the
atmosphere**]{.underline} (Pausata et al., 2016), possibly **[reducing
the duration of these effects.]{.underline}**

[Different types of]{.underline} possible [catastrophes suggest
different scenarios for how survival could happen on an island. What is
important is]{.underline} that [the island should have
properties]{.underline} [which]{.underline} [protect against the
specific dangers of]{.underline} particular global [catastrophic
risks]{.underline}. [Specifically, different islands will provide
protection against different risks, and their natural diversity will
contribute to a higher total level of protection:]{.underline}
**[[Quarantined island survives pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline}** . An
island could impose effective quarantine [if it is sufficiently remote
and simultaneously able to protect itself]{.underline}, possibly using
military ships and air defense. **[[Far northern aboriginal people
survive an ice age]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Many far [[northern people
have adapted to survive in extremely cold]{.underline}]{.mark} and
dangerous [[environments]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} under
the right circumstances [could]{.underline} potentially [survive the
return of an ice age]{.underline}. However, their cultures are
endangered by globalization. If these people become dependent on the
products of modern civilization, such as rifles and motor boats, and
lose their native survival skills, then their likelihood of surviving
the collapse of the outside world would decrease. Therefore,
[preservation of]{.underline} their [survival skills may be important as
a defense against the risks connected with **extreme
cooling**.]{.underline} [Remote polar island with high mountains
survives]{.underline} brief [global warming of]{.underline} median
surface temperatures, [up to 50˚C]{.underline}. There is a theory that
the climates of planets similar to the Earth could have several
semi-stable temperature levels (Popp et al., 2016). If so, [because of
climate change]{.underline}, the [Earth could transition to
a]{.underline} second semi-stable [state with a median global
temperature of around]{.underline} 330 K, about [60˚C]{.underline}, or
about [45˚C above current global mean temperatures]{.underline}. But
[even in this climate, [**some regions of Earth could still be
survivable for humans**, such as the Himalayan plateau]{.mark} at
elevations above 4,000 m, but below 6,000]{.underline} (where oxygen
deficiency becomes a problem), [or on polar islands with
mountains]{.underline} (however, global warming affects polar regions
more than equatorial regions, and northern island will experience more
effects of climate change, including thawing permafrost and possible
landslides because of wetter weather). In the tropics, the combination
of increased humidity and temperature may increase the wet bulb
temperature above 36˚C, especially on islands, where sea moisture is
readily available. In such conditions, proper human perspiration becomes
impossible (Sherwood and Huber, 2010), and there will likely be
increased mortality and morbidity because of tropical diseases. [If
temperatures later returned to normal]{.underline} -- either naturally
or through climate engineering -- **[[the]{.mark} rest of the [Earth
could be repopulated]{.mark}.]{.underline}** ''Swiss Family Robinsons''

Most AI researchers ignore medium-term AI risks, which are neither
near-term risks, like unemployment, nor remote risks, like AI
superintelligence. But a large drone army -- if one were produced --
could receive a wrong command or be infected by a computer virus,
leading it to attack people indiscriminately. Remote islands without
robots could provide protection in this case, allowing survival until
such a drone army ran out of batteries, fuel, ammunition or other
supplies: [Primitive tribe survives civilizational

Island**]{.underline}, near the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean,
[are hostile and uncontacted]{.underline}. **[[The Sentinelese]{.mark}

unaffected]{.underline}** (Voanews, 2009), and [if the rest of humanity
disappear, **they [might]{.mark} well [continue their existence without

2017). However, after a catastrophe, the submarine with survivors would
eventually need a place to dock, and an island with some prepared
amenities would be a reasonable starting point for rebuilding
civilization. Bunker on remote island. [For risks]{.underline} which

target nor as accessible to looters or unintentionally dangerous (e.g.
infected) refugees. [These bunkers [could potentially be connected to
water sources by underwater pipes,]{.mark} and passages could provide

### No Nuclear Winter\-\--2NC

#### Islands solve

[Islands offer excellent protection against natural and/or **low-tech
catastrophes**]{.underline} which are neither too large nor too small.
[Remoteness, isolation and the diverse conditions found on different
islands could be helpful features to aid survival in the face of
different types of catastrophes. Islands could provide protection
against a human-to-human transmitted biological pandemic]{.underline};
as mentioned in the Introduction, some islands were able to escape the
1918 flu pandemic by implementing effective quarantine measures.
[Islands may help to survive a **long-term collapse in food production
caused by nuclear winter**]{.underline}, agricultural pests and other
catastrophes. [[Islands often have **non-traditional food sources**,
such as birds and sea flora]{.mark} and fauna, [which]{.mark} may
[provide independent subsistence for an indefinitely long
period]{.mark}. On remote islands, **[the extent of radioactive and
chemical contamination from catastrophes would likely be
smaller]{.mark}**. This is [especially true of islands]{.mark} [located
in the Southern hemisphere]{.mark} close to the Antarctic, as **[winds
around the pole maintain]{.mark} some [isolation from the rest of the
atmosphere.]{.mark} Constant rains and winds may accelerate the
decontamination of some islands**]{.underline} (like Kerguelen). [In
addition, **sea animals may be relatively less contaminated food
sources**.]{.underline} Islands away from the equator could provide
protection against some of the direct effects of a gamma ray burst
(muons) (Cirkovi c and Vukoti c, 2016 ) if they were in the constant
shadow of the Earth, below the horizon of the gamma ray source. [[In the
case of global war]{.underline}]{.mark} or technological collapse,
[**[many islands could become unreachable]{.mark}**. This would protect
them against human-borne diseases, pirates, looters and certain
autonomous weapon systems such as]{.underline} land-based or short-range
[drones]{.underline}. [Additionally, remote and sparsely populated
islands may not be interesting military targets. In case of war, it may
be more expensive to reach them than to ignore them]{.underline}, though
this depends on the nature of the war. For example, [the Germans used
remote unpopulated islands in the Arctic]{.underline} (Grossman, 2016)
[and in the Southern Ocean]{.underline} (Rogge and Frank, 1956) [as
secret bases during Second World War]{.underline}, and the allies later
sent cruisers to Kerguelen to check if Germans were hiding there. It
might be too expensive for a hostile AI to seek out and kill small
groups of people in remote places, if they do not pose an immediate risk
to the AI's interests. However, over time, the AI's risk calculation
might change.

[[To]{.mark} quantitatively [account for]{.mark}]{.underline} natural
and forced [[variability in the climate system, we created two
ensembles]{.underline}]{.mark}, one for the natural, unforced system and
a second ensemble using a range of realistic vertical profiles for the
BC aerosol forcing, consistent with our detailed fire simulation. The
control ensemble was generated using small atmospheric temperature
perturbations (Kay et al., 2015). Notably, the overall spread of
anomalies in both ensembles is very similar. [[These]{.mark} ensembles
[were]{.mark} then [used to create "super ensembles" using a statistical
emulator, which allows]{.mark} a robust [statistical comparison]{.mark}
of our simulated results [with and without the carbon forcing.
Our]{.mark}]{.underline} primary [[result is]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[**decreased impact on global climate indices**, such
as]{.mark}]{.underline} global average [[surface temperature]{.mark} and
precipitation]{.underline}, relative to standard scenarios considered in
previous work (e.g., Robock et al., 2007a; Stenke et al., 2013; Mills et
al., 2014; Pausata et al., 2016). [With our finding of **substantially
less [BC]{.mark} aerosol [being lofted to stratospheric
heights]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., over a factor of four less than in
most of the scenarios considered by previous studies),
[these]{.underline} globally averaged [anomalies [drop to
**statistically insignificant levels**]{.mark} after the first several
years]{.underline} (Figures 14 and 16). [Our results are]{.underline}
generally [comparable to]{.underline} those predicted by
[other]{.underline} [studies]{.underline} that considered exchange
scenarios [in which only]{.underline} about [1 Tg of soot is emitted in
the upper troposphere]{.underline} (Robock et al., 2007a; Mills et al.,
2008; Stenke et al., 2013). There are more subtle suggestions of
regional effects, notably in the extent of the region over which sea
surface temperature differences between ensembles remain significant in
the final years of simulation (Figure 17). Further work is required to
adequately analyze these and other potential regional effects.
[[Historical analysis of several large volcanic eruptions
and]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[recent]{.mark}]{.underline} large
[[fire]{.mark} also [supports this result]{.mark}. For
example,]{.underline} Timmreck et al. (2010) claim that [nonlinear
[aerosol effects of the Toba Tuff eruption]{.mark}]{.underline} 74,000
years [ago [helped **limit significant global cooling**
i]{.underline}]{.mark}[mpacts to a **two-year time period** and that any
cooling beyond this time period could be due to other
effects]{.underline}. It should be noted that [this eruption was
estimated to have produced **10\^6 Tg** of ash]{.underline} and
comparable amounts of other gases, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), [while
[the estimated amount of soot produced by a regional exchange is]{.mark}
on the order of **10 Tg**, or **[5 orders of magnitude smaller than the
ash]{.mark}**]{.underline} (not including gases) [**[produced by the
Toba eruption]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Noting that a nuclear exchange is
not identical to volcanic events, it has been asserted that [BC
particles produced by fires]{.underline} should [have a **greater impact
on**]{.underline} **[absorbing solar radiation]{.underline}**
[than]{.underline} even [has]{.underline} the [significantly larger
amounts of ash]{.underline} and various gases [produced by large
eruptions]{.underline} (e.g., Robock and Toon 2010). Likewise, [recent
work in analyzing BC emissions]{.underline} [from large fires suggests
that]{.underline} in such fires, [similar to large volcanic eruptions,
**coating of soot particles with other particles**]{.underline} in
convective eddies **[tends to increase their size and hence increase
their subsequent rainout]{.underline}** (China et al., 2013) [before
they can reach the stratosphere]{.underline}. In fact, the recent study
of Pausata et al. (2016) found that [growth of BC aerosol via
coagulation with organic carbon significantly reduce the particles'
lifetime in the atmosphere]{.underline}

## Misc Russia Tech Impacts

### AT: Russian Warheads

#### Skyfall sucks

Instead [Lewis worries]{.underline} more [about the
**Skyfall**]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} **[nuclear-powered cruise
missile carrying a nuclear warhead]{.underline}**. "I'm a little
bothered by [the]{.underline} **[menagerie]{.underline}** [of science
fiction ideas that the Russians are working on]{.underline}," he says.
"[We]{.underline} **[don't know]{.underline}** [much about the
technology behind]{.underline} that one (**[Skyfall]{.underline}**),
[but]{.underline} **[certainly]{.underline}** when the U.S. investigated
the idea [it was]{.underline} **[pretty nasty]{.underline}** [in terms
of radiation released **just to power it**]{.underline}." According to
Putin, [the Skyfall is a superpowered Tomahawk cruise missile launched
via ground or air]{.underline}. The best Tomahawks can travel 1,550
miles---but with a nuclear reactor powering it, the Skyfall [effectively
has an]{.underline} **[unlimited range]{.underline}**. Russian military
sources reported the country had successfully tested the cruise missile
in January 2019; however, U.S. intelligence suggests that it has yet to
demonstrate a range greater than 22 miles, and may not reach its full
potential for another 10 years.

#### RS-28 Sarmat sucks

Matthew **Gault 22**, professional multimedia journalist and storyteller
who writes about conflict and culture, "Russia's New Nuclear Missiles
Squeeze Response Time," updated 3/21/22,
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/russias-new-nuclear-missiles-squeeze-response-time/micahw

Still, a [radiation-spewing cruise missile with unlimited range
is]{.underline} **[not Russia's only frightening new
weapon]{.underline}**. [It is also testing the]{.underline} **[RS-28
Sarmat]{.underline}**, a liquid-fueled ICBM [designed to **brute-force
its way through U.S. missile defense systems**]{.underline}. [The
missile is]{.underline} **[fast]{.underline}**,
**[huge]{.underline}**---119 feet tall with a weight of more than 220
tons---[and]{.underline} **[full of weapons]{.underline}**: It [carries
a]{.underline} **[10-ton payload]{.underline}**, big enough [to
include]{.underline} **[24 separate nuclear-tipped Avangard hypersonic
glide vehicles]{.underline}**.

And [the Sarmat is dangerous for reasons]{.underline} **[beyond its
size]{.underline}**. According to Coyle [it also has a]{.underline}
**[shorter-than-usual]{.underline}** [boost phase]{.underline} (the
period of an ICBM's launch when it is rocketing into the atmosphere),
[which gives U.S. missile defenses]{.underline} **[less
time]{.underline}** [to shoot it down]{.underline}. If a brief launch
window is not enough to protect the missile, Coyle says, "\[Putin\] also
said that **[Sarmat]{.underline}** [would carry]{.underline}
**[countermeasures]{.underline}** designed [to **confuse U.S.
anti-missiles systems**]{.underline}."

https://thespacereview.com/article/4401/1/micahw

**[Russia]{.underline}** [has a long history of developing]{.underline}
**[space weapons]{.underline}**. It has [demonstrated]{.underline} a
[capability to]{.underline} **[kinetically intercept
satellites]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} low Earth orbit
(**[LEO]{.underline}**) [from space and]{.underline} more recently [from
the ground]{.underline} in late 2021. Additionally, it [can
use]{.underline} **[ground-based lasers]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[dazzle]{.underline}** [satellites in LEO]{.underline}.
**[Russia]{.underline}** can [conduct]{.underline} radiofrequency
(**[RF]{.underline}**) **[jamming]{.underline}** [from mobile platforms
against communication satellites in LEO]{.underline}. [This article
examines]{.underline} **[Russia's ASAT concepts]{.underline}** [and
places them in the context of military space doctrine that]{.underline}
**[threatens]{.underline}** both **[US]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[NATO allies' satellites]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline}
**[increasing]{.underline}** [threat to satellites has led to the
development of the concept of a bodyguard satellite]{.underline}.

Russian counterspace programs

[Under]{.underline} Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}**, [Russia has
reinvigorated its political desire to obtain counterspace capabilities
for the same reason as China]{.underline}, [to]{.underline} **[advance
its regional power]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[limit]{.underline}** [the ability of the US to counter Russia's
freedom of action]{.underline}. Russian military thought sees modern
warfare as a struggle over information dominance and netcentric
operations that can take place without clear boundaries. [Russia is
pursuing the goal of incorporating]{.underline} **[EW
capabilities]{.underline}** [throughout its military to both protect
its]{.underline} own **[space-enabled capabilities]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} degrade or **[deny]{.underline}** [those capabilities
to its adversary]{.underline}. In space, Russia is seeking to mitigate
the superiority of US and NATO space assets by fielding a number of
ground, air, and space-based offensive capabilities.

The [former Soviet Union tested a co-orbital ASAT system known as
Isrebitel Sputnikov]{.underline} (IS). This was [based on a SS-9 missile
and used a shrapnel at an effective range of 50 meters]{.underline}.
However, it needed two orbits to approach the target satellite, which
gave the target satellite several hours to detect the attack and take
evasive action.\[1\] The IS was [capable of targeting satellites up to
2,200 kilometers with an]{.underline} estimated [**kill probability**
of]{.underline} 70--**[80%]{.underline}**, [and an IS-M system was
developed to rendezvous with a single orbit]{.underline}. It was
intended to develop the system IS-MD to intercept satellites in GEO,
however the program was ended in 1993.\[2\]

[Russia has been testing technologies for]{.underline} rendezvous and
proximity operations (**[RPO]{.underline}**) [in]{.underline} both
**[LEO]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[GEO]{.underline}** [in order
to develop a co-orbital ASAT capability]{.underline}.\[3\] Russia is
likely to have [started]{.underline} a **[co-orbital ASAT
program]{.underline}** called Burevestnik.\[4\] The concept of
Burevestnik is most likely that it will [not carry a kinetic kill
vehicle like its Soviet predecessor]{.underline}, [but will serve as a
launch vehicle for]{.underline} **[small interceptor
satellites]{.underline}** [that can]{.underline} approach and **[disable
enemy satellites]{.underline}**.\[5\] The [status of this program is
unclear]{.underline}, as [open reporting is often
contradictory]{.underline}, nevertheless, the [concept appears to be one
modified out of Soviet era development]{.underline}, and as such cannot
be ruled out.

### Satellite Jammers\-\--2NC

#### They'll build [satellite jammers]{.underline}\-\--causes US escalation.

Alex **Hollings 19**, master\'s degree in Communications from Southern

Russia claims their new military aircraft will be able to 'disable enemy
satellites',
https://sofrep.com/fightersweep/russia-claims-their-new-military-aircraft-will-be-able-to-disable-enemy-satellites/micahw

Kremlin-owned media outlet [Sputnik News recently released details
of]{.underline} a **[new]{.underline}** [electronic warfare aircraft
being developed for the Russian military that they claim
will]{.underline} not only be able to **[jam
communications]{.underline}** [but also]{.underline} "**[disable enemy
satellites]{.underline}**." Of course, the unnamed source from "within
the Russian defense ministry" opted not to divulge any details of just
how the new aircraft will engage with orbital assets, describing the
systems being developed for the aircraft instead only as "fundamentally
new."

> The [work is]{.underline} **[currently underway]{.underline}** [to
> develop an aircraft equipped with]{.underline} **[jamming
> systems]{.underline}** that will replace Il-22PP Porubshchik
> \[electronic warfare aircraft\], which are currently being delivered
> to the Russian Aerospace Forces. This machine will receive a
> fundamentally new on-board equipment, [which will allow to
> conduct]{.underline} **[electronic suppression]{.underline}** [of any
> targets]{.underline} --- **[ground]{.underline}**,
> **[air]{.underline}**, **[sea]{.underline}** --- [and]{.underline}
> **[disable]{.underline}** [enemy satellites that provide navigation
> and radio communication on the ground]{.underline}," the source said.

The [first half of those claims are]{.underline} pretty
**[believable]{.underline}**. [Electronic suppression or
jamming]{.underline} **[isn't unheard of]{.underline}** technology and
reports of Russian jamming equipment being used in Belarus and
Kaliningrad [during the recent Zapad military exercises near the Baltics
suggest that Russia has already been working to develop digital area
denial techniques that could limit or disrupt
communications]{.underline}. [The United States military has already set
about conducting exercises that presuppose the idea that issues with
satellite communications are just a part of peer and near-peer level
warfare in the 21st century]{.underline}. The latter half of those
claims, however, beg some interesting questions about how this new
aircraft will be equipped, and just what purposes it may aim to fill.

[Disabling an enemy satellite could]{.underline} feasibly
[mean]{.underline} a **[number of things]{.underline}**. [China
has]{.underline} **[already demonstrated]{.underline}** their [ability
to target American satellites with]{.underline} **[ground-based
lasers]{.underline}**, causing no damage but sending a clear message
about the potential for weapons applications. **[Russia's]{.underline}**
new [aircraft could]{.underline} hope to [use similar laser technology
to damage or temporarily distract satellites]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} could [offer]{.underline} **[varying degrees of
strategic value]{.underline}** depending on if the laser is actually
able to damage the satellite, [or if it is simply able to confuse it
temporarily]{.underline}. It's worth noting that merely dazzling some
satellites in America's orbital constellation could dramatically reduce
the nation's chances at identifying and intercepting inbound nuclear
missiles. [In other words]{.underline}, this [new electronic warfare
aircraft may pose a **significant threat** to America's **nuclear
defense infrastructure** as well as to conventional forces in the
fight]{.underline}. It's also possible to engage satellites with
missiles, as China has demonstrated in the past --- but electronic
warfare aircraft of this sort are rarely armed, let alone equipped with
missiles of that sort.

[According to]{.underline} **[Russia's claims]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} **[new systems being developed]{.underline}** (and
coupled with what they say will likely be an entirely new airframe)
[will be able to]{.underline} **[disable anti-aircraft]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[missile defense systems]{.underline}** [as well as
disrupting the functions of]{.underline} unmanned **[aerial
vehicles]{.underline}** --- and that's where the claims are starting to
sound a bit more like science fiction.

While there's no denying that weapons have been under development for
years that aim to disrupt the function of the electronics employed by
the enemy in combat zones, Russia's suggestion that their new aircraft
will single-handedly be able to power down drones, disable anti-aircraft
systems, and take out satellites in orbit, all while blocking digital
and radio communications sounds more like a flight of fancy than
anything else. Each of these applications would require either a highly
specialized form of data attack or a kinetic one --- and it seems
unlikely that a single aircraft could house such an array of
capabilities (assuming Russia could even develop them).

However, if Russia's claims can be believed, it would make this new
electronic warfare aircraft, currently being developed under the name
Porubshchik 2, such an immense threat to American security that just
having them could be seen as something that would require a kinetic
response. [The United States **couldn't sit idly by**]{.underline} [with
the understanding that Russia is building a **fleet of
airplanes**]{.underline} [that could power down American defenses
and]{.underline} **[blind the nation]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} an
**[impending nuclear strike]{.underline}**. In other words, [if Russia's
claims are true]{.underline}, the U.S. will either see a massive influx
of investment into its orbital infrastructure to [offset this new slew
of capabilities or a concerted diplomatic effort to curb their
production]{.underline}, [followed by military action if diplomacy
fails]{.underline}. Likely, what we'd see would be a combination of
these two possibilities.

Russia claims their new military aircraft will be able to 'disable enemy
satellites',
https://sofrep.com/fightersweep/russia-claims-their-new-military-aircraft-will-be-able-to-disable-enemy-satellites/micahw

[According to Russia's claims]{.underline}, the new systems being
developed (and coupled with what they say will likely be an entirely new
airframe) will be able to disable anti-aircraft and missile defense
systems as well as disrupting the functions of unmanned aerial vehicles
--- and [that's where the claims are starting to sound]{.underline} a
bit more [like]{.underline} **[science fiction]{.underline}**.

While there's no denying that weapons have been under development for
years that aim to disrupt the function of the electronics employed by
the enemy in combat zones, [Russia's suggestion that their new aircraft
will single-handedly be able to power down drones, disable anti-aircraft
systems]{.underline}, [and take out satellites in orbit]{.underline},
all while blocking digital and radio communications [sounds more like
a]{.underline} **[flight of fancy]{.underline}** [than anything
else]{.underline}. [Each of these applications would require either a
highly specialized form of data attack or a kinetic one]{.underline} ---
and [it seems]{.underline} **[unlikely]{.underline}** [that a single
aircraft could house such an array of capabilities]{.underline}
(assuming Russia could even develop them).

However, if Russia's claims can be believed, it would make this new
electronic warfare aircraft, currently being developed under the name
Porubshchik 2, such an immense threat to American security that just
having them could be seen as something that would require a kinetic
response. The United States couldn't sit idly by with the understanding
that Russia is building a fleet of airplanes that could power down
American defenses and blind the nation to an impending nuclear strike.
In other words, if Russia's claims are true, the U.S. will either see a
massive influx of investment into its orbital infrastructure to offset
this new slew of capabilities or a concerted diplomatic effort to curb
their production, followed by military action if diplomacy fails.
Likely, what we'd see would be a combination of these two possibilities.

But then, [the]{.underline} **[most likely outcome]{.underline}** [is
that these new Russian claims]{.underline}, [like those of their robots
in combat in Syria and the supremacy of their short-ordered
fifth-generation Su-57 fighters in the skies]{.underline},
[are]{.underline} **[more about bark]{.underline}** [than]{.underline}
they are about **[bite]{.underline}**. [It's]{.underline} **[entirely
likely]{.underline}** that the Porubshchik 2, which the [Russian
official]{.underline} claimed will likely receive a new name before it
enters service, will [offer little more technical capability than its
predecessor]{.underline} (shown above) --- and [the rest is]{.underline}
just more **[Russian smoke and mirrors]{.underline}**.

### Hypersonics\-\--2NC

#### Russia will be able to launch hypersonic missiles by the end of 2022 -- war now is key -- otherwise, new missiles will overwhelm US interceptors

**Cole 22** \[Brendan Cole is a Senior Reporter at Newsweek, \"Russia
develops hypersonic missile system to up ante in Ukraine war\",
Newsweek,
https://www.newsweek.com/russia-tsirkon-hypersonic-putin-ukraine-black-sea-1710701\]
GBS-HW

[A system designed to launch one of Russia\'s much-vaunted hypersonic
missiles is expected to be ready for use **by the end of the
year**]{.underline}, state media have reported.

[News agency Tass said that a **system to launch the Tsirkon missile**
was being developed]{.underline} at the renowned rocket design bureau
NPO Mashinostroyenia in Reutov, near Moscow, which Newsweek has
contacted for comment.

A military source told the agency that [the coastal missile system is
slated to enter service with the Russian Navy \"**by the end of
2022**.\"]{.underline}

Another source said the new system will have the capacity to strike both
ground- and sea-based targets. This would give it the same capability as
its predecessor, the Bastion, which deploys Oniks supersonic anti-ship
cruise missiles.

[Anatoly Svintsov, deputy general director of NPO Mashinostroeniya, told
the Zvezda military TV channel that while there were aviation- and
sea-based versions of the Tsirkon, his factory had been ordered to
\"**intensify work** on the creation of a marine version of the
rocket.\"]{.underline}

The report of the missile system\'s development comes as the Russian
Navy plays an increasingly critical role in the Ukraine war.

This week, Russia reportedly loaded Kalibr cruise missiles onto two
Varshavyanka submarines in the Black Sea, only days after it was said
that the U.S. would target the Russian fleet to free up grain stranded
at Ukrainian ports.

[Before his invasion of Ukraine, **Putin repeatedly boasted** about the
capabilities of his country\'s hypersonic missiles, which are **faster
and more agile** than standard ones and are harder for defense systems
to intercept.]{.underline}

Over the last two and a half years, Russia has said it had test-launched
the Tsirkon missile a number of times from its Northern Fleet vessel
Admiral Gorshkov. Moscow says it can hit targets up to 660 miles away.

At Mach 9, the Tsirkon missile is at the low end of the hypersonic
spectrum. As Newsweek has previously reported, unlike pure hypersonic
missiles which rely on scramjets, it is believed to be a hybrid cruise
missile and ballistic missile. [Experts have warned that **it could
overwhelm the American Aegis Combat System**.]{.underline}

#### Hypersonic development high now.

**AP 5/28**, Associated Press, "Russia says it has test-fired another
hypersonic missile," 5/28/22,
https://www.npr.org/2022/05/28/1101948971/russia-hypersonic-missile-test/micahw

MOSCOW --- The [Russian navy on Saturday conducted]{.underline} another
[test of a prospective]{.underline} **[hypersonic
missile]{.underline}**, [a demonstration of the military\'s long-range
strike capability amid the fighting in Ukraine]{.underline}.

The [Defense Ministry said]{.underline} the Admiral
[Gorshkov]{.underline} frigate of the Northern Fleet in the White Sea
launched the Zircon cruise missile in the Barents Sea, successfully
hitting a practice target in the White Sea about 1,000 kilometers (540
nautical miles) away.

The [launch was the latest in a]{.underline} **[series of
tests]{.underline}** of Zircon, [which is set to enter service later
this year]{.underline}.

Russian President Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}** has [said that Zircon
is capable of flying at]{.underline} **[nine times the speed of
sound]{.underline}** and has a [range of]{.underline} **[1,000
kilometers]{.underline}** (620 miles). [Putin]{.underline} has
[emphasized that its deployment will significantly boost the capability
of Russia\'s military]{.underline}.

Zircon is [intended to arm **Russian cruisers**]{.underline},
**[frigates]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[submarines]{.underline}** and [could be used against]{.underline}
both **[enemy ships]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[ground
targets]{.underline}**. [It is one of several hypersonic missiles under
development in Russia]{.underline}.

[Russian officials have boasted about Zircon\'s capability]{.underline},
[saying]{.underline} that [it\'s]{.underline} **[impossible to
intercept]{.underline}** [with existing anti-missile
systems]{.underline}.

[Putin]{.underline}, who has sternly warned Western allies against
interfering in Ukraine, has [warned in the past that Russian warships
armed with Zircon would give Russia a capability to
**strike**]{.underline} \"**[decision-making centers]{.underline}**\"
**[within minutes]{.underline}** [if deployed]{.underline} in neutral
waters.

#### Russia used it in Ukraine.

John **Ismay 22**, Pentagon correspondent in the Washington bureau, and
previously served as the At War reporter covering armed conflict for The
New York Times, "Russia claims to use a hypersonic missile in attack on
arms depot in Ukraine,"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/19/us/politics/russia-hypersonic-missile-attack-claim.html/micahw>

WASHINGTON --- [Russia]{.underline} has [fired]{.underline} **[scores of
guided missiles]{.underline}** [into Ukraine]{.underline}, but on
Saturday it [claimed]{.underline} for the first time [that it had
launched]{.underline} one capable of **[hypersonic speed]{.underline}**
[in an attack on an ammunition depot in western Ukraine]{.underline}.
The report could not be independently verified, but if true [could be
the]{.underline} **[first use of a hypersonic weapon in
combat]{.underline}**.

Hypersonics, generally defined as weapons capable of flying at speeds
over Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound, are at the center of an
arms race among the United States, Russia and China.

The United States has pursued development of this type of weapon since
the early 2000s, focusing on two different variants, according to a
report released Thursday by the Congressional Research Service.

The [first is a]{.underline} "**[hypersonic glide
vehicle]{.underline}**" which is [launched from a rocket and then
separates before gliding to a target]{.underline}, [and the second is a
faster version of a cruise missile]{.underline}, which could be
[launched by]{.underline} **[submarines]{.underline}**,
**[ships]{.underline}**, **[airplanes]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[ground vehicles]{.underline}**, the report said. The Pentagon
requested \$3.8 billion for hypersonic research in fiscal year 2022.

The report notes that the [Department of Defense has shown growing
interest in developing these weapons in part because of **advances made
by Russia and China**]{.underline}. Those [countries]{.underline} "[have
a]{.underline} **[number]{.underline}** [of hypersonic weapons programs
and have likely fielded operational hypersonic glide
vehicles]{.underline} --- potentially [armed with]{.underline}
**[nuclear warheads]{.underline}**," according to the report.

A [spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry]{.underline}, Maj. Gen.
Igor Konashenkov, [said hypersonic missiles]{.underline},
[called]{.underline} **[Kinzhals]{.underline}**, [had destroyed the
underground warehouse storing Ukrainian missiles and aviation ammunition
in the western Ivano-Frankivsk region of Ukraine]{.underline}.

Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for Ukraine's military, confirmed Saturday that
Russian forces had hit an underground warehouse in western Ukraine but
said the type of missile involved "is yet to be determined."

The Pentagon did not immediately respond on Saturday morning to a
request for comment on Russia's claim.

In [recent briefings at the Pentagon]{.underline}, **[defense
officials]{.underline}** [have declined to comment on reports that
Russian forces have used weapons like cluster munitions]{.underline} ---
which [split open in midair and spread smaller bomblets]{.underline} ---
[and]{.underline} **[thermobaric explosives]{.underline}**, [which
create more-powerful and longer-lasting blast waves than traditional
high explosives]{.underline}.

But [they have offered a running tally of **short**]{.underline}-
[and]{.underline} **[medium-range]{.underline}** [ballistic
missiles]{.underline}, [cruise missiles]{.underline}, [and
surface-to-air missiles fired by Russian forces]{.underline}. On
Wednesday, a senior defense official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity to discuss details of the war in Ukraine, said that [Russian
troops had launched more than **1,080 missiles** since the war
began]{.underline} on Feb. 24.

#### It [escalates tensions]{.underline}.

Matthew **Gault 22**, professional multimedia journalist and storyteller
who writes about conflict and culture, "Russia's New Nuclear Missiles
Squeeze Response Time," updated 3/21/22,
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/russias-new-nuclear-missiles-squeeze-response-time/micahw

Last year Russian President Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}** [unveiled
six new weapons during a governmental address]{.underline}. The [most
impressive]{.underline}, according to nuclear experts,
[were]{.underline} the **[Avangard hypersonic glide
vehicle]{.underline}**, the **[nuclear-powered cruise missile
Skyfall]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} the **[RS-28 Sarmat
intercontinental ballistic missile]{.underline}**
(**[ICBM]{.underline}**). [These three are the]{.underline} **[crown
jewels]{.underline}** [in Russia's aggressive new nuclear
policy]{.underline}, [capable]{.underline}---according to
Putin---[of]{.underline} **[circumventing]{.underline}** [U.S. missile
defense systems]{.underline}. Currently, American defenses are designed
to knock an incoming nuke out of the air before it can hit its
target---but this was already a complicated and difficult task before
the development of hypersonics.

Although [Russia's new weapons sound **frightening**]{.underline}, none
has actually been deployed yet. They may be [ready in the next year or
two]{.underline}, but "none of them are fully operational," says Philip
Coyle, a board member of the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation. Coyle (who has also served as U.S. assistant
secretary of defense), explains that [some have been
tested]{.underline}, but "none of them have been so successful that they
can claim to have operational capability."

But [that **doesn't mean Coyle is not worried**]{.underline},
**[especially about hypersonic threats]{.underline}**. "[Some of those
would be]{.underline} **[impossible]{.underline}** [for United States
missile defense systems]{.underline} \[[to counter]{.underline}\]," he
says, "**[especially]{.underline}** [the hypersonic air-to-ground-system
and the hypersonic glide system]{.underline}, both of
[which]{.underline} \[[Putin]{.underline}\] said [had been]{.underline}
**[successfully tested]{.underline}**." The **[current
crop]{.underline}** [of weapons that defense experts label as hypersonic
reach speeds]{.underline} **[greater than 3,000 mph]{.underline}**.

INSIDE THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL

Other countries, including the United States and China, have also tested
hypersonic weapons---but [it is **Russia's hypersonic glide
vehicle**]{.underline}, the Avangard, [that has garnered the defense
community's]{.underline} **[most intense attention]{.underline}**.
[Glide vehicles could theoretically combine the maneuverability of a
cruise missile with the speed of an ICBM]{.underline}. On a traditional
nuclear launch involving an ICBM, [a]{.underline} **[powerful
rocket]{.underline}** [sends the warhead on a trajectory **similar to a
space launch**]{.underline} (long-range ICBMs even go suborbital)
[before it turns around and plummets to Earth at **hypersonic
speeds**]{.underline}. [Glide vehicles like the Avangard would ride an
ICBM into the sky]{.underline}, but they would then be released and soar
along at the top of the atmosphere---**[above sensor
range]{.underline}**---[before heading to their targets]{.underline}.

#### Hypersonics go nuclear -- [warhead ambiguity]{.underline}, compressed [timeframe]{.underline}, and [entanglement]{.underline}

Weapons and the Changing Calculus of Battle;\" *Arms Control
Association*;

Escalation Risks and 'Entanglement' [Many weapons can be employed
for]{.underline} offensive and [**defensive purposes**, but
**[hypersonic]{.mark}**]{.underline} weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
especially those designed for use in a regional context, [[are]{.mark}
primarily intended to be [used
**offensively**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [to destroy high-value
enemy assets, including **command-and-control facilities**]{.underline}.
[[This]{.mark} raises two major concerns: the [risk]{.mark} of **[rapid
escalation]{.mark}** from a **minor** crisis to a **full-blown war** and
the unintended escalation from **conventional** [to **nuclear
war**]{.mark}**fare.**]{.underline} That [hypersonic]{.underline}
weapon[s]{.underline} [are being designed for **offensive use** at an
**early stage in a conflict**]{.underline} has been evident [in U.S.
strategic policy from the beginning.]{.underline} Claiming that a major
adversary might try to hide or move critical assets at the outbreak of a
crisis to protect them from U.S. air and missile strikes, the Pentagon
hoped the prompt global-strike program would enable U.S. forces to
attack those targets with minimal warning. As this program got under
way, hypersonic weapons became the technology of choice for its
implementation. "Systems that operate at hypersonic speeds ... offer the
potential for military operations from longer ranges with shorter
response times and enhanced effectiveness compared to current military
systems," states the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
Such munitions, it adds, "could provide significant payoff for future
U.S. offensive strike operations, particularly as adversaries'
capabilities advance."12 Most of the hypersonic weapons being developed
by the U.S. military, including the Air Force cruise missile and the
Navy's sea-launched system, are intended for strikes against key enemy
assets at an early stage of conflict, when speed confers a significant
advantage. Certain Russian weapons, such as the Kinzhal, also seem
intended for this purpose. Some analysts fear that [[the]{.mark} mere
[**possession** of]{.mark} such [weapons might]{.mark} induce leaders to
escalate a military clash at the very outbreak of a crisis---believing
their early use will confer a significant advantage in any major
engagement that follows---while **[reduc]{.mark}ing the
[chances]{.mark}** [of keeping]{.mark} the [fight]{.mark}ing
**[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is easy to imagine, for example,
how [a **clash** between U.S. and **Chinese naval vessels**]{.underline}
[in the **South China Sea**]{.underline}, accompanied by signs of an air
and naval mobilization on either or both sides, [might prompt one
combatant to launch a **barrage of hypersonic weapons**]{.underline} at
all those ships and planes and their command-and-control systems, hoping
to prevent their use in any full-scale encounter. This might make sense
from a military perspective, but would undoubtedly prompt a fierce
counterreaction from the injured side and restrict efforts to halt the
fighting at a lower level of violence. [The introduction of **hypersonic
weapons** also raises concerns over the **escalation** from
**conventional** to **nuclear warfare.**]{.underline} The United States
has focused primarily on the development of hypersonic weapons carrying
conventional warheads, but there is no fundamental reason why they could
not be nuclear armed. Indeed, **[Russia's Avangard
missile]{.underline}** is intended to deliver a nuclear warhead, and it
is assumed that China's DF-ZF is also designed with this in mind. [This
leads to what is]{.underline} called "**[warhead
ambiguity]{.underline}**": [the risk that [a **defending
nation**]{.mark}, aware of an enemy's **hypersonic launch** and having
**no time** to assess the warhead type, [will **assume the worst** and
**launch**]{.mark}]{.underline} its own **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}13 Concern over this
**[[risk]{.mark} has [led]{.mark} the U.S. [Congress to bar funding
for]{.mark} the development of ICBM-launched [hypersonic]{.mark} glide
[vehicles]{.mark}, thereby helping to propel the Pentagon's shift away
from such systems and toward the development of medium-range weapons
more suitable for use in a regional context.]{.underline}**
Nevertheless, [**warhead ambiguity** will remain a feature of any future
landscape involving the deployment of **multiple hypersonic weapons**,
as a defender will **never be certain** that an enemy's assault is
**entirely non-nuclear**. [With]{.mark}]{.underline} as little as
[[**five minutes** to **assess an attack**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[the
time it would take a hypersonic glide vehicle to traverse **2,000**
**miles**]{.underline}---[[a defender would be]{.mark} understandably
[**hard pressed** to avoid **worst-case assumptions.**]{.mark} Equally
worrisome is]{.underline} the danger of "**[target
ambiguity]{.underline}**": the possibility that [[a
**hypersonic**]{.mark} **attack**]{.underline}, even if conducted with
missiles known to be armed only with conventional warheads, [[would
endanger]{.mark} the **early-warning** and
**[c]{.mark}ommand-[and-c]{.mark}ontrol [systems]{.mark}** a defender
uses for its **nuclear**]{.underline} and conventional
**[forces]{.underline}**, [[leading it to fear]{.mark} the **onset** of
[a **nuclear attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is especially
dangerous in light of]{.underline} what James Acton, a security analyst
at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, calls the
"**[entanglement]{.underline}**" problem. Although almost everything
involving nuclear decision-making is secret, the [**[nuclear]{.mark}**
and **conventional command-and-control [systems]{.mark}** of the major
powers [are]{.mark} **widely assumed** to be **interconnected**, or
**[entangled]{.mark}**, [making it difficult to]{.mark} **clearly
[distinguish]{.mark}** [**one** from **another**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Therefore, [[**any** attack]{.mark} on command-and-control facilities at
the onset of crisis, **however intended**, [could]{.mark} be interpreted
by the defender as a prelude to a **nuclear**]{.underline} rather than a
conventional **[attack]{.underline}** [and [prompt the defender to
**launch**]{.mark}]{.underline} its own **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** before they are destroyed by an
anticipated barrage of enemy bombs and missiles.14 All this points to
yet another concern related to the impact of emerging technologies on
the future battlefield: the risk that nuclear-armed nations, fearing
scenarios of just this sort, will entrust more and more of their
critical decision-making to machines, fearing that humans will not be
able to make reasoned judgments under such enormous time pressures. With
hypersonic weapons in the arsenals of the major powers, [military
leaders may conclude that sophisticated]{.underline} artificial
intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**) **[systems]{.underline}** [should be
empowered to determine the **nature of future missile attacks** and
select the **appropriate response**. This is a temptation that can only
increase as **hypersonic weapons** are **themselves equipped** with **AI
systems**]{.underline}, a capability being developed at Sandia National
Laboratories, enabling them to select and navigate to an array of
potential targets.15 This convergence of advanced technologies is one of
the greatest concerns of analysts who fear the loss of human control
over the pace of combat. Paul [[Scharre]{.underline}]{.mark}, a program
director at the Center for a New American Security, [[has warned of
a]{.mark} "**[flash wa]{.mark}r**"]{.underline} erupting [[when machines
**misinterpret**]{.mark} radar [signals and
initiate]{.mark}]{.underline} catastrophic, possibly **[[nuclear
responses]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "Competitive pressures in fast-paced
environments threaten to push humans further and further out of the
loop," he wrote. "With this arms race in speed come grave risks,"
[including]{.underline} "[a **war** that **spirals out of control** in
mere **seconds**]{.underline}."16

[Nuclear war has no winner]{.underline}. Beginning in 2006, several of
[the [world's leading climatologists]{.mark}]{.underline} (at Rutgers,
UCLA, John Hopkins University, and the University of Colorado-Boulder)
[[published a series of studies]{.mark} that evaluated the long-term
environmental consequences of a nuclear war]{.underline}, [[including
baseline scenarios fought with merely 1% of]{.mark} the [explosive power
in the US]{.mark} and/or Russian [launch-ready nuclear
arsenals]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They concluded that the consequences of
**[even a "small" nuclear war]{.mark} would include [catastrophic
disruptions of global climate]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} massive
[destruction of]{.mark} Earth's protective [ozone]{.mark}
layer]{.underline}. These and more recent studies predict that global
agriculture would be so negatively affected by such a war, a global
famine would result, which would cause up to 2 billion people to starve
to death. These peer-reviewed studies -- which were analyzed by the best
scientists in the world and found to be without error -- also predict
that a war fought with less than half of US or Russian strategic
[[nuclear weapons would destroy the human race]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
other words, a US-Russian nuclear war would [create such extreme
long-term [damage to the]{.mark} global [environment]{.mark} that it
[would leave the Earth uninhabitable]{.mark} for humans and most animal
forms of life]{.underline}. A recent article in the Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists, "Self-assured destruction: The climate impacts of
nuclear war," begins by stating: "[A nuclear war]{.underline} between
Russia and the United States, even after the arsenal reductions planned
under New START, [could produce a nuclear winter. Hence, an attack by
either side could be suicidal, resulting in self-assured
destruction]{.underline}." In 2009, I wrote "Catastrophic Climatic
Consequences of Nuclear Conflicts" for the International Commission on
Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament. The article summarizes the
findings of these studies. [It explains that nuclear [firestorms would
produce millions of tons of smoke]{.mark}, which would rise above cloud
level and form a global stratospheric smoke layer [that would]{.mark}
rapidly [encircle the Earth]{.mark}. The smoke layer would remain for at
least a decade, and it would act to destroy the protective ozone
layer]{.underline} ([vastly increasing the UV-B reaching
Earth]{.underline}) [as well as block warming sunlight, thus [creating
Ice Age]{.mark} weather [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline} that would last
10 years or longer. Following a US-Russian nuclear war,
[temperatures]{.underline} in the central US and Eurasia [would fall
below freezing every day]{.underline} for one to three years[; the
intense cold would completely eliminate growing seasons]{.underline} for
a decade or longer. [[No crops could be grown]{.mark}, leading to a
famine that would kill most humans and large animal populations.
**[E]{.mark}**lectro**[m]{.mark}**agnetic **[p]{.mark}**ulse from
high-altitude nuclear detonations [would destroy]{.mark} the integrated
[circuits in all modern electronic devices]{.mark}, [including]{.mark}
those in commercial [nuclear power plants]{.mark}. [Every]{.mark}
nuclear [reactor would]{.mark} almost **[instantly meltdown]{.mark}**;
every nuclear spent fuel pool]{.underline} (which contain many times
more radioactivity than found in the reactors) [would boil off,
releasing vast amounts of long-lived radioactivity. [The]{.mark}
[fallout]{.mark}]{.underline} would make most of the US and Europe
**[[uninhabitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Of course, [the survivors of
the nuclear war would be starving to death]{.underline} anyway. Once
nuclear weapons were introduced into a US-Russian conflict, there would
be little chance that a nuclear holocaust could be avoided. [Theories of
"limited nuclear war" and "nuclear de-escalation" are
unrealistic]{.underline}. In 2002 the Bush administration modified US
strategic doctrine from a retaliatory role to permit preemptive nuclear
attack; in 2010, the Obama administration made only incremental and
miniscule changes to this doctrine, leaving it essentially unchanged.
Furthermore, Counterforce doctrine -- used by both the US and Russian
military -- emphasizes the need for preemptive strikes once nuclear war
begins. Both sides would be under immense pressure to launch a
preemptive nuclear first-strike once military hostilities had commenced,
especially if nuclear weapons had already been used on the battlefield.
Both the US and Russia each have 400 to 500 launch-ready ballistic
missiles armed with a total of at least 1800 strategic nuclear warheads,
which can be launched with only a few minutes warning. Both the US and
Russian Presidents are accompanied 24/7 by military officers carrying a
"nuclear briefcase," which allows them to transmit the permission order
to launch in a matter of seconds. Yet top political leaders and
policymakers of both the US and Russia seem to be unaware that their
launch-ready nuclear weapons represent a self-destruct mechanism for the
human race. For example, in 2010, I was able to publicly question the
chief negotiators of the New START treaty, Russian Ambassador Anatoly
Antonov and (then) US Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller,
during their joint briefing at the UN (during the Non-Proliferation
Treaty Review Conference). I asked them if they were familiar with the
recent peer-reviewed studies that predicted the detonation of less than
1% of the explosive power contained in the operational and deployed US
and Russian nuclear forces would cause catastrophic changes in the
global climate, and that a nuclear war fought with their strategic
nuclear weapons would kill most people on Earth. They both answered
"no." More recently, on April 20, 2014, I asked the same question and
received the same answer from the US officials sent to brief
representatives of the NGOS at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory
Committee meeting at the UN. None of the US officials at the briefing
were aware of the studies. Those present included top officials of the
National Security Council. It is frightening that President Obama and
his administration appear unaware that the world's leading scientists
have for years predicted that a nuclear war fought with the US and/or
Russian strategic nuclear arsenal means the end of human history. Do
they not know of the existential threat these arsenals pose to the human
race . . . or do they choose to remain silent because this fact doesn't
fit into their official narratives? We hear only about terrorist threats
that could destroy a city with an atomic bomb, while the threat of human
extinction from nuclear war is never mentioned -- even when the US and
Russia are each running huge nuclear war games in preparation for a
US-Russian war. Even more frightening is the fact that the neocons
running [[US foreign policy believe]{.mark} that the US has "[nuclear
primacy]{.mark}"]{.underline} over Russia; [[that]{.mark} is, [the US
could successfully launch a nuclear sneak attack
against]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian (and
[[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[nuclear forces and completely destroy
them]{.underline}]{.mark}. This theory was articulated in 2006 in "The
Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy," which was published in Foreign Affairs by
the Council on Foreign Relations. By concluding that the Russians and
Chinese would be unable to retaliate, or if some small part of their
forces remained, would not risk a second US attack by retaliating, the
article invites nuclear war. Colonel Valery Yarynich (who was in charge
of security of the Soviet/Russian nuclear command and control systems
for 7 years) asked me to help him write a rebuttal, which was titled
"**[[Nuclear Primacy]{.mark} is a Fallacy]{.underline}**." Colonel
Yarynich, who was on the Soviet General Staff and did war planning for
the USSR, concluded that the "[Primacy]{.underline}" article [[used
faulty methodology and erroneous assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark}, thus
invalidating its conclusions. My contribution lay in my knowledge of the
recently published (in 2006) studies, which predicted [**[even a
"successful" nuclear first-strike]{.mark}**, which destroyed 100% of the
opposing side's nuclear weapons, [would cause the]{.mark} citizens of
[the side that "won"]{.mark} the nuclear war [to **perish from nuclear
famine**]{.mark}, just as would the rest of humanity]{.underline}.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NON-NUCLEAR DISARMING STRIKES This threat of a
non-nuclear disarming strike is a central topic of discussion among
Russian experts and government officials. **[The key bone of contention
is whether the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**might
attempt a massive conventional counterforce attack against Russia**
(which would inevitably be less effective than a nuclear counterforce
strike), assuming that Moscow would be reluctant to respond with nuclear
weapons given the certainty of follow-on nuclear retaliation by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. A particular issue of concern
is that Russia's emphasis on the threat of a conventional disarming
strike could be perceived in the United States as evidence of Moscow's
unwillingness to use nuclear arms to counter such a strike, prompting
the United States to start precisely this kind of conventional air
campaign to attain escalation dominance in a local or regional conflict.
[**In reality, however**, and in contrast to such strategic
calculations, [Moscow might retaliate early with a limited]{.mark}
strategic [nuclear strike]{.mark} in the event that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [launched a conventional
counterforce operation against Russia's nuclear forces ([in accordance
with Russia's launch-under-attack doctrine]{.mark})]{.underline}.
Alternatively, **[[Moscow might even preempt]{.mark} the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**with selective
strategic nuclear [strikes]{.mark}** [to thwart U.S. naval and air
forces]{.mark} that were [engaged in a **conventional conflict**]{.mark}
and **perceived as conducting a conventional counterforce offensive** by
launching attacks against airfields, naval bases, and their C3I
facilities]{.underline}. [In the latter case, Moscow would count on the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [responding selectively with
"tailored strategic options" even after nuclear explosions had occurred
on its territory]{.underline}. [In reality, [the **U.S. response** might
be a large-scale nuclear attack against Russia]{.mark}, **provoking a
massive nuclear exchange**]{.underline}. In any case, the more concerned
that Moscow is about the survivability of its nuclear forces, the more
likely escalation becomes. Targets for a non-nuclear disarming strike
might include super-hardened command centers at various echelons, ICBM
silos, light shelters for land-based mobile missiles, exposed mobile
ICBM launchers in the field, ballistic missile submarines at their
bases, heavy bombers at main and reserve airfields, communication sites
on land, early-warning radars, command centers for the missile
early-warning system, and storage depots for nuclear weapons. The
vulnerability of these targets depends on how well they are defended and
concealed, and on the effectiveness of countermeasures against incoming
weapons. Early-warning radars, light shelters for mobile ICBM launchers,
missile submarines at their bases, and heavy bombers at airfields, as
well as C3I centers and sites that are not deeply buried, can be
incapacitated relatively easily if the attacking weapons have sufficient
range and good targeting. [In the event of a local or regional
conventional conflict between Russia and **NATO** in Eastern Europe or
the Arctic, airstrikes and cruise missile attacks against these sites
would **most likely cause rapid escalation to a nuclear
war**]{.underline}. [In particular, **early U.S. strikes** against such
targets **might not be deliberate** since Russian strategic submarines
and bombers are kept at the same bases as general-purpose naval vessels
and aircraft, and strikes designed to target the latter might
inadvertently destroy the former]{.underline}. Unlike the logic that may
be behind Chinese policies, the co-location of nuclear and
general-purpose forces in the USSR and now in Russia was and is prompted
by economic and administrative considerations, not by the strategic goal
of trying to deter U.S. non-nuclear strikes against Russian
general-purpose forces through the threat of nuclear escalation. [The
interception of heavy and medium dual-use bombers in flight during a
conventional conflict also makes entanglement virtually
inevitable]{.underline}. These bombers might take part in conventional
missions, but might also be sent out on patrol with nuclear weapons to
decrease their vulnerability in case the conflict escalates. If these
aircraft were destroyed while carrying nuclear weapons, there would be a
real risk of escalation. A similar risk could arise from conventional
threats to Russian nuclear-armed ballistic and cruise missile submarines
in the Arctic, North Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans.

[Any conflict]{.underline}, indeed any severe crisis, [between the
United States and Russia invariably would unfold under the "nuclear
shadow]{.underline}" cast by the large nuclear arsenals of the two
sides. Because of well-grounded concerns on both sides that a major
military conflict could escalate to implicate the nuclear forces of the
two sides, [for generations policymakers have sought to
promote]{.underline} **["strategic stability"]{.underline}** [between
the two nations.]{.underline}[62 [For the last 60
years]{.underline}]{.mark}[, the [stability of the
U.S.-Russian]{.mark}]{.underline} (previously U.S.-Soviet) [[nuclear
balance has been]{.mark} [based on]{.mark} each side's [confidence that
it could]{.mark} absorb even an all-out nuclear first
strike]{.underline} by the other side [and then [unleash a]{.mark}
devastating [nuclear second strike.]{.mark}]{.underline} As Albert
Wohlstetter wrote in "The Delicate Balance of Terror" in 1958, "To deter
an attack means being able to strike back in spite of it. It means, in
other words, a capability to strike second."63 [Over recent decades,
both sides have undertaken massive investments to ensure that they
sustained]{.underline} **[a secure second-strike
capability]{.underline}**, including deployments of highly survivable
delivery systems -- in particular nuclear-powered ballistic missile
submarines (SSBNs) for the United States, and mobile missiles for Russia
-- and resilient nuclear command and control. Over the decades of the
Cold War, two main alternatives to this balance of terror, or Mutual
Assured Destruction (MAD), were proposed: a shift to defense dominance,
as articulated in President Ronald Reagan's March 23, 1983, Strategic
Defense Initiative speech, and the mutual and global abolition of
nuclear weapons, as also articulated by President Reagan at the 1986
Reykjavik Summit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev[. Because of
the massive destructive potential of nuclear weapons]{.underline},
meaning that even limited penetration of an adversary's defenses renders
the value of such an approach effectively nugatory, [and the extreme
challenges of near-perfect missile and air defense against]{.underline}
a capable and adaptive adversary**[, [defense dominance has not been and
will not be technically possible]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the
foreseeable future. **[Neither will the elimination of all nuclear
weapons be possible]{.underline}** for the foreseeable future; [there is
no sign of the global political will to impose]{.underline} (or accept)
[the elimination of all nuclear arms and essentially unlimited
inspections in all nuclear-capable nations;]{.underline} [to the
contrary, the nuclear arsenals of a number of actors (China, India,
Pakistan, and North Korea) are growing.]{.underline} Whatever one's
wishes, for the foreseeable future nuclear weapons show no prospect of
meeting either part of President Reagan's goal to make them "impotent
and obsolete." **[Thus, for [the indefinite future,]{.mark} [the United
States and Russia must accept]{.mark} MAD or [mutual
vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[as a basis for the
stability]{.mark} of their strategic nuclear deterrence
relationship]{.underline}**. [This does not mean that stability is
guaranteed]{.underline} -- far from it. [Nuclear
deployments]{.underline} -- and perhaps even more so emerging cyber,
counter-space, missile defense, and non-nuclear strike systems [-- have
the potential to undermine strategic stability.]{.underline} As these
military capabilities are developed further, each side is likely to have
growing fears that the other side might use these capabilities (with or
without also using nuclear weapons) in a first strike to attempt to
negate its nuclear second-strike capabilities. U.S.-Russian Strategic
Stability in Today's MAD World [Assessing strategic stability today
requires considering both the balance of strategic nuclear weapons and
the balance of additional non-nuclear capabilities that the United
States and Russia could bring to bear in a major war]{.underline}.
Today, [the United States deploys a large percentage of its strategic
warheads on highly survivable strategic missile submarines]{.underline};
at all times, several of these vessels are at sea and ready to receive
orders to launch a devastating strike that Russia would be powerless to
stop. [The United States also possesses 400 fixed-silo intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs)]{.underline} that would be extremely
difficult for Russian missiles to comprehensively destroy, [as well as a
force of 60 dual-capable strategic bombers that could be dispersed and
placed on a more survivable alert status if needed]{.underline}. The
United States also maintains dual-capable fighter-bombers capable of
delivering nuclear gravity bombs. At the same time[, the United States
continues to maintain capabilities to ensure the requisite command and
control and early-warning apparatus to provide warning of any attack and
enable the National Command Authority to communicate launch orders to
the force]{.underline}. Accordingly, **[there are no serious concerns
about the U.S. ability today to launch a devastating nuclear retaliatory
strike against Russia]{.underline}** (or any other state), **[even in
the aftermath of an all-out attack]{.underline}**. [[Russia also retains
a triad of strategic delivery systems capable of delivering many
hundreds of second-strike warheads]{.underline}]{.mark} against the
United States. [[Russia deploys ICBMs]{.mark} both in fixed-silo
and]{.underline} (when dispersed) [[highly survivable mobile
configurations, strategic]{.mark} missile [submarines, and
bombers]{.mark} capable of delivering air-launched cruise
missiles]{.underline}. In addition, and unlike the United States, Russia
has nuclear-tipped sea-launched cruise missiles that it could launch
from its otherwise conventionally oriented attack submarines. Like the
United States, [[Moscow also possesses a]{.mark} [capable nuclear
command and control system]{.mark} as well as some capacity for early
warning of an adversary attack]{.underline}.65 **[[Under]{.mark} the
[New START]{.mark} Treaty]{.underline}**, which entered into force for a
ten-year period in February 2011, **[the [United States and Russia
agreed to]{.mark} three [main]{.mark} limits: no more than 700 deployed
strategic delivery systems]{.underline}** (ICBMs, SLBMs, and
nuclear-capable bombers); **[no more than 800 deployed plus non-deployed
strategic delivery systems; and no more than 1,550 accountable deployed
strategic weapons]{.underline}**. Under the treaty, each nuclear-capable
bomber counts as only one warhead irrespective of the number of gravity
bombs and airlaunched cruise missiles it may carry. In addition,
non-deployed nuclear weapons are not limited, and each side has the
ability to "upload" at least hundreds of additional warheads on ICBMs
and SLBMs should it decide to withdraw from the treaty. The table below
shows a recent estimate of the numbers of deployed and non-deployed U.S.
and Russian delivery systems and warheads. **[[In today's strategically
stable]{.mark} situation, [neither side can realistically see an
opportunity to limit damage to itself]{.mark} to a sufficiently
meaningful degree by conducting a first strike against the other side's
strategic nuclear forces]{.underline}**. Even if it chose to "ride out"
an attack and not launch its ICBMs, the United States would have many
hundreds of surviving SLBM weapons (plus weapons on any alert bombers)
with which to respond. Similarly, even if it chose to "ride out" an
attack and not launch its silo-based ICBMs, Russia would have several
hundred warheads on mobile ICBMs (plus weapons on any bombers). And
today, [neither side has a reasonable basis for fearing that it is
highly vulnerable to a disarming strike, and so neither side should feel
"use or lose" pressures]{.underline}. In a strategically stable
situation such as today's, one side or the other still could choose to
use nuclear weapons to attempt to gain military advantage and/or to send
a political signal. But [neither side should believe it has an
opportunity to disarm the other side, and thus neither side should feel
impelled to launch a nuclear attack because of fears of being so
disarmed]{.underline}. **[Thus]{.underline}**, bearing in mind that a
preemptive disarming strike would need to be nearly perfect to
meaningfully limit damage to the attacker, **[the U.S.-Russian strategic
balance today is quite stable]{.underline}**.66 Both sides have the
power to wreak unprecedented destruction on the other through the
employment of nuclear weapons even in the face of a determined effort by
the other to preempt and/or defend against it. **[Absent a fundamental
transformation in the military-technological balance between the two
states, enabled by the development and integration of novel military
capabilities, this high degree of strategic stability is set to persist
for the foreseeable future]{.underline}**. Such a fundamental
transformation of military capabilities, however, may already be under
way

[Countermeasures will be available, however. Green and Long note that
although jamming is a compelling countermeasure, jammers can be targeted
or used to cue other sensors. **[Jammers are,]{.mark}** however,
[**cheap and easily proliferated**; China could readily afford to deploy
hundreds]{.mark} of jammers [for every mobile
missile]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the mobile missiles could be equipped
with an identical jammer, [[presenting the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [with tens of thousands of]{.mark} potential
[targets.]{.mark} And rather than trying to make decoys appear more
realistic, **[China could make its missiles]{.mark} and transporters
[look]{.mark} more [like decoys]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by]{.mark}
covering them with materials that will present similar signatures to
overhead satellites. [[Even if continuous]{.mark} and robust [tracking
becomes possible**, mobile missiles can be made**]{.mark} **much more
[survivable]{.mark} by deploying them in areas where they can move in
any direction, and** [by **giving them the ability to travel at high
speeds**]{.mark} and to survive the blast from a nearby
explosion]{.underline}. The Chinese portion of the Gobi Desert covers an
area larger than Texas and is mostly bare rock, with large flat areas in
which a vehicle can travel dozens of kilometers in any direction. It
should be possible to build a transporter erector launcher (TEL) that
could travel up to 65 kilometers per hour (40 miles per hour) over such
terrain. If, in the most optimistic case for damage limitation, the
location of such a TEL could be determined and U.S. ballistic missiles
could be retargeted instantaneously, a single TEL could be anywhere
within a 3,300-square-kilometer area by the time the attacking warheads
arrive thirty minutes later. For comparison, the entire U.S. ballistic
missile force under the New Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty--- 400
intercontinental ballistic missiles and 1,090 submarine-launched
ballistic missile warheads---would have an effective lethal area of
25,000 to 60,000 square kilometers \[End Page 205\] against TELs
hardened to 5 to 10 pounds per square inch.8 [[In this best-case
analysis]{.mark} for damage limitation, the **[barrage attack would be
able to destroy only 8 to 20 TELs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But
[[instantaneous retargeting is not possible]{.mark}, and [the United
States would not launch its entire missile force]{.mark} against Chinese
mobile missiles.]{.underline} Using more plausible assumptions leaves
the United States able to destroy a still smaller number of Chinese
mobile missiles. To achieve a more effective capability against Chinese
mobile missiles, [**the United States would require continuous tracking
of TELs and retargeting** of warheads while the missiles are in flight.
This would require survivable and robust surveillance and satellite
communications syst]{.underline}ems, together with post-boost vehicles
that can receive updated target information (or, better still, warheads
that receive such information and maneuver to the new target).
[In-flight retargeting [**opens up the possibility** that adversaries
**could employ electronic countermeasures**]{.mark}**,** jamming the
transmission or perhaps even [diverting the warhead to a harmless
area]{.mark} or a U.S. ally.]{.underline} Concern about the possibility
of such countermeasures has prevented the United States from equipping
its intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic
missiles to receive information after launch (e.g., for improved
navigation or command-destruct in the event of an errant launch). Green
and Long raise the possibility that unattended ground sensors could be
used to track TEL movements. Setting aside the difficulties associated
with clandestine emplacement of such devices, they would work well only
if TELs are constrained to road networks, and even then they could be
defeated or spoofed with noise-makers. (The Viet Cong played recordings
of truck traffic to spoof U.S. air-dropped acoustic detectors.) Green
and Long cast doubt on China's ability to launch from unprepared sites,
because missile crews could not rely on satellite navigation for
geolocation. This is not a difficult problem to solve. First, one could
pre-survey thousands of potential launch sites in advance at relatively
low cost. Second, one could establish terrestrial navigation systems,
such as eLoran or ground-based global positioning satellite systems, to
provide robust geolocation in mobile missile deployment areas. Third,
one could rely on inertial navigation systems, which would be perfectly
adequate for periods of a few hours, bearing in mind that high accuracy
is not needed for attacks against cities. Finally, Green and Long
suggest that stealthy penetrating unmanned aerial vehicles might be used
to find and destroy mobile missiles. As they note, classification makes
it difficult to fully evaluate such systems, but there are reasons to
believe that this would prove difficult to implement. First, stealth
technology reduces the range at which aircraft can be detected by radar
and other sensors, but does not render them invisible. There are
countermeasures to stealth, such as the use of low-frequency active
electronically scanned array radars and passive electromagnetic and
infrared sensors to cue high-frequency radars. Second, surveillance
requires operation at high altitude and modest speeds, to maximize area
coverage and endurance, while penetration of the adversary's airspace
calls for low altitudes and high speeds. One could have swarms of high-
and low-fliers that communicate with each other, but communication opens
up \[End Page 206\] the possibility of electronic countermeasures.
Third, aircraft would have flight times of many hours to launch sites
deep inside China, even if launched from the territory of regional
allies or ships near the coastlin[e]{.underline}. The detection of even
one such aircraft would give ample time for countermeasures, such as the
movement of a missile into one of several shelters. **[We are aware of
no technological trends that make it likely that the United States will
have an enduring advantage in maintaining a damage-limitation capability
against China]{.underline}.**9 But if technological trends do provide
such an advantage, China would have the option of establishing an
ability to launch on warning of a U.S. attack. [The small [satellite
revolution will]{.mark} make possible robust and low-cost warning
systems, able to [detect missile launches anywhere on Earth]{.mark} and
provide continuous tracking information and aimpoint
prediction.]{.underline} This would give China warning of a U.S.
counterforce attack and allow China to launch its forces under attack.
[There would be no easy U.S. countermeasure to such a
capability]{.underline}. Similarly, China could pre-delegate launch
authority to compensate for any shortcomings in the survivability of its
command and communication capabilities. Both measures would increase
risks of accidental, inadvertent, and unauthorized use of nuclear
weapons, but China could reasonably judge that these risks were worth
running to defeat U.S. damage-limitation programs.

#### First strike breaks [nuclear taboo]{.underline}\-\--[extinction]{.underline}

**Gibbons** **and** **Lieber 19** \[Rebecca Davis Gibbons is a
Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Belfer Center at the Harvard Kennedy
School, is currently working on a book on the politics of the nuclear

<https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/01402390.2018.1529568?needAccess=true>\]

[Scholars often hold aloft the **[nuclear taboo]{.mark} as evidence that
norms [significantly constrain state behavior]{.mark}**, even in the
realm of [national security.]{.mark}]{.underline} The nuclear taboo is
also sometimes invoked in policy debates; for example, to suggest that
the U.S. and other countries' arsenals of nuclear weapons can be
drastically reduced and eventually eliminated. But the conclusions that
analysts and policymakers draw from the nuclear taboo literature exceed
what the evidence warrants. There are good reasons for analysts to
question the strength and prevalence of an international norm against
nuclear use, but here we highlight several reasons why the durability of
a moral-based nuclear taboo is dubious. First, the comparable case of
strategic bombing does not support hypotheses about how and when
norm-violation should strengthen morally-based taboos. Second, recent
survey and social science research challenges the durability of a moral
taboo. For example, surveys indicate that a majority of Americans, who
are supposed to have internalized the nuclear taboo, would be willing to
use nuclear weapons against terrorist adversaries or Iran. Furthermore,
experiments in psychology tell us that leaders can encourage their
population to make tragic trade-offs through their framing of choices.
The strategic bombing case illustrates one such trade-off: General
Eisenhower siding with strategic bombing proponents to facilitate a
quicker end to World War II. Opposition to the use of nuclear weapons in
the abstract does not guarantee opposition in times of crisis. Finally,
precedent logics -- not moral logics -- appear to more commonly underlie
taboos in warfare. [[Once the bargain against bombing civilians broke
down, there was little moral compunction leading countries to stop
pursuing this strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Furthermore, the survey
literature referenced above suggests that respondents' reluctance to
have the United States employ nuclear weapons stems from a concern about
precedence, not moral authority. If the nuclear taboo is based upon
concern for precedent and not moral opprobrium, then resuscitating the
taboo after an incident of nuclear use may be unrealistic. These
findings point to a number of policy implications. Most importantly,
policy-makers should be aware of the challenges to the norm against
nuclear use after a future violation. Both the moral logic and precedent
logic cause reason to be skeptical that the norm would remain durable.
[As a result, [preventing nuclear use in the first place is
paramount.]{.mark}]{.underline} The United States should continue to
seek to strengthen the global nuclear nonproliferation regime, a major
challenge at a time when NPT member states are so divided over nuclear
disarmament.86 U.S. leaders should refrain from making casual nuclear
threats against adversaries and should encourage other leaders to follow
suit. Moreover, in its declaratory policy, the United States should
restrict the intended use of its nuclear weapons to deterring nuclear
attacks. If the United States or its assets were attacked with a nuclear
weapon, leaders would have to strongly consider whether responding in
kind would do more harm than good. Fortunately, U.S. conventional
superiority means that the U.S. military would have many non-nuclear
means to respond. Finally, [because we find that the **[precedent
logic]{.mark} to be more [compelling in explaining
non-use]{.mark},**]{.underline} the United States should consider ways
in which it can affect whether future nuclear use is perceived as
successful and how it can lead the international community in bringing
about a strong sanctioning response against those responsible for such
an attack. If nuclear use is perceived as unsuccessful or the attacker
is meaningfully punished, the precedent is more likely to be
re-established.

### AT: AI\-\--2AC

#### Russia AI weak

Dr. Christopher **Whyte 22**, assistant professor of homeland security
and emergency preparedness at Virginia Commonwealth University,
"Russia's AI setbacks will likely heighten its cyber aggression,"
<https://www.csoonline.com/article/3656957/russias-ai-setbacks-will-likely-heighten-its-cyber-aggression.html/micahw>

In 2017, Vladimir Putin famously stated that "\[a\]rtificial
intelligence is the future not only of Russia but of all of mankind" and
that "\[w\]hoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the
ruler of the world." Indeed, AI has come to sit at the heart of landmark
initiatives established by the world's leading powers to transform the
conflicts, economies and societies of the future.

Mirroring efforts in Europe, a National Security Commission on
Artificial Intelligence in the United States has encouraged immense
increases in non-defense AI spending, widespread talent development and
recruitment programming, and revamped acquisition vehicles to make
harnessing new AI potential easier. India has become the leading adopter
of AI tools among emerging economies. China has established
unprecedented investment regimes tied to programs like the Belt and Road
Initiative -- and defined by the 2017 New Generation Artificial
Intelligence Development Plan -- designed to leapfrog perceived American
technological superiorities.

Despite Putin's statements, [Russia's AI efforts have lagged behind most
initiatives in other countries]{.underline}. In 2014, barely [two years
after a breakthrough innovation of deep neural networks by a
multinational group of researchers energized AI
development]{.underline}, Russia's buildout of new machine learning
applications and other AI tools was already slowing significantly.
Collaborations with cutting-edge projects in the West, China, India and
elsewhere began to drop away following Putin's annexation of Crimea and
decision to embroil Eastern Ukraine in ongoing conflict.

State-sponsored companies and military-intelligence institutions in the
Russian Federation have consistently been a leading source of novel AI
technologies aimed at bolstering national security and strengthening
mechanisms of population control. However, [a slow leak of human capital
and a complicated relationship with parts of the global economy that
dominate critical high technology resources]{.underline}, such as
graphics processing units (GPUs), [have become a substantial obstacle
for the country's AI ambitions. Even if Moscow matched China's or the
United States' levels of domestic AI investment, its fundamentals of
innovation for the field simply haven't been concrete for some

[One major blow]{.underline} to Moscow's AI ambitions is [the dramatic
acceleration of the **brain drain** that has plagued Russian high
technology and scientific communities for years. Enticing researchers
out of private industry and academia is perennially difficult for
governments, but Russia has been even less capable in this regard than
mos]{.underline}t, likely [due to the unappealing culture and benefits
of Putin's military and paramilitary communities]{.underline}. Now, up
to 70,000 tech workers that were otherwise minimal flight risks have
fled the country. Many have ended up in former Soviet states and South
Asia, and no small number have left positions tied to the Russian
state's focus on building out facial recognition, autonomous vehicles
and surveillance capabilities.

[Sanctions worsen the impact of this brain drain by cutting across the
research and business relationships that Moscow has heavily supported in
recent years]{.underline}. In the face of shaky fundamentals for
domestic AI development, Putin's government has emphasized
collaborations across industry and academia with India and China.
Publication and patent activity seem to suggest that this approach may
have been paying off for Russia.

Despite producing a fraction of AI-linked patents (50 or \~5%) last year
relative to the United States and China, Sino-Russian and Russo-Indian
research teams collaborated on hundreds of research papers in the same
period. Now, with such collaborations subject to international sanctions
on Russian industry and citizens, this approach seems destined to flop.
If anything, [this dynamic virtually **ensures the Russia will become an
even more minor actor in economic relationships**]{.underline} with
Asian countries as the absence of American firms and the loss of any
ability to lead collaborations removes the leverage that Russian
industry might previously have had.

Here's what we know. [The [US has]{.mark} likely the [foremost academics
and talent in artificial intelligence]{.mark} who are attracted either
by academia, or by Tech companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and
others. Washington has been slow to act on calls for regulation in
AI.]{.underline} Washington Finally Forms AI-Regulation Task-Force The
Center for a New American Security ([CNAS), one of America's top defense
and foreign policy think tanks, announced the creation of a Task Force
on Artificial Intelligence and National Security, as part of the
organization's Artificial Intelligence and Global Security
Initiative.]{.underline} It will be led by Steve Moore, dean of Carnegie
Mellon University's School of Computer Science, and Robert O. Work, who
was deputy defense secretary from 2014--2017 and formerly CEO of CNAS.
China is Prioritizing Artificial Intelligence to become a Tech
Superpower by 2025 [China, intent on dominating artificial intelligence
in a race with the United States, is said to be on a steep ascent toward
at least a tie]{.underline}. **[But a number of AI experts say that
while China can come close, it will be hard to catch up
completely]{.underline}**, according to Axios. But is this actually the
case? [A recent study from a team of economists at the University of
Toronto has concluded that **[China is]{.mark} steadily [gaining on the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates in the field of artificial
intelligence.**]{.underline} The 2017 Association for the Advancement of
Artificial Intelligence ([AAAI), a worldwide conference that presents
the achievements of the world's AI leaders, indicated that **23 percent
of the authors of academic papers were based from China**]{.underline},
[according to the AI and International Trade study. **This was a massive
leap** in terms of research output, considering that Chinese AI
researchers only contributed 10 percent of the research output in the
2012 AAAI. **China's research output will likely be close to being on
par with the United States in 2018, and will overtake them as early as
2020.** China will throw more money, resources, and has more consumer
data to tackle the problem of developing the next-gen of Artificial
Intelligence. China has 3x as many internet users as the United States
has total population. This means that Big Data and less privacy
protection favors Chinese Tech companies over their western
counterparts. Chinese Tech companies]{.underline} such as Tencent and
Alibaba [have greater access to consumer data]{.underline} than do
companies such as Google and Facebook, that do not own either E-commerce
markets (as Alibaba) or apps as ubiquitous and multi-functional as
(Tencent's) WeChat. More Funding for AI Research According to popular
technology analysts CB Insights, they report that [**[China has
overtaken the US in]{.mark} the funding of AI [startups]{.mark}**. China
accounted for 48 percent of the world's total AI startup funding in
2017, **compared to 38 percent for the US**]{.underline}. [This
corroborates data from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial
Intelligence (AAAI). The next generation of AI talent educated in the
States may be tempted to join Chinese Tech companies instead of Western
Tech Companies, as in the 2020s may be able to offer better compensation
and more bleeding edge working environments that will be building more
impactful products. **International talent may be less likely to want to
move to the U.S. with the current policies of the
administration**]{.underline} and prefer countries such as Canada,
Australia, or even the U.K. [Many of the top Students now in U.S.
colleges are in fact Chinese international students.]{.underline} Here
is one of the cruxes of the problem, the U.S. is itself the education
center for the next generation. These talented Chinese Students won't
all want to work for the sinking ship that is Facebook, or the
internally divided company that is Google. Could it be, could it
possibly be that some of them will prefer the career track that is
Alibaba, Tencent, Didi, Baidu, Huawei, Toutiao or any other number of
ascending China companies and startup unicorns? Common Sense is the
Simplest Answer to Futurist's Questions **[It's actually ridiculous to
suppose that the next economic superpower won't be the leader in
technology and artificial intelligence]{.underline}**. [Even the former
experts of U.S. Tech giants are coming to the same
conclusion.]{.underline} Recently former Google CEO Eric **[Schmidt told
his audience that it won't be long before China overtakes the United
States in the development of advanced artificial intelligence
(AI)]{.underline}**, [according to a report by The Verge]{.underline}.
Knowing what we know about the impact of Chinese cities on innovation,
[we have to assume that some of humanity's greatest breakthroughs in
exponential technologies and the future of machine learning and AI will
come out of China, **if not the majority**]{.underline}. [This is
because it's a **numbers game and funding and the government push of
Beijing, is on China's side**.]{.underline} A report jointly published
by New York-based research consultancy Eurasia Group and Beijing-based
VC firm Sinovation Ventures on Dec. 6 outlined how [**China has been
making rapid advances in AI over the past few years.** Sure Google is
making terrific advances, yes Amazon is prioritizing Alexa-like- crazy
since we now know the Voice-AI interface will be a multi-billion dollar
industry and possibly the future of the human-AI computing interface.
**But for China, its tech dynasty and state-supported technology
community is literally just getting started. It doesn't have all the VC
bureaucracy and Washington relationship Silicon Valley has to deal with
on a constant basis.** China is ahead when it comes to the dollar value
of AI startup funding, which CB Insights says demonstrates the country
is "aggressively executing a thoroughly-designed vision for AI." **But
[for the top 5% of researchers]{.mark}, certainly [the U.S. is still in
the driver's seat, for]{.mark} possibly [a few more
year]{.mark}s.**]{.underline} Typically in academica, the discipline is
driven ahead and pioneered by the top few percent of the greatest minds
in a given niche field. [China has perhaps, about another decade until
it's able to recruit such high-level talent on a consistent
basis.]{.underline} Could China overtake the the US in AI development?
[It's no longer a question of if, but when. The answer is **we don't
know.**]{.underline} In reviewing some of the literature, where I of
course am by no means an expert, [I would think **by the late 2020s and
possibly much earlier**, China will be contributing more to AI
development than the United States.]{.underline} That's not good or bad,
or a politically motivated opinion**[, that's just
reality]{.underline}**. As this occurs, Chinese Tech companies will
begin to overtake western ones. Picture this, the market cap of the
likes of Apple and Google, overtaken by younger and more innovative
Chinese companies? It's hard to imagine, right. Or is it? \[Graph
Ommitted\] It's almost inevitable now that Tencent and Alibaba could
catch the likes of Facebook and Microsoft. It may take a bit longer for
them to catch the likes of Alphabet and Amazon though. However, that's
what the data is beginning to show when we make simulations of the
likely course of events in the future of technology, innovation and
machine intelligence. \[Graph Ommitted\] [China's proportion of global
AI startup funding as a percentage of dollar value]{.underline}. Image:
CB Insights We've known for some time that compared to the incredible
pace of patents by the likes of Amazon, the likes of Huawei are catching
up. Comparing products, it does not take a genius to figure out that
WeChat is more addictive and useful than Facebook's flagship app. It's
difficult for Chinese smartphone makers to compete with the profit
margins of Apple, but they have and are starting to take marketshare
away from Apple, that has been the cream of the crop for over a decade.
China has the Will to create a Chinese Tech Dynasty We know in terms of
investment, Softbank, Tencent and Alibaba are doing things that will
change the technological landscape for decades. Yet as impressive as
that sounds (Softank is Japanese), it's the incredible unity of the
political will that makes this so much of a certainty. [[China]{.mark}
has previously laid out [plans to]{.mark} become the world
[lead]{.mark}er [in AI by 2030]{.mark}, as outlined in a government
policy released in July of 2017. With China's leader now destined to
stay on past 2023, **the sky is the limit for a Chinese driven era of
progress**]{.underline}. In the scope of civilization, it doesn't matter
who owns the keys to the driver's seat of technological progress and
artificial intelligence. At the end of the day, it benefits all global
citizens, consumers and users. We may criticise how American apps and an
American lead internet have made us into app addicts, but the same thing
has occurred everywhere. Who\'s to say that China as a leader in tech
and AI might not actually be even more responsible and aware of that
responsibility than Silicon Valley has, which has largely failed us. It
doesn't really matter if it's China or SpaceX or Blue Origin or somebody
else that brings us to Mars. But to fulfill the dream of Stephen
Hawking, Elon Musk and thousands of others, it must happen soon for the
human species to have a higher probability of long-term survival. The
Entirely New Models of AI Development Will Likely Come out of China It's
indeed plausible that as some have suggested, China has already
overtaken the U.S. when it comes to AI research. Yet the Holy Grail of
artificial intelligence and the convergence of quantum computing and new
ways of thinking about possibly deep learning or another system of AI
development means the essential breakthroughs that will occur, will
probably take place in China and will thus be in a sense, owned by China
for a certain period. This may give them a certain economic benefit and
a kind of technological advantage. New ways of thinking about machine
learning and how to help smart machines "learn how to learn" will come
from places and companies and smart cities that are themselves
experiencing their own mini Golden Ages. We know Chinese centers circa
2025 will be experiencing such an atmosphere. Thus, logically we have to
admit that they have the rational best shot at achieving
AI-breakthroughs that may never be possible in the U.S. again, at least
not in our lifetimes. This is because apart from all other things, the
best typically want to work with the best. The United States, on the
other hand, seems to be experiencing a steady decline in its artificial
intelligence initiatives. To return back to the AI conference, While 34
percent of the academic papers presented in the 2017 AAAI were still
American, the number shows a significant decrease from the output of the
country's researchers back in 2012, when studies from the United States
represented 41 percent of the academic papers in the conference. That's
pretty empirical evidence that relatively, China is ascending where
America is in decline. As a futurist, it's statistics like these that
change how I view the role of China not just economically and as a
leader in the smart grid, but in how smart machines scale to become part
of our lives in smart cities all over the globe. I'm Canadian, I
personally don't care where innovation takes place, I'm just pointing to
available facts. According to Futurism, the United States' current
levels of R&D spending on AI are one-half to one-quarter of the levels
that would be best for economic growth. China on the other hand, have
made becoming a leader in AI, one of the state's primary goals to
illustrate the advent of New China. This is where the facts become
scary. China's one-party rule affords them an incredible ability to "get
shit done." I don't suspect developing AI will be a major issue for
them, as having a higher population here becomes an essential advantage.
More collaboration and a bigger slices of funding and Big Data, will win
this war. The wheels of Chinese supremacy in AI have been set in motion.
\[Graphj Ommitted\] Data from the NSTC's AI R&D Plan. Credits: Office of
Science and Technology Policy/The White House I don't know if Deep
learning is the answer to the next-gen of AI, and I suspect that it is
not. However, once the domain of Google, that's no longer at all the
case. We once thought Waymo would arrive at self-driving cars years if
not months ahead of "everybody else." Now we find heading further into
2018, there are dozens of competitors who are likely very near to the
same level of advancement, some of those likely in China. A study
published by CB Insights on the upcoming AI trends for 2018 revealed
that, for the first time, investments destined for China surpassed those
for the US in this particular technology. China attracted almost half of
all investments, compared to 38% for the US. So when does China's
big-push to AI catch up in products, software integration and real-world
applications? How quickly does the R&D cycle manifest superiority on the
field? The problem here is sociological, China is a mandarin based
nation, and English is the global language. American companies have
greater penetration, think of Amazon entering and dominating India in
just a matter of years. Yet starting in 2017, China has become much more
globally minded South and East Asia rapidly and making key investments.
While American bravado charms and champions by culture and promises of
altruism like Facebook, China buys up your land, ports, water and key
assets positioning itself as the future in a very different manner. If
America leads by perusassion, China leads by action. China's superiority
in AI will therefore likely manifest in unexpected ways, in convenience
that could even rival the likes of Apple, Google and Amazon. China leads
in things like the sharing-economy, where bike-sharing startups Ofo and
Mobike, microcosms of the rivalries between Tencent and Alibaba, are
scaling globally fast. You will know China's superiority in Tech when
the following events occur. When Huawei has a larger global market share
than Apple. When Alibaba has a larger market cap than Amazon. When
Tencent's profits overtake Facebook. In 2018 you might think these
events could never, and never will happen. But what if I told you that
for a brief time, one of them already did occur. \[Graph Ommitted\] Here
I am just illustrating how the Tech Dynasty of China is rising, but it's
not a dynasty yet. As a Futurist, I believe the start-point for that
even is circa 2022. American original content streaming, digital
advertising and AI is likely to consolidate into two or three winners
(and I don't believe Apple or Netflix will be among them). By the mid
2020s, it will likely just be Amazon and Alphabet left standing.
Facebook has a digital ads giant, may not have such a bright future.
Even as big a monopoly as Amazon is destined to become, as many jobs as
it will create for Americans, it's literally nothing compared to the
Chinese Tech Dynasty that's coming in the form of Tencent, Alibaba,
Didi, Huawei, Xiaomi, Baidu and so many others. Admittedly, this is hard
for many Americans and Europeans to get their head around. For Indians
and South-East Asians it's less of a stretch of the imagination. Each
year approaching 2022, there will be increasing evidence that this is
taking place. Chinese researchers' contributions to the best 100 AI
journals/conferences rose as a percent of total papers from 23.2% in
2006 to 42.8% in 2015 and as a percent of cited papers from 25.5% to
55.8%. There's reason to believe post 2017, the pace of this data-point
will now accelerate. In this great transition we won't be able to think
of a China-US "duopoly" for every long, since China will so far outpace
the United States in AI-research, as to distance itself as Amazon has
distanced itself from Microsoft, as Cortana is to Alexa. One of the key
indicators is also in terms of investments. At home we can witness
Silicon VAlley has entered a period of stagnation, where Chinese 1st
tier cities have entered another a period of incredible growth. Massive
investment in R&D including state-sponsored funds means Tencent and
Alibaba are also building the future of Chinese with massive smarts.
Just looking at Tencent's investments in 2017, you get an idea of the
scale at which this is occuring. Looking at Alibaba's biggest
investments in 2017, they are no less impressive. Tech in Asia It could
be argued the Chinese duopoly is giving back more to innovation and
startups than is the American Ad duopoly of Google and Facebook. As
Apple is nearly and will soon be worth \$1 Trillion dollars, what has it
done for innovation or American job recently? Here is where Capitalism
as we know it, is failing innovation. In Asia, they have not hit the
same bottleneck, nor are they likely to anytime soon. China has an Army
of Little Amazons Working Night and Day The Chinese tech custom of
working 9/9/6 (from 9am to 9pm, six days a week) is a symbol of the
Chinese work-ethic. What does a 72-hour week amount to in terms of
actual innovation? The world is about to find out. Beijing published a
national development plan for AI, aiming to increase China's economic
clout by more than 150 billion yuan (22.15 billion dollars) by 2020 and
to 400 billion yuan (59.07 billion dollars) by 2025, according to
figures from the State Council. China's Xiaomi wants to put artificial
intelligence 'everywhere', and it's not alone. Face++, a Chinese face
recognition startup (and one of Sinovation's investments), recently won
first place in 3 computer vision challenges, ahead of teams from
Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and CMU. Xiaomi plans to put sensors and AI
processing components in home electronics while running a computing
cloud handling more complex calculation for them. To keep up with the
likes of Huawei, Xiaomi must think big, and for the likes of Didi to
catch Uber and so many other races, China is racing with itself in a
race that makes over-taking less agile and less hard working U.S.
companies all but a given. All of this is without taking into the most
important aspect of all progress. China has yet to hit it's economic
peak of Economic superiority over the U.S. China Predicted to Surpass
U.S. Economically by 2032 This study is pretty conservative I think, a
report by CERB, the Centre for Economics and Business Research in
London. \[chart ommitted\] Towards the Technological Singularity But
let's remember, speech and image recognition technology might be nice,
but it isn't the future of AI. Real breakthroughs require converging new
answers to age old questions. If "There is no data like more data",
China is about to have a serious advantage over the U.S. Amazon Prime
can have 100 million users, it sounds nice on paper. Tencent's WeChat
already has around 1 Billion users. WeChat's payment integration with QR
codes means it's far more actionable data that loads of Facebook,
WhatsApp and Instagram user accounts. There's literally no western
equivalent to Tencent. They are into mobile gaming and investing in ways
that Facebook should have, but never did get into. When AI stands to
transform virtually everything including labor, the environment, and the
future of warfare and cyberconflict, the superiority of China in AI over
the United States will feel very very real in the 2030s. China's rapid
agility towards green technology and electric cars is also more
aggressive by proximity to air, water and food pollution. The forces
that push China further are more urgent and more the will of its
leaders. In the U.S. there's no such leadership or urgency, as America
has become the brat of the Paris Accord and must depend on names like
SpaceX, Tesla and only a handful of companies to actually even look
competitive. Countries like Germany have embraced the smart energy grid,
now maybe almost a decade ahead of the U.S.. In China, they aren't
falling behind, they are keeping pace. The timing of the Tech
Singularity coincides with Chinese Dominance in Tech By the time China
passes the U.S. sufficiently in artificial intelligence, the next-gen
pre-sentient AI systems will be starting to come online. Where do you
think they will first be born? It won't be San Francisco, Boston or New
York, it will be Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. Think about for a
second even what a tier-1 Chinese city means. China classifies its
cities according to GDP, administrative level and population. All first
tier cities have a GDP over \$US 300 billion. Tier 1 cities are directly
controlled by central government. Cities with more than 15 million
people. In short, Tier 1 cities of China, don't even exist in the U.S.
Asia's high density and collectivistic norms for the full-engagement of
innovation and progress, are more suited to manifesting the
technological Singularity. This might sound counter-intuitive to some,
but let history be our witness. Countries that are centralized in the
way China is, can also collaborate on joint ventures in a way that would
not be possible in America, even if America had China's population. By
the way, the American fertility rate is a post 2008 recession trend that
is officially a time ticking demographic bomb. The coming wave of
automation and the future of work, will further crush it. As China's
economy scales China's middle class, the generation of Chinese born in
the 1990s are the most transformative generation in the history of
humankind. Circa, 2035, they are doing some of their best work, manifest
destiny for the Technological Singularity. The Universal Basic Income
debates in America of the early 2020s will attract a lot of people who
will want to move there. You think climate migrants are going to be big?
This will create an economic press, where post-automation, China is
significantly ahead of America. India's demographics with so many
Millennials, will be playing catch-up and in the 2030s will make
remarkable progress. You don't want to be in the U.S. in the 2030s. This
is because Americas have no intention of combating wealth inequality,
they will be victims of their own free-market thinking and a decently
large segment of the Middle Class is going to pay the price and bite the
bullet. China as a high-tech police state will have its own issues. In
relationship to the future of Artificial Intelligence, China is still a
far better place to be born. However premature this may sound in 2018.
The Chinese Tech Dynasty is Closing In When you consider even the top
funded companies in China in 2017, you begin to get a sense of the scale
the Didi, Meituan-Dianping, Daikuan, NIO, Ofo and Mobikes of the world
that are coming. Alibaba and Tencent aren't cannibalizing (divide &
conquer a la Wall Street) companies the way Amazon is, or the way the
likes of Apple and Facebook have stunted innovation in the West, they
are funding and supporting it. So let's think about what the China Tech
Dynasty will become along with their artificial intelligence. \[graph
omitted As China begins to dabble, a bit of Snapchat here a bit of Tesla
there, these companies will also have partial access to certain
advantages in China. Like Apple, they will in part sell out to China in
exchange for some access to their market. And so this story starts to
accelerate, Chinese firms will soon be able to scale faster globally
than foreign firms cna make it in China. That's the basic formula for
the emergence among many of the other factors I've discussed, on a
Chinese Tech Dynasty. These 800+ million Chinese consumes fuel firms
into the dynasty at record pace. A Tale of Two Nations in Opposite
Directions The U.S. is failing to invest in basic AI research, and this
coincides with a massive lack of trust in American leadership and a
crisis internally in the government. China on the other hand, has
high-trust levels in their authority and government. As American
contracts into a warped populism and fear of the outside world, China is
expanding its sphere of influence in Asia and globally. The AIIB and One
Belt One Road initiatives are massive undertakings that all set China up
for economic prosperity in the years to come. America's political
climate and internal division that can even be witnessed in a microcosm
amid Google's employees, means China has won the race to AI before it
even started since both countries are going through very distinct phases
of their National destiny. For AI, it's also key to note that the data
gap between the US and China is "dramatically larger" than the actual
gap between the respective populations or the number of active mobile
users. This is because in China, the rights and priorities of the state
are seen as more important than the rights of the individual.
Techno-collectivism is in this sense more native to how
AI-consciousness, whatever you might call it, can emerge. Human beings
as separate entities, will always be kind of dumb. They won't suddenly
dramatically improve their capabilities. Smart machines working in a
framework of collective collaboration and efficient cooperation, can in
a sense hyper-specialize in a way that means how automation manifests in
China vs. the United States, is fundamentally different. How this scales
is also expected to impact how machine learning might come to learn how
to learn better. Once self-learning AI is achieved, of the nature of a
general intelligence, well all of humanity will have a reckoning (if at
all such a thing is possible). This means corporations such as Google,
Apple and Amazon are desperately trying to cherry-pick AI talent in
China as well. This is occurring even though they are weirdly blocked
from actually doing business in China. Yet these companies cannot even
slow down the inevitable and they know China is coming for their markets
and are more agile than their most direct competitors in the West. In
the race to AI, corporate espionage and nurturing talent funnels even in
the other's backyard, are just part of the game. China's State Council
Plans for Artificial Intelligence Dominance However when the China's
State Council laid out ambitious plans for China to become the world
leader in artificial intelligence (AI) in 2017, they placed AI at the
center, and the goal is for it to become a 150-billion-US-dollar
industry by 2030. The U.S. spends so much on its military and as
healthcare costs balloon, America's chances of being first to Mars are
greater than winning the race to Artificial Intelligence.

BROOKS: People always want us to fight, but we don\'t really. I think,
although I agree with the general themes that Andy talks about, I think
**[[it\'s very easy for people]{.mark} who are [not deep in the
technology]{.mark} itself [to make
generalizations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[which may
be]{.underline}]{.mark} a little [[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}. And
[[we\'ve certainly seen that]{.mark} recently [with Elon Musk, Bill
Gates, Stephen Hawking, all saying AI is]{.mark}]{.underline} just
taking off and it\'s [[going to take over the world]{.mark} very
quickly]{.underline}. And [the [thing that they share is **none of them
work in this technological field.**]{.mark}]{.underline} So let me
explain why---and they\'re all smart people, but I think they\'re making
a fundamental error and it gets to NEIL, actually. THOMPSON: After
taking down Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, he\'s going to
take down the Dalai Lama. Please continue, Rodney. BROOKS: So let\'s go
back to an example from the \'90s, when IBM\'s Deep Blue beat Kasparov,
beat the world chess champion. And Kasparov got up and said, well, at
least it didn\'t enjoy beating me. That was his---holding on to his
humanity. And now, today, you can get programs that run on---and that
was on a supercomputer and now you can get programs that run on laptops.
There\'s about twelve of them that have a better chess rating than any
human being has ever had. So people see that \-- MCAFEE: It\'s so bad
now---let me underscore what Rod is saying. It\'s so bad now that they
asked human grand master a couple years ago how he would prepare for a
match against a computer and he said, I\'d bring a hammer. BROOKS: So
they can play chess really, really well. And I think [[people
generalize]{.underline}]{.mark} that [in the way that if a person can do
some task really]{.underline}, really well, [[they can do adjacent tasks
quite well]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [[none of those chess programs can
play tic-tac-toe]{.underline}]{.mark}. Imagine a chess grand master who
couldn\'t play tic-tac-toe. It doesn\'t make sense. None of those chess
programs can give advice to an aspiring human on how to play better.
[All they can be is a sparring partner.]{.underline} MCAFEE: That
program couldn\'t play tic-tac-toe without being substantially
redirected, right? BROOKS: Right. So people, I think, are seeing some of
the image labeling that\'s going on, for instance. Google came out with
image labeling, which is a great commercial problem for them. They want
to be able to label images. And one of the examples was, that Jeff
Hinton shows, one of the chief scientists, is, it\'s a picture and it
says there\'s a baby holding a teddy bear or doll in there. You look at
it, it\'s a baby holding a teddy---a doll. But then if you ask the
program, where is the baby? All it can say is, well, this pixel has 10
percent probability of being a baby, this pixel has 80 percent. And
people have done experiments. You have a mashup of, you know, a
grotesque mashup of baby parts and it says it\'s a baby. It\'s a baby.
It\'s got all the parts. But a person says, no, that\'s a grotesque
mashup of baby parts in the image. THOMPSON: But Abhinav, you\'ve solved
this, right? GUPTA: No, no, no. BROOKS: Well, he\'s working towards\--
GUPTA: So, can I\-- BROOKS: He\'s working towards it because it\'s such
a hard problem. GUPTA: Yeah, OK. Thank you. So since we are talking
about images, I think I should chime in a little bit and tell you
that---so what Andrew is talking about, that we have made big advances,
again, they\'re very, very specific tasks. Given an image, tell me what
label can you put on that image? We have gotten really good at this
task. Some people claim even better than humans. I don\'t buy that, but
let\'s assume that even better than humans. But that doesn\'t mean we
can do anything else apart from that exact task. And that\'s what Rodney
was talking about. They have no idea that---what does baby mean? What
does having a baby mean in those images? No idea. You, as a human, would
know, OK, if I\'m saying there\'s a baby, it has a lot of meaning
inside. You get a lot of meaning out of that thing. So [[while we have
made significant advances]{.underline}]{.mark} in the last two years, I
want to boil it down a little bit and say [**[we still are a long, long
way to go]{.mark}** but Elon Musk or Bill Gates, everyone is talking
about]{.underline}, we still have a long way to go. But there\'s hope,
and that\'s what I think we have to see here. Two years ago, if you
asked me can computers take an image and solve this problem, I would say
I have invested seven years of my life but if you give me a random
image, it will not work. And now, given a random image, it will work. So
all it \-- MCAFEE: This was the guy who was doing this for a living and
if you asked him two years ago would this happen, he would say, no. This
progress is weirdly fast and is surprising insiders in the field. GUPTA:
Yeah. I agree. And I\'m an insider in the field and I\'m very surprised,
I have to say. Now, at this point of time, I am like living in an awe of
myself, in some sense, that---but it was like Rodney told---Rodney told
us that in thirty-five years he never thought he\'d do this all. I also
thought some of it, like that, for thirty-five years, I will not
solve---see this kind of classification performance. But as I\'m saying
this, still a long, long way to go and much harder way to go.
What---where all the kind of gains have come from is the data. And I
think---so technology, this like deep-learning technology has been there
from \'70s and \'80s. [[Don\'t misunderstand that this technology came
two years ago]{.mark} and everything\'s changed. **[This has been there
for thirty years]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It\'s just that for the first
time in our technological advances we have data for this deep-learning
technology to learn. MCAFEE: Let me jump on this because I think the
three of us are really agreeing, instead of disagreeing. I chose my
adjective pretty carefully. I said these advances are going to be
economically significant. I completely agree with Rod that **[[they\'re
not going to be existentially significant on any timeframe]{.mark} that
we really need to worry about]{.underline}**, for exactly the reasons
that you\'re bringing up. One way to think about this, the way I try to
get my mind around it, is there are, from what I\'ve been able to take
in, there are something like between ten and twenty really fundamental
challenges that these guys and their discipline have been working on.
Common sense is a really great example of that. As I\'ve looked around,
these breakthroughs that we\'re seeing seem to be---kind of indicate
that we\'re making real progress on one of those challenges, the
challenges of learning in a pretty unstructured environment. That\'s a
big deal. There are lots of other fundamental challenges in the
discipline where the progress has not been as fast, and these are the
ones that you\'re working on.

#### Super intelligent AI is [impossible]{.underline}\-\--risk calculus must fight [uncertainty bias]{.underline}

**Vasilaki 18** \[Eleni, Professor of Computational Neuroscience,
University of Sheffield, September 24, 2018,
<http://theconversation.com/worried-about-ai-taking-over-the-world-you-may-be-making-some-rather-unscientific-assumptions-103561>\]

[**[Should we be afraid of a]{.mark}**rtificial
**[i]{.mark}**ntelligence?]{.underline} For me, [this is a simple
question with an even simpler, two letter answer:]{.underline}
**[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But not everyone agrees -- many people,
including the late physicist Stephen Hawking, have raised concerns that
the rise of powerful AI systems could spell the end for humanity.
Clearly, your view on whether AI will take over the world will depend on
whether you think it can develop intelligent behaviour surpassing that
of humans -- something referred to as "[super
intelligence]{.underline}". So let's take a look at how likely this is,
and why there is much concern about the future of AI. [**[Humans tend to
be afraid of what they don't understand]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Fear is
often blamed for racism, homophobia and other sources of discrimination.
So it's [no wonder [it also applies to new
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} -- they are often surrounded with a
certain mystery. Some [technological [achievements seem]{.mark} almost
[unrealistic]{.mark}, clearly [surpassing expectations]{.mark} and in
some cases human performance.]{.underline} No ghost in the machine But
let us demystify the most popular AI techniques, known collectively as
"machine learning". These allow a machine to learn a task without being
programmed with explicit instructions. This may sound spooky but the
truth is it is all down to some rather mundane statistics. The machine,
which is a program, or rather an algorithm, is designed with the ability
to discover relationships within provided data. There are many different
methods that allow us to achieve this. For example[,]{.underline} we can
present to the machine images of handwritten letters (a-z), one by one,
and ask it to tell us which letter we show each time in sequence. We
have already provided the possible answers -- it can only be one of
(a-z). The machine at the beginning says a letter at random and we
correct it, by providing the right answer. We have also programmed the
machine to reconfigure itself so that next time, if presented with the
same letter, it is more likely to give us the correct answer for the
next one. As a consequence, the machine over time improves its
performance and "learns" to recognise the alphabet. In essence, we have
programmed the machine to exploit common relationships in the data in
order to achieve the specific task. For instance, all versions of "a"
look structurally similar, but different to "b", and the algorithm can
exploit this. Interestingly, after the training phase, the machine can
apply the obtained knowledge on new letter samples, for example written
by a person whose handwriting the machine has never seen before. Humans,
however, are good at reading. Perhaps a more interesting example is
Google Deepmind's artificial Go player, which has surpassed every human
player in their performance of the game. It clearly learns in a way
different to humans -- playing a number of games with itself that no
human could play in their lifetime. It has been specifically instructed
to win and told that the actions it takes determine whether it wins or
not. It has also been told the rules of the [game.]{.underline} By
playing the game again and again it can discover in each situation what
is the best action -- inventing moves that no human has played before.
Toddlers versus robots Now does that make the AI Go player smarter than
a human? Certainly not. AI is very specialised to particular type of
tasks and it doesn't display the versatility that humans do. Humans
develop an understanding of the world over years that no AI has achieved
or seem likely to achieve anytime soon. [The fact that AI is dubbed
"intelligent" is ultimately down to the fact that it can learn. But
[even when it comes to learning, it is no match for humans]{.mark}. In
fact, toddlers can learn by just watching somebody solving a problem
once]{.underline}. An AI, on the other hand, needs tonnes of data and
loads of tries to succeed on very specific problems, and it is difficult
to generalise its knowledge on tasks very different to those trained
upon. So while humans develop breathtaking intelligence rapidly in the
first few years of life, the key concepts behind machine learning are
not so different from what they were one or two decades ago. [**The
[success of modern AI is less due to]{.mark} a [breakthrough]{.mark}**
in new techniques **[and more]{.mark} due [to the vast amount of
data]{.mark}** and computational power **[available]{.mark}**.
I]{.underline}mportantly, though, [[even an infinite amount of data
won't give AI human-like intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} [-- **[we
need to make a significant progress on developing]{.mark} artificial
"[general intelligence]{.mark}" [techniques
first]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some approaches to doing this involve
building a computer model of the human brain -- which we're not even
close to achieving. Ultimately, [just because an AI can learn,
[it]{.mark}]{.underline} [[doesn't]{.mark} really [follow that it will
suddenly learn all aspects of human intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline}
and outsmart us. There is no simple definition of what human
intelligence even is and we certainly have little idea how exactly
intelligence emerges in the brain. But even if we could work it out and
then create an AI that could learn to become more intelligent, that
doesn't necessarily mean that it would be more successful.

<https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/a23457329/augmented-super-soldiers-reversible>\]

The [coming issues with human enhancement will ripple across the
military and society.]{.underline} The only way to avoid these problems
seems to be to make sure the techniques are safe for soldiers and
reversible after they are discharged. Last year, three Canadian defense
researchers published a paper that explored the intersection of human
enhancement and ethics. They found that the permanence of the
enhancement could have impacts on troops in the field ("will unequal
distribution of the technology between soldiers cause tension and lead
to dysfunction?") as well as a return to civilian life ("a permanent
technology give a veteran an unfair advantage or disadvantage at finding
employment?") They also note that "many soldier resilience human
enhancement technologies raised health and safety questions." These
problems would ease when an enhancement is temporary: A soldier can
train to use an exoskeleton and a temporary chemical boost wouldn't
carry into civilian life. Or would they? A soldier could follow an order
to take an enhancement that is considered temporary but in reality has
unexpected problems. The Canadian researchers wrote: "Are there unknown
side effects or long term effects that could lead to unanticipated
health problems during deployment or after discharge? Moreover, is it
ethical to force a soldier to use the technology in question, or should
he/she be allowed to consent to its use? Can consent be fully free from
coercion in the military?" [[The Augmentation Arms Race Is Coming
The]{.mark} [Pentagon's desire for]{.mark} reversible [human
augmentations]{.mark} over potentially irreversible ones will favor some
technologies winning out over others]{.underline}. Exoskeletons over
implants, for example. [But that doesn't mean strange-sounding body
hacks won't find their place at the Pentagon]{.underline}. For example,
the military is obsessed with new ways to improve training, and whether
soldiers' brains can be stimulated to learn skills more quickly. A 2018
report from this year's Mad Scientist conference, a future tech
conference run by the U.S. Army, states that "there are studies being
conducted that explore the possibility of directly emulating those
expert brain states with non-invasive EEG caps that could improve
performance almost immediately." In other words, the term "thinking cap"
is about to become more literal. There's common worry in the defense
world that casts a shadow over human enhancement: Will America's ethics
be its downfall, dooming the U.S. to second place in the super-soldier
arms race? After all, totalitarian regimes do not have many ethical
limits or transparent media to report on experiments[. [Gene editing
equipment has grown drastically cheaper and easier to use]{.mark} in
recent years, [putting those tools **within reach of well-funded
non-government actors such as terrorist groups and drug
cartels**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As one U.S. Navy report in 2015 noted:
"Major ethical concerns about the voluntary and reversible nature of
such augmentations mean that it is more likely these enhancements will
first gain traction in state and non-state forces that do not place as
much weight on ethical concerns as our own." [[Every medical advance is
now eyed for augmentation potential, and **not just in the

regimes, terrorist camps, and drug cartels don't read papers that have
phrases "potential ethical issues," " policy modifications," or "ethical

"Navy's New Laser Weapon: Hype or Reality?", 5/18/2015,
https://thebulletin.org/2015/05/navys-new-laser-weapon-hype-or-reality/

[Proponents do not seem to be dismayed]{.underline}, however, [citing
the same old supposed benefits of a military laser, if one could ever
work under battlefield conditions]{.underline}: A military laser would
be a lightweight, effective high-energy device, that could hit an enemy
target at the speed of light (186,000 miles per second) as opposed to
the speed of the fastest hypersonic missiles (about 3,800 miles per
hour). And they claim that each individual firing of a laser would be
dirt-cheap, at less than a dollar per shot---if one excludes the
billions of dollars spent in research and development. It also
presumably excludes the cost of shipboard electrical power, likely in
the thousands of watts, that would be needed.

[But [there are **many obstacles** to getting a]{.mark} powerful [laser
**out of the lab**]{.mark} and [**onto the battlefield**, where]{.mark}
it must be **small** and [**rugged enough** to operate]{.mark} in a
hostile environment [while]{.mark} still [packing]{.mark} enough
[punch]{.mark} to be effective. [Big]{.mark}]{.underline}, gas-powered
[[lasers]{.underline}]{.mark} generate plenty of oomph to do damage, but
they [[need **vast**]{.mark} **amounts** of power to operate, and are
**[far too bulky]{.mark}** to fit on a tank or a plane]{.underline}.
Chemical-based lasers offer the benefits of being very efficient while
not needing electrical power, but they are almost as hefty as
gas-powered ones---one of the reasons for the demise of the airborne
laser system that the Air Force had been pursuing. Solid-state lasers
are small and compact, but produce only low power and cannot fire very
far.

[[There are **many**]{.mark} **other [hitches]{.mark}**]{.underline} as
well. Any weapon that relies upon light traveling through the atmosphere
runs into the problems of dust, humidity, and fog---features which
absorb and scatter the laser energy. In addition, **[[atmospheric
distortions]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as turbulence [can
**[deflect]{.mark}** a beam [of light]{.mark}. And]{.underline} at the
same time that [the photons]{.underline} in a laser's beam [must
**overcome all of these obstacles**]{.underline}, they must also stay
focused in a tight column and keep advancing forward without diminishing
in power. Meanwhile, [the [user]{.mark}]{.underline} of the laser weapon
[[must account for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[movement]{.mark} of the
target]{.underline}, the movement of the firing platform, and any
decoys, dummies, or multiple war warheads that the enemy throws up.

The latest generation of lasers, based on fiber optics, promises to
solve many of these problems, but at this time, fiber-based lasers
consume about ten times as much power as their older brothers---and
reliably generating that huge amount of energy under battlefield
conditions is a challenge.

All told, while lasers, or **[["directed energy
weapons,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** offer the tantalizing possibility of
being game changers, they [[will **not**]{.mark} **likely [be
ready]{.mark}** for prime time [**anytime soon**. Like a
**mirage**]{.mark}, battlefield lasers are **[always just over the
horizon]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If the history of military lasers is any
guide, caution is warranted.

[[The path]{.mark} to laser weapons [is **littered with dead
lasers**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Not long after the carbon dioxide laser
was demonstrated at Bell Labs in 1960 (the acronym "laser" stands for
"light amplification through the stimulated emission of radiation"), the
Navy began funding research to bring the new technology to the
battlefield. The military influence showed in the choice of names for
the devices---Thumper, Humdinger, and Scaleup---which I became familiar
with when gas-powered, carbon-dioxide lasers showed a lot of promise.
Regardless of whether they are powered by gases, chemicals, solid
fibers, or wafer-thin diodes, all lasers operate under the same general
principle: They get a bunch of atoms, molecules, or ions in a given
lasing medium pumped up in unison to the next energy level so that they
emit light (photons) while giving up their energy. A laser resonator
(much like a telescope) makes the unruly photons march in step, and stay
in a narrow column. The resulting beam of light contains a powerful
concentration of energy, all at precisely the same wavelength, that can
be used for everything from eye surgery to cutting metal. And, possibly,
for warfare.

#### Technical challenges [can't be overcome]{.underline}

Association, 5-14-2018, \"Reasons to Doubt Laser Missile Defense,\" Arms

https://www.armscontrol.org/blog/2018-05-14/reasons-doubt-laser-missile-defense

For years the disheveled YAL-1 Airborne Laser baked in the Air Force
Boneyard in Tucson, Arizona. Stripped of its chemical laser and turbofan
engines, its airframe became a skeletal albatross---a monument to the
futility of laser-based missile defense. But in 2014, it was
unceremoniously destroyed, and the Defense Department wiped the failure
from its memory. The system was meant to fly above hostile territory to
track and destroy intercontinental ballistic missiles in flight. But
after 16 years and \$5 billion, the program was canceled simply because
it did not work. Four years later, however, laser-based missile defenses
are back in vogue. In his keynote speech to the 2017 Booz Allen Hamilton
Directed Energy Summit, [Deputy Director of the Missile Defense Agency
Jon Hill identified three key barriers the agency is facing in its
rejuvenated quest to develop a directed energy weapon for defense
against incoming missiles: tracking targets at long ranges, controlling
the beam, and scaling up the power.]{.underline} [The Missile Defense
Agency's (MDA) goal is to field a laser weapon on a high-altitude,
long-endurance (HALE) drone by 2023.]{.underline} The laser-armed drone
would circle potential launch sites and shoot down ballistic missiles
while they are in their most vulnerable "boost phase." Toward this goal,
the Defense Department plans to spend \$563.5 million on directed energy
research across five research programs: \[Chart Excluded\] **[Yet
[significant questions remain about]{.mark} the technical
[challenges]{.mark} facing such a system [and whether they can be
overcome]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Precision Tracking: First, a
directed-energy weapon would need to precisely track targets the size of
a quarter from hundreds of kilometers away.]{.underline} To achieve
this, MDA's plan calls for using passive tracking at longer ranges to
detect the target, then switching to active tracking when the target is
closer. [The laser designators on MDA's active tracking systems, which
belong to the Multispectral Targeting System (MTS) family of sensors,
have not demonstrated anything close to an extended-range laser
range-finding capability]{.underline}. **[[Cloud cover, rain, or smoke
can]{.mark} also [prevent signal]{.mark}
[detection]{.mark},]{.underline}** which is why laser rangefinders fell
out of favor in the 1980s. Moreover, **[many [basic
countermeasures]{.mark} can [exploit]{.mark} the [fragility of
these]{.mark} kinds of [sensors]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [To disarm a
laser rangefinder, an adversary could simply coat the surface of its
missile in reflective or absorbent material, or just as easily deploy
dust or shrapnel to disrupt the electrooptical sensors on a system like
AN/DAS-4, the most advanced laser tracker used in prototype
weapons]{.underline}. **[Beam Control]{.underline}**: [[Another major
problem]{.mark} with laser technology [is jitter]{.mark}---\"the degree
to which the spot of laser light jumps around on the surface of the
target due to vibration or other movement."]{.underline} To be
effective, a laser must bore into a single spot for several seconds
until the target is destroyed. Several systems, including Position
Sensing Devices (PSD), Fiber Optic Gyros (FOG), Fast Steering Mirrors
(FSM), and various filters can significantly reduce jitter, but only to
the micron level---several thousand times wider than the nanoradian
specificity MDA demands. And [ultimately, the work MDA puts into
reducing jitter may be for nothing. [Adversaries can]{.mark} easily
exploit a laser's reliance on one target point by [designing]{.mark}
their [missiles to roll in flight]{.mark}, ensuring the laser does not
have a static target]{.underline}, even in boost phase. [Power Scaling:
At the heart of MDA's directed energy weapon problem is lowering the
ratio of size, weight, and power (SWaP) in a laser system]{.underline}.
In his justification for terminating the Airborne Laser program, which
mounted six SUV-sized lasers on a Boeing 737, Defense Secretary Robert
Gates said the Air Force "would need a laser something like 20 to 30
times more powerful" to be able to hit a missile at a sufficient range.
Today the Missile Defense Agency wants to scale up the power for such a
system, but field it on a drone. To remedy this technological gap, MDA
is pursuing two technologies: the diode-pumped alkali laser system
(DPALS), which focuses on building a more powerful singular laser, and
Fiber Combining Lasers (FCL), which combine the beam outputs of smaller
lasers. Unfortunately, both technologies require approximately 35-40
kilograms of weight per kilowatt of energy emitted. "To have any chance
of fielding it on a high altitude platform,\" said former MDA Director
James Syring, \"where we need to be is below the 5
kilograms-per-kilowatt window.\" Neither the agency nor federally funded
research and development centers have indicated how they plan to achieve
this. However, if the technology proves successful, the agency will run
into problems with beam quality. [As [a laser]{.mark} travels to its
target, "it [encounters]{.mark} atmospheric [effects that distort the
beam]{.mark} and cause it to lose its focus." Particles in the
atmosphere such as water vapor, sand, dust, salt, and pollution can all
absorb or refract a laser's energy, and thermal blooming is of
particular concern in high-power laser weapons. Tactical Considerations:
Even if every technological barrier was successfully conquered, though,
it's far from clear that laser weapons would be an effective form of
missile defense]{.underline}. This is because lasers, unlike kinetic
interceptors, face limitations that are tactically insurmountable no
matter how advanced technology becomes: First, a laser can only stop a
missile if it generates enough energy to cut into its electronics
package. By adding a harder, thicker layer of outside shielding,
adversaries can strengthen a missile's "skin" and prevent it from being
disabled. Second, lasers can only focus on one target at a time. An
adversary could simply launch a salvo attack to oversaturate laser
defenses. Third, laser weapons can only destroy targets in their line of
sight. This means most systems would be unable to target low-flying
cruise missiles. Moreover, line-of-sight systems are restricted by the
curvature of the earth and risk letting targets get away over the
horizon---a limitation not faced by heat-seeking kinetic interceptors.
There are also platform-specific limitations unique to lasers: Air-,
ground-, and sea-based platforms need to be close to the target's launch
site to achieve boost-phase missile interception. But perpetually
keeping laser weapons near prospective launch sites is financially
unsustainable, and if the platform is manned, it is risky for military
personnel. **[[Space-based platforms]{.mark} may [accidentally
damage]{.mark} or destroy [nearby satellites]{.mark}, risking escalation
in a conflict or inhibiting U.S. reconnaissance
operations]{.underline}**. [Despite the many pitfalls of directed energy
weapons, it is unlikely that the Missile Defense Agency will soon
relinquish the chase for laser defense. **But one thing is certain: [the
road ahead will be difficult and costly]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[It's been a running joke]{.mark} inside the defense technology
community for years[: lasers are the weapons of the future \... **and
always will be**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But while [experts have long
predicted laser systems, also known as directed energy weapons, **are
juuuust over the horizon**]{.underline}, more and more technology
experts have said they believe lasers are truly in the realm of the
possible in the near-term for the Pentagon. Which raises the question:
who gets them first? Speaking at the Washington Post earlier this month,
[Steven Walker, director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, said, if possible, the Air Force would love to get directed
energy up and running tomorrow.]{.underline} \"I never met a four-star
general who didn't want a laser on his airplane," Walker said. "It would
be really neat. That would be a really neat technology and capability."
**[But [weight remains an issue]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} Walker
warned. [Quite simply, [the tech]{.mark}nologies needed to support a
laser weapon [are heavy]{.mark}. "All this power generation and cooling
adds up in terms of weight,\" he said. As a result, "I think
[air]{.mark}planes **[will]{.mark} probably [be the last]{.mark}**, sort
of, **[application]{.mark} of it**]{.underline}, but I think we're very
close to having a ship-based capability," he said. "The Navy's done some
demonstrations in that space. I think ground capability, lasers from the
ground, from trucks, are being worked pretty heavily. And those will be
closer than a laser on the airplane."

short-range air defense and other applications. Since 2014, the Navy has
been operationally testing a ship-mounted laser for defense against
drones, small aircraft and high-speed boats. The fiscal 2017 defense
authorization act mandated that the Defense Department accelerate
development of directed-energy weapons, according to a recent report by
the Congressional Research Service. In the fiscal 2018 federal budget
signed into law recently, Congress added \$25 million to the Army's
budget for high-energy lasers, with about \$155 million allocated to
demonstrate laser weapons on trucks and the Army's Stryker wheeled
armored vehicle, according to the CRS report. [An earlier
vehicle-mounted laser system developed by Northrop Grumman and Israeli
contractors shot down more than 30 rockets]{.underline} and artillery
and mortar shells during operational testing in the early 2000s. [But
[the]{.mark} chemical-based laser [system **was deemed too

[[One of the surprises of the]{.mark} 2019 [Mi]{.mark}ssile
[D]{.mark}efense [R]{.mark}eview [is that it did not cheer the use of
weapons in space]{.mark}. The arms-control community had braced for the

interceptor weapons in space. The review does call for further study of
space-based interceptors, **[which]{.mark} [suggests the Pentagon is not

policy, [said]{.mark} Joseph [Cirincione]{.mark}, president of the
Ploughshares Fund. "We don't get the much ballyhooed weapons" such as
space lasers..**]{.underline} Laura Grego of the Union of Concerned
Scientists cautioned that whatever studies are conducted on space
weapons should stop short of actual tests. "The research may include
on-orbit testing, and that would be a great concern," she said. "That is
a line we have not crossed." [A recommendation in the MDR to deploy a
new Space Sensor Layer for hypersonic missile defense is a far less
controversial proposition. New sensor-equipped satellites would not
necessarily be destabilizing]{.underline}, although it could motivate
China and Russia to proliferate more missiles, [said
Cirincione]{.underline}. "The fact that you announce this process \[to
build new missile defense sensors\] forces adversaries to ramp up their
offensive capability." Grego said she worries that the Pentagon's
emphasis on "rapid acquisition" and easing bureaucratic red tape for
projects such as the Space Sensor Layer could lead to a massive waste of
taxpayer dollars. She noted that the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense that
was developed in the 1990s to counter North Korean and Iranian ballistic
missiles cost \$70 billion and has only showed a 50 percent success
rate. "When you back off oversight, you end up spending billions on
something that doesn't work," she said. If Congress fails to exert
proper oversight, the Pentagon's Space Sensor Layer could turn into a
"recipe for spending money and getting nothing."

Mr. Putin did not criticize President Trump, instead suggesting, as he
has in the past, that a secretive "deep state" hobbled the American
president. In his speech last year Mr. Putin cataloged an array of new
weapons that he said Russia was developing, while animations showed
missiles striking the United States. This year he mentioned just a few.
[**[This spring]{.underline}**,]{.mark} he said, [[Russia will launch
its firs]{.mark}t nuclear submarine carrying a [**Poseidon**, an
unmanned underwater nuclear drone, and]{.mark} will [deploy a]{.mark}
new Zircon **[hypersonic missile]{.mark}** for the Russian
Navy]{.underline}. The missile can fly at nine times the speed of sound
with a range of 620 miles, he said. Mr. Putin took up his usual foreign
policy cudgel at the end, using most of the 90-minute speech to Russian
lawmakers to focus on improving the standard of living in Russia.

How useful such a weapon would be is debatable. [[Poseidon is **too

all the questions about armed robots (especially ones carrying
mega-bombs). Nonetheless, as a psychological weapon, it\'s brilliant.

the thought of a robot tsunami-bomb creeping along the sea floor. But

to halt Poseidon. Sutton assumes that Poseidon\'s \"operating modes and

[[Poseidons could be killed by **long-range** ]{.mark}**hypersonic

[\"[The short flight time and long range]{.mark} of this type of system

#### [No]{.underline} hypersonic impact and [other countries]{.underline} are developing

**Brennan 19** \[David Brennan is currently a World News reporter for
Newsweek, July 15, 2019, "CHINA\'S HYPERSONIC MISSILES: HOW WORRIED
SHOULD THE U.S. BE ABOUT FUTURISTIC WEAPONS?"
<https://www.newsweek.com/china-hypersonic-missile-weapons-worried-u-s-arms-race-military-pentagon-1447681>\]

A recent propaganda video released by the Chinese military has brought
one of the country\'s most advanced and threatening technologies back to
the fore---hypersonic weaponry. Hypersonic weapons travel at incredible
speed and---unlike even the most advanced ballistic missiles---can
maneuver in flight. This gives the weapons enormous range and makes them
much harder to track and stop. [[The U.S., **Russia** and China are all
**investing**]{.mark} **heavily [in hypersonic
tech]{.mark}nologies**]{.underline}. However, the Pentagon has been the
slowest to jump on the bandwagon and military chiefs are warning that
the U.S. could be left behind by its authoritarian adversaries, at least
when it comes to nuclear-capable hypersonics. The U.S. still maintains
by far the most powerful military on Earth, supported by a military
budget larger than that of the next seven biggest spending nations
combined. As such, America\'s rivals must consider intelligent methods
of leveling the playing field and---at least on a local or regional
level---upending long-held U.S. military hegemony. This is especially
true for China, where the government has invested huge sums in bringing
its outdated military up to scratch. Beijing is rapidly transitioning to
a potent modern force, but one still inferior to the U.S. Nonetheless,
military spending has been geared towards exploiting U.S. weaknesses and
dominating East Asia[.]{.underline} Beijing is hoping that its
hypersonic weapons will form a key element in this disruptive strategy.
There are two types of hypersonic weapon---cruise missiles (HCMs) and
glide vehicles (HGVs). Both are able to travel at speeds of Mach 1 or
higher---around 3,800 miles per hour---and can maneuver during flight.
This makes them difficult to shoot down, but also means it is very
difficult to predict what target they will hit. HGVs are launched by a
ballistic missile, but the hypersonic component itself does not have an
engine. HCMs can be launched by other vehicles such as fighter jets or
naval vessels, and power themselves with internal engines. Both weapons
can be armed with either nuclear or conventional warheads. China is
working on both types of weapon. According to Douglas Barrie, a senior
fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for
Strategic Studies, Beijing is within \"a few years\" of fielding an HGV.
China already fields a daunting missile arsenal, whether subsonic,
supersonic or ballistic. For enemies, this already challenging scenario
is exacerbated by the introduction of HGVs. As Barrie told Newsweek,
HGVs \"fly at an altitude not presently well covered by radar systems,
and given their speed also potentially cut down reaction and decision
time on the part of the defender. Were \[China\] to go ahead and also
field hypersonic cruise missiles then this defensive picture would
become only more complex.\" \"Any system that reduces reaction and
decision time is potentially further destabilising,\" Barrie added.
China\'s interest in HGVs in part would seem to be driven by the desire
to counter missile defence systems that are already or could be deployed
in the Indo-Pacific theatre.\" Hypersonic weapons will form a key
element of Chinese military strategy. U.S. force projection depends on
regional bases and aircraft carriers. As James Bosbotinis---the co-CEO
of U.K.-based JB Associates and an expert in maritime and aerial
security---explained, it is these \"high-value\" targets that hypersonic
weapons will focus on, particularly where evading anti-missile defenses
is required. \"Leadership facilities, key command and control centers,
underground facilities, air bases, time-critical targets such as mobile
missile launchers\" and maritime targets will all be on the list,
Bosbotinis told Newsweek. Once deployed, the weapons will
\"significantly enhance\" Chinese strike capabilities in East Asia,
Bosbotinis continued. The DF-17 HGV (known by the Pentagon as WU-17),
for example, has a reported range of between 1,118 and 1,553 miles. This
system is expected to be operational by 2020, at which point it will be
the world\'s first HGV put into service. [Though daunting]{.underline},
Bosbotinis noted that [**[hypersonic weapons]{.mark} \"[are not a
panacea nor invincible]{.mark}. [Long-range precision strikes are
dependent on]{.mark}** [a supporting \'kill chain\' of
intel]{.mark}ligence, [surveillance, and reconnaissance
**assets**]{.mark}**, [which are themselves
vulnerable]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline} Furthermore, [[the U.S. is hot on
China\'s heels]{.mark}. [Military officials]{.mark} may be concerned
that America [is not leading the hypersonic charge, but they have been
**far from idle**]{.mark}. Images have already been released of
the]{.underline} AGM-183A [**Advanced Rapid Response Weapon**
([ARRW]{.mark}), which will be launched from U.S. bombers and reportedly
[can reach speeds up to Mach 20]{.mark}---[four times the
fastest]{.mark} Russian or [Chinese weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
weapon is currently undergoing testing. [[Another
project]{.mark}---[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**Hypersonic Conventional
Strike Weapon**]{.mark}---[will]{.mark} reportedly [put another]{.mark}
aerial-launched [hypersonic missile in service **by
2022**]{.mark},]{.underline} while the secretive Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency is also working on the Tactical Boost Glide and
Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept weapons. And while the U.S.
might be behind China and Russia in nuclear-capable hypersonic weapons,
it is thought that the Pentagon still has the edge on those carrying
conventional warheads. According to Business Insider, this is more in
line with U.S. military doctrine, though conventional hypersonics
require more accuracy and thus more research.

Secondly, consider dropping the option of nuclear or conventional
preemptive strike against China's nuclear forces, even for the purpose
of damage limitation. [One of the rationales for developing conventional
preemptive strike capability is the recognition of the increasing
difficulty to use nuclear weapons]{.underline} firstly [in a world where
the public opinion is very much against]{.underline} any imprudent use
of [nuclear weapons]{.underline}. However, using [**[conventional
weapons to strike nuclear forces]{.mark}** of an adversary like China
for the purpose of damage limitation [is **not a viable
option**]{.mark}]{.underline}, neither. [[This study shows]{.mark} that
[conventional strikes by advanced precision-guided prompt global strike
weapons that are developed]{.mark} or proposed to be developed [have
little chance of eliminating]{.mark} theater [nuclear forces of a
medium-sized nuclear adversary like China]{.mark}]{.underline}. More
importantly, to the contrary of the purpose of damage limitation, such
[**conventional preemptive strikes can lead to inadvertent escalation of
conflicts**. Therefore, keeping the option open for pursuing
conventional counterforce strike capabilities will only add to existing
concerns in the mind of China and other nuclear adversaries about the
reliability of their nuclear retaliation forces and about the intention
of the United States regarding strategic stabilit]{.underline}y.
Alternative strategies of damage limitation other that using
conventional preemptive strikes against China's theater nuclear forces
are needed. Efforts along the lines of reinforcing existing
military-to-military communication mechanisms are worth pursuing.

In order to get Moscow to stop increasing its arsenal, the U.S. agreed
to an Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972. In effect, it traded away
the right to defend its homeland in return for stabilizing the arms
race. But stabilization in this case meant the two countries would have
an assured ability to wipe each other out. The thinking was that if each
side knew launching a nuclear attack would result in devastating
(\"unacceptable\") retaliation, then neither would ever commit nuclear
aggression against the other. The nicest thing that can be said about
this approach to security is that it opened the way to reductions in
nuclear arsenals on both sides. The arms reductions have been
substantial, but in a way they don\'t matter: Russia still has an
assured capacity to obliterate America\'s society and economy. That
isn\'t going to change, because Moscow doesn\'t trust Washington and
nuclear weapons are its sole remaining claim to superpower status. A few
U.S. leaders, most notably Ronald Reagan, understood what a bad bargain
this was. They saw that a security system based on \"mutual assured
destruction\" would be unable to cope with enemies who were irrational,
or accident prone, or unable to secure their arsenal against a breakdown
in the chain of command. They also understood that miscommunication and
misjudgments are common in confrontations such as the Cuban Missile
Crisis. Even rational leaders can make mistakes when arsenals are poised
to launch on a hair trigger. However, [Reagan\'s efforts to develop
[ballistic missile defenses]{.mark} of the homeland [were
derailed]{.mark} by the end of the Cold War]{.underline}, because many
observers assumed the waning of superpower rivalries would diminish the
danger of nuclear conflict. Missile defense lost its urgency until the
end of the Clinton years, when the prospect of a nuclear-armed North
Korea reignited interest. [George W. Bush]{.underline} withdrew the U.S.
from the treaty banning homeland missile defenses, but his
[[concern]{.underline}]{.mark} too [[was mainly with North Korea]{.mark}
(and to a lesser extent Iran) \-- [Russia was not a focus of his]{.mark}
administration\'s [modest missile defense efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} Administration has followed the lead of
past Democratic administrations in [[viewing]{.mark} homeland missile
[defense as (1) too hard]{.mark}, (2) too [expensive, and]{.mark} (3)
too [destabilizing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Until Russia unexpectedly
invaded Ukraine, Obama\'s security team preferred to focus on further
reductions in nuclear arsenals and maintaining a minimal defensive
shield on the West Coast oriented to North Korea. To the extent it
thought at all about the possibility of Russian nuclear aggression, its
solution was a survivable retaliatory capability \-- in other words,
offensively-based deterrence. That deterrent \-- a \"triad\" of
land-based and sea-based missiles plus bombers \-- is arguably the most
important feature of the U.S. military posture for the simple reason
that Russia\'s nuclear arsenal is the most important threat. However,
[on the day deterrence fails, [America\'s]{.mark} highly capable
[strategic force]{.mark} will be little comfort because it **[can\'t do
anything to intercept incoming warheads]{.mark}**. All it can do is lay
waste to Russia]{.underline}. [The minimal defensive system]{.underline}
the [Obama]{.underline} Administration has [sustained against North
Korea\'s fledgling nuclear threat, called the Ground-based Midcourse
Defense, can potentially intercept warheads attacking from any
direction, but **[more than a dozen Russian warheads would
overwhelm]{.mark} it**. So here we sit, able to detect a Russian launch
almost immediately and retaliate with devastating force, but powerless
to defend our homeland]{.underline} and loved ones [from nuclear
aggression]{.underline}. This is the kind of strategic myopia that
eventually leads to catastrophe. What America needs is a layered,
resilient defensive network against Russian ballistic missiles that at
least can negate the kind of limited attack resulting from a strategic
error or miscalculation. That network would presumably include elements
on land, at sea and in space that could give defenders multiple shots
against any incoming warheads. After all, if you have three layers that
are each 80% effective, then cumulatively only one in a hundred warheads
would get through to their targets. Critics complain that such a system
would be astronomically expensive. However, even a crash program to
deploy homeland missile defenses would likely cost much less than what
taxpayers are coughing up today to defend hopeless cases like
Afghanistan and Iraq. And compared with the value of assets that might
be destroyed in a nuclear attack, the cost would be genuinely modest \--
maybe equivalent to the losses caused by a couple of Russian warheads. I
have written a report for my think tank on why homeland missile defenses
should be a national strategic imperative that you can read here.

The second common strategy to protect a nuclear arsenal, mobility and
concealment, is undermined by improvements in remote sensing.
Traditional sensor platforms like satellites and manned aircraft are
improved and supplemented by new systems such as remotely piloted
aircraft, underwater drones, autonomous sensors, and cyberspying.
State-of-the-art sensors collect "a widening array of signals for
analysis using a growing list of techniques" and, in contrast to the
Cold-War generation of sensors, the twenty-first century monitoring is
persistent and data are transmitted in the real time (33). The aggregate
effects of this development put the survivability of systems like
submarines and mobile missile launchers in jeopardy. These systems have
always been relatively easy to destroy, but historically it had been
nearly impossible to locate all of them. [[**Lieber and Press**
argue]{.mark} that [modern sensors make locating and destroying
possible]{.mark}. However persuasive [Lieber and Press's
analysis]{.mark} of the effects of the revolution in remote sensing
[is]{.mark}, it is not without some [imperfect]{.mark}]{.underline}ions.
For instance, the [**[heavy secrecy]{.underline}** [that
shrouds]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [**real capabilities** of modern
nuclear submarines]{.mark} and their opponents' capabilities in
anti-submarine warfare]{.underline} (ASW) [[precludes Lieber and Press
from **using current data**]{.mark} to assess how vulnerable the
submarines are]{.underline}. [[They]{.mark} must [rely on]{.mark} the
data about the [vulnerability of]{.mark} Soviet **[Cold-War
submarines]{.mark}** to the United States' ASW capabilities to support
their general argument about the vulnerability of this weapon's
platform]{.underline}. Consequently, the article can show how vulnerable
the submarines were and illustrate how vulnerable the submarines could
be, but **[it remains uncertain how vulnerable they actually
are]{.underline}**. While logically sound, [[Lieber and Press's
deductive argument]{.underline}]{.mark} about the vulnerability of
modern submarines [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} inevitably not without some
**[[speculation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is also possible to argue
that a reader can easily get a somewhat exaggerated impression about the
degree of vulnerability of mobile missiles launchers to remote
detection. Whereas [Lieber and Press]{.underline} provide an impressive
geospatial analysis of the possible remote-sensing coverage of North
Korea's road network to show how vulnerable North Korea's mobile
missiles are to detection and subsequent destruction, [[in a footnote
they]{.mark} [admit]{.mark} that such [results cannot be]{.mark}
directly [applied to]{.mark} much bigger countries like
**[Russia]{.mark} and China**]{.underline} (fn. 98). Yet while the
degree of vulnerability of submarines and mobile launchers to detection
might have been slightly exaggerated, Lieber and Press certainly
identify the trends that unequivocally undermine nuclear arsenals'
survivability.

dominant power in the Caucasus region;]{.underline} c) [It took action
in the Middle East and defended its strategic interests in
Syria]{.underline}. [[Moscow uses]{.underline}]{.mark} all the necessary
factors available to realize its revisionist strategy. Such factors are:
(1) **[[Military strength]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The first level is
that of a preventive strategy. The second is that of the Russian aim to
consolidate its strategy either with force---[[as occurred in]{.mark}
the cases of [Georgia, Crimea, Syria and

**[Gas and oil]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Russia uses the pipelines like

its [political influence]{.mark} over states and
governments]{.underline}. (3) **[[Tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**.
[Russia combined conventional and cyber techniques and tactics in the
wars that it led from 2008]{.underline}. Its conventional [military
[forces include]{.mark}]{.underline} sophisticated weapons such as the
missile systems of [[S-300 and S-400]{.mark} and the [hypersonic]{.mark}
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} (3M22 Zircon) that [[combined]{.mark}
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} its extended [[cyberwar]{.underline}]{.mark}

(4) **[[Historical and imperial Russian
consciousness]{.mark}.]{.underline}**42 [Moscow has an imperial identity
and consciousness, military power, national resources and a pivotal
geopolitical position in the core of the Heartland.]{.underline} By
combining these factors, Moscow fuels its political machine to
accomplish its strategic missions and targets. (5) **[[Russian
minorities]{.mark} [existing in other states are used]{.mark} by the

the cases of [Crimea and Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Minorities also
exist in the Baltic States and other countries, which emerged in the

Therefore, this specific issue of [minorities]{.underline} takes wider
and more complicated dimensions. It is also [relevant to political and
legal motives and the right to self-determination, the exercise of which
depends on conflicting and convergent national interests of the parties
involved as well as the uniqueness of each case.]{.underline} Moreover,
humanity experienced tragic implications when Adolf Hitler exploited the
Sudeten Germans as a strategic instrument to occupy Czechoslovakia

American preventive strategy is a quasi-ally of Russia which pursues to
restructure the international system and promote its revisionist
strategy. The American and [European expansionist policy offered Russia
the pretext to put forward a preventive and then a revisionist policy in
Georgia, Crimea, Syria and Ukraine]{.underline}. [Moscow]{.underline}
seized the opportunity to make its case by [accusing the US and NATO of
following an aggressive strategy that put Russian security at
stake.]{.underline} **[While [Russia]{.mark} [argues]{.mark} that [it is
in defence, at the same time, it promotes]{.mark} its
[revisionist]{.mark}, even belligerent [strategy]{.mark}, which
partially [induces]{.mark} a redistribution of power and the
[restructuring of]{.mark} the regional and [international system in line
with its hegemonic]{.mark} strategic [goals]{.mark}]{.underline}**.43
Whether this policy will be successful and to what extent, is something
that only time can show. The War on **[[Ukraine]{.mark} [seems to be
a]{.mark} [cornerstone]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the [future]{.mark}
structural [changes]{.mark} in Europe and worldwide. Russia pursues to
raise itself as a game-changer]{.underline}**. The relevant question is
the following: What structural changes the Russo-Ukrainian War could
bring about?

#### Revisionism is true -- dissatisfaction with post-Soviet states, lack of international recognition, national identity

[Russia is also a revisionist state for three main reasons]{.underline}.
First, [**[Moscow considers]{.mark} the [agreements]{.mark} made [with
former Soviet states]{.mark} after the dissolution of the Union in 1991
[unfavorable]{.mark}** to Russia's]{.underline} national
[interests]{.underline} and security. Second, **[[the international
order]{.mark} created and [led by]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates after the end of the Cold War [does not recognize
Russia]{.mark}'s status [as]{.mark} an [equal
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And finally, 30 years later, [**a
[post-Soviet Russia]{.mark} has only begun to [formulate]{.mark} [a new
national identity]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} a mixture of [themes from its
pre- and post-Soviet history]{.mark}, conforming to the borders and
agreements with former Soviet republics that emerged after the
disintegration of the common state.]{.underline} Throughout its history,
Russia frequently debated its national identity, which was ambiguous due
to its geographical location between Europe and Asia and its multiethnic
composition. In some periods, including during the reign of Peter the
Great (eighteenth century) and the period after the Napoleonic Wars,
Russia looked West and embraced a European identity. But when it had
problems with the West, as in the aftermath of the Crimean War
(1853--1856), it stressed its Eurasian or Eastern identity, or its
messianic role as a unique civilization and "unifying nation," which
exalts Russians as an imperial people with the sacred mission of
creating a supranational state. In the 1990s, Russian political and
intellectual elites considered five possible concepts of national
identity: (1) "the unifying nation," (2) "the nation of all East Slavs,"
(3) "the nation as a linguistic community," (4) "the nation as race,"
and (5) "the civic nation." None of these five concepts were fully
accepted by Russian citizens, and today Russia is a state, but not yet a
nation. This [failure to find a new national identity has allowed Putin
to impose his own definition, based on the demands of Russian
nationalists and relying heavily on the idea of "compatriots
abroad."]{.underline} In 1992, Yeltsin introduced the term "[[compatriot
abroad]{.underline}]{.mark}" (which was suggested by the analyst Sergey
Karaganov) to [[refer to ethnic Russians]{.mark} who now found
themselves [outside]{.mark} the formal [borders]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
[Russia]{.mark}n Federation but had cultural and linguistic ties with
Russia]{.underline}.2 The 1993 military doctrine of the Russian
Federation held that the suppression of ethnic Russians in the near
abroad represented a military threat to Russia. Already in the 1990s,
several state programs were created to promote ties with compatriots in
the near abroad, but it was the 2008 document Strategy 2020 (Strategia
2020) that emphasized that the interest and security of these
compatriots would be militarily protected by Russia. Later that year,
former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev justified Russian support to
Russian separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia by connecting it with
the right of Russia to protect its compatriots. **[[Putin]{.mark} later
[used]{.mark} the same argument [to justify]{.mark} the [annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian rebels]{.mark} in eastern
Ukraine.]{.underline}** In July 2014, three months after the annexation
of Crimea, [[he stated]{.mark}, "I would like to make it clear to all:
[our country will continue to]{.mark} actively [defend]{.mark} the
[rights of Russians]{.mark}, our [compatriots abroad, using]{.mark} the
[entire range of available means]{.mark}---from political and economic
to operations under international humanitarian law and the right of
self-defense."]{.underline} The right of [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
to [[defend]{.mark} its [compatriots]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [former
Soviet republics is the key element of]{.mark} the process of Russia's
[re-imperialization]{.mark}]{.underline}. What alarms neighboring states
is that Russian federal law defines the term "compatriot" in a very
inclusive manner, enabling the Kremlin to consider virtually anyone with
ties to Russia or the former Soviet Union as a "compatriot."

The geopolitical arcs and 'strategic pincers' were the preludes of the
Russian revisionist strategy which reflects in the 'lightning military
action' launched by the Russian Army on 24 February 2022, bearing the
code name: 'Special Military Operation'. It was presented as a military
response to NATO's expansionist policy on Ukraine and therefore the
entire Western World---namely the US, the EU, the United Kingdom,
Canada, and Australia---faced the Russian operation as an invasion and a
violation of the UN Charter and International Law. However, both the UN
Security Council and collective security were paralysed by the Russian
veto power while President Putin verified in practice what Clausewitz
said,12 that war constitutes the continuation of diplomacy with the
usage of other, military means. Taking into consideration Russia's
'modus operandi' the question that should be answered is the following:
What is the existing situation after the Russian military action in
Ukraine? Firstly, [Russia pursues to create a new state of affairs based
on its revisionist strategy]{.underline}. As a result, **[no one can
allege that such a policy is limited to the Ukrainian borders. On the
contrary, it expands to the regions of Eastern and Northern Europe, the
Caucasus Region and also reaches the Middle East]{.underline}**. As to
Europe, [the minimum strategic aspiration of Moscow is to achieve the
establishment of a joint security zone alongside Belarus and
Ukraine.]{.underline} Secondly, [if the Russian invasion of Ukraine aims
to create a new state of affairs with an 'imperial character', why
Moscow did not target the Baltic States, Romania and Bulgaria
instead?]{.underline} Because [in that case, the conflict between NATO
and Russia would have been a direct one, with a scenario of a
Pan-European and/or a Third World War falling into the sphere of real
probability. Such a war case scenario can only be prevented either if
the US, the United Kingdom and the EU show political compliance to the
new state of affairs]{.underline} established by Russia or if the
economic and political cost---resulting from the sanctions imposed by
the Western World and a new type of military deterrence compel Russia to
implement a compromising policy.

The [West's fears]{.underline} may not necessarily have been justified,
but they [intensified after President Putin's position became stronger
in Russia.]{.underline} In the past, Russia's possible revisionism would
be mentioned -- in fact, very rarely so -- in classified U.S. National
Security Council documents. Nowadays the West talks about it openly and
frequently, and for good reason too: Moscow has been actively restoring
its influence in the geopolitical arena since 2014. First **[Russia took
over Crimea]{.underline}**, and **[then it launched a military operation
in Syria]{.underline}** in 2015 [while simultaneously attempting to
restore its positions in the Middle East and actively negotiating with
governments in the Gulf following a sharp drop in oil
prices]{.underline}. In October 2017, the [king of Saudi
Arabia,]{.underline} one of America's key Middle Eastern allies, [paid a
visit to Moscow]{.underline}. Since 2015, [Putin has regularly held
bilateral meetings with Mohammad bin Salman]{.underline}, the crown
prince of Saudi Arabia: in Moscow, Sochi, St. Petersburg, and on the
sidelines of the G20 summit. At least seven such meetings have been held
to date, and Putin is planning to visit Riyadh in October 2019. In
addition, **[Russia probably sees itself as a new mediator in the
Palestine-Israeli settlement process.]{.underline}** [Putin has held at
least eight meetings and three phone conversations with Palestinian
President Mahmoud Abbas since 2014]{.underline}. Over the same period,
[Putin has spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu more
than 40 times]{.underline} and held some 11 personal meetings with the
Israeli official: mostly in Moscow but also once in Paris. [According to
Russian and international media]{.underline}, which quoted anonymous
sources close to the Libyan authorities, the **[Russian Ministry of
Defense, and British intelligence services, Russia opened a new foreign
political foothold in October 2018 by sending troops to
Libya]{.underline}** [in support of the field commander Khalifa
Hafta]{.underline}r, the [head of the Libyan National Army]{.underline}.
[Haftar]{.underline}, who controls Libya's eastern regions, [had
previously visited Russia and repeatedly met with senior Russian
officials]{.underline}, including Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu. In
fact, **[Moscow supports the Libyan forces opposed to the UN Security
Council-recognized Government]{.underline}** of National Accord, which
is headed by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. **[In 2019, Russia openly
declared its interests in Venezuela]{.underline}**, where the [Juan
Guaido-led, U.S.-backed opposition forces had attempted to depose
President Nicolas Maduro]{.underline}, whose economic policy they
believed to be untenable and destructive to the country. Indeed,
Venezuela was living through a drastic economic and social crisis, with
inflation going through the roof at 130,000%: the population found
itself on the poverty line and took to the streets in protest. The U.S.
and its allies (more than 50 West European and Latin American states)
supported Guaido, who had declared himself the new president. [Russia
and China backed Maduro.]{.underline} Media reports emerged **[in
March]{.underline}** to the effect that **[99 Russian troops had arrived
in Venezuela.]{.underline}** [Washington]{.underline} then [demanded
that Moscow withdraw the troops]{.underline}. [The Russian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs replied that "the presence of Russian specialists on
Venezuelan soil" did not contravene the Venezuelan constitution and
strictly complied with the bilateral military-technical cooperation
agreement that Moscow and Caracas signed in May 2001. The Russian and
U.S. presidents have repeatedly discussed the Venezuela]{.underline}
[issue]{.underline} during telephone conversations and personal
meetings; U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his Russian
counterpart Sergey Lavrov have also actively discussed this matter. In
the meantime, Western journalists, experts, and politicians suggest that
**[Venezuela is becoming yet another topic for the ongoing
Moscow-Washington conflict, which is starting to resemble a new Cold
War. Russian revisionism can be found even in Africa]{.underline}**.
Leading U.S. news outlets report that [Moscow is strengthening its
positions on that continent.]{.underline} [Russia has been steadily
expanding its military influence across Africa, alarming Western
officials with investments in local mineral extraction and energy
projects, increasing arms sales, security agreements, deployment of
mercenaries, and training programs in support of local dictators, The
New York Times reports]{.underline}. Bloomberg, for its part, says that
[Russian political advisors rig elections in African countries in favor
of candidates that suit Moscow.]{.underline} Finally, the **[West is
concerned about Russia's Arctic activitie]{.underline}**s. The New York
Times cites NATO spokesperson Dylan White as saying that [Moscow is
bolstering its military presence in the Arctic. U.S. intelligence
services suspect that Russia is conducting low-yield nuclear tests on
Novaya Zemlya. "The United States believes that **Russia probably is not
adhering to its nuclear testing moratorium,"**]{.underline} says Lt.
Gen. Robert Ashley, Director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency.
Any [Arctic move by Russia invariably causes concerns]{.underline}. The
website of the TV channel Current Time points out that Russia has, since
2016, launched the nuclear-powered icebreakers Sibir, Arktika, and Ural:
"**[Moscow has not built so many vessels of this class since Soviet
times]{.underline}**." On the other hand, Russia sometimes offers a good
reason for concern, and the West usually interprets Moscow's statements
in the context of possible aggression. Shoigu said in December 2017:
"Over the past five years, [425 facilities with total area of 700,000
square meters have been built on Kotelny Island, Alexandra Land, Wrangel
Island, and Cape Schmidt in the Arctic. They house over 1,000 troops
complete with missionized weapons and equipment."]{.underline} Shoigu
added that [Russia would continue its efforts to build "a full-blown
airfield"]{.underline} on Franz-Josef Land that would be able to handle
aircraft movements around the clock. The minister stressed that [not a
single country had previously managed to implement any such
massive-scale military projects in the Arctic in the entire history of
the region.]{.underline} By 2020, **[Russia is planning to complete
construction on or modernize six military bases in the
Arctic.]{.underline}** In this light, it is quite understandable that
the West treats such plans with suspicion, despite Shoigu's assurances
that Russia is "not rattling its saber and not intent on waging war
against anyone." However, the second part of his statement -- "at the
same time, we would not recommend anyone to test our defensive capacity"
-- sends a totally different message to the West: **[Russia is not
intent on living with the old world power and will act based on its own
national interests.]{.underline}**

### putin is revisionist

#### Public statements about Ukraine proves Putin is revisionist

**Serhan 2-27** (Yasmeen Serhan is a staff writer at The Atlantic. The
Atlantic, FEBRUARY 27, 2022, "Who is Vladimir Putin's Revisionist
History For?"

accessed 7/5/2022) ng

The evolution of **[[Putin's]{.mark} historical [revisionism can be seen
throughout]{.mark} his [public statements]{.mark}]{.underline}** over
the years[. In 2005, [he]{.mark} famously [described]{.mark} the
[collapse of]{.mark} the [Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical
catastrophe]{.mark} of the 20th century]{.underline}. Two years later,
[Putin bemoaned the aftermath of the Soviet era and the pernicious,
unipolar world---one led not by Moscow, but by Washington---that it had
created]{.underline}. Last year, in perhaps the clearest articulation of
his worldview, [[Putin said]{.mark} that [Ukrainians and Russians are
"one people]{.mark}---a single whole]{.underline}." On Monday, he took
that sentiment even further, [declaring Ukraine to be "an inalienable
part of our own history, culture, and spiritual space" whose
independence was a product not of self-determination]{.underline}
(Ukrainians resoundingly voted in favor of independence from the Soviet
Union in a 1991 referendum), but rather "a mistake." Unlike his 2014
address announcing Moscow's annexation of Crimea, which was largely
framed as a moment of celebration, this was an angry speech---one
ostensibly designed to make Russia's people angry too, and to justify
what was to come. "[In territories adjacent to Russia, which I have to
note is our historical land, a hostile 'anti-Russia' is taking
shape]{.underline}," **[[Putin said]{.underline}]{.mark}** in another
address ahead of the invasion. "**[[For our country, it is a matter of
life and death]{.mark}, a matter [of]{.mark} [our historical
future]{.mark} as a nation."]{.underline}** It's hard to know what Putin
means by historical future (which is, on its face, an oxymoron), though
we can take an educated guess. When [Putin speaks of [Russia]{.mark}
today, he speaks of a country whose greatness is defined by its
past]{.underline}---namely, [its [imperial history and]{.mark} its
[victory during World War II]{.mark}---which [he believes must guide its
present]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Putin weaponized history by giving it a
function," Orysia Lutsevych, the head of the Ukraine Forum at the
London-based Chatham House think tank, told me. As far as the Russian
president is concerned, "history is the fortune teller of the future."
Such [historical narratives]{.underline} can be compelling, especially
when they [elicit the kind of nostalgic nationalism that has proved
potent elsewhere]{.underline}, including in the United States (where
Donald Trump's Republican Party has dubbed itself the defender of
"patriotic education"), India (where Hindu nationalists have appealed to
pride in India's past to undermine its secular present), and Hungary
(where Prime Minister Viktor Orbán often invokes the territories the
country lost after the First World War). "[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}
is not the only person who is old enough to have
[[felt]{.underline}]{.mark} that sense of [**[deep, personalized
humiliation and shame]{.mark} [that came with the loss of]{.mark} power
of the [Soviet Union]{.mark}** at the end of the Cold War,"]{.underline}
Keir Giles, the author of ​​Moscow Rules: What Drives Russia to Confront
the West, told me. "[Anything that reasserts Russia as that great power
with a greater status than others and the right to a global presence and
global influence in others' affairs will be popular in those sectors of
the Russian population.]{.underline}" Still, it's difficult to gauge
just how big that sector is or how pervasive the narrative has been
among those who don't share Putin's semi-mythological view of history. A
recent CNN poll, published the day before the start of Moscow's military
invasion of Ukraine, found that though roughly half of Russians support
using military force to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, only 36
percent support doing so as a means of forcing a reunification of the
two countries. The lack of support for the latter was most clearly
evidenced by anti-war protests that have broken out across Russian
cities. When I spoke with Denis Volkov, the director of the Moscow-based
Levada Center, Russia's last independent pollster, in early February, he
told me that though the majority of Russians fear war, few would feel
comfortable voicing opposition to it if it came due to fear of
reprisals. Indeed, more than 1,700 arrests have already been made.
Besides, Volkov said, "public opinion will be no limit to the Russian
government." Though Putin may feel obliged to justify his war of choice
to the Russian people, who with Ukrainians will share the costs of a
bloody and drawn-out conflict, his revisionist history is designed to
appeal to no one more so than himself. [[By]{.mark} [restoring Russia's
control over]{.mark} its [former territorie]{.mark}s,]{.underline}
**[[Putin]{.mark} not only [corrects what he sees as a historic
wrong]{.mark} but also cements his place in Russian history as the
leader who restored the country to its rightful status.]{.underline}**
The irony is that in his quest to make Russia great again, he risks
achieving just the opposite. Invading Ukraine has already resulted in
wide-ranging sanctions and has all but ensured Russia's diplomatic
isolation. Even Putin's friends in Europe, such as Orbán and Czech
President Milos Zeman, have gone out of their way to reiterate their
support for Ukraine and their commitment to a joint European Union
stance. "[Putin's views have become more and more extreme over time to
the point where they are now more or less unrecognizable and have few
points of contact with history as it's understood in the outside
world]{.underline}," Giles said. "He's operating in a different plane of
reality and in a different century."

The '**[defensive Russia' perspective is not entirely
convincing]{.underline}** either, for at least three reasons. First,
**[the claim that Russia is a staunch defender of principles like state
sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs is
problematic]{.underline}**. Granted, Moscow consistently emphasizes
these norms in official policy documents and promotes them in diplomatic
forums. **[In practice, however, Russia has violated such principles
repeatedly within the post-Soviet space.]{.underline}** [Examples are
Russia's takeover of Crimea, its meddling in south-eastern Ukraine, and
its longstanding support for separatist regions in Georgia (Abkhazia and
South Ossetia) and Moldova (Transnistria)]{.underline}. As Lo (2015, pp.
71--72) rightly remarks, '[there is a stark disconnect between its
\[Russia's\] formal allegiance to the "primacy of international
law]{.underline}" [and the territorial integrity of nation-states, and a
highly selective approach toward implementing such
principles]{.underline}.' Likewise, Bolt and Cross (2018, p. 30) note
that, '[while Russia professes to champion sovereignty and
non-intervention as standards for the world order, these guidelines
somehow do not apply to Moscow's own behaviour in its immediate
neighbourhood]{.underline}.' In other words, **[there is a gap between
Moscow's rhetoric and actions, which does not square with the 'defensive
Russia' perspective]{.underline}**. Second, **[it appears questionable
whether Russia's assertive foreign policy is a natural and almost
automatic response to aggressive encroachments]{.underline}**, [both
normative and geopolitical, from Western powers. For example, it is
highly debatable whether Russia's takeover of Crimea was a pre-emptive
move, as some claim, to block NATO from establishing a naval base
there]{.underline} (for contrasting views, see Milne, 2014, March 5;
Motyl, 2015). Likewise, [there was little risk that NATO would offer
post-Yanukovych Ukraine a Membership Action Plan]{.underline}. According
to then-Russian President Medvedev's own account, the alliance seemed to
have understood the dangers of eastward enlargement and given up on it
after the 2008 war in Georgia (Reuters, 2011). The financial crisis of
that same year and the ensuing Greek debt crisis further contributed to
enlargement fatigue among many EU member states. Consequently, there was
little prospect for Ukraine (or any other post-Soviet state, for that
matter) to join either of these two organizations in the short to medium
term. Moreover, European militaries had downsized since the end of the
Cold War, while the US was engaged in its so-called pivot to Asia. If
[anything, the direct threat posed by NATO to Russia was therefore
dwindling. Against this background, **it is difficult to interpret
Moscow's takeover of Crimea and activities in eastern Ukraine as a
purely defensive response to external pressures**]{.underline}. Thirdly,
**[it is unclear why the West -- and not Russia -- should adjust its
status ambitions and policies]{.underline}**. As Freire (2011)
demonstrates, [Russia is a status overachiever relative to the power
resources (economic, demographic, and military) that it
controls]{.underline}. This means that **[Russia punches above its
weight and occupies an extremely prominent position in world
politics]{.underline}** -- [at least in comparison to other countries
with a roughly equal amount of material capabilities such as Japan,
Brazil, or India]{.underline}. None of these countries is a permanent
member of the UN Security Council, for example. [This raises the
question of how many great-power privileges must Russia be granted
before its outsized status ambitions are satisfied]{.underline}. More
generally, it is questionable whether the creation of a modern-day
concert of great powers, similar to the Concert of Europe in the second
half of the nineteenth century, is possible or even desirable. As
Rynning (2015, p. 552) observes, not only is concerted power in Europe
unlikely, but its pursuit could be dangerous in so far as it could
herald the type of unrestrained or flexible balance of power politics
that presaged the great wars of the twentieth century. Kagan (2017)
likewise asserts that, a return to spheres of influence would not calm
international waters. It would merely return the world to the condition
it was in at the end of the nineteenth century, with competing great
powers clashing over inevitably intersecting and overlapping spheres. In
essence, both the policy prescriptions derived from the 'defensive
Russia' perspective and its explanations of Moscow's international
conduct require some elaboration.

Scholarly references to Russian revisionism as a general category tend
to favour or dispute the core claim of official Western statements that
in some sense Russian foreign policy is regressing, even recidivist. In
other words it has departed from some normative consensus about core
principles and rules of international order and more specifically the
post-Cold War European territorial settlement, in favour of reliance on
force and coercive diplomacy. This claim is found, for example, in the
2015 National Military Strategy of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff
identified Russia among 'revisionist states', which 'seek to revise key
aspects of international order and to act in a way that threatens our
security interests'.1 Former US NATO deputy secretary general Alexander
Vershbow expresses this charge concisely, in arguing that by annexing
Crimea, waging an undeclared war in Eastern Ukraine and occupying
regions of Georgia 'Putin's Russia has torn up the international rule
book and firmly established itself as a revisionist power' (Vershbow
2018). Different theoretical standpoints influence academic responses to
this notion of revisionism. Assuming an unabashed neo-realist
perspective, Mearsheimer refutes the assumption that
**[Russia]{.underline}** is at all regressive, rather it [**has just
behaved the way great powers do when their core strategic interests are
threatened** - for Russia, this happened in Ukraine]{.underline}
(Mearsheimer 2014). This position is refuted by liberal claims that
regime survival and contesting democracy are the key rationale behind
Russian foreign policy. This liberal perspective often coexists with the
claim that if the only role Russia can conceive of is an imperial one,
as a former empire 'then it is a revisionist threat to its neighbours'
(Speck 2017, pp. 13-16). Social constructivists, who emphasise the role
of status, have argued on other lines. [For Clunan (writing well before
the Ukraine crisis) '**Russia is not a revisionist power seeking to
challenge the United States and the West and create a non-Western
international order'**. Instead, 'Russia seeks to join the West but in a
manner that allows its leaders to maintain national self-esteem in the
eyes of Russian political elites, primarily through Russia's involvement
in the management of global affairs']{.underline} (Clunan 2009, p. 220).
While the notion of Russia joining the West seems no longer persuasive
for our period of study, a more recent constructivist
[study]{.underline} argues like Clunan that that 'accommodating Russia's
status aspirations will not embolden it to pursue more radical
revisionism'. It [characterises Russia instead as a 'reactionary
challenger', in the sense of seeking 'a return to the status quo ante'.
Russia would like to see 'the return of multipolarity enshrined in a
Great Power Concert', which would entrench Russia's position as one of
the leading states in the international system -- even as its relative
power continues to decline]{.underline}' (Krickovic, 2018, pp. 5-6).
Constructivist claims that Russia is seeking an enhanced international
role, although one associated with an earlier time period, share some
ground with scholars who describe Russia's approach to international
rules and law as 'neo-revisionism'. Sakwa adopts this term to argue that
in Ukraine, Georgia and elsewhere, [Russia]{.underline} has engaged in
some selective revisionism, but **[is 'far from being a genuine
revisionist power, dedicated to transforming the basis of world
order']{.underline}**. For him [Russia does not seek to change the
principles of international law, but how it is practiced by Western
states]{.underline}. [Until 2012, he claims, Moscow's goal was to revise
the system from within as a status quo power. After that,]{.underline}
despite its neo-revisionism, [Moscow still positioned itself as a
'norm-enforcer', rather than 'norm innovator', tilting against American
'hegemonism' and its practices]{.underline}. Sakwa [claims Russia seeks
to adhere to the existing UN-centred framework of international society
'while carving out space for its own normative world order at the
regional level]{.underline} (Sakwa 2017, pp. 104, 128-31). The Russian
scholar Romanova applies the same neorevisionist label to Russian
conduct. She argues that '[Russia seeks to transform the global order so
it accommodates its views and concerns better, but does not attempt to
replace it with a completely new set of rules']{.underline}. Citing
official Russian documents she claims that [Russia justifies its actions
with the existing order's normative frameworks, reproaches the West for
inconsistency in observing the letter of international law and tries to
become part of the governance structures with the same right to
interpret core norms as the United States]{.underline} (Romanova, 2018,
pp. 77-78, 81). This neorevisionist argument - the image of Russia as a
status quo power, drawn into qualified revisionist actions in reaction
to the earlier Western practice of liberal interventionism and concerns
about Moscow's agency in interpreting international law and norms -
seems to depend on what emphasis is given to the crucial case of Crimea.
Is a Russian effort to carve out space for a separate normative world at
the regional level, as Sakwa suggests, a secondary issue in evaluating
Russian attitudes to international order? Other scholars on the politics
of international law emphasise instead the foundational challenge to
post-war international order posed by Russian efforts to justify
territorial annexation and enlargement through force. They argue that a
core difference exists in terms of rules between the Ukraine crisis and
earlier Russian-Western controversies - over Kosovo (1999), Iraq (2003)
and Libya (2011) (Grant, 2015; Mälksoo, 2015, pp. 172-84). For all their
international controversy, the official debate round the latter was
accompanied by a recognisable legal language and arguable
justifications, often around developing if unconsolidated norms or
efforts to stretch the bounds of customary international law. In
contrast, much of the Russian justificatory discourse over Crimea moved
quite beyond the legal domain, for example in citing 'historic justice'
(Allison, 2014, pp. 1258-68; Grant, 2015). It is this, accompanied by
some Russian calls for new rules, which has raised the question whether
Russia has aimed to redefine core international legal principles, a form
of legal revisionism. [Taking into account the radical Russian
quasi-legal rhetoric over Crimea, the notion has been proposed of the
CIS region as a zone of legal exceptionalism in Russian thinking. This
could be consistent then with Moscow's projection of itself as a
stalwart defender of traditional rules on the use of force, 'old rules',
around the Syrian conflict and in wider international
relations]{.underline} (Allison, 2017, pp. 528-31, 536-40; Allison,
2013, pp. 120-49). In fact [**preliminary research, as elaborated below,
indicates that there has been no sustainable post-2014 Russian effort to
develop new legal interpretations over Crimea.** Moscow has not
seriously tried to shift understandings of customary international law
more generally, nor have other states been at all ready to accede to
such changes]{.underline} (Allison, 2017, pp. 531-4, 542). This article
seeks first to confirm such previous research on the Russian approach to
rules, by examining the period 2016-19. This period was defined by the
continuation of lowintensity conflict involving Russia (despite its
denials) in eastern Ukraine, but also by the American presidency of
Trump, whose concern about Russia's rule-breaking has been uncertain.
Secondly, it seeks to substantiate and elaborate a previous research
proposition that a major function of contemporary Russian legal
discourse is to instrumentalize such normative language. This strategic
effort is broadly captured by the concept of lawfare (Allison, 2017,
534-5; Kittrie, 2016).

Russian legal discourse is expressed in the context of various
officially endorsed narratives which predate the acute controversy since
2014. First, Moscow has long levelled charges that Western states are
the ones revising and unravelling rules in the international system.
Putin has repeatedly criticised Western interventions, citing Russia's
traditional UN Security Charter-focused 'restrictionist' interpretation
of the lawful use of force by states (despite Russia's forceful
dismemberment of the Georgian state in 2008).2 Secondly, and crucially,
narrative Western influence it is claimed was augmented unjustly at
Moscow's expense during a period of temporary Russian weakness in the
1990s. [For Moscow, Western states and the 'hegemonic' order they have
pursued in the post-Cold War era are revisionist and Russia in contrast,
increasingly championing the 'nonWest']{.underline}, [is the fulcrum of
international stability]{.underline}. [Russia regards its determination
to progressively restore aspects of the status quo ante (though not the
full scope of Soviet influence) **not as revisionist, but as recovering
a natural balance in Russian power relations in a concert of several
major powers**]{.underline}. It [reaffirms Russia's rightful trajectory
of power]{.underline} in the wider system of states, codified all along
by Moscow's continued UN Security Council membership. It [also
reinvigorates Russia's underlying, preordained role in
Europe]{.underline} - an expression of Russia's enduring great power
status. In this way a core structural claim, bolstered by an identity
narrative, underpins the dictum favoured in Moscow that **[Russia is a
'rule-maker rather than a rule-taker'.]{.underline}** So **[Foreign
Minister Lavrov has scorned the 'discourse on "revisionism"' as based
'on the simple and even primitive logic that only Washington can set the
tune in world affairs'.]{.underline}** [He rejects those 'who believe
that Russia is doomed to drag behind, trying to catch up with the West
and forced to bend to other players' rules']{.underline}. This inference
of 'Western rules' accompanies claims by Lavrov about the declining
influence of the 'historical West', and Russia's shared approaches with
'most countries of the world, including our Chinese partners, other
BRICS and SCO nations, and our friends in the EAEU, the CSTO, and the
CIS' (Lavrov, 2016). This portrays Russia as a stabilising pole at the
centre of a strong normative and political coalition of states. This
brings us to Russian discourse more specifically on rule-making. Has
Russia aimed since 2014 at legal revisionism -- that is an attempt to
sustain a campaign against a 'Western' international legal order, beyond
the standard Russian criticisms about the human rights project of
liberal states and a longstanding controversy over unconsolidated norms
on humanitarian intervention?. In the aftermath of the Crimean
annexation Putin implied that Russia was indeed ready to tolerate, or
even sustain, significant disruption in the international legal order.
He described the choice of living 'without any rules at all' as
'entirely possible' at the Valdai Club session in October 2014, which
had taken the theme 'The World Order: New Rules or a Game without
Rules'.3 However, no other major state would support such legal
nihilism. Perhaps anticipating this, the [formal Russian position since
2014 has been to cast itself as an indispensable 'rule-maker', rather
than anarchic influence on international legal regulation or general
disrupter.]{.underline} Putin has even been tempted to grandstand
against the West under a legal banner, claiming '[if there is an area
where Russia could be a leader -- it is in asserting the norms of
international law']{.underline}.4 In this spirit [Lavrov
quoted]{.underline} the Russian philosopher Ivan Ilyin that '[a great
power is the one which...introduces a creative and meaningful legal idea
to the entire assembly of the nations, the entire "concert" of the
peoples and states']{.underline}. In agreement, Lavrov portrayed Russia
as a potential pioneer in crafting international law (Lavrov 2016). This
kept the door open for some effort a legal revisionism. However,
**[since 2014 Russia has failed to advance any such big legal idea to
the international community since 2014]{.underline}**. [It has not even
sustained an effort to revise customary international law to support the
various weak arguments it offered to justify the annexation of
Crimea]{.underline} (see below). [Moscow retreated]{.underline} instead
[to]{.underline} core principles associated with [legal
positivism]{.underline}. So the Russian Foreign Policy concept approved
in December 2016 enjoins [Russia]{.underline} to [uphold generally
recognised rules of international law embodied in the UN Charter
5]{.underline} (Likhachev, 2017, pp. 157-9). In line with this Russian
legal analysts reinforced a highly traditional focus on sovereignty, one
which well precedes the Charter. In the words of one, 'it is necessary
to establish order and restore the principles existing since the Peace
of Westphalia', that 'international law should serve the interests of
equal sovereign states'6 This resurgence of traditionalism does not fit
an image of Russia as the standard- bearer of new rules. Indeed, when
asked specifically at the end of 2017 whether Russia should develop new
rules to regulate the emerging 'multipolar world order',
[Lavrov]{.underline} [affirmed]{.underline} that 'this does not seem to
me to be necessary'. In his view [this multipolar order, in the form of
the G-20, the BRICS states or Putin's Greater Eurasia project, would
develop through 'natural processes']{.underline}.7 However, this
position was accompanied by uneasiness that the legal basis of a new
multipolarity was slow in coming. The Chairman of the Russian
Constitutional Court, Valery Zorkin, described law as playing an
important role 'in building a unipolar world order', arguing that
'gradually, through the efforts of an enterprising and aggressive leader
(the United States), a system of norms, rules of thumb and priorities
emerges, which can hardly be called "the law"'. Therefore Zorkin has
been at the forefront of efforts in Moscow in 2015 at judicial change
(see below) to prevent the subordination of Russian national laws, let
alone the Russian constitution, to international laws (Klishin, 2016).
Whatever the benefits Putin may have hoped from a Trump presidency,
Russian rhetoric on the theme of Western manipulation of the rules
continued unabated. If anything it took on more vigour, as Trump showed
growing disdain with his America first rhetoric for constraints on
American sovereignty. For example, in early 2019 the Russian Foreign
Ministry accused Washington of 'steps to dismantle the system of
international law and to force a certain rules-based order on the world,
formulated by them in accordance with their immediate foreign policy
needs'.8 Here rules-based is contrasted to the operation of law; by
implication if Russia disavows such rules it rejects their binding
quality. Later that year, just before a G20 summit, Putin lamented that
during the Cold War 'there were at least some rules that all
participants in international communication more or less adhered to or
tried to follow', but 'now it seems there are no rules at all'.9 This
reprised his rhetoric at Valdai almost five years previously. This
cynical approach leaves the question what Russia has expected from its
extensive discourse of legal argumentation since 2014.

### neo revisionism

#### Revisionism does not explain Russia's aggressive behavior -- aggression is defensive and reactionary

**Sakwa 20** (Richard Sakwa is a British political scientist and a
former Professor of Russian and European politics at the University of
Kent, a Senior Research Fellow at the National Research
University-Higher School of Economics in Moscow, and an Honorary
Professor in the Faculty of Political Science at Moscow State
University. 15 July 2020, "Greater Russia: Is Moscow out to subvert the
West?" <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00258-0>;
accessed 7/5/2022) ng

[Russia has returned as an international conservative power, but **it is
not a revisionist one, and even less is it out to subvert the West**.
Russia certainly looks for allies where it can fnd them, especially if
they advocate the lifting of sanctions]{.underline}. When Macron (2019)
argued that it was time to bring Russia out of the cold, arguing that
'We cannot rebuild Europe without rebuilding a connection with Russia',
his comments were welcomed in Moscow, although tempered by a justifable
scepticism. The Putin elite had earlier welcomed Trump's election, but
in practice relations deteriorated further. The foreign policy
establishment is deeply sceptical that the EU will be able to act with
'strategic autonomy'. Above all, Russo-Western relations have entered
into a statecraft 'security dilemma': Currently, we are again faced with
a situation in which mutual intentions are assessed by Washington and
Moscow as subversive, while each side considers the statecraft employed
by the other side as efective enough to achieve its malign goals. At the
same time, each side is more sceptical about its own statecraft and
appears (or pretends) to be scrambling to catch up (Troitskiy 2019). In
the nineteenth century, Russia became the 'gendarme' of Europe, and
while Putin repudiates the country assuming such a role again, Russia
has undoubtedly returned as an international conservative power.
Maintenance of a specifcally historically determined defnition of the
status quo is the essence of its neo-revisionism: a defence of
traditional ideas of state sovereignty and of an internationalism
structured by commitment to the structures of the international system
as it took shape after 1945. Russia resents its perceived exclusion from
the institutions of Atlantic dominion (above all NATO); but is not out
to destroy the international system in which this competition is waged.
Thus, Anton Shekhovtsov (2017) is [mistaken to argue that Russia's links
to right-wing national populist movements are rooted in philosophical
anti-Westernism and an instinct to subvert the liberal democratic
consensus in the West.]{.underline} In fact, **[the alignment is
situational and contingent on the impasse in Russo-Western relations and
thus is susceptible to modifcation if the situation
changes]{.underline}**. [Moscow's readiness to embrace Trump in 2016
when he repeatedly argued that it made sense to 'get on' with Russia
indicates that Western overtures for improved relations would fnd the
Kremlin ready to reciprocate]{.underline}. In 2017 the Kremlin sent
Washington various ideas on how to move out of the impasse in US-Russian
relations, but given the 'Russiagate' allegations, the White House was
in no position to respond. The same applies when in 2019 Russia was
invited to resume full voting rights in the Parliamentary Assembly of
the Council of Europe (PACE), which the Kremlin embraced even though
powerful domestic neo-traditionalist and Eurasianist voices counselled
against. [**Russia is not out to subvert the West**]{.underline} but
seeks to change it. For the defenders of monist enlargement, this is
just as bad. Resistance at home and abroad to the post-Cold War Western
order has exposed unexpected fragilities and insecurities, hence the
turn to the language of 'resilience' (for example, EU Global Strategy
2016). Given its strategy of resistance, Russia in turn becomes the
object against which resilience is tested, becoming one of Federica
Mogherini's 'fve principles' (2016), creating yet another barrier to
normal diplomatic relations. In fact, the structural model outlined in
this paper suggests that [**Russia does not seek to create a greater
Russia through subversion let alone physical enlargement,** although all
leaders since the end of the Cold have tried to make the country a great
power.]{.underline} This raises the fundamental and still unresolved
question: is Russia still interested in [joining a transformed
West]{.underline}? Or has it realised that the only way to retain great
power status and sovereign decision-making is to remain outside the
West? Joining the transformed West meant the attempt to create a
'greater Europe', what Gorbachev had earlier termed the common European
home. For defenders of the existing West, this is perceived as
threatening its existing values, norms and freedoms, and perhaps more
importantly, also the existing hierarchy of international power; but
[for Russia, it is a way out of the perceived geopolitical impasse and
ofers a common developmental strategy]{.underline}. The West is faced by
a choice 'between containment and engagement on mutually agreed terms'
(Trenin 2016, p. 110). Incompatible understanding of the political
character of the historical epoch provokes an intense barrage of
propaganda from all sides, with mutual allegations of political
subversion and interference. The interaction of hegemony and dominion on
the one side and multiple layers of identity on the other provides
fertile ground for incomprehension and the attribution of sinister
motives, provoking the statecraft 'security dilemma' identifed above.
[Russia maintains a neo-revisionist critique]{.underline}, but this does
not mean repudiating improved relations with a post-dominion West. [The
country increasingly pivoted to the East and strengthened its alignment
with China, but **this does not mean that Russia seeks an irrevocable
break with the West**]{.underline} (Monaghan 2019). **[This is why it
seeks improved relations with the EU and the USA if a satisfactory
formula for restored contact can be found]{.underline}**. [Moscow's
support for insurgent populist movements]{.underline} in Europe and
disruptive forces in America [will always be tempered by larger
strategic concerns and are certainly not unequivocal]{.underline}. The
[greater Russia envisaged by the Kremlin elite is one **whose
sovereignty is defended and whose great power status is recognised, but
it is not one that seeks more territory or to subvert the West and sow
discord**]{.underline}. The West can be trusted to do that without
Russia's help. The West's response to Russia's neo-revisionism has been
neo-containment and counter-subversion strategies, but if the analysis
proposed in this article has any validity, then new forms of engagement
may be a more productive course.

#### Fundamentally is not seeking to change the international order

**Sakwa 20** (Richard Sakwa is a British political scientist and a
former Professor of Russian and European politics at the University of
Kent, a Senior Research Fellow at the National Research
University-Higher School of Economics in Moscow, and an Honorary
Professor in the Faculty of Political Science at Moscow State
University. 15 July 2020, "Greater Russia: Is Moscow out to subvert the
West?" <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41311-020-00258-0>;
accessed 7/5/2022) ng

We are now in a position to assess whether Putin really is out to
subvert the West, as suggested by the US intelligence community, much
recent commentary and numerous strategic and doctrinal statements. The
'[black legend' charge underlies the Russiagate allegations]{.underline}
of Russian interference in the 2016 US and other elections. Such
[accusations are based on the view that a fundamental gulf has opened
between the worldviews of the Russian leadership and the Western
community]{.underline}. There are some grounds to argue that this is the
case, although this needs to be placed into the broader framework of the
evolution of Russian foreign policy since the end of the communist era
and into the theoretical context of how Russia sees the international
system, as described earlier. Above all, as the historic West moved into
an era of expansive 'hegemonism', Russia (and China) were inevitably
categorised as hostile nations. They had the motive and heft to fght
back. Lavrov (2019) condemned the way that the 'rules-based order'
substituted for international law, while the expanded institutions of
dominion encircled both countries. Challengers to the radicalised
liberal world order become subversive by defnition. [Russia is a
challenger power but **it is not insurrectionary.**]{.underline} In
other words, [**it is far from the Soviet position of seeking to advance
the ideology of revolutionary socialism,** of which 'active measures'
were one of the most specifc manifestations]{.underline}. Further,
**[Russia is not a revisionist power out to destroy the foundations of
the international system]{.underline}** as it has taken shape since
1945, but it is neo-revisionist, challenging the practices of the US-led
Atlantic order within that system. As a conservative status quo Russia
fnds itself challenged by the radicalisation of the historic West that
it had hoped to transform at the end of the Cold War. Concurrently,
[Russia's]{.underline} [identity as a great power means]{.underline}
that it resists the dominion element. [It could live with the more
modest liberal hegemony of the Cold War years]{.underline} (and in fact,
one of the layers of Russia's foreign policy identity still wants to
join it), but the combination of radicalised hegemonic universalism and
the expansive logic of the power system rendered dominion unacceptable.
Russia condemns the Atlantic system for its revolutionary radicalism,
manifested in what is perceives to be Western revisionism. [Russia thus
fnds itself divided from the historic West on a range of policy issues,
**but not ultimately by commitment to the post-1945 international
system**]{.underline}. [This is why Moscow welcomed Trump's
post-Atlanticist declarations, since he ofered an alternative to the
neo-conservative militarism and democratic interventionism of the
post-Cold War era.]{.underline} Shackled by Russiagate, Trump was not
able to deliver much and in fact the sanctions regime and other forms of
neo-containment were intensifed. In this context, six observations can
help us examine the problem of greater Russia and subversion. First[, it
is misleading to see direct continuity between the USSR and
Russia.]{.underline} **[Russia no longer embodies an alternative
ideology and is in fact a status quo power in both ideational and
territorial terms]{.underline}**. [Russia is also comparatively far less
powerful. If at its peak in the early 1970s Soviet GDP reached 58 per
cent that of the USA, today Russia's at most is ten per cent of
America's. Russia's defence spending]{.underline} in 2019 was the fourth
largest in the world, but at \$65 billion this [is less than a tenth of
the USA]{.underline} at \$732 billion (38 per cent of total global
military spending) [and less than a quarter of China's]{.underline}
\$261 billion (SIPRI 2020). Cold War patterns have been restored, but
the [dynamics of]{.underline} this [confrontation are very
diferent]{.underline} even though some of the procedural rituals of
mutual excoriation have returned (Monaghan 2015). However, Russia does
claim to represent an alternative to the historical West in three ways:
as the defender of conservative sovereign internationalism, where states
interact on the basis of interests, [although norms are far from
repudiated; as a socially conservative civilisation state with societal
dynamics of its own (Coker 2019; Tsygankov 2016); and as a European
power with a stake in creating some pan-continental framework, while at
the same time advocating the establishment of some sort of greater
Eurasian unity.]{.underline}

### threat exaggerated

#### The threat is exaggerated and driven by the desire for defense spending -- assumes Ukraine

accessed 7/9/2022) ng

[Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991]{.underline}, **[the
mainstream media have supported government efforts to "scare the hell
out of the American people]{.underline}**," [and convince Americans that
only increased defense spending could deal with the multi-front threat
that includes]{.underline} international terrorism; "Islamo-terrorism";
[Russia]{.underline}; and China. The [exaggeration of the Russian/Soviet
threat began in the last days of WWI when the United States joined
European countries and Japan in occupying Russian territory to defeat
the Bolsheviks.]{.underline} For 16 years, the United States refused to
recognize the Soviet Union; fortunately, President Franklin D. Roosevelt
reversed that policy, which contributed to the eventual Soviet-American
alliance that defeated the Nazis. With the start of the Cold War at
WWII's end, successive U.S. administrations demonized the Soviet Union.
Also, remember the "bomber gap;" the "missile gap;" and even the
"intentions gap," a creation of Harvard Professor Richard Pipes, who
argued that Soviet leaders believed they could fight and win a nuclear
war? The intelligence community often cooperated with the efforts of the
White House to exaggerate the Soviet threat. The worst period of all was
[the 1980s, when **the Soviet Union was on its path to dissolution, but
found the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence
Agency supporting the myth of the Soviet Union as a
superpower**]{.underline}. In the 1980s, **[the DIA produced an annual
compendium of Soviet weaponry that was a completely politicized product
issued at an unclassified level to influence political and public
opinion]{.underline}**. **[CIA deputy director Robert Gates created
fictions regarding Soviet strategic weaponry in order to justify
President Ronald Reagan's Star Wars program]{.underline}**. [Gates was
totally wrong about the Soviet threat, and he made sure that CIA's
finished intelligence was also wrong.]{.underline} The exaggeration of
the Russian threat, and the additional problem of dealing with China,
has led to record-setting defense budgets with no sign of easing the
burden. We are the most active military force in the world; the leading
provider of arms to the world; and the only nation capable of projecting
power anywhere in the world. [Russia has two overseas military bases,
and China has one. The United States has over 700 bases and facilities
around the world. No major power has the geographic advantages of the
United States with its secure borders north and south, and the security
of oceans east and west]{.underline}. Very few appropriations attract
bipartisan support, but nothing garners bipartisan support like the
defense and intelligence budgets. We spend more on defense and
intelligence than the entire global community. [The United States has an
Air Force and a Navy that dominate the skies and the seas]{.underline}.
A former chief of naval operations conceded that the United States
enjoys a "degree of overmatch (with any potential adversary) that is
extraordinary." [The Air Force has spent billions of dollars on advanced
aircraft,]{.underline} such as the B-1 bomber, the F-22 fighter, and the
F-35 fighter that have never been deployed in combat. The final F-22
rolled off of Lockheed Martin's assembly line in 2012 at a cost of \$153
million. In 1988, [Lockheed Martin executives told congressional
committees that the cost of the F-22 would be \$35 million per
plane.]{.underline} The [redundancy of the U.S. military services never
receives serious attention from the Congress.]{.underline} The Navy has
its own air force, its own army (the Marine Corps), and its own
strategic weapons. It is equal in size to all the navies of the world
combined with a subordinate organization, the Coast Guard, which
represents the world's seventh-largest fleet. The Marines haven't
conducted an amphibious operation in more than seven decades, but still
garners massive support in the budgetary process. Meanwhile, **[there is
no other nation in the world that has such a Corps in terms of numbers
and capabilities. Defense spending and procurement are rarely related to
actual threats that the United States faces or is likely to
face]{.underline}**. Too often, moreover, **[we allocate billions of
dollars for weapons systems to counter enemy systems that never got out
of the design stage.]{.underline}** [The Virginia-class submarine,
designed to counter Soviet attack and nuclear-launch submarines, is a
case in point.]{.underline} The Zumwalt-class destroyer is a naval
combatant designed to fight mid-ocean battles that no other nation is
preparing to initiate or fight. There are the costly weapons systems,
such as aircraft carriers, that have lost much of their strategic
utility because of China's success in developing anti-ship missiles.
Tens of billions of dollars could be saved by cutting naval platforms
without any risk to U.S. national security. There would be associated
savings in personnel and maintenance costs as well. Congressional
delegations will resist cuts in any program, however, typically
appropriating greater funding than either the Pentagon or the White
House requested. States such as Connecticut and Virginia view naval
construction as public works projects for their states. Even
California's liberal representatives protect the interests of
California-based Lockheed Martin, and Lockheed Martin ensures its own
success by manufacturing components for its aircraft in nearly every
state in the union. In view of the F-16 and the F-22, there was no need
for the F-35, particularly in view of U.S. air superiority that finds
only one U.S. aircraft lost to the enemy over the past 45 years. Even
the late Senator John McCain, who rarely met a weapons system that he
didn't love, referred to the F-35 program as a "train wreck." It should
come as no surprise that Lockheed Martin is the top donor to members of
the House Armed Services Committee. **[We are essentially waging an arms
race with ourselves]{.underline}**. As President Dwight D. Eisenhower
warned: "Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket
fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and
are not fed, those who are cold and not clothed. This world in arms is
not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the
genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children." [There is nothing
more wasteful than the \$2 trillion currently earmarked over the next
several years for the modernization of strategic nuclear forces and
strategic defense systems. **Offensive strategic nuclear weapons have no
utility, and defensive strategic weapons don't work.**]{.underline}
Eisenhower would have deplored a recent presidential administration that
had a retired four-star general as the secretary of defense; two
three-star generals as national security advisers; a retired Marine
general as director of homeland security and then White House chief of
staff; and general officers serving as directors of national
intelligence. **[There is an American tradition to place military
veterans in high political office]{.underline}**, **[but the over
reliance on general officers contributes to the threat exaggeration that

To begin with, [there are a number of reasons to be sceptical about the
'revanchist Russia' perspective.]{.underline} First, **[it adopts an
overly deterministic position]{.underline}**, which [negates the
open-ended character of history by underlining its predetermined course
through certain 'iron laws' and the supposedly unchanging 'essence' of
Russia]{.underline}. In so doing, this perspective effectively denies
the role of individual agency: **[Whoever the leader is, or whatever the
regime may be, Russians are subordinate to the quest for imperial
greatness]{.underline}**. This is a view that incidentally dovetails
with that of extreme Russian nationalists, who see Russian history in
similar holistic terms of a 'single stream' that connects Ivan IV, Peter
the Great, Stalin, and Putin. However, Russia has experienced tremendous
upheavals throughout history that dramatically changed its society and
its relations with the outside world. This happened often at the
instigation of one or a few individuals. Both the beginning and the end
of the Soviet Union, for example, serve as powerful reminders of the
role agency plays in affecting Moscow's internal and external affairs.
Furthermore, [essentialist claims about Russian identity do not offer
much insight into the dynamics of Moscow's approach to the liberal
international order, which has significantly fluctuated over
time]{.underline} (Tsygankov, 2016). Second, **[Russia's revisionist
behaviour should not be exaggerated]{.underline}**. Its [intervention in
Ukraine has remained relatively limited, as has its military activity in
other post-Soviet states]{.underline} (Götz, 2016, p. 9). In fact, [the
scope of Russia's revanchist aims is a matter of debate**. It is
doubtful whether Moscow has a blueprint for an alternative international
order**]{.underline} with different norms and principles than the
current one. **[Nor does its promotion of conservative authoritarianism
seem to constitute a genuine agenda.]{.underline}** As Lewis (2016)
writes, '[the export of conservative social and political values (...)
has so far not developed into a coherent campaign, but remains a rather
ad hoc and inchoate critique by Russian politicians of
"multiculturalism", LGBT rights and "political correctness]{.underline}"
in Europe.' Furthermore, the [**'**revanchist Russia' perspective is
unable to account for the numerous instances in which Moscow has adhered
to the norms, rules, and institutions that are associated with the
existing liberal order.]{.underline} While it might be a stretch to
describe [Moscow]{.underline} as a consistent defender of
multilateralism (Lo, 2015), it [has supported frameworks such as the
2015 Iran nuclear deal. It also acceded to the World Trade Organization
in 2012 -- after 19 years of talks -- and continues to be a member of
the European Court of Human Rights.]{.underline} The liberal goals and
supranational methods of these institutions hardly fit with a
revisionist imperial agenda. Third, **[Moscow's behaviour is much more
in line with that of an ordinary great power]{.underline}** than the
'revanchist Russia' perspective makes it out to be. For one thing,
[Russia is by no means unique in its quest to establish a zone of
influence in its near neighbourhood.]{.underline} As Carpenter (2017,
January 19) points out, [Russia is hardly the only country to regard the
\[sphere of influence\] concept as important for its
security]{.underline}. Or do U.S. officials believe that Chinese actions
in the South China Sea, Turkey's policies towards Iraq and Syria, and
Saudi Arabia's actions in Bahrain and Yemen do not involve such a
consideration? For another[, interference in the domestic affairs of
other states is something of a habit for great powers. Whether they are
democratic or authoritarian does not seem to make a difference in this
regard.]{.underline} The United States, for example, has a long track
record of meddling in the internal affairs and electoral processes of
other countries (Levin, 2016). [It is therefore unlikely that a more
democratic Russia will substantially change its key foreign policy
objectives and activities]{.underline}. Furthermore, the [discrediting
of Russian concerns over NATO enlargement as an 'imagined' threat,
rather than a 'real' one, misses the mark. Any international relations
scholar worth their salt knows that uncertainty about others' intentions
is central to security dilemma dynamics.]{.underline} Thus, Moscow's
fears should not be brushed aside as idiosyncratic Russian paranoia. In
conclusion, it seems fair to say that the 'revanchist Russia'
perspective faces an array of explanatory challenges and shortcomings.
