To strengthen the military aspect of denial-based deterrence, NATO and
partner forces must be equipped with robust A2/AD capabilities and
postured in such a manner to limit Russian access and freedom of
maneuver in the BSR and North Atlantic. [[Rather than position forces
forward]{.mark},]{.underline} NATO should consider keeping forces
further back, taking advantage of strategic depth both to limit its
vulnerability to Russian attack and increase operational flexibility. To
make this posture credible, [[NATO should]{.mark} continue to [invest
in]{.mark}]{.underline} road and rail capacity and other transportation
and **[[logistics infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the
BSR]{.underline}. NATO should enhance its cooperation with Sweden
[and]{.underline} Finland to include integrated planning to ensure plans
are fully synchronized and readily executable. Furthermore, the Allies
must prepare to fight in a contested battlespace to include the looming
prospect, not seen since the end of the Cold War, of a nuclear
confrontation.

[The Alliance should invest in [a **hedgehog defense**]{.mark} [of the
Baltic]{.mark} states]{.underline}, the most significant step of which
is enhancing Total Defense through public education for resistance and
then following through with the necessary commitment of resources in
line with the concept. Estonia, Poland, Latvia,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Lithuania have already met or exceeded NATO's
2 percent GDP benchmark for defense spending by individual countries.45
The Alliance should [[provide]{.mark} the **additional [military
assistance]{.mark}** required to bolster the Baltic states in their
hedgehog defense [to make]{.mark} **abundantly [clear]{.mark}** [to
Moscow the]{.mark} high [costs]{.mark} of any intervention]{.underline}.
[**[Emerging tech]{.mark}nologies** [increasingly benefit the
defender]{.mark}, and [NATO should make]{.mark} additional [investments
in]{.mark} [**existing** tech]{.mark}nologies [that can
**revolutionize**]{.mark}]{.underline} [the potency of frontline states'
[hedgehog defenses]{.mark}, [such as]{.mark}]{.underline} small
warheads, 3D manufacturing, **[[drones]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[task-specific **[a]{.mark}**rtificial
**[i]{.mark}**ntelligence]{.underline}, [[robust]{.mark}
**[cyber]{.mark}** capabilities]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark}
[inexpensive]{.mark} **[space]{.mark}**
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}.46

[[NATO should continue **exercises**]{.underline}]{.mark}, like Trident
Juncture held in the autumn of 2018, [[that demonstrate]{.mark} its
**[resolve]{.mark}**, **responsiveness**, and **operational
reach**]{.underline}.47 [These exercises should make it abundantly clear
to Moscow that any Russian attack on the Baltics would be a **costly
affair**]{.underline} and that Russian occupation of the Baltics would
be untenable given NATO's A2/AD capabilities undergirded by a tenacious
hedgehog defense provided by the Baltic states themselves. Additionally,
[[exercises should focus on]{.mark} **allied [interop]{.mark}erability**
[and]{.mark} **[command and control]{.mark}**]{.underline} to ensure a
rapid transition to a preplanned and prepared A2/ AD network of systems.

[[A]{.underline}]{.mark} [**more [flexible]{.mark}** [approach to defend
the Baltics would be]{.mark}]{.underline} to augment [[denial-based
deterrent strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} with threats of punishment.
[Denial-based deterrent strategies discourage enemy action by making it
physically difficult for an adversary to coerce or
attack]{.underline}.16 To execute deter by denial, the defender must
demonstrate that enemy leaders cannot achieve their aims at acceptable
costs. Although no concept of defense in the Baltics can eliminate the
risks of escalation with absolute certainty, denial-based deterrence
offers a way to mitigate them. Area denial is often thought of as an
operational concept used by U.S. adversaries to prevent freedom of
action in a geographical zone under the enemy's direct control. However,
area denial can work both ways. To best protect its Baltic partners,
[NATO should use **strategic depth** to its advantage by establishing
its]{.underline} own [A2/ AD bubble over the region]{.underline}. A
denial-based deterrence strategy in the Baltic region would encompass a
wide range of capabilities: deploying integrated air and missile
defenses, establishing sea denial, and investment in popular
mobilization leveraging creative and cost-effective approaches to attrit
the elements of any Russian military advance.

Carl von Clausewitz recognized that the aim of defeating the enemy "can,
in practice, be replaced by two other grounds for making peace: the
first is the improbability of victory; the second is its unacceptable
costs."17 He also reasoned that "the defense is the stronger form of
waging war. . . . \[I\]f attack were the stronger form, there would be
no case for using the defense." 18 In Clausewitz's mind, the purpose of
defense was preservation of combat power. The defender also had the
advantage of position. Area denial for the Baltics would have NATO blunt
the strategic effectiveness of Russian attacks. Demonstrating the
capability to impose costs and make the victory seem improbable could
shift Russia's cost-benefit analysis enough to deter attack. If not, the
escalating costs of continued Russian military action in a prestructured
and in-depth NATO Baltics A2/ AD complex could increase the
improbability of achieving Moscow's main political aims and open the
political space for negotiation.19

NATO enjoys several natural geographic advantages that enable a
denial-based deterrent strategy based on an AD operational concept. In
particular, [the geography of the Baltic Sea favors a **defensive**
operational concept because of its relatively small size and shallow
depth, with only a few navigable passageways and numerous
**chokepoints**]{.underline}. Approximately half of Russia's maritime
cargo transits through the Baltic Sea, thereby providing NATO and its
partners economic leverage in a potential crisis.20 By extension, NATO
should plan to deny Russia access to the North Atlantic via the GIUK
(Greenland--Iceland-- United Kingdom) Gap and further afield to the
Barents Sea between Svalbard and Norway's northern coastline.

As mentioned, Russian forces stationed in the Kaliningrad exclave pose a
particular predicament to NATO and its partners. Nevertheless, despite
its menacing appearance, Kaliningrad may actually be a Russian
vulnerability rather than a strength. Viewed as an encircled area, with
the sea to the west and NATO surrounding the territory on the other
three sides, Kaliningrad sits in a precariously vulnerable position,
particularly given the array of A2/AD capabilities and strike
capabilities that the Alliance and its partners could deploy against it.
Therefore, a part of their deterrence strategy, NATO and its partners
should demonstrate to the Russians their willingness and capability to
neutralize and ultimately isolate Kaliningrad militarily in the event of
a hot war scenario. Finally, the Alliance should be prepared to deny the
airspace over the Baltics to Russian aircraft. One 2017 RAND study
concluded, "From just two launch points, one in northeastern Poland and
the other on one of the islands off the coast of Estonia, NATO forces
could cover nearly the whole of the Baltic states, much of western
Belarus, and all of Kaliningrad with suppression of enemy air defenses
or counterbattery fires."21 Given the above, even if Russia were to
launch an invasion of Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania, NATO's goal would
be to impose high costs and, should that fail, render any subsequent
Russian occupation untenable.

[[The ability of NATO to maintain a Baltics defense]{.mark} coalition
[hinges on **perception**]{.mark}]{.underline}s of Russia's aggressive
behavior, and [[Russia is]{.mark} more likely to be [deterred if it
perceives]{.mark} that **[NATO solidarity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
the **preponderance**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} international opinion and
[support siding with the Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[Area
denial]{.mark}** as an operational concept [compares
**favorably**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [alternatives]{.mark} if
preservation of the NATO structure forms the basis for
resolve]{.underline}. Foremost, [[it is a **defensive concept**]{.mark}
[that seeks to]{.mark} **[preserve the s]{.mark}tatus
[quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thereby [[allowing NATO to dominate
the]{.mark} **strategic [narrative]{.mark}** [by playing to]{.mark}
international [perceptions of **legitimacy**]{.mark} based on the right
to **self-defense**]{.underline} and freedom of the global commons.
[Because area denial is defensive in nature, [it is more **palatable**
to NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and its partners [[than offensive-minded
concepts]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly when compared to provocative
and expansive actions that could horizontally expand military operations
deep into Russian territory or to other geographic regions.

The same **[[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}** that enable Russia's
A2/ AD capability [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} proliferating to Russia's
NATO and NATO-aligned neighbors, [[making area denial]{.mark}
**extremely [attractive]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[from a practical
standpoint]{.underline}.]{.mark} Several states in the
region---including Sweden and Poland---already possess high-end A2/AD
capabilities and are either affiliated with NATO or members of the
Alliance. [[These]{.mark} capabilities [include]{.mark} long-range
**precision-strike** systems, such as **GPS-guided** cruise and
ballistic missiles]{.underline}; [littoral anti-ship
capabilities]{.underline} (high-quality nonnuclear submarines, fast
missile-armed surface craft, and [smart]{.underline} coastal and
shallow-water [mines]{.underline}); both long- and short-range air
defenses; [long-range **[precision-guided]{.mark}** artillery and rocket
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[and]{.mark} **[cyber]{.mark}** and
**electronic**]{.underline} warfare
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}.22 Militarily, the combination of
NATO AD capabilities should provide its own deterrent effect, just as
NATO forces did in Western Europe during the Cold War. Unfortunately,
NATO and partner nations currently are "almost completely dependent on
airpower" to counter Russia's extensive array of A2/AD capabilities,
according to General Philip Breedlove, former NATO Supreme Allied
Commander, Europe, in a 2016 speech.23 Notably, the use of fighters such
as the F-35 would be problematic in a Baltics scenario given its short
range and the F-35's dependence on air refueling.24

[The [NATO]{.mark} goal [should be to **knit partners together**]{.mark}
[in a networked system of]{.mark} **advanced** command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance]{.underline} (**[[C4ISR]{.underline}]{.mark}**),
[**[targeting]{.mark}**, **[p]{.mark}**recision-**[g]{.mark}**uided
**[m]{.mark}**unition[s]{.mark}, **airborne [early warning]{.mark}**
capabilities, **integrated [air defenses]{.mark}**,
**[m]{.mark}**aritime **[d]{.mark}**omain **[a]{.mark}**wareness,
**undersea surveillance**, and standoff capabilities such as cruise and
ballistic missiles]{.underline}. This networked system-of-systems
approach has come to define the contemporary revolution in military
affairs. Policy analysts James Thomas and Evan Montgomery have dubbed
these "mini A2/ AD complexes."25 The current willingness of key Allies
and partners---particularly those in the Baltic region---to modernize
their militaries makes it a favorable time for NATO to implement such a
defensive concept. Therefore, providing partners with additional
enabling capabilities to round out their defensive formations may prove
critical. To enhance area denial, NATO needs additional mobile and
survivable long-range precision-strike capabilities such as the Army
Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and Highly Mobile Artillery Rocket
System. The Army is currently developing DeepStrike, a next-generation
missile for these systems that doubles the firepower and can engage
targets at distances up to 499 km, including the ability to hit moving
targets on land and at sea.26 To counter Russian tactical missiles,
cruise missiles, drones, and advanced aircraft, additional NATO and
partner countries should procure the Patriot and other surface-to-air
missile defense systems.

In short, [[the **best course**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of defense [for
the Baltic]{.mark} states [is]{.mark} to adopt [the]{.mark} strategy of
the **[hedgehog]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[the hedgehog does
not]{.underline} defend against the predator by trying to [emulate the
predator's strengths]{.underline} (speed, claws, and teeth) [but puts on
such a defensive display]{.underline} that the predator decides to leave
it alone. [The predator also realizes that should it be successful in
breaking through the hedgehog's defenses, the hedgehog would prove even
more difficult for the predator to swallow and digest]{.underline}.
Switzerland is a classic example of the hedgehog or "bitter pill"
strategy.40 An astute European aphorism over the years has been,
"Switzerland doesn't have an army; Switzerland is an army."41 The Finns
have fostered a similar reputation by standing up to the Soviet Union
during the Winter War and Continuation War.42 Nevertheless,
[[the]{.mark} **[defensive display]{.mark}** of the hedgehog [is]{.mark}
far **more [important]{.mark}** than actual defense]{.underline}.
Frontline [hedgehog [states must demonstrate their]{.mark} defensive
[capabilities as part of an]{.mark} **[active
info]{.mark}rmation**]{.underline} [[campaign and]{.mark} as [a]{.mark}
**[policy tool]{.mark}**]{.underline}.43

[The hedgehog strategy should **underpin** NATO's denial-based
deterrence strategy in the BSR]{.underline}. It dispels any notions
Russia may have of getting away with an easy victory by increasing the
immediate costs of grabbing territory. As additional components of the
strategy, NATO must have plans and organizations for defending the
Baltic states and Poland, reinforcing Alliance forces in the Artic and
GIUK Gap, and establishing A2/AD bubbles over the region. More
important, based on those plans, [[**NATO** must convey]{.mark} to the
Russians [its]{.mark} level of **[preparedness]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[intent]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including the potential costs to
Russia should it decide to threaten NATO or its partners.44 [If properly
implemented, NATO's denial-based deterrence strategy should change
Moscow's **decision calculus**]{.underline} regarding a quick
territorial land grab of the Baltics. Instead, NATO deters Russia by
making the Baltics more difficult for Russia to invade and occupy and by
prospect of inflicting unacceptable costs on Russia both at the
immediate onset of hostilities and over time through attrition.

Improve Exercises

[[Improve]{.mark} the **scope**, **tempo**, and **depth** of
[**exercises** in the Baltic]{.mark} Sea region]{.underline}.
[[Exercises]{.mark} should not be **showcase**]{.underline} [events to
demonstrate success, but to examine the causes of failure and [improve
capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[The]{.mark} overall [goal should be
**credibility**]{.mark}]{.underline}, internal and external: [[to
show]{.mark} that the [countries]{.mark} of the region [are]{.mark}
[willing]{.mark} and able to defend themselves]{.underline}. This
involves not only pure military capabilities but also psychological
resilience, and deep integration of security policy in the wider
society.

Key features of realistic exercises include:

- Surprise: Russian aggression could be sudden. The ability to mobilize
  a substantial part of fulltime and reserve forces in a short space of
  time, in an orderly and effective manner, in difficult conditions
  ([[including **rapid response**]{.mark} [to **hybrid
  warfare**]{.mark}, such as **cyberattacks**]{.underline}), [sends
  powerful messages to domestic and foreign audiences]{.underline}.
  Regional allies could follow this example by amending restrictions to
  legalize snap exercises and more frequently execute them.

- Disruption: Real war is no respecter of commuters' schedules and
  property rights. Exercises involving "free play" will involve damage
  to crops, roads, buildings, and other infrastructure. They may make
  major roads impassable, sometimes at short notice, or involve the
  commandeering of facilities. Public messaging in advance of this, and
  adequate compensation afterwards, is an essential part of national
  security. NATO undertook such operations during the Cold War notably
  in what was then West Germany. It can do so again.

- Realistic scenarios: Exercise planners should factor in distractions
  and disruption, such as US commitments in the Indo-Pacific region,
  divisions that hamper EU and NATO decision-making, and other
  unexpected problems. [As emphasized in]{.underline} transatlantic
  debates around [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} Allied Command
  Transformation's (ACT's) Warfighting Capstone Concept (NWCC), [the
  alliance should utilize]{.underline} more outside "mavericks" to add
  the [dynamic and unpredictable elements that make exercise scenarios
  truly testing]{.underline}. This also means regularly testing
  reinforcement to the Baltic Sea region from across the Supreme Allied
  Commander Europe's (SACEUR) Area of Responsibility (AOR) and not
  limiting exercises to the region only.

- Scope: [War does not take place in one domain only]{.underline}. Air
  and Missile Defense (AMD) and intelligence, surveillance, and
  reconnaissance (**[[ISR]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
  [[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[including their]{.mark}
  **[interop]{.mark}erability**, [should be routinely]{.mark} and
  aggressively [exercised]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [to the "**point of
  failure**" in realistic simulated combat scenarios]{.underline}.
  [Russian non-kinetic tactics, such as information operations, economic
  pressure, and cyberattacks, will feature in **any real-world**
  conflict]{.underline}. [[Allied]{.mark} leaders'
  [decision-making]{.mark}]{.underline} and the psychological resilience
  of societies ([or lack of it]{.underline}) [[around these subthreshold
  threats **significantly impact**]{.mark} defense and
  [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Exercises will test, socialize, and
  normalize the assumptions and thresholds involved.

- Duration: Russia's geographic location and stocks in the region give
  it a potential short-term local advantage in the early phase of an
  armed conflict. Western countries' greater size and technological edge
  give them a longer-term advantage, though this depends on adequate
  stocks of smart munitions and effective reinforcement capabilities.
  Exercises need to test these parameters.

- Escalation: The military response to Russian aggression is only part
  of the picture. National decision-makers must also rehearse their
  individual and collective approach to the escalation ladder: for
  example, the (threatened or actual) test detonation of a small nuclear
  warhead by the Kremlin, particularly in a contest over the Baltic
  states.7 This is particularly important given Russia's aggressive
  nuclear posture, renewed speculation about US nuclear policy, and the
  change of government in Berlin to include parties opposed to nuclear
  weapons on German soil. [[Exercising escalation should]{.mark} also
  [account for]{.mark} the spectrum of the Kremlin's so-called **[hybrid
  tactics]{.mark}**, [which include **influence
  op**]{.mark}**eration[s]{.mark}**, **[cyberattacks]{.mark}**,
  [and]{.mark} enabling **[new tech]{.mark}**nologies which could
  undermine]{.underline} or delay [the West's crisis
  response]{.underline}. The migrant crisis prompted by Belarus, for
  example, was a real-world test of Western decision-makers' ability to
  handle gray-zone escalation. Lessons can be learned from it.

- Flexibility: Russia can choose how it attacks, but it cannot determine
  how the West will respond. Dynamic and unpredictable ways of
  countering aggression highlight the breadth and depth of alliance
  capabilities. The acquisition of F-35s and new naval capabilities
  (such as Danish frigates) extend the range of responses.

- Technology: Artificial intelligence
  (**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**)-[enabled [decision]{.mark} support
  [tools and]{.mark} synthetic [environments may be more]{.mark}
  **[cost-effective]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
  **[faster]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They allow decision-makers and
  planners to test more **radical courses** of action, to train to
  failure out of the public gaze, and to pursue different
  iterations]{.underline}. They also allow national leaders to explore
  the context and outcomes of strategic dilemmas.

- [After action reviews]{.underline} (AARs) [should be **shared widely**
  among allies, and with the public in unclassified
  formats]{.underline}.

[Variations]{.underline} in national capabilities, readiness, budgets,
doctrines, and risk appetites [present difficulties for multinational
exercises]{.underline} in the region. Willingness and ability to
participate will vary. But [even [small steps are better than
none]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly [[when combined with]{.mark} a
**[coordinated]{.mark} approach** to [messaging]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Some aspects of exercises must remain in the classified realm, but more
openness would be helpful. The demonstrated willingness to accept costs
and make hard choices is an important element in national and regional
defense.

Ultimately, [[exercises are a guide to]{.mark} **[better
decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They guide the deployment of
financial and other resources]{.underline}. They also focus
decision-makers' minds on necessary political sacrifices. Before
embarking on these hard choices, we need to know what they are. Subject
to the lessons learned from exercises, we also recommend the following
steps to enhance capabilities in the Baltic Sea region.

Boost Capabilities and Security Assistance

Increase contributions to AMD in the Baltic states, particularly from
alliance countries with a stake in regional security such as the UK,
France, Germany, and the Netherlands. Lack of AMD is the region's single
biggest military weakness. In the event of a crisis, the only US Patriot
battalion deployed in Europe will be needed to defend Ramstein (the main
US air base in Germany). Polish and Swedish Patriot missiles will be
needed in those countries. The Baltic states are the most militarily
exposed countries in Europe and also lack the defense budgets to buy
these capabilities themselves on a sufficient scale.
[[By]{.underline}]{.mark} enhancing regional AMD, and [[building on
**US**]{.mark} [security assistance]{.mark}]{.underline} efforts so far,
[[all of Europe will be **safer**]{.mark} as a result]{.underline}.

Transform Baltic Air Policing (essentially a peacetime deployment) to
Baltic Air Defense. This will signal to Russian decision-makers that
their anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities do not automatically
give them dominance over the Baltic states in the event of a crisis.
This will not happen overnight and serious questions about command and
control (C2) will need to be resolved. The balance between the onshore
and naval capabilities required and their permanent or persistent
presence in the Baltic states can be graduated according to the threat
environment. So too is the role of potential deep strikes on the
territory of Russia's Kaliningrad exclave. But the pretense that air
policing alone is adequate is outdated and harmful.

[[Improve **ISR** capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region. [[The
aim should be an]{.mark} "**[unblinking eye]{.mark}**]{.underline}"
[that can identify what Kremlin forces are doing, long before a
crisis]{.underline} actually [develops]{.underline}. [[This contributes
to]{.mark} the [speed of recognition]{.mark} that is [vital in]{.mark}
gray-zone or **[hybrid war]{.mark}** [situations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
To help achieve this, regional [[countries should leverage]{.mark}
more]{.underline} unmanned and **[[autonomous]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[surveillance capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} in the air and maritime
domains. As part of regional burden sharing, richer countries (such as
Sweden) should pay for new intelligence-gathering capabilities that may
be deployed, as required, in the airspace, waters, and territory of the
Baltic states.

[[Overhaul the]{.mark} rules, [classifications]{.mark}, clearances, and
procedures [around]{.mark} **[data]{.mark} transfer**]{.underline} [and
processing [to ensure]{.mark} **[seamless]{.mark}** [info]{.mark}rmation

**[complicated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
**[conservative]{.mark}** enough to make intelligence sharing

not fit the **specifics** of the Baltic Sea region]{.underline}, where
non-NATO Finland and Sweden are in practice more trusted than some
countries that are formally members of NATO. Short of NATO accession for
Sweden and Finland, the goal should be maximizing information flows with
these countries. Regional nations should begin improving these processes
within the highly trusted framework of Nordic cooperation before
extending further and should ultimately aim to increase
information-sharing between the Nordic and Baltic states, particularly
for the region's maritime and air domains. Relatedly, national-level
intelligence services should maintain their vital ability to speak truth
to power. These agencies should not be in the business of courting
public popularity or pleasing their political masters. They must be
empowered to share more information with allies and partners in the
region.

Introduction

The Baltic states were accepted into NATO in April 2004 after fulfilling
all the general requirements stated in NATO Membership Action Plan
(NATO, 1999) first issued in 1999. It was a significant effort from the
countries as they started to develop their states and armed forces
almost from nothing in 1991. To reach the full membership, the Baltic
states worked separately and together, being heavily supported by
western countries, especially the Nordic states. Historic roots of
cooperation among independent Baltic states lay in the interwar period.
There were several attempts to form an alliance between the Baltic
states, Poland, and Finland in the 1920s, but for different reasons
those failed (Männik, 2013 p. 17). Finally, the Baltic Entente was
created in 1934, but 'this format was not utilized as a security and
defense policy tool because of increasing tensions in Europe and weak
trilateral cooperation' (Ozoliņa, 2019 p. ix). In the end, all the
Baltic states chose to remain neutral and were occupied by the USSR one
by one. Learning from history, it was decided in mid-90s that neutrality
would not be the policy to follow, and cooperation is the only way how
not to remain alone again. However, like in history, the cooperation
between the Baltic states today has not been so self-evident. Being
competitors for western resources at the same time have made the
cooperation relatively hard to achieve. One thing is sure: it needs
strategic leadership. 'Strategic leadership is about developing and
maintaining the capabilities that will enable success at the operational
and tactical levels of command both today and tomorrow. The objective of
strategic leadership is to ensure the long-term effectiveness'
(Institute, 2005 p. 98). Strategic leadership is about leading the
institution rather than leading at the strategic level of war (McKay,
2008 p. 106). Regardless of the definition, it is based on human
relationships (McKay, 2008 p. 18) and includes also shaping the external
and improving the internal environment of the institution (Institute,
2007 p. 48). In the current paper, the author will not differentiate
between state (policy) and military strategy. The reason lays in the
understanding that strategic leadership is considered more teamwork than
individual endeavour. It does not matter whether you are civilian or
military, a decision maker, recommender of policy or adviser in military
matters.

[The]{.underline} **[main thesis]{.underline}** [of the research paper
is that]{.underline} the **[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and
defence]{.underline} **[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[between
the **Baltic**]{.mark} **states** [to **deter
Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is still **more declarative** than
actual]{.mark}, and [it is]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} at least
partly, [[caused by lack of **strategic
leadership**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The aim of the paper is to find those
strategic leadership requirements which should be followed to enhance
the Baltic cooperation and therefore strengthen NATO's eastern boundary.
It is a qualitative analysis with case study elements. At first the
author describes the context of the subject -- how the cooperation has
evolved since 1991, what has driven it and how important it is in
today's security situation. Thereafter the author analyses three
different cooperation fields in more detail, namely joint procurements,
possible integration of land forces, and the Baltic Defence College
(BALTDEFCOL). Based on the comparison of the findings, the author
presents recommendations for strategic leadership on how to enhance the
Baltic unified military effort to deter and, if needed, to defend the
countries.

Baltic cooperation since 1991 -- need for strategic leadership There are
four main joint projects which illustrate the Baltic states' cooperation
since the restoration of their independence. According to Jermalavičius
(2009) and Molis (2009 pp. 32-33) the Baltic Battalion (BALTBAT) was
formed in 1994, followed by a trilateral naval squadron (BALTRON) in
1997, a common air surveillance network (BALTNET) in 1998, and the
establishment of joint staff college (BALTDEFCOL) in 1999. The most
visible and influential projects were BALTBAT and BALTDEFCOL (Vaidotas,
2003 pp. 11-12), especially BALTDEFCOL (Romanovs, 2014). They all are
considered successful and sometimes brought up as examples of how a
regional cooperation should be organized. Of course, there have been
smaller initiatives: cooperation in operations, some joint procurements,
and contribution to NATO Response Force (NRF) (Molis, 2009 p. 33). All
those joint initiatives helped to develop the Baltic states' defence
forces, enhanced foreign assistance and support, and in the end, were
important for the states to become NATO members. However, already 'five
years after accession to NATO, Baltic military cooperation became
stagnating' (Jermalavičius, 2009). The regional cooperation did not
disappear, but 'massive new projects of regional cooperation among the
Baltic States have not been initiated' (Molis, 2009 p. 46).
'Intra-regional cooperation lost its unique relevance and became part of
the wider Alliance's landscape' (Ozoliņa, 2019 pp. ix-x). In fact, the
problems were there already from the beginning. In his BALTBAT case
study, Pete Ilo describes the lack of trust between the Baltic states
and how western countries sometimes had to force the Balts to cooperate
(2013 pp. 258-260). The main reasons of low cooperation can be described
as 'critical combination of three factors: foreign disengagement,
divergent national responses to NATO's global strategy and the
competitive instincts of the three defence organizations'
(Jermalavičius, 2009). The common goal after the restoration of
independence which forced the Baltic states to cooperate was the
ambition to join NATO. After being accepted 2004, the Baltic states came
to the conclusion that their security was guaranteed, and Russia was not
seen as the main threat anymore (Männik, 2013 p. 13). Therefore, the
cooperation started to erode, and each country followed their own
agendas. From the abovementioned initiatives only BALTDEFCOL and BALTNET
have survived till today. The former has become a respected professional
military education institution (Dilans, 2019 p. 22) and the latter one
can be considered as the backbone of all the Baltic Air Forces and is
fully integrated into NATO. BALTBAT was deactivated already in 2003
(Ito, 2013 p. 245) and in 2016, Estonia stepped out from BALTRON to turn
its focus on the standing NATO mine-countermeasure squadron (Grant, et
al., 2019 p. 20). Today's security situation is completely different
compared to the time the Baltic states joined NATO. Attacks against
Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine since 2014, as well as constant hybrid
actions against the Baltic states and others have forced western world
and NATO to reassess the situation and come up with new NATO 2022
Strategic Concept (NATO, 2021). The new NATO military strategy named as
Defence and Deterrence Concept, is 'built on a concept of direct defence
designed to defeat an aggressor and such a direct defence capability is
a deterrent because it can either defeat an aggressor or impose
intolerable costs' (Group, 2022 p. 17). The two most significant
deterrence strategies are: deterrence by denial and by punishment
(Rostocks, 2020 p. 23). Knowing that conventional balance in the region
is not achievable by the Baltic countries alone, even with the
pre-positioned NATO battalions (Veebel, 2018 p. 237), and looking at the
geography of the Baltic region, the main conclusion to be drawn is as
follows: deterrence by denial will be the Baltic states' duty and
deterrence by punishment will remain for the rest of NATO. The purpose
of that magnitude is not achievable if the Baltic countries continue to
act separately following their own agendas.

Therefore, [[the **purpose** of Baltic cooperation]{.mark} today [should
be to deter Russia by **denial**]{.mark}]{.underline} and, if deterrence
fails, to defend until the other NATO countries will join the fight. In
the other words, in case of an attack it will be NATO's fight from the
first moment and the Baltic states will be just the first ones to react
on the ground. [There are]{.underline} three possible [scenarios for
[Russia to act against the Baltics to undermine]{.mark} **NATO
[cohesion]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}:
a hybrid attack, [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} large-scale
[**[conventional]{.mark}** [attack]{.mark}]{.underline} or a surprise
attack. When launched, it [[will]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, [[be a
**combination**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[with]{.mark} some additions like
[destroying]{.mark} **[critical]{.mark} targets**]{.underline} [and
**[infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[**[cyber-attacks]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [etc]{.underline}. At least
initially, [all the Baltic states will be **cut off**]{.underline} from
the rest of the allies and must manage with what they have at their
disposal. [It can be currently estimated that [a **hybrid
scenario**]{.mark} [will be the]{.mark} **[most
likely]{.mark}**]{.underline} and a surprise attack most dangerous one;
however, [[a **large-scale** attack]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[cannot be
ruled out]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Kundla, 2022). Neither deterrence nor
defence is just military business. Effective deterrence involves
activities in all DIME domains and the Baltic states' joint effort
supported by other NATO countries. Using NATO terms, comprehensive
approach is the basis to approach all the security matters.

To sum up, regarding the security situation, [[the need for]{.mark} the
Baltic states' strategic level [coop]{.mark}eration [is]{.mark}
**[inevitable]{.mark}**, [but there are]{.mark} currently [no]{.mark}
**[large-scale]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[projects
ongoing]{.underline}]{.mark}, except the old ones. Most of the
cooperation continues to take place proceeded by NATO. The lack of the
Baltic states' ability to deter Russia by denial indicates the absence
of strategic leadership. At the same time, [[there are **lot of areas**
where Baltic militaries]{.underline}]{.mark} and MoD-s [[can
cooperate]{.mark} and work jointly]{.underline}. According to
Jermalavičius (2009), '[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} sub-regional
[**contingency [planning]{.mark}** [to the
**integration**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} **[command]{.mark}**,
**[control]{.mark}**, **[communication]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} **[info]{.mark}rmation** systems]{.underline};
[[from]{.mark} **[joint procurements]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.mark}
the organization of common defence **[R&D]{.mark}**
activities]{.underline} -- [[the Baltics can]{.underline}]{.mark} do a
lot together to [[increase the]{.mark}
**[credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of NATO's collective
defence]{.mark} system]{.underline} in the Baltic region, while saving
resources and remaining at the forefront of progressive defence thinking
within the Alliance'. Enhanced cooperation between [the Baltic states
will]{.underline} probably [be **not enough**]{.underline} [to deter
Russia]{.underline}. Therefore, besides the need to rethink the
operational strategy and concepts of the Baltic states, [[it is
also]{.mark} **[critical]{.mark}** [to cooperate with]{.mark}
**[Finland]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[Sweden]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Grant, et al., 2019 p. 46). It can be stated that there is an urgent
requirement for strategic thinking and leadership if the Baltic states
really want to successfully deter Russia.

Joint procurements -- a field to improve

Many authors, for instance Jermalavičius (2009), Romanovs (2014),
Veebel, (2018), Mehta (2019), Grant et al (2019), have studied the
Baltic states' cooperation and pointed out the absence of joint
procurements. It is hard to understand why small states with common
enemy and limited resources buy and maintain different equipment. The
most popular argument for acting jointly is the cost-effectiveness.
'[[Joint procurement]{.mark} would **[drive down]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[costs for]{.mark} large [defence articles]{.mark} by allowing the
smaller [Baltic nations]{.mark} to [buy in **greater numbers**]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} allow the [countries]{.mark} to [share **maintenance
responsibilities**]{.mark}, which would **save money'**]{.underline}
(Mehta, 2019). [Joint procurements are]{.underline} often
**[cost-efficient]{.underline}** (Veebel, 2018 p. 239). There are also
some different opinions, arguing that sometimes it is possible to get a
better deal by acting bi-laterally. 'It could be assumed that the Baltic
states main consideration for procuring different equipment of the same
type is driven by trying to find the best deal with the money available'
(Romanovs, 2014).

Theoretically, joint procurements are beneficial, but in practice, there
are several problems. Mehta (2019) interviewed the Baltic officials and
concluded that small-scale procurements are doable and practiced, but
there are severe problems with big ones resulting from different budget
cycles of the states, different threat assessments, the bureaucracy of
the seller country to handle different buyers, and organization of
maintenance. There have been some smaller-scale joint procurements but
none regarding the main equipment. For example, Estonian and Latvian
procured jointly Lockheed Martin long-range radars (Jermalavičius, 2009)
and the Baltics states together acquired Carl Gustav ammunition
(Romanovs, 2014). In 2020, Estonia and Latvia procured Carl-Gustav M4
grenade launchers and are planning to buy practice hand grenades (BC,
2020). In contrast, between 2016 and 2021, all the three Baltic states
have acquired different types of main weapon systems, for example,
infantry fighting vehicles: Estonia bought 44 CV-90's, Latvia 123
CVR(T)'s and Lithuania 88 Boxer's Combat vehicles. The same goes for
artillery, 12 K9 Thunder's, 47 M109's and 21 Pz2000's, respectively, and
air defence systems, namely Mistral 3, RBS70 Mk2 and NASAMS,
respectively (Finabel, 2019 pp. 17-19). Based on the procurement
programs, it can be concluded that the Baltic states are developing
different land forces and there is practically no cooperation concerning
joint procurements. However, in the light of the Russia-Ukraine War,
there can be seen some positive changes in joint procurements. Now also
big projects are agreed and in process. The Estonian Centre for Defence
Investment (RKIK) and the Latvian Ministry of Defence announced 'the
largest procurement in the military field so far' by planning to buy
different types of vehicles together (LETA/BNS/TBT, 2022).
Unfortunately, Lithuania is not taking part in this project. At the end
of 2021, all the Baltic defence ministers revealed plans to procure M270
Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) (ERR, 2021). The last is not just
joint procurement; it can be illustrated as joint capability
development.

[[The issue is]{.mark} not so much about cost-effectiveness but
**[interop]{.mark}**erability and military necessity when preparing to
fight against Russia]{.underline}. [Interoperability means '[the ability
to **act together coherently**]{.mark}, **effectively**, [and
**efficiently**]{.mark} to achieve Allied tactical, operational and
strategic objectives']{.underline} (OFFICE, 2021).
[[Different]{.underline}]{.mark} main [[weapon systems bring]{.mark}
about **[different organization]{.mark}**, **procedures**, **tactics**,
and demand **different logistical** and **command
solutions**]{.underline}. On the one hand,
[[diversity]{.underline}]{.mark} is good, but on the other hand, it
[[works against]{.mark} you when there is [a]{.mark} need for **[joint
collective effort]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to win the
war]{.underline}]{.mark}. The side effects on tactical level can be and
have been mitigated by extensive joint training. But on the operational
level and considering the sustainability of force, training doesn't
help. Again, [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the first days of [[a]{.mark}
potential [war]{.mark}]{.underline}, there will be no issues, but after
that, [[all the Baltic states will be dependent on **outside
support**]{.mark} regarding supplies, spear parts, ammunition
etc]{.underline}. [[It is **much easier** for NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
and Allies [[to help the Baltic states as]{.mark} **[one
entity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [with similar goods]{.underline} than
three different countries with very different ones.

It can be said that there is no need for joint procurements just to buy
stuff together, especially in circumstances where every state has
developed their land forces according to their own threat assessment,
geographical conditions, resources available, and [[following **NATO
standards**]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, as concluded previously, to
deter [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} defend, there is no other options than
to fight together. In other terms, the real need for **[[joint
procurements]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[arises from **military
necessity**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- to create conditions to win the war.
[It will]{.underline} not [be]{.underline} so much [about]{.underline}
cost-effectiveness, but [building, developing, and maintaining
capabilities in a **coordinated manner**]{.underline}. In other words,
it is a question of strategy, how to create conditions for future
success on tactical and operational level. This joint strategy and
future perspectives seem to be missing currently.

Strengthen Political Cohesion and Resilience

Enhance political cohesion by developing a common threat assessment
[[for the Baltic]{.underline}]{.mark} Sea region. [[The first step
to]{.mark} greater **political [cohesion]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is to work toward a]{.mark}
deeper **[common threat assessment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This
is]{.mark} an [important]{.mark} means [to]{.mark} **[building
trust]{.mark}** across the region]{.underline}, which is strong between
some countries (notably Sweden and Finland, and Poland and Lithuania)
but much weaker among others. Building trust should be an explicit goal
of national decision-makers [[with an]{.mark} **[extensive
program]{.mark}** [of **exchanges**]{.mark}, **joint
[training]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} **[info]{.mark}rmation
[sharing]{.mark}**]{.underline} to create the personal and institutional
ties that underpin a common strategic culture. [A common threat
[assessment]{.mark} should [involve]{.mark} **[pooled]{.mark} bottom-up
[analyses]{.mark}** [of Russia's intentions and capabilities,]{.mark}
[coupled with]{.mark} **high-level [intel]{.mark}ligence** inputs from
countries outside the region]{.underline}. An unclassified version
should be published on an annual basis, endorsed by at a minimum the
four Nordic and three Baltic countries and Poland. It would be helpful
if other countries, notably Germany but also the Netherlands, France,
the UK, and the United States, would endorse the assessment too.
Undoubtedly, national threat assessments vary because of geography and
history. Political considerations play a role too: Poland and the Baltic
states' national interest is to maximize the foreign military presence
on their territories. Other countries cherish their flexibility.
Nonetheless, [[the **search** for common ground will **in
itself**]{.mark} [be useful]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The classified version of such an assessment would form a **useful
basis** for military planning, exercises, and budgeting]{.underline}.
[This would not be a substitute for NATO and other allied efforts in
this respect]{.underline}. [But it would have a **quality of focus** and
**authority** by virtue of]{.underline} the **[expertise]{.underline}**
and proximity of the countries endorsing it. It would also be free to
state blunt truths that are often lost in the thickets of Brussels
politicking.

Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its subsequent involvement in
the war in eastern Ukraine have caused deep concern in the capitals of
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members. In the 2016 Warsaw
Summit Communiqué, NATO labeled Russia a "challenge \[to\] the Alliance"
and "a source of regional instability."1 These concerns reflect the
reality that a war between Russia and NATO, although unlikely, is not
unthinkable anymore. [[The risks of tensions escalating]{.mark} in
general or in a crisis [are]{.mark} **[particularly
high]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the wider Baltic
region, which includes [[the]{.mark} three [Baltic]{.mark}
states]{.underline} (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), [Poland, parts of
western Russia, and the adjacent waters of the Baltic Sea]{.underline}.2

An underlying challenge is that [[Russian interests]{.mark} and strategy
toward the region [are]{.mark} **[ambiguous]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
leave]{.mark} much room for **[speculation]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[misinterpretation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Specifically, [NATO allies
**cannot be sure** what Moscow's intentions]{.underline} toward the
Baltics and the alliance [are]{.underline}. Does it aim to merely
intimidate these countries by various threats? Or does Russia plan to
invade? Particularly prevalent in the Baltic states and Poland---all of
which have borders with Russia---these concerns have prompted NATO to
reassure its easternmost members with a number of limited defensive
measures, most prominently by agreeing to deploy four multinational
battalions to the three Baltic states and Poland to deter eventual
Russian aggression.3 Meanwhile, Moscow strongly denies any malign
intentions toward NATO, and instead points to the alliance as a threat
to its own national security.4

As a consequence of these ambiguities, it is possible that NATO may be
overestimating the threat emanating from Russia, and the alliance could
end up precipitating exactly the kind of security threat that it seeks
to avoid. For example, the well-intentioned defensive measures for the
Baltic states and Poland that allies agreed to implement at the Warsaw
Summit could reinforce legitimate as well as imagined Russian security
concerns. Moscow has already denounced NATO's actions as aggressive and
announced retaliatory steps.5 Some NATO members have warned the alliance
of doing too much and assert that enhanced defensive measures might only
further deteriorate the security situation in the region by raising
tensions with Russia.6 As a consequence, both sides may enter a security
dilemma that could raise tensions and make conflict more likely, if this
is not already happening.

Conversely, it is also possible that NATO may be underestimating the
Russian military threat. Russia's strategy of conflict, as stipulated in
its doctrine of new-generation warfare,7 appears to be comprehensive,
involving everything from propaganda to potential nuclear use. Failing
to identify a sound response that addresses the threat in its totality
could be dangerous. For example, NATO's defensive measures, by being too
limited, could lead Moscow to deliberately test allies' resolve, perhaps
even by military means.

Some NATO members argue that the alliance is still not doing enough to
credibly deter Russia.8 The geography and the military balance in the
region present real challenges to NATO in defending Baltic allies.
Russia has a much larger force presence than NATO in the region and, by
using land routes, can quickly reinforce equipment and personnel. NATO,
by contrast, would have to fly or ship in reinforcements---a much slower
process. Additionally, Moscow continues to hold large-scale military
exercises based on aggressive scenarios against neighboring states such
as Poland, close to NATO's borders. The latest one---Zapad 2017---peaked
in September 2017. Such exercises, some of Russia's neighbors fear,
could be used as a cover for a limited military attack against them.9

The conventional challenge in Europe is compounded by Russia's
increasingly aggressive behavior in the nuclear realm. On various
occasions since 2014, the United States has publicly accused Russia of
violating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty by
developing and, more recently, deploying a ground-launched cruise
missile (although Washington has not indicated whether it believes these
missiles are designed to accommodate nuclear or nonnuclear warheads or
both).10 Furthermore, Russia frequently issues blunt nuclear threats
toward NATO allies. For example, in March 2015, the Russian ambassador
to Denmark said that if Danish warships contributed radar capacity to
NATO's missile defense system, "Danish warships will be targets for
Russian nuclear missiles."11

[All these [developments create **political**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as
well as military) [[problems for NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[They]{.mark} lead to **[pressure]{.mark}** on [NATO to review
its]{.mark}]{.underline} own [[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} and
defense [[posture]{.underline}]{.mark}, including its nuclear component,
and, perhaps, to formulate more muscular responses. [But [such a
debate]{.mark}]{.underline}---already tentatively taking place at NATO
Headquarters---[[risks **eroding unity**]{.mark} among NATO
allies]{.underline}, which have a wide range of different preferences in
the nuclear realm. [[This erosion of unity could **undermine
deterrence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [A military [alliance at odds over
its **own deterrence**]{.mark} and **defense posture**]{.underline}
[[could be perceived as **weak**]{.mark} by Russia]{.underline},
[[making it a]{.mark} potential [target for]{.mark} **military
[blackmail]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[coercion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Preserving **NATO's unity**]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline},
therefore, [[a]{.mark} **[key task]{.mark}** for the alliance, [even
more so since Russia's]{.mark} doctrine of **[new-gen]{.mark}eration
[warfare]{.mark}** [is challenging NATO militarily]{.mark} and
politically in many other respects]{.underline}. [All three [Baltic
states]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance, [[are subject to
**relentless**]{.mark} [Russian attacks through]{.mark} **propaganda**,
**[disinfo]{.mark}**rmation, [and]{.mark} **outright [hate
speech]{.mark}**]{.underline} that have become more virulent since
2014.12 [These states are home to **significant** [ethnic Russian
minorities]{.mark} that [receive Russian]{.mark} state-sponsored
[media]{.mark}]{.underline} almost exclusively. [[This]{.mark}
**[propaganda]{.mark}** [deepens]{.mark} existing
[divides]{.mark}]{.underline}, which date back to the Soviet occupation,
between the different populations groups in the Baltics.13 [Perhaps
Russia does not seek to stoke protests or]{.underline} outright
[unrest]{.underline} among minority groups. [But even if it does not,
[Moscow's negative influence]{.mark} nonetheless [increases the risk of
a]{.mark} **[domestic crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} in one of the three
states, in the wake of which [[there could be]{.mark} **growing domestic
[pressure]{.mark}** [on]{.mark}]{.underline} the Kremlin for [[Russia
to]{.mark} come to the [aid]{.mark} of [Russians living
abroad]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Even if Moscow is not planning]{.mark} for [deliberate
aggression]{.mark} against NATO, **[accidental escalation]{.mark}** [is
another]{.mark} potential [risk]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Russia has
stepped up]{.mark} **[military brinkmanship]{.mark}** vis-à-vis NATO
member states]{.underline} since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.14
In 2016 alone, [Russian military aircraft violated Estonian
airspace]{.underline} five times [and often came **extremely close** to
allied aircraft]{.underline}.15 [These actions could result in an
accident]{.underline}, potentially [killing NATO and Russian service
personnel]{.underline}. In the wake of such an accident, [tensions could
rapidly mount, especially given **domestic pressure**]{.underline} [to
retaliate. NATO and Russia might find themselves unable to control the
subsequent escalation]{.underline}.

So far, NATO has responded with an incremental approach, focused on
collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. At its
2014 summit in Wales, NATO emphasized the assurance of allies,
particularly those in the Baltic region, who felt most vulnerable.16 By
the 2016 Warsaw Summit, the emphasis had shifted to deterrence and
defense, as allies set out NATO's primary responsibility as being "to
protect and defend our territory and our populations against attack."17
By agreeing to deploy multinational forces from sixteen member states to
the region, allies aimed to increase the credibility of NATO's
deterrence and defense posture against Russia by trying to convince
Moscow that an attack on one would be an attack on all. The Warsaw
Summit Communiqué also highlighted a possible cooperative way forward by
underscoring political dialogue with Moscow aimed at avoiding
misunderstanding, miscalculation, and unintended escalation by means of
transparency and predictability.

Indeed, [[NATO's deterrence]{.mark} and defense approach still
[contains]{.mark} **[loopholes]{.mark}** [that must be
closed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [But **[deterrence]{.mark} alone** [is
ill-equipped to manage]{.mark} the **[nonkinetic]{.mark}** [or]{.mark}
**[accidental]{.mark}** [escalation risks that Russia's]{.mark} doctrine
of **[new-gen]{.mark}**eration [warfare pose]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[NATO needs a]{.mark} **[comprehensive]{.mark}**]{.underline},
threefold [[strategy]{.mark} that addresses these risks and [takes into
account]{.mark} the views of [allies in the **wider Baltic
region**]{.mark}]{.underline}.18 As NATO seeks to formulate an effective
response to Russia's policies and actions, [the alliance is
facing]{.underline} three major tasks: (1) [how to calibrate its
deterrence measures to prevent deliberate Russian escalation and to
assure its easternmost members]{.underline}; (2) [how to maintain
alliance unity]{.underline} in light of the differing threat
perceptions---particularly toward Russia---and defense priorities of the
members states; [and]{.underline} (3) [how to prevent possible
inadvertent or accidental escalation]{.underline} with Russia. If left
unattended, these challenges will further increase the already high risk
of escalation in the Baltic region. The focus should be on what NATO can
do now to reduce the risk of escalation in the future, rather than on
the separate (albeit important) question of how NATO should try to
manage escalation should a crisis occur.

To this end, [[NATO should close]{.mark} **dangerous
[loopholes]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in its current deterrence and
assurance approach]{.underline}, so [as [to deter Russian
aggression]{.mark} against NATO [and]{.mark} prevent Moscow from using
deliberate [escalation]{.mark} to coerce the alliance]{.underline}[.
[The alliance should]{.underline}]{.mark} also [double down on efforts
to **[enhance resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline}---that is, [[increasing
the ability of]{.mark} member [states to]{.mark} **[absorb
shocks]{.mark}**, [such as]{.mark} sudden **[electricity
outages]{.mark}**]{.underline} [or **large-scale
[cyberattacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} on corporate networks. [NATO must
make its societies]{.underline}---[in]{.underline} particular [its
easternmost allies [and]{.mark} Russian minorities living
there]{.underline}---[more immune to Russian **[destabilization
efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Finally, by engaging Moscow in talks on
risk-reduction measures, NATO should seek to diminish the potential for
accidental escalation, especially given the spike in dangerous military
encounters. Over the longer term, it is also possible that consultations
with Russia could lead to more far-reaching arms control talks about
conventional forces in the region.19

Despite some positive signs such as rotational deployments and exercises
to the BSR, it remains to be seen whether NATO and partner nations have
the political will to implement the measures necessary for an effective
denial-based deterrent strategy. Arguably, A2/AD capabilities and
hedgehog defenses would be costly to build and maintain, and there is
little appetite outside the Baltics themselves to pay the bill. These
criticisms are valid. Nevertheless, the necessary political will to
defend the Baltic states is suspect no matter what deterrence strategy
NATO decides to pursue. As a recent paper concluded, "[[protecting
**political will**]{.mark} and **strengthening** it for the future
foundation of NATO [should become]{.mark} a **[critical]{.mark}**
alliance function]{.underline}."48 However, [[**denial-based**

[of a potentially available solution, [one that is]{.mark}
**[defensive]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} therefore **[more

[[To remedy]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[shortfalls]{.mark}, [NATO
should deploy a]{.mark} **[robust]{.mark}** [ISR network that
**integrates** NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and non-NATO [[assets]{.mark}
to provide early indications and warning of impending Russian attacks
and the critical component to an effective air defense
system]{.underline}. Additionally, NATO and its partners should
supplement air presence with a robust integrated air defense network to
ward off Russian attacks. By focusing foremost on air defense, NATO can
raise the cost of potential Russian attacks, preserving NATO forces,
while providing time to transition from a defensive to an offensive air
campaign.

The Alliance must first improve the technical capabilities of the Baltic
states and those of the surrounding non-NATO countries if it is to
deploy a robust integrated ISR network. To that end, the United States
could deploy its unmanned aerial systems (UAS) or ground-based radars to
the region. Utilizing UAS, however, will come at the expense of other
U.S. operations around the globe.54 Rather than relying on the U.S.
military to provide both manpower and assets, the Baltic states could
lease UAS or other intelligence capabilities from U.S. or European
commercial entities.55 NATO and its regional partners should also invest
in low-cost and commercially available micro and cube satellites to
create a resilient space-based ISR capability.56 Furthermore, [[the
Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} and partner nations [[must ensure]{.mark}
**[system compatibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[interop]{.mark}erability]{.underline}**
[[to create a]{.mark} **[viable network]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[capable
of providing]{.mark} **[early indications]{.mark}** [of an
impending]{.mark} Russian [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}.57

[[An **even greater**]{.mark} [challenge is]{.mark} creating the
structures and processes for
**[intel]{.mark}ligence-[sharing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, an undertaking
complicated by nations reluctant to participate or share data with their
neighbors. RAND analyst Andrew Radin suggests bilateral
[[intel]{.mark}ligence-[sharing agreements among the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates, **[Baltic states]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} **[NATO
countries]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}to [**[overcome]{.mark}** [the
Alliance's **limited progress**]{.mark}]{.underline} in this arena.58
However, [sharing and cooperating needs to extend **beyond** the
intelligence realm and must include the integration of regional air
defense assets]{.underline} such as radars and missile systems and
incorporate both ground- and air-based systems. The five-member Nordic
Defense Cooperation provides a forum outside of NATO for such
cooperation.59

General Breedlove further advocates for a layered regional air defense
construct that links the national capabilities of both NATO and non-NATO
allies. Specifically, Breedlove recommends including the Baltic maritime
domain for air defense to "\[deepen\] the air defense network in the
region during a crisis."60 Leased [[capabilities such as air defense
radars]{.mark} in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania [can further refine
the]{.mark} regional [air picture when **shared with
NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and other surrounding countries.61 Such
initiatives must overcome the same challenges that NATO encountered with
intelligence-sharing.62 They will also require a concerted diplomatic
and political effort from NATO to ensure participation by regional
countries affected by the Russian threat. The initiative to integrate
all of these capabilities should fall under a new and broader Baltic Air
Defense mission, which would replace the current Baltic Air Policing
mission.

NATO established the Baltic Air Policing mission in 2004 to "enforce the
sovereign airspace of the three Baltic countries."63 The mission has
served as an important check on Russian aggression and recklessness in
the air against both NATO and non-NATO members. Since the 2014 Russian
incursion into the Crimean Peninsula, the mission has gained additional
support.64 Although NATO has increased the number of aircraft to respond
to increased tensions in the BSR, "existing processes" and the Russian
threat prevent the Alliance from rapidly increasing the number of air
assets in "the event of a military crisis in the Baltic."65 The
transition from the Baltic Air Policing mission to the Baltic Air
Defense mission will enable NATO to defend the "prepositioned equipment,
rotational troops, and key infrastructure and transport nodes" as well
as improve the Alliance's ability to respond more rapidly to military
crises in the Baltics.66 To enhance operational flexibility, NATO and
its partners should also establish easy access agreements to permit the
movement of military assets across borders in the event of a crisis
without prior diplomatic approval.67

The Russian A2/AD threat in the BSR negates many of airpower's
advantages, and for the first time since the Cold War, NATO and its
partners may not be able to achieve air dominance. To offset this new
reality, [[NATO]{.mark} and its partners [must develop their]{.mark}
**[own A2/AD]{.mark}**]{.underline} network in the region [starting with
a credible air defense network]{.underline} that integrates high-end
assets, low-cost systems, and traditional airpower [[to]{.mark} provide
a [check]{.mark} on future Russian [aggression]{.mark} in the
BSR]{.underline}. Protecting vulnerable military bases and assets in the
region will allow NATO and its partners to consolidate forces and
eventually transition from a defensive to an offensive campaign, one
with the potential to escalate using the full range of NATO's military
capabilities, including the potential use of nuclear weapons if needed,
against Russian forces.

Today, America's adversaries are building antiaccess/area-denial (A2/AD)
zones to keep the U.S. military out of key strategic regions. A2/AD is a
series of sensors; antiship, antiaircraft, and ground defenses; and
long-range fires utilized by U.S. competitors and designed to prevent
the United States from entering into a close fight.1 We see Chinese
A2/AD zones set up to deny U.S. access to Taiwan and the South China
Sea. Russia uses A2/AD zones in Kaliningrad, Crimea, the Kola Peninsula,
and the Kuril Islands to block key maritime avenues of approach. In the
past, the weakness of these zones were the command and control nodes,
which formed a single point of failure. Utilizing precision-guided
technology, the United States would wage a short, inexpensive
decapitation campaign aimed at these nodes. Their destruction would
break up integration of enemy defenses, also called dis-integration. For
decades, the offense-defense balance was firmly on the offense.
[**[Emerging tech]{.mark}**nologies [in]{.mark} the fields of network,
**[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence]{.underline}, and
space [[are shifting the balance]{.mark} **[back to
defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}, making these zones more dangerous. At
the same time, the United States may have overestimated the effects of
long-range strike capabilities after three decades of fighting nonpeer
competitors. Unable to fight a short decapitation campaign, the United
States may be forced into a prolonged attrition campaign, at
unacceptable political costs.

What Is A2/AD?

[[**A2/AD** zones are composed of]{.underline}]{.mark} intelligence,
surveillance, reconnaissance (**[[ISR]{.underline}]{.mark}**), and
defensive and offensive strike systems. [[ISR systems]{.mark} are
utilized to [spot]{.mark} **[incoming threats]{.mark}** for engagement
by **defensive strike** systems]{.underline}. Offensive strike systems
attack enemy bases, logistics, and command and control (C2)
infrastructure seeking to delay the buildup of U.S. forces. [Adding to
the effectiveness of the A2/AD zones are the decoy and deception
operations that favor]{.underline} ground-based [defenders]{.underline}
and increase the defender's survivability. [**[Combinations]{.mark}**
[of these techniques with emerging tech]{.mark}nologies [are making
**defense** the]{.mark} **[stronger form]{.mark}** [of warfare]{.mark}
for the foreseeable future]{.underline}. The key strategic objective of
the defender is not to defeat the United States in battle, but to
increase the costs to the United States until the potential political
gain is outweighed by the loss.

Current: Advantage Offense (United States)

Traditionally, the defender has relied on combinations of ground-based
radars, human intelligence, and ground reconnaissance to gain an
operational picture. Wealthier states could afford to augment these
sensors with an Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), consisting
of powerful radars mounted on large passenger planes, unmanned aerial
vehicles, and space assets. The augmenting assets are expensive and
available only in small numbers. This makes them early high-value
targets, unlikely to survive prolonged conflict. Within a month of
conflict, the United States would destroy most of them, forcing the
defender to rely on his primary systems for early warning and targeting.

For the U.S. military, the main strike capability has always been land-
and sea-based airpower. U.S. adversaries' solutions were ground-based
air defense. These air defenses are relying on ground-based search radar
to identify incoming strikes and attack radar, which paints the targets
for the defending missile. The search radar has numerous weaknesses. It
is stationary; thus, its coverage is limited and can be bypassed. Once
turned on, electronic warfare (EW) aircraft can identify its location
and destroy it with standoff antiradiation missiles that home in on
radar emissions. Historically, an attacking air force can suppress air
defenses after a month-long air campaign.2 Ground search radars can be
augmented with AWACS. These aircraft are more survivable than
ground-based radars due to their mobility, but the introduction of
long-range and very long-range air-to-air missiles, together with low
observable aircraft, are rapidly negating the effects of AWACS,
retaining advantage for offense.

Reliance on ground-based search radar forces the defender to centralize
the C2 structure. Passing targeting data between batteries requires a
single central control node. This weakness is exacerbated by the
effectiveness of suppression of enemy air defense missions using
antiradiation missiles. Unable to continuously emit, defenders must rely
on rolling emissions by several radars to gain a picture of their
airspace. It is a process where several radars cover the same area and
turn on and off for short durations before moving. Only a centralized
headquarters can coordinate that effort and tie it in with defending
fighters. This gives the attacker few key nodes for targeting.
Destruction of these nodes will rapidly dis-integrate the enemy's A2/AD
defense. The missile launchers will still be there, but they will not be
able to engage without warning and targeting data telling them where to
shoot. So far, the balance is in favor of the offense.

Next 10 Years: Advantage Defense (Adversary)

Emerging technologies are changing this 10-year prediction. One key
technology is the miniaturization of cameras and satellites. New
microsatellites are cheap, small, and effective. A single rocket can
deliver 80 small photo reconnaissance satellites into orbit.3 This
technology has allowed the U.S. firm Planet to photograph any corner of
the Earth with one of its 200 satellites, updating images every day with
2-meter resolution.4 The defender does not need to cover all the Earth;
he just needs to cover the conflict zone. He can accomplish this by
seeding the orbit over the conflict zone with 300 to 500
microsatellites, especially if these satellites are able to generate
imagery of 1-meter resolution and transmit data every 5 to 10 minutes.
This satellite constellation will have complete photo coverage of the
battlespace and be able to spot any aircraft or ship coming into the
conflict zone. This system is even more dangerous because antisatellite
weaponry is extremely expensive. For example, both antiballistic and
antisatellite (Standard Missile 3, or SM-3) missiles cost between \$15
and \$18 million each. To make matters worse, in 2018 the Department of
Defense planned to buy only 40 of them.5 There may simply not be enough
antisatellite missiles to destroy an enemy constellation. There are
direct energy weapons coming online, and the Russians recently claimed
to have operationalized one.6 Yet even those systems are few in number
and may not be able to attrit a satellite constellation faster than the
enemy can reseed it. In short, this constellation may be extremely
survivable to the point where an attacker might not be able to
neutralize it due to the large number of targets.

Space-based ISR will be augmented by aerostats. These are high-altitude
balloons or blimps. They can maintain a position at 70,000 feet above
sea level and have visual coverage of up to 775 miles.7 Aerostats vary
in cost but are far cheaper than interceptor missiles and can be easily
replaced. Functionally, they are like microsatellites---a cheap and
resilient, wide-area ISR system.

More [[powerful]{.mark} **high-speed [computers]{.mark}** [allow]{.mark}
**[algorithms]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to **rapidly
process**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[thousands of surveillance
images]{.mark}, identifying incoming aircraft or ships based
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} preprogrammed **[[image
recognition]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It]{.mark} also [allows]{.mark}
**[prediction]{.mark}** [of **trajectories**]{.mark} based on several
images]{.underline} collected with the ability to pass that data across
the battle network. [[The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has
been working on]{.mark} a **similar [capability]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in Project Maven.8 [[This data will]{.underline}]{.mark} not be enough
for targeting, but it will [[generate an]{.mark} **[early
warning]{.mark}** [system]{.mark}]{.underline} robust enough to replace
ground-based radar systems without any of their weaknesses. As computers
get smaller, they can be mounted on the microsatellite. This allows data
processing to be done in space and only targeting data to be passed
across the network. This reduces the bandwidth requirements and speeds
up the time to identify targets. Instead of updating target location
every 5 minutes, it can be done every minute, resulting in greatly
increased effectiveness of early warning systems.

Where an attacker can gain an advantage is in the defender's logistics.
Once enemy air defense artillery fires, it requires resupply. An
attacker can use the same space-based ISR combined with high-speed
computing power to develop algorithms to track resupply vehicles
traveling to locations from which missile launches have been detected.
This method will give the attacker a general idea where the enemy
defenses are; unfortunately, the defender must start shooting before it
can be utilized.

[Another defensive advantage is **electronic warfare**]{.underline}.
[The increased **bandwidth** and **processing power**]{.underline} of
computers allow U.S. adversaries to [network]{.underline} their
[electronic reconnaissance]{.underline}. [By networking all]{.underline}
his [EW reconnaissance assets with analytical systems, the defender can
**analyze** the emissions of attackers in real time and determine which
targets are real and which are **decoys**]{.underline}. [It can rapidly
identify incoming threats that generate emissions]{.underline} that may
have been missed by other systems. Russia has this capability in its
Moskva-1 system.9

Underpinning the enemy system is the network. For any data to be
relevant, it must be easily passed from one system to another. [[The
network must be]{.mark} **[robust]{.mark}** an[d
**secure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Quantum [[computing tech]{.mark}nology
[introduces comm]{.mark}unication[s]{.mark} [that are]{.mark} **[long
range]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[difficult to locate]{.underline}**,
[[and]{.mark} **nearly [impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to break
into]{.underline}.]{.mark}10 [[This network allows data to be **rapidly
passed**]{.mark} [between]{.mark} early warning [satellites
and]{.mark}]{.underline} ground-based [[defense
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition, [the defender owns terrain
and will have time to lay **fiber cable**]{.underline} between his
battle positions, [reducing emissions and defending its network against
**jamming**]{.underline}. It will be difficult to isolate specific
portions of the battlefield. We know that our adversaries are looking to
develop such networks and technologies, and it is only a matter of time
before they succeed.11

How the New ISR Comes Together

The defender will retain ground-based search radars but keep them off
and rely on satellites and aerostats to provide early warning and to cue
attack radars. Without emissions by the ground-based radars, the
attacker will be unable to locate enemy antiaircraft and antiship
missile batteries before they fire. The ground search radars will only
be activated if the network fails, giving the A2/AD complex redundancy
should it be temporarily dis-integrated. Neutralizing them will become
far more time-consuming and costly in terms of munitions expended and
aircraft lost. The penetration of a robust A2/AD system requires the
attacker to converge complementary capabilities from multiple units and
services. The challenge is the amount of time needed to plan such a
deliberate operation and the availability of key capabilities. If any
capability such as EW aircraft is not available, then the entire mission
must be canceled.

[[The digital network]{.mark} that passes data]{.underline} directly
from satellite and aerostat early warning systems to the ground-based
shooters allows the defender to [**[decentralize]{.mark}** [command and
control]{.mark}]{.underline}. Data carried across the network is
generated by each reconnaissance node and is seen by all shooting nodes.
For example, when a satellite constellation picks up a target, it
automatically puts the data out on the network so that every shooting
battery sees it without headquarters in the loop. Even fighter aircraft
can operate independently based on priorities published prior to
conflict. [[This]{.mark} system [removes headquarters as a]{.mark}
**single [point]{.mark}** [of failure]{.mark} in a defender's A2/AD
zone, making the task of dis-integrating more challenging]{.underline}.
A recent speech by General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian
general staff, indicates that this is the direction Russia is planning
to go.12

Survivability

[The]{.underline} next [key]{.underline} topic [is the
**survivability**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} adversary [A2/AD
systems]{.underline}. There are two issues. The first is the effects
that munitions have on targets and the number of strikes needed to fully
neutralize enemy defenses. The second is the increased effectiveness of
modern decoys and camouflage.

Decreasing Effects of Long-Range Fires

The most common long-range fire systems employed by U.S. forces are
Tomahawks and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile--Extended Range
(JASSM-ER) long-range missiles. Their key advantages are their long
range (over 1,000 kilometers), precision, and the absence of danger to
human pilots. They can be delivered by aircraft, submarines, and surface
ships. In the past, these weapons were fired early in a conflict to
destroy search radars, degrade airbases, and neutralize key nodes in an
enemy's A2/AD system. The effectiveness of these weapons may be
overestimated because we have fought nonpeer enemies. During the
conflict in Syria, the United States employed massive cruise missile
strikes on two occasions; in both cases, the damage inflicted was in no
way proportional to the amount of munitions used.

During the strike on Shayrat Airbase on April 7, 2017, the United States
fired 59 missiles. Satellite imagery shows only 44 targets hit, although
some may have been hit twice.13 It is possible that Russian jamming may
have diverted some missiles off target, although there is no way to be
certain without access to classified information. Russia's Krasukha, an
electronic warfare jamming system, was reported in the area at the time
of the strike.14 Regardless, the airbase was launching airstrikes less
than 24 hours after the attack.15 While the base was warned an hour
ahead of the strike, it was not equipped or postured to endure a
conventional precision strike.

The second strike took place on April 14, 2018. A combination of 109
JASSM-ERs, Tomahawks, and SCALPs (a European cruise missile) was fired
at six buildings. The second strike was purely political in nature and
is harder to assess for weapon effectiveness. There are indications that
some of the incoming missiles (Tomahawks and SCALPs) were intercepted.
The Russian government has presented missile remnants showing clear
damage from air defense artillery (ADA) fragmentation impacts.16 In
addition, there is video evidence from Damascus showing incoming
missiles intercepted by defensive missiles.17

At sea, the situation has been even more difficult. An attacker's
surface ships entering A2/AD zones are vulnerable to antiship missiles,
especially new hypersonic systems such as the Chinese DF-26 and Russian
Zircons. Even submarine launches are becoming a challenge as defending
diesel submarines are becoming quieter and increasing their submerged
time thanks to independent air propulsion. During an April 2018 North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) missile strike, a state-of-the-art
British Astute-class nuclear submarine was located and harassed by a
pair of Russian Kilo-class diesel submarines. It is suspected that it
failed to participate in the attack because of the harassment.18 The
combination of antiship missiles and cheap diesel submarines can be used
to keep attacker's ships away from an A2/AD zone. It is possible that in
the future, aircraft will be the only means of reliably launching cruise
missiles.

The number of [[missiles required]{.mark} to destroy a target [is
**another issue**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[there may not be
enough]{.underline}]{.mark} missiles in U.S. inventories. Official
reports indicate that approximately 100 to 150 missiles are purchased
every year.19 Quick math shows that missiles introduced in 1983 would
result in 4,500 missiles in stock, at 125 missiles purchased for 36
years. About 2,000 have been expended in combat.20 That leaves an
inventory of 2,500. At 100 missiles per major target, the U.S. stockpile
is empty after 25 targets. Even then, the damage is rapidly repairable
as the Shayrat Airbase strike demonstrated. Once the stockpile is
depleted, the United States will be reliant on replacing hundreds of
Tomahawks and JASSM-ERs a year. As enemy EW and ADA continue to improve,
the required expenditure of missiles per target will only go up.
Traditionally, the United States could rely on its industrial base to
ramp up prior to conflict. This may not be possible. A recent report by
an interagency task force points to a decline in U.S. industrial bases'
potential. A decrease of skilled labor, combined with foreign parts in
the supply chains, suggest that the United States may not be able to
ramp up production prior to conflict. Instead, America may suffer
temporary disruption of production.21

[[Once]{.mark} standoff [weapons are expended]{.mark}, [the attacker
will be forced to rely on]{.mark}]{.underline} manned [[aircraft]{.mark}
to penetrate the A2/AD zone]{.underline}. [[This will]{.mark}
immediately **[drive up]{.mark}** the [cost]{.mark}]{.underline}---[in
**lives**, **aircraft**, **finances**, and **p**olitical **c**apital for
the attacker]{.underline}. Manned [aircraft]{.underline} can generate
far more strikes but [are vulnerable to the same ADA as a cruise
missile]{.underline}. In addition, there is a human factor. Faced with
incoming fire, pilots may choose to drop their munitions and abort.
Cruise missiles will press on, no matter the odds.

[[A2/AD]{.mark} zones are able to [soak up]{.mark} **[tremendous
amounts]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} conventional [fire power
without]{.mark} **long-term** [effects]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially
those of near-peer competitors whose industrial base will replace losses
and restore the effectiveness of A2/AD zones after repeated strikes.

One of the best examples of A2/AD zone resilience is the Siege of Malta,
which took place from June 1940 to November 1942. The island, sitting in
the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, was able to conduct air and sea
denial against Axis shipping for the duration of the North African
campaign. Despite committing over 2,000 aircraft during the campaign,
German and Italian forces failed to neutralize the island for any length
of time. When the battle was over, Malta-based forces had sunk 23
percent of total European Axis shipping. The key to the island's
defenses was heavy ADA, distribution of aircraft across numerous small
airfields, and a constant air patrol. Logistics were distributed across
numerous small caches rather than one large supply point. The airfields
were rapidly repaired and put back into action. The key takeaway from
that battle is that most damage inflicted on an A2/AD zone is temporary
and will be repaired given even a short respite.22

Defenders can use many of the same techniques today. Dispersing aircraft
across multiple airfields, always keeping a combat air patrol airborne,
and using highway segments as runways can serve to make fixed-wing
aircraft more survivable and allow them to enhance the A2/AD zone.
Strikes at airbases work only if aircraft are on the ground. This
system's point of failure is sustainment. Using highway segments
increases survivability, but someone must fuel, rearm, and then park the
aircraft. Maintenance is a major issue, especially for fifth-generation
aircraft. During Operation Desert Storm, U.S. F-15s and F-16s generated
one sortie a day. In 2018, F-35s generated only 0.33 sorties per day
while flying from USS Essex against the Taliban.23 Providing maintenance
assets at dispersed locations requires considerable coordination.
Although both sides have to contend with long-range fires, the defender
has the advantage because he had years to plan and rehearse dispersed
operations on familiar terrain.

It is important to note that munition effects cut both ways. There is an
assumption that Russian missiles will destroy NATO infrastructure and
prevent use of NATO airbases in range of Russian A2/AD zones. This is
highly unlikely. Russian missiles are newer, and the country has not had
time to build large stockpiles. As noted above, it takes almost 100
missiles to close an airfield to operations, and the effect is only
temporary. The U.S. Air Force adaptive bases concept adds to resilience
by further spreading out aviation assets and increasing the Russian
target list. The Russians are far more likely to concentrate their
limited missile inventory on key targets such as C2 nodes and logistic
support areas, including forward fuel storage facilities.

Decoys and Deception

[The capacity of the defense is further increased by **[decoys]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[deception]{.mark}** countermeasures]{.underline}. These
can work both ways but usually favor the defender. [Decoys are used to
[absorb fire power]{.mark} and divert from real targets]{.underline}.
Attackers can use decoys to mislead a defender and overwhelm the ADA
with targets, but with aircraft being the main striking platform, this
becomes more difficult. In theory, airborne decoys are possible, but
they must fool radar, EW, and the visible spectrum from space-borne ISR
assets, all while maneuvering at Mach 2. The price tag of this decoy
will rapidly approach the cost of an actual combat aircraft. Ground
systems are much easier to hide using underpasses and vegetation, while
ground decoys are cheaper since they can be stationary. The defender has
a major advantage when it comes to camouflage and deception operations.

During the 1999 conflict in Kosovo, the Serbian army made extensive use
of decoys to absorb NATO airstrikes. According to one report filed by
the U.S. Air Force Munitions Effectiveness Assessment Team, 90 percent
of reported hits were on decoys. In an extreme case, the Serbs even
managed to protect a bridge by constructing a decoy 300 meters
downriver. The decoy bridge was designed to be seen from the air and was
struck multiple times by NATO aircraft.24 The spoofing did not end in
visual range. Serbian air defenses also used extensive radar decoys to
divert NATO suppression of enemy air defense missions away from actual
radars. Serbian Colonel Zoltán Dani, commander of the 250th Air Defense
Missile Brigade, used old radar sets pulled from obsolete fighters to
divert NATO strikes away from search and attack radars. During the war,
his brigade was engaged more than 20 times with NATO antiradiation
missiles without any effect. The decoys absorbed all the damage. Using
such innovative techniques, his brigade was credited with shooting down
two NATO aircraft, including a stealth F-117, and damaging another.25

The lessons of the Kosovo War were not lost on our adversaries; the
Russian army has institutionalized Serbian techniques. While Serbian
weaponry was a quarter-century behind, the state-of-the-art A2/AD zones
in Russia and China are equipped with modern systems. To provide
concealment and deception, the Russian army has created the 45th
Engineer-Camouflage Regiment. This formation is tasked with camouflaging
targets so they cannot be found and creating dummy targets that divert
an attacker's fire power.26 The Russians make extensive use of
inflatable decoys. Their dummy tanks can be transported in two duffel
bags, resist minor shrapnel damage, and incorporate radar-reflective
coating.27 It is suspected that a battery-powered heater can be used to
generate a heat signature. It appears that this technology was tested in
Syria with satisfactory effects.28 The regiment not only hides
formations; it can also disguise an installation and build a fake
airfield in 24 hours.29 In addition to setting up decoys and disguising
physical targets, the formation has capabilities to simulate radio and
radar emissions for full-spectrum deception operations. When combined
with constant shifting of forces around the battlefield such as moving
aircraft between airfields and patches of highways, these tools can be
highly effective.

Systems deployed by formations such as the 45th regiment are not capable
of complete deception, especially against higher end space platforms,
but they do not have to be. They are designed to defeat tactical-level
collection platforms such as the microsatellite ISR described earlier.
The problem with national-level collection platforms is that there are
few of them and they are tasked to support national- and strategic-level
targets, not tactical operations. The small number leaves them
vulnerable to enemy antisatellite systems.

[Another technique is to make **all systems** look alike]{.underline}.
The proliferation of standardized containers for international shipping
is making the camouflage of weaponry even easier. Recently, both Russia
and China have introduced antiship missile launchers that are disguised
as containers.30 Northrop Grumman has also investigated this
technology.31 As space-based ISR becomes more resilient and robust, we
can expect all vehicles to start looking the same. The attackers will
have no way of knowing if the observed truck is carrying a deadly
antiship missile or hauling humanitarian supplies to a refugee camp. [By
making all targets look the same, the defender can degrade the effects
of enemy fire power and protect]{.underline} his [**key defense**
systems]{.underline}.

A defender's techniques are not all powerful and will not prevent an
attacker's penetration of the A2/AD zone. Once key U.S. systems are
converged, penetration of the A2/AD zone is possible. [[A strike]{.mark}
package [would consist of]{.mark}]{.underline} EW protection and attack
aircraft to jam radars and incoming missiles, **[[cyber
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to disrupt the enemy
network]{.underline}]{.mark}, and ground- and sea-based long-range fires
to disrupt enemy ADA and airbases, [all [timed to allow]{.mark} strike
[aircraft to **penetrate**]{.mark} the [A2/AD]{.mark} zone]{.underline}.
A defender's deception operations and the survivability of his
formations will degrade the effects that the penetrating strike force
has, while attacking platforms are engaged by state-of-the-art air
defenses. The attacker will penetrate the A2/AD zone and destroy targets
but at much higher cost and increased duration of the conflict.

Conclusion

Attempts to penetrate an A2/AD zone of a near-peer competitor are
possible, but at high cost and over a prolonged conflict. [[By
utilizing]{.underline}]{.mark} space- and aerostat-based
[**[ISR]{.mark}**, [a defender gains a **nearly
indestructible**]{.mark}]{.underline} [early warning
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}. It can protect his ground-based search
radars while maintaining situational awareness. EW reconnaissance
systems and high-power computers can distinguish decoys from real
aircraft. This degrades the attacker's situational awareness because the
defending battery no longer emits until it is ready to engage real
targets. The real defenses are camouflaged, and realistic decoys are set
up to draw fire away from defensive systems. The attacker is then
engaged from unexpected locations by modern air defenses, including
long-range surface-to-air missiles and fixed-wing fighter aircraft.

The defenders will fight in a decentralized manner. Also, a defender's
higher headquarters will allocate ADA and antiship assets and allow them
to fight on their own with direct access to early warning networks. The
higher headquarters will likely retain control of defending air assets
and allocate targets for their own long-range fires, but the bulk of the
fight will be in a decentralized manner. This will make dis-integrating
enemy defenses difficult because C2 centers will not affect the fight to
the degree seen in previous conflicts. Destroying the defender's C2
nodes will degrade but not dis-integrate the defense. Furthermore, the
enemy will likely regenerate damaged C2 nodes, while networked
communications will continue to function unabated due to multiple
connections and non-C2 nodes that carry the same traffic.

Penetration and degradation of an A2/AD zone is possible through
converging key systems across all domains. The real challenge lies in
dis-integration of the A2/AD zone. It is important not to underestimate
the resilience of enemy networks and their ability to reconstitute
damage inflicted by U.S. fire power. At the strategic level, failure to
gain quick victory via dis-integration of A2/AD zones will result in a
war of attrition, a contest that may not be won at a politically
acceptable cost, ending the conflict in a peace settlement favorable to
the adversary. JFQ

**[Solvency\-\--AI]{.underline}**

**The more data the better.**

**Lanoszka 19** \[Alexander Lanoszka, assistant professor of

Security Series, Centre for International and Defence Policy, School of
Policy Studies, Queen's University;

In the more immediate term, however, [[AI would be]{.mark} most [useful
for **early warning**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [especially with respect to
the [monitoring]{.mark} of [social media]{.mark}, [energy flows]{.mark},
[or]{.mark}]{.underline} even [[encrypted
communications]{.underline}]{.mark} between Russia and sources inside
the Baltic countries. Consider how [AI could help **bolster Baltic
defences**]{.underline} in such a way as to defeat, if not [to
prevent,]{.underline} some of the [tactics]{.underline} that [Russia
used against Ukraine]{.underline} in its annexation of Crimea in early
2014. Recall that so-called "little green men" --- military personnel
bearing no insignia or other identifying marks --- suddenly appeared in
Crimea manning checkpoints, clearing areas, and intimidating members of
the local population in the run-up to the independence referendum that
Russia used to lend legitimacy to its effort. The Baltic countries fear
that Russia might attempt something similar against them, not least
because --- especially in the case of Estonia and Latvia --- their
populations contain Russian-speakers who may sympathize with the Kremlin
enough to do its bidding.55 One measure that they have taken is to
practice retaking sites from paramilitary forces of unknown origin.56

[[AI is useful for such situations because the Baltic]{.mark} countries
[have]{.mark} **[home-field advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As such,
[they can **amass data on** certain environments and sites most **at
risk** of being targeted by Russia]{.underline}. [Such data
could]{.underline} thus be used to [understand **regular patterns** of
behaviour]{.underline} of individual contained within those
environments, [thereby offering **earlier detection** and warning in the
event]{.underline} that [something]{.underline} untoward or
[**irregular** is happening]{.underline}. Of course, this technology is
not impervious to countermeasures. Algorithms could be vulnerable to a
battery of malicious queries by adversaries, leading those very
algorithms to make faulty or bad predictions.57

As for 3D printing, the Baltic countries could benefit in at least two
ways. To begin with, observers believe that because they face such a
massive imbalance of power, the Baltic countries should not prepare
their armed forces for fighting set-piece battles with the Russian
military. Instead, they should prepare to wage an insurgency campaign
designed to make themselves difficult to swallow and to occupy.58
Because 3D printing might reduce supply chains, violent organizations
may be able to make their own weapons or weapons parts. 3D printed guns
have so far proven to be unreliable, but as one Deloitte report warns,
3D printing "can help terrorist groups not only acquire new weapons or
capabilities, but also allow them to do so more rapidly and stealthily
than before, across a wider range of locations."59 This can apply
equally to insurgent groups, with such capabilities being homemade
firearms and improvised explosive devices. 3D printers are not
impervious to countermeasures, however. A RAND study cautions that 3D
printers --- if they are connected to the global internet --- can be
susceptible to sabotage if a malicious actor hacks into the system and
encodes a flaw into the designs of a product that would be printed.60
Moreover, if Russia could mass firepower and saturate hostile
environments by using killer robots, then the advantage gained from 3D
printing weapons could be offset. Finally, 3D printing could allow
forward deployed forces --- like the NATO battlegroups stationed on
Baltic territory as part of the alliance's "Enhanced Forward Presence"
--- to buy more time before reinforcements arrive. They can replenish
themselves "on the spot" without relying too much on supply chains and
logistical tails. Such additional time could help if Russian aerial and
naval assets located in Kaliningrad complicate NATO efforts to enter,
and to move within, the theater of operations if war were to erupt.61

Conclusion

Some security analysts argue that the introduction of emerging
technologies on the battlefield will have a transformational impact on
international security. Military robots, AI, and additive manufacturing
(3D printing) could allow non-state or weak actors to level the playing
field with more powerful countries. Yet the preceding discussion
suggests that a more tentative attitude is appropriate. In the
long-term, the impact of these technologies could be dramatic. However,
in the foreseeable future at least, the changes generated by these
technologies will be gradual, if not modest. Their significance for
Baltic regional security will remain limited despite Russian investments
in military robotics and AI. Nevertheless, [AI holds some promise for
the Baltic countries, especially if it enables them to improve their
early warning capabilities so as to thwart "**little green
men**]{.underline}" [scenarios]{.underline}.

This essay offers some policy implications for NATO to consider. First,
[[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, [the **Baltic**]{.mark}
countries, [and]{.mark} their fellow **[allies]{.mark}** [should be
mindful of how]{.mark} these [emerging tech]{.mark}nologies [might
affect]{.mark} **[interop]{.mark}**erability]{.underline}. [If progress
in]{.underline} robotics, [[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}, and 3D printing
[will be more evolutionary than revolutionary, then the development of
these technologies [could produce]{.mark} further **[capability
gaps]{.mark}** [between the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark}
its [NATO]{.mark} allies]{.underline}. [**[Buying American]{.mark}**
[might help prevent a]{.mark} **greater [widening]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
those [gaps]{.mark}]{.underline}, but European countries --- especially
those in the Baltic region --- will need to invest in their own research
and development (R&D) so that they can tailor these technologies to
their own needs.62 Indeed, [capability gaps could develop **between**
the Baltic countries]{.underline}. [Since Estonia may already be ahead
of the curve, Latvia and Lithuania could find themselves lagging too far
behind]{.underline}. [Capability gaps could create gaps in
**coverage**]{.underline} if AI has the potential for enhancing early
warning.

Second, [[because AI draws on deep learning methods]{.mark} to improve
prediction, **[more data]{.mark}** [would allow for a]{.mark} **[more
robust]{.mark}** [understanding]{.mark} of trends and behaviour
patterns]{.underline}. NATO's new Baltic-focused regional command could
provide a clearinghouse of the data drawn from individual allies. Of
course, European allies have already agreed to a Declaration of
Cooperation on AI in order to share information and to foster research
and development links. Yet the regional command can focus on the
peculiarities of the Baltic security economy and exploit economies of
scale. This regional command can offset the risk of stove piping between
the three NATO Centers of Excellence in the Baltic countries. The one in
Riga focuses on strategic communications; the one in Tallinn addresses
cyber security; and the one in Vilnius is dedicated to energy security.
Although these centers of excellence should preserve their
specialisations, they admittedly work on overlapping areas and [AI is
most effective when algorithms crunch the **largest amount** of relevant
data possible]{.underline}. Indeed, [[an]{.mark}other [advantage of
**data sharing**]{.mark} and **aggregation** [is to reduce the
possibility of **bias**]{.mark} [and to improve the **quality**]{.mark}
[of algorithms]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Third, emerging technologies offer no "absolute weapon," since
countermeasures are possible. This could be both good news and bad news.
For example, if Russia leans too heavily on military robotics, then it
would face new problems that manned systems might not have to confront.
Latvia has many forests, but it also has marshes and swamps like the
Teiči State Reserve in its east. This terrain would already be difficult
for military robots to overcome without further intervention. Russian
RPAs might also be vulnerable to man-portable air-defence systems. If
Russia comes to rely on AI for military purposes, then it might be
susceptible to hacking and manipulation. [NATO should]{.underline} also
[heed the]{.underline}se [issues]{.underline}. Hence [the importance
of]{.underline} regional [cooperation]{.underline}: [no one country
should find itself a potential **weak link** that can be
exploited]{.underline}.

Russia's war in [[Ukraine has generated]{.mark} a **new sense of
[urgency]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in providing]{.mark} security
[assistance to Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.

President [Biden]{.underline} recently [announced]{.underline} another
\$33bn request to Congress -- which Democrats hope to raise to nearly
\$**[40bn]{.underline}** --- [to]{.underline} support military,
economic, and humanitarian assistance to [Ukraine]{.underline}, as well
as broader security assistance in Europe. [This funding underpins the US
and NATO's efforts to **reset**]{.underline} [their long-term force
posture to adapt to Europe's new security reality]{.underline}. After 30
years of disarmament, there is much to be done.

As part of this reset, [the US should **dedicate more** security
assistance to the Baltic States]{.underline} -- three strategically
important allies on the frontlines of freedom in Central and Eastern
Europe. All are EU and NATO members and each spends more than the
stipulated 2% of GDP on defense. They are adamant defenders of
democracy, supporting Ukraine and Belarus both politically through
rhetoric, and practically with security aid. Still, they lack core
defense capabilities of their own. This is where the US can help.

US security assistance and cooperation programs are an investment in the
transatlantic community's shared future. They are beneficial for several
reasons.

Such [efforts make the US safer by **empowering allies**]{.underline}
[to do more to defend common interests in Europe]{.underline}. Put
simply, [[the more the US]{.mark} does to [strengthen Baltic
capabilities]{.mark} now, [the stronger our]{.mark} **collective
[deterrent]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[against Russia's]{.mark} **future
[aggression]{.mark}** [will be]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This
reduces]{.mark} the [possibility]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the
US]{.underline} and its allies [will]{.underline} be forced to [fight
[a]{.mark} **broader [war]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}.

They are a force multiplier for other national contributions. For
instance, between 2015 and 2020, every \$1 allocated by the US taxpayer
in Baltic security assistance was matched by \$3.20 from the Baltic
taxpayer. This supported capabilities such as Multi-mission Black Hawk
helicopters, C4 ISR, large caliber ammunition, joint light tactical
vehicles, and air surveillance.

[[Security cooperation]{.mark} also **[enhances
interop]{.mark}**erability]{.underline}. [[Providing]{.mark}
**[standardized systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} (and funds for them)
[[ensures]{.mark} that the [equipment of one ally plugs into]{.mark}
**[everyone else's]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This way, if the US does need
to fight, we can do it effectively and share the burden with allies.

[[The Baltics]{.mark} currently [participate in **several**]{.mark}
[security]{.mark}]{.underline} assistance and [[cooperation
programs]{.underline}]{.mark}, [including the]{.underline} Baltic
Security Initiative (**[BSI]{.underline}**), [which
provided]{.underline} \$**[180 million]{.underline}** [for
2022]{.underline} under the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
Yet, [there are **several ways**]{.underline} such [assistance can be
made **more impactful**]{.underline}.

First, [[more]{.mark} security assistance [resources are required to
provide]{.mark} the Baltics with [capabilities that
are]{.mark}]{.underline} **[practical]{.underline}**,
**[[affordable]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.mark} **[fill key
gaps]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[These include]{.underline}:

- **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**ir and **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**issile
  **[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense systems, which are woefully
  insufficient in the region;

- artillery and ammunition, which have proved critical to Ukraine's
  fight against Russia; and

- **[[ISR]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Intelligence, Surveillance, and
  Reconnaissance) [tools that [enhance]{.mark} **[situational
  awareness]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark}
  **[multi-domain]{.mark}** [threats]{.mark} and help the alliance build
  a **shared threat picture**]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} capability
  priorities [must be]{.mark} **[aligned]{.mark}** [across the US and
  all]{.mark} three [Baltic States]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Second, [[funding for security programs]{.mark} in the Baltics [could be
extended to]{.mark} **[multi-year]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[timelines to
provide]{.mark} more **[predictability]{.mark}** and
**sustainability**]{.underline}. Because many security assistance
resources are assessed and adjusted annually as part of the NDAA, by the
time money is appropriated, the timeline to utilize them each year
shrinks to roughly nine months. This makes it difficult for recipient
countries to deliver meaningful projects and impedes longer-term
planning.

Building on the security assistance efforts already provided to Ukraine,
the US should consider adapting such programs to contain more
predictable multi-year funding. These programs should apply not only to
the Baltic States, but also to other vulnerable countries in the region,
including Georgia and Moldova. The Baltic Defense and Deterrence Act,
introduced in the House and Senate in early 2022 but not yet adopted,
would prove a useful step in this direction. It would codify the current
BSI and create a complementary initiative at the State Department.

ABSTRACT

To what ends do allies employ military exercises? In order to further
our understanding regarding the logic and utility of military drills,
this paper focuses on NATO's eastern flank. Specifically, [with the help
of **newly compiled** data, [we tracked]{.mark} **[two
decades]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of exercises in the Baltic]{.mark}
states]{.underline}. Our analysis speaks to the fact that the size,
tempo, and character of military training events in this region have
manifestly changed. In the early 2000s, military drills were primarily
conceived as a mechanism to modernize Baltic armed forces and ensure
their adequacy to NATO membership standards. [The 2014
**[Crimea]{.mark}** crises]{.underline}, however, dealt a serious blow
to the regional order. This event [[was the]{.underline}]{.mark} primary
[[driver behind a]{.mark} **[considerable spike]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[in]{.mark} the overall [exercise numbers]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the
same time, we observe that it was not only a mere quantitative shift
that transpired. From parachute drops into remote areas, rehearsals of
river crossings to moving of combat power via narrow land corridors, the
staging of military exercises after 2014 were overhauled into events
that accentuated NATO's reinforcement capabilities. In this context,
[military [exercises can be seen as a]{.mark} **[crucial
element]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} **[credibly signal
capacity]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[resolve]{.mark}** within the concept
of deterrence]{.underline} by reinforcement.

Introduction

Military [[exercises]{.mark} can [serve a **number of
purposes**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[ranging from]{.mark} tests of
**[interop]{.mark}**erability and **readiness**]{.underline}
[[to]{.mark} **geopolitical [signalling]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[States]{.underline}]{.mark} can use such costly signals to reveal
their military power and to [send signals of resolve]{.underline} to use
it [with the intent to [deter]{.mark} potential [aggressors but
also]{.mark} to [reassure alliance partners]{.mark}]{.underline} of
their support. Depending on the geopolitical climate and the perception
of threat these signals can be more or less pronounced and their logic
can prioritize one purpose over another. In times of relatively
harmonious regional cooperation military exercises presumably follow
predominantly more peaceful aims such as testing interoperability and
building further trust, whereas more conflictual times with high mutual
distrust and threat perceptions lend themselves to geopolitical
signalling and a deterrent logic while continuing to practice and
develop interoperability.

In the past years, [military exercises have **regained their salience**
as essential tools of statecraft]{.underline}. [Nowhere has this been
**more pronounced** than in the **B**altic **S**ea **r**egion,
where]{.underline} both [NATO]{.underline} and Russia [have organized
their **largest training events** since the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}. In order to further our understanding regarding the
logic and utility of military manoeuvres, this paper focuses on NATO's
eastern flank. Specifically, with the help of newly compiled data, we
have been able to track two decades of allied military drills in the
Baltic states, evaluating their objectives, involved scenarios and
messaging efforts that surround them. The peculiar positioning of
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- sitting on a geopolitical fault line,
provides us with an ideal opportunity to gain deeper insights into the
value of allied military exercises.

Our analysis reveals how at different time periods exercises have been
employed to support various political and military objectives. Mirroring
the changing security landscape, the size, complexity, and logic that
underpins such exercises have shifted considerably. In the early 2000s,
[military [drills]{.mark} were primarily conceived as a mechanism to
**[modernize]{.mark}** [Baltic armed forces]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[ensure their **adequacy**]{.mark} [to NATO]{.mark} membership
[standards]{.mark}]{.underline} and prepare personnel for out-of-area
operations in the Middle East and Balkans. For a brief period of time,
maritime exercises in the Baltic Sea further served as a rare venue for
engaging the Russian senior military leadership. A deteriorating
regional security environment, however, elevated military drills on
whole another level of importance. Russia's forceful takeover of
territory from its neighbour Ukraine in 2014 was a critical juncture
that instantly prompted a change in perceptions about Moscow's
intentions. As a result, the number of military training events across
the Baltic republics spiked. At the same time, we observe that it was
not only a mere quantitative change that transpired. Upon closer
inspection of individual exercises in the Baltics, we identify a clear
paradigm shift as to their overall mode of function.

Whereas previously exercises primarily served the purpose of preparing
Baltic armed forces for far-flung combat areas, the bulk of military
exercises in the post-Crimea era "turned inward." Having studied the
lessons of Ukraine, scenario scripts were flipped over and directed
towards the defence of Baltic cities, roads, airfields, and seashores.
Allied exercises in the Baltics essentially became an interlocking
element between already pre-positioned, but very limited multinational
troop deployments in the region, and much larger follow-on forces. In
this context, [the purpose to practice and enhance interoperability and
testing new equipment became a **central aim** of military trainings
given [the]{.mark} increasingly **[multinational]{.mark}** [character of
NATO presence]{.mark} and reinforcement]{.underline}. [From the vantage
point of NATO, military manoeuvres on the alliance's eastern flank
[formed a]{.mark} **[critical facet]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the overall
[deterrence]{.mark} posture]{.underline} as they aimed to convey that,
despite Russian advantages in force ratios and geography, the alliance
would be able to move fast in a crises situation in support of its
treaty allies. Stated differently, by organizing exercises on the basis
of swift movement of forces, NATO aimed to establish deterrence by
reinforcement.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The first section briefly
surveys theoretical underpinnings of why states exercise. Subsequently,
the paper lays out the curious geopolitical context in which the Baltic
states find themselves and the impact that this may have had on NATO's
adopted deterrence posture and implemented exercises. Following that, we
present our research design, data gathering methods, and used sources.
With the help of our data collection, the paper then proceeds to outline
the general patterns of military drills across the Baltics. Next, the
analysis offers a more granular assessment of selected military
exercises: Baltops, Saber Strike, and Spring Storm. This allows us to
make the case that a substantial shift has taken place not only in terms
of overall exercise numbers in the region but also concerning their
underlying objectives. The article concludes with a summary of the key
findings and identification of possible avenues for future research.

Why states exercise?

Current scholarly literature offers multiple explanations for why actors
conduct individual and allied military drills. To begin with, military
manoeuvres figure prominently in classical works of deterrence, which
can be defined as "the use of a threat by one party in an attempt to
convince another party to refrain from some action" (Quackenbush 2015,
2). In order to deter an opponent, an actor must be in possession of
certain military capabilities. [[Hard power]{.mark}
**[alone]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, [[does not
deter]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Physical capability **must be combined**
with credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}, which in Morgan's (2003, 15)
terms is "the quality of being believed." Simply stated, [an opponent
must believe that the defender will **follow through** on its announced
threats to use force]{.underline} in order to protect its interests in
question. Signals about foreign policy interests and the willingness to
use force are more credible if costs are attached (Fearon 1997).
Financially quite costly military exercises can credibly communicate a
resolve to employ force. [Joint exercises can be considered as one of
the **foundational elements** for reinforcing credibility behind mutual
defence commitments]{.underline} (Bernhardt and Sukin 2021, 859).

Military [[drills can be]{.mark} **particularly salient** in instances
of **extended** deterrence]{.underline}, a type of deterrence that
involves more than two parties. In the academic literature, extended
deterrence is viewed as "inherently less credible than direct
deterrence" (Davis et al. 2019, 6). This is due to the fact that allied
partners are often located "thousands of miles away and often much
closer to the territory of the aggressor state" (Mazarr 2018, 2). As
Stephen Walt (2021) posits, attempting to deter attacks on one's own
soil is by definition more credible, whereas extended deterrence is a
more demanding task. In this context, regular military training events
with a partner government may be utilized in order to convey a message
to the opponent about one's willingness to sacrifice own soldiers in
order to defend an ally under a military threat. In particular, if
allies are far away, military exercises can also be used to signal the
logistical capabilities to deploy troops quickly over large distances.
In their study of various signalling devices that major powers can use
to assure support to a protégé, McManus and Nieman (2019) identified
joint military exercises as the most important signals of support.
[Military [exercises factored **before**]{.mark} [other signal
types]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[such as]{.underline}]{.mark} arms
transfers and **[[troop deployment]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The purpose of military exercises, however, goes beyond mere deterrence
and assurance efforts and has been linked to other strategic goals.
According to Wolfley (2021), governments can also initiate joint
military exercises as a means to recruit partners to join multinational
war-fighting coalitions. To illustrate this with a concrete example,
NATO's Partnership for Peace program served to intensify bilateral links
between individual nations and NATO while equally preparing them for
potential peacekeeping missions in the Balkans and the Middle East (p.
6). In addition, the undertaking of military exercises can be used as a
trust and confidence-building measure among rival powers. Training side
by side, proponents claim, holds the promise of lessening uncertainty
about each other's capabilities and intentions, thus helping to steer
clear of the classic security dilemma scenario (Chau 2011, 57).

[Multinational exercises can also be instrumental in honing **allied
interop**erability, **mutual understanding**, and
**communication**]{.underline}. Here, it is worth stressing that [even
states that belong to the same military organization tend to have
**distinct** command styles, doctrine, and equipment]{.underline}. [[One
important]{.mark} **institutional [asset]{.mark}** [of NATO is its
multinational **integrated**]{.mark} **military [command]{.mark}** [and
the interop]{.mark}erability of its member states' national
militaries]{.underline}. Over the years [[**regularly recurring**
exercises]{.underline}]{.mark} helped to [[build up]{.underline}]{.mark}
not only specific assets against a Soviet threat but more [general
[assets for]{.mark} **decision-making** and **[planning]{.mark}** with
procedures and structures]{.underline} that could serve other types of
missions [[adding to NATO's]{.mark}
**[persistence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
**[adaptability]{.mark}**]{.underline} to changing security environments
(Wallander 2000). [[Refining interop]{.mark}erability]{.underline},
however, [[is an **ongoing process**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This is
**particularly**]{.underline}]{.mark} the case [[due to NATO's
absorption of **new member states**]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
20**[04]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Some of the previous [NATO deployments]{.underline} involving troops
from multiple countries [have brought to the fore issues]{.underline}
[of incompatible military equipment, lack of adequate English-language
proficiency and cultural complexities]{.underline} (Tresch and Coops
2007). [To alleviate such problems, regular exercises may serve as means
for integrating otherwise diverse military compositions]{.underline}. In
addition, [multinational exercises are credited for having certain
socialization effects whereby common military drills help actors to
identify mutual threats and share processes of how to address
them]{.underline} (Frazier Derrick and Hutto 2017, 380).

On the other side of the spectrum, military exercises can also serve as
a cover for an invasion. Historically, countries have frequently
employed exercises as a disguise for a surprise attack on the enemy
(Betts 1982). In this context, it is useful to recall that in 2014
Russia first utilized snap exercises in order to move its forces near
Ukraine's border, part of which eventually were deployed for the actual
invasion of Crimea (Kofman 2017, 24). A similar scenario played out in
February of 2022 with Russia initiating large and protracted military
exercises in Belarus and on the borders of Ukraine. Eventually, the
Russian forces that were supposedly on a training mission then switched
to attempts to take over and occupy large parts of Ukraine. If perceived
as threatening, military exercises can also provoke a reciprocal signal
of resolve by the adversary, especially if the exercise is large and
takes place in proximity (Bernhardt and Sukin 2021). The potential for
conflict escalation, however, is smaller if the manoeuvres are conducted
within an alliance (Kuo and Blankenship 2021).

The size, location, and frequency of the exercises vary considerably.
Training may be carried out in domains such as land, sea, air, cyber,
and space. Such events may be open to international monitors or take
place behind the veil of secrecy. Moreover, it must be stressed that
military exercises are not cheap to organize and execute. Even the
preparation stage, Lasconjarias (2020) submits, can be a time and
resource-demanding event. In sum, military exercises fulfil multiple
functions and can be applied to buttress numerous political and
strategic objectives. The aims and priorities of military exercises can
change over time depending on shifts in the geopolitical order. They can
serve the purpose of sharpening interoperability among alliance partners
or be used as confidence and trust-building mechanisms among opponents.
By the same token, however, exercises can be utilized as a measure of
deterrence or coercion.

In this article, we propose that NATO military exercises in the Baltics,
while characterized by continuity in their endeavour to practise
interoperability, at the same time underwent major changes in their
aims. Mirroring the changing geopolitical conditions, they have evolved
through two distinct phases. Initially (2000--2014) they supported the
goals of modernizing Baltic armed forces and preparing personnel for
foreign missions. After 2014, however, allied exercises morphed into a
critical tool for making deterrence credible. In particular, they served
as a mechanism to demonstrate the alliance's capability to quickly
reinforce its enhanced Forward Presence units.

Exercises and deterrence by reinforcement in the Baltics

In this study, we have chosen to scrutinize military exercises in the
three Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Why focus on this
specific geostrategic area? We posit that this space, due to its
proximity between rival actors, lends us an opportunity to gain
important insights into the value and utility of allied military
exercises. To put it at its simplest, the structural conditions present
in the Baltic Sea region make this area an intriguing object for an
academic inquiry. After all, this is where the Western security
architecture (NATO) and the Russian Federation psychically meet each
other.

The outer edge of NATO and the Russian western border has long been
marked by analysts as a geopolitical fault line. Both Baltic and Russian
authorities have regularly expressed their discomfort of being in close
physical proximity to each other. In this context, scholars like Ralph
Clem (2018) have advanced the argument that by ratcheting up the number
and size of military exercises, both NATO and Russia are risking greater
geopolitical instability. This notion, however, has been countered by
the work of Kuo and Blankenship (2021) who suggest that
[[exercises]{.mark} that are [conducted within]{.mark} military
[alliances **do not** create]{.mark}]{.underline} the type of
[[escalatory dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark} that critics have warned
about.

As NATO's easternmost members, [the Baltics share considerable borders
with]{.underline} what they perceived to be [a threatening revanchist
power]{.underline}. These countries are almost completely cut off from
their NATO peers. [Only Lithuania shares a thin stretch of
land]{.underline}, commonly referred to as [the **Suwalki
gap**]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} fellow alliance member
[Poland]{.underline}. In the view of Riho Terras, a former Estonian
Chief of Defense Forces, [the Baltics are]{.underline} "**[like an
island]{.underline}**" [due to]{.underline} the fact that the gap
between pro-Moscow [Belarus and]{.underline} the Russian enclave
[Kaliningrad]{.underline} is negligible (cited in Jones 2016).
[Kaliningrad itself poses a significant challenge as it gives the
Russian side an additional platform for power projection]{.underline}
into the Baltics (Nieto 2011).

[[Being **sparsely populated**]{.mark}, [the Baltic]{.mark} republics
[are not in a position to mount a defence]{.mark} purely [by own
means]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, in strategic matters, [[they are
**heavily reliant**]{.underline}]{.mark} [up[on]{.mark}
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} partner [governments' promise to protect
them]{.underline}. In this context, academic scholarship abounds with
references to the Baltics as the alliance's most exposed link. Sceptics
have even implied that territories located in Europe's deep corner are
outright indefensible militarily. In the view of Barry Posen (2021), the
defence of the Baltics is not a practical matter due to their
unfavourable geography. In its immediate neighbourhood, the Russian
Federation is by far superior in terms of conventional military force as
well as holding an advantage in the geographic set-up (Veebel 2018; IISS
2021). What is more, Russian military capabilities are considered to be
most formidable and advanced in its Western Military District. Certain
war-gaming simulations have concluded that Russia, in a hypothetical
scenario, could overwhelm and overrun the Baltics in a matter of few
days (Shlapak and Johnson 2016).

In hindsight, with the Russian armed forces struggling tremendously in
achieving their war aims in Ukraine despite outnumbering their opponent
by a significant margin, analysts have been forced to rethink their
baseline assumptions about the "defensibility" of the Baltic states. As
put by one of the lead Russian military experts Michael Kofman, the
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} war [has [proved]{.mark} that the
[Russia]{.mark}n military [is not]{.mark} exactly "[twelve feet
tall]{.mark}]{.underline}." [That]{.underline}, Kofman advises, however,
[**[should not]{.mark}** [lead us to the]{.mark} **[other
extreme]{.mark}** [where]{.mark}by [we assume that it is]{.mark} "[four
feet tall]{.mark}]{.underline}" [[and incapable of]{.mark} operational
[success in a **different setting**]{.mark}]{.underline} (cited in
Chotiner 2022). [One ought to bear in mind that [by]{.mark} their
**territorial [size]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} **[population]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} the number of **active-duty [troops]{.mark}**, [the
Baltic]{.mark} states [and Ukraine are]{.mark} in **[entirely
different]{.mark}** [categories]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Tellingly, Baltic officials themselves have also talked about being
entrapped in an "uncomfortable geography" (Larter 2019). In the words of
former Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs, "while NATO collectively is
far superior to Russia \[...\] there is one corner where Russia enjoys
local advantage and that's the Baltic Sea region" (Mikser 2018). During
relatively harmonious geopolitical climate, Baltic geographic
disadvantages as well as Russia's upper hand in local conventional force
ratios, have largely been a non-issue. In the immediate aftermath of the
Ukraine crises, however, as the Baltic region became a focal point of
tension between Russia and NATO, geographic considerations, in
Mattelaer's (2018, 346) telling, "returned with a vengeance." Similarly,
Studemeyer (2019, 789) points out that while the Baltic "geographic
position on NATO's eastern periphery was of little concern in a
post-9/11 world," the annexation of Crimea visibly changed the
importance that was accorded to NATO's eastern flank.

The Baltic strategic predicament created a considerable dilemma for
NATO. On the one hand, the alliance was unwilling to recreate a Cold
War-type of deterrent with massive troop numbers facing each other. On
the other hand, the deteriorating security landscape called for a
credible deterrence posture on its eastern flank. The solution, at least
in part, was found in regular allied military exercises. To begin with,
as part of NATO's effort to bolster its presence in the East, allied
governments in 2016 agreed to implement the enhanced Forward Presence
model -- an innovative force structure consisting of a diverse group of
nations. While a historical milestone for the alliance, the deployment
of roughly 5500 NATO troops in the Baltics and Poland did not, however,
appreciably alter the balance of power in the region. In itself,
forward-based tripwire forces across the Baltics are clearly not in a
position to deny Russia its military objectives.

[[By **any measure**]{.mark}, [Moscow]{.mark} still [retains]{.mark}
**[notable]{.mark} quantitative** and **qualitative** [superiority in
the region]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather, the task of these limited
forward-based units in a hypothetical Russian advance scenario would be
to buy time and delay its advance until the arrival of larger NATO
forces (Lanoszka and Hunzeker 2016). As elaborated by the Estonian
Defence Minister, the enhanced Forward Presence model should be viewed
only as "one piece of the puzzle," that is connected to the
"reinforcement strategy, the goal of which is to ensure the rapid
arrival of allied forces in the Baltic states" (Estonian Ministry of
Defence 2018). In such a set-up, we suspect that regular military
exercises after 2014 more distinctly contain core elements that signal
the alliance's capacity for swift movement of forces and reinforcement.
Such [exercises can]{.underline} thus [be considered an **anchor point**
for making deterrence credible]{.underline}.

Baltic exercises over time

In order to capture the key patterns regarding exercises, we collected
empirical data covering military drills in the Baltic states between the
years 2000--2019. This time period includes the years before the Baltic
states' NATO accession and ends before 2020 when major exercises were
cancelled or notably limited due to the Covid pandemic. As it pertains
to data collection on military exercises, one has to acknowledge that it
is fraught with challenges. The only available global data collection on
joint military exercises (D'Orazio 2013) that we are aware of ends in
2010. In a comparison of Russian and NATO military manoeuvres
(2015--17), a group of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung journalists relied
mostly on press releases to assemble a systematic overview. In doing so,
the lead author (Hemicker 2017) points out that because there are no
readily available overviews of such exercises, the "data must be
assembled from hundreds of pieces like a mosaic."

Here, we followed a similar approach by marshalling empirical evidence
from the following publicly available sources: Baltic News Service
(BNS), annual NATO reports on allied exercises and the official website
of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. We relied on an automated keyword search
("military exercises" and "military manoeuvres") in LexisNexis for the
Baltic News Service, the region's leading news wire, to identify
relevant articles which we then screened manually to identify the
ongoing manoeuvres. Our data collection encompasses 72 military
exercises that took place in the Baltics at land, sea and/or air. This
includes exercises that are repeated annually as well as exercises that
are nonrecurring. A list of the identified exercises can be found in the
online appendix.

We have counted only those military exercises that are multinational in
nature. That is to say that at a minimum two NATO members had to be
involved in the military drill for it to be included in our analysis. As
part of the data gathering process, we sought to establish the name of
the exercise, location, size, participating countries as well as
estimated troop numbers. For our research purposes, we counted only
those events that involved at least 1000 participants. Following the
example set by Castillo (2016), we chose this particular cut-off point
due to the fact that an exercise of this magnitude would likely be
reported in the press.

To get a better handle of the role that military exercises play in the
region, [we further fused quantitative data with in-depth qualitative
analysis]{.underline}. To that end, [[we have scrutinized]{.mark}
**[public statements]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[strategic
documents]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} **[NATO]{.mark}**, **[Russia]{.mark}**,
[and the]{.mark} **[Baltic]{.mark}** states]{.underline}. Consequently,
we have been able to better assess the driving logic behind military
exercises in the Baltics. [[Our]{.mark} presented [findings]{.mark}
serve to [fill a]{.mark} **[notable void]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark}
academic [scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}. While a number of scholars
and policy analysts (Brzezinski and Varangis 2016; Norberg 2018; Ploom
et al. 2020) have made important strides in exploring the topic of
military exercises in the Baltic Sea region, such studies have focused
either on a selection of individual large exercises, or they have
covered a maximum of 8 years of exercises in the region.

[To date, **[no systematic analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[has]{.mark}
yet [been presented that thoroughly maps]{.mark} and assesses **two
decades** of [exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Without]{.mark}
**systematic [data]{.mark}** collection and **in-depth** analysis, [we
risk]{.mark} drawing conclusions that suffer from **[selection
bias]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Relying on]{.mark} very [few
exercises]{.mark} or a short time [can be
**misleading**]{.mark}]{.underline} indicating a shift in patterns where
there might only be an outlier. Our contribution is to investigate how
military exercises in the region evolved over time and whether key
international events had a large and enduring impact in the pattern of
joint trainings. [By grounding our analysis in a longer time period, we
are able to develop a **richer understanding**]{.underline} [of the role
that military drills have played in the Baltic Sea region]{.underline}
and how they have changed over time. Moreover, our contribution goes
beyond capturing the size and frequency of exercises. We furthermore
assess the character and scripts of military exercises and thus add more
detail, again in particular with a focus on how they changed over time.

In the first step, we present some descriptive patterns of the military
exercises in our data collection. Graph 1 reveals that military
exercises in the Baltics took a different course after the annexation of
Crimea We can see a clear spike in the frequency and size of military
exercises. Graph 1a provides us with an overview of the number of joint
military manoeuvres that were performed in the Baltics per year. Up
until 2012 we observe typically one or two military exercises per year,
with a certain increase after 2010 to three and even four exercises per
year in 2013. In 2014, the number of joint exercises that took place in
the Baltics doubled to eight and remained high until 2019.

**[\[GRAPH 1 EXCLUDED\]]{.underline}**

Military exercises did not only take place more frequently after 2014,
they also increased in size. Graph 1b portrays the average size of a
military exercise in terms of participating troops on a monthly basis.
Until 2014, military drills were held on a rather regular basis usually
in May or June. The average size of a manoeuvre in the early years of
our period of study was about 3,000 (2,927) ranging from 1,000 (the
minimum size to be included in our data collection) to 6,000
participating soldiers in the Steadfast Jazz exercise in October 2013.
After the annexation of Crimea, military exercises took place with far
greater frequency, spread over more months in a year and also increased
in size to an average of almost 5,000 (4,798) troops. The largest
exercise in our data collection with 18,000 troops is Saber Strike 2018.

In the early 2000s, military exercises in the Baltic states primarily
served the purpose of preparing these nations to meet the alliance's
technical standards as well as readying them for missions in the
Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq. State officials regularly framed
exercises with allies as opportunities to modernize forces and acquire
new skill-sets. Commenting on a multinational exercise Baltic Eagle
2000, Estonian President Lennart Meri stressed that these types of
activities help the nation to gain "sound and intelligent administrative
experience and modern military training" (Meri 2000). After the Baltic
states' NATO accession in 2004, our data does not reveal much change in
the pattern of exercises. In 2005, the Lithuanian Ministry of Defence
emphasized that the guiding objective of exercising with partner
governments has been to "to develop interoperability among NATO and PfP
forces and to improve multinational unit command and control in NATO-led
Peace Support Operations" (Lithuanian Ministry of National Defence
2005).

The Baltic states were highly concerned with the developments in Georgia
in 2008. Relations between Russia and NATO became increasingly strained.
NATO reacted to the Russian military invasion in Georgia by suspending
military and political cooperation; in turn, Russia suspended its
participation in military exercises and other cooperation but continued
logistical support for NATO's Afghanistan mission (Forsberg and Herd
2015). In the graphs above, the Georgian-Russian war did not leave a
pronounced mark on the number and size of military exercises conducted
in the Baltic states. The number and size of manoeuvres remained
relatively stable with a slight increase after 2009. Russia did not
participate in the Baltops exercise in 2009 but already joined again in
the military training exercise a year later.

[The Ukraine crises was a **clear turning point**]{.underline} in
NATO-Russia relations. All cooperation was put to an enduring halt. No
joint exercises with Russia have been held since. Instead, [NATO
**increased** its military presence in the Baltic states and
beyond]{.underline}. [This includes the military exercises in the
Baltics]{.underline} as reflected in the graphs. Already in 2014, NATO
officials vowed to "establish an enhanced exercise programme with a
focus on exercising collective defence" (NATO 2014). Concurrently, [[the
alliance's **predominant power**]{.mark}, [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, [[pledged]{.mark} to increase the number
of **[multilateral exercises]{.mark}** [in the Baltic]{.mark}
region]{.underline} (White House 2014). The presented analysis attests
that [these promises were translated into **tangible
action**]{.underline}. NATO, as part of its deterrence posture, put a
premium on sharpening the ability to move allied troops and equipment
across Europe. To that end, [military exercises stressed
**readiness**]{.underline}, [**speed** of movement]{.underline}, [and
**compatibility**]{.underline}.

From parachute drops into remote areas, rehearsals of river crossings to
moving of combat power via narrow land corridors, the staging of
military exercises after 2014 were overhauled into events that, first
and foremost, accentuated the alliance's swift reinforcement
capabilities. By probing the character of allied military drills, we
find that exercises were scripted and implemented in a manner to convey
the message that the alliance can act on short notice and that even the
most exposed members on its frontier will be defended. As explained by
the former NATO assistant secretary-general, the task at hand for the
alliance was to demonstrate that it is in a position to move "forces
where they are needed and to move them quickly. And send a signal to a
potential adversary that NATO will be ready to defend" (Brauss 2021).
Simply put, by directing its attention toward rehearsing a quick
response to a potential crisis in the Baltics, NATO used exercises as a
means for establishing deterrence by reinforcement.

[Beyond communicating that the alliance can **rapidly
move**]{.underline} military fighting power [into]{.underline} and
within [the Baltic]{.underline} operational area, [military [drills
have]{.mark} also [been **instrumental**]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
**[sharpening interop]{.mark}**erability]{.underline} among
**[[multinational deployments]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region.
Shortly after the setting up of the enhanced Forward Presence model in
2017, these forces were incorporated into various NATO training schemes,
primarily to ensure that multinational battalions [are able to [function
together as **cohesive units**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[under the]{.mark}
common **[alliance's flag]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, we find that
[[allied exercises]{.mark} in the Baltics have also [served as]{.mark}
**[important feedback]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[channels for]{.mark}
lawmakers and [military planners]{.mark}]{.underline}. [While
large-scale [exercises]{.mark}]{.underline} clearly [[had]{.mark} a
performative dimension]{.underline} to them -- an audience for which
they were played out, [there was also [a **very practical**]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [**educational** side]{.mark}]{.underline} to the regular
movement of military equipment and personnel across the European
continent. [[Exercises served as a **testing device**]{.mark} [for
identifying]{.mark} one's own **[deficiencies]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[thus [laying the **groundwork**]{.mark} [for what needs to be
**rebuilt**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the physical infrastructure.

On the other hand, what one must also see, especially [when looking
[through the eyes of the Baltic]{.mark} leaders,]{.underline} [[the
**major player** in NATO is the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} For the U.S.,
[[the possibility of not **stepping forward**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
retaliating for a violation of sovereignty of NATO members [[would be an
**existential issue**]{.underline}]{.mark}. From this perspective, there
appears to be certain minimum levels of coherence. At large, i.e. about
NATO in general, this is reflected in joint statements and actions.
However, [[the **core minimum** cohesion of NATO can]{.mark} still be
seen to [depend on how the U.S. interprets the
situation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Would the U.S.]{.mark} be willing to
and capable of [protect]{.mark}ing [its allies]{.mark}, [even the
**smallest ones**]{.mark}]{.underline}? In this context, clearly the
main strategy of the Baltics is to fully meet the requirements set by
the U.S. and to seek for a special relationship with the U.S.

2.2.2 Growing into a green-tech giant. The ecological footprint clear-up

In 2050 green is the new black. Today, in 2050, [[the **B**]{.mark}altic
**[S]{.mark}**ea **[R]{.mark}**egion [is a]{.mark} **[global
giant]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} **[green-tech]{.mark}**, [where
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}, growth [[and green tech]{.mark}nology
[are]{.mark} in [the **epicentre**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} work and everyday
[life]{.mark}]{.underline}. Building on its innovation leader profile of
the 2010s (European Commission, 2019b), places in the Baltic Sea Region
continue being a worldwide player in innovation, research and green
technology, attracting businesses and business angels to invest in the
region. [Already between 2012 and 2017, the **[v]{.mark}**enture
**[c]{.mark}**apital funding [to start-ups with]{.mark} an
**[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence [specialisation
grew]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}at a global level [[by a **compound
annual growth**]{.mark} [rate of]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[85%]{.underline}**]{.mark}, while [it more than
**tripled**]{.underline} [between 2016 and 2017 elevating this
technology to a **priority** for private investors]{.underline}
(European Political Strategy Centre, 2018). This went hand in hand with
the 4th industrial revolution and the latest technological advancements,
which has shaken the technological progress over the last 30 years.
Industrial evolution has been a continuous process in the history of
modern humanity. The advancement of technology and innovations have
revolutionised the industry and the 4th industrial revolution or
industry 4 is now a reality in most aspects of life. Industry 4
incorporates a set of different technological advancements that
influence manufacturing, services and everyday life of citizens through
a fusion of technologies blurring the lines between physical, digital
and biological systems (ESPON, 2019c). The term encompasses the
technological [[trends of **cyber-physical**]{.mark} systems,
**[I]{.mark}**nternet **[o]{.mark}**f **[T]{.mark}**hings, **[cloud
computing]{.mark}**, **[cognitive computing]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence]{.underline} (European
Parliament, 2016) [[with **robotics**]{.mark}, autonomous automobile
systems, **[additive manufacturing]{.mark}** [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
not only **[[well established]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but also shape the
production and consumption patterns. With growth and competitiveness
being a primary goal for governments and industries, production is
reaching a peak. [**[Global relations]{.mark}** [are boosted]{.mark} so
[as to consolidate the]{.mark} **[B]{.mark}**altic **[S]{.mark}**ea
**[R]{.mark}**egion [as a]{.mark} **[worldwide tech giant]{.mark}**
region]{.underline}. [[Advanced green tech]{.mark}nology and innovation
turn production]{.underline} '**[greener']{.underline}** [and limit
environmental problems]{.underline}. Due to this, people tend to consume
more, resulting in a guilt-free apogee of consumerism.

[**[Cool]{.mark}ing [down]{.mark}** the global
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Climate change was]{.underline}
according to a 2017 Eurobarometer report [a **serious concern** for the
Europeans]{.underline} (European Commission, 2018). Europe had faced a
sequence of extreme weather events, ranging from heat waves and droughts
to floods and typhoons, with the temperatures above the Arctic Circle
increasing. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in
2018 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2018b) that global
warming of +1.5°C would have severe consequences on the sea level rise
and ecosystems in the world. Such [developments have rung the caution
bell to adopt stricter climate change mitigation policies]{.underline},
and the European Union put forward a strategy to achieve a
climate-neutral net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. [In 2050 Europe is a
global climate change actions **leader** having reached the
goals]{.underline} of the 2018 vision [to achieve a net-zero greenhouse
gas emissions]{.underline} (based on European Commission, 2018). [The
**B**altic **S**ea **R**egion became a **pioneer** of this transition,
given its **strong innovation** background, which has developed and
implemented green technology to address environmental
issues]{.underline}. This has been largely supported by both governments
and industries, which have seen green innovation and technology as both
a means for growth and profit and a panacea for improving the
environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea Region and meeting the
European and global climate requirements and policies.

• Who is afraid of industry 4.0? In 2050 the 4th industrial revolution
is embedded in everyday life in the BSR, where the lines between
physical, digital and biological systems are blurred through a fusion of
technologies. Cloud computing has revolutionised IT platforms and
services, with companies using enterprise or public clouds not only
because it is more cost-efficient (European Strategy and Policy Analysis
System, 2015) but also for easier data storage and mining, as well as
for cryptocurrency exchanges, as the latter functions as the new
monetary system. At the same time, AI has brought the biggest changes in
the production and economy (e.g. machine learning, text and speech
recognition, tailored news and web surfing suggestions). The use of AI
has a strong impact on production and consumption. Algorithms can
predict what people want to shop, what to watch or read and production
and services are tailored according to these needs. Robotics and AI have
replaced most of the repetitive production jobs in the BSR, which
already from the 2020s had a high risk (of about 70%) of automation
(ESPON, 2019a).

• [[Becoming the]{.mark} **[Baltic eco-silicon
valley]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Given the commitment of the BSR to
achieve by **2050** a **zeroemissions** policy]{.underline}, [this
**advanced tech**nology has been used and implemented in 'greening' the
economy]{.underline}. [The use of '[Greentech']{.mark}]{.underline} in
the BSR [has [decreased pollution to the]{.mark}
**[minimum]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[reaching]{.mark} the goal of the
**[zeroemissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [with a **positive impact** on
the overall environmental condition of the air and sea of the
region]{.underline}. Green technology has been applied both at the
production business models, but also in the energy, transport, farming
and resource efficiency sectors. This has increased competition of the
industries and companies which wish to satisfy their customers and at
the same time increase their profits. Such high competition and
practices have also increased the greenwashing phenomena in the region,
where companies were deceptively marketing their products as
environmentally friendly, overall, the implementation of advanced
technology in the different production sectors has allowed an almost
zero CO2 emissions, resulting in a more massive production and growth.

• Businesses go green and make money. In response to the citizens'
demands and in anticipation of stricter regulations, businesses
accelerated their innovation developments for low carbon transition.
Business activities range from investing to renewable energies to
cutting their own GHG emissions, by adopting new technologies,
increasing their operations resilience and contribute to the market of
environmental goods (Bartlett et al., 2016a). This move did not only
minimise costs, increased the profits and economic growth of businesses
[in the BSR]{.underline}6 , but also improved the reputation of the
[companies]{.underline}, as they [contribute to **better health** and
**environment**]{.underline}, increasing their consumers\' loyalty.
Nevertheless, phenomena of misusing eco-labels, or scandals around
reporting low carbon emissions happen and are hardly traceable.

• New jobs created, new forms awaited. The rise of the AI is not only
linked to technological unemployment. Instead, it has been a motor for
generating new jobs, adjusting in the new model. Studies from the late
2010s anticipated that new technologies are not only replacing some
existing jobs, but also increase them or creating the need for new ones.
At the same time, the increase use of technology and online connections
also create new forms of employment, where people work rather from
distance, in home offices without necessarily being present in an office
space. In addition, people may have more quality jobs, allowing them to
have time on more important and personally fulfilling tasks (European
Commission, 2019a) or engage in voluntary work. To cope with the
changes, companies need to be ready for continuous innovations and to
adjust. Given the high automation of jobs, the production is also more
efficient, more accessible and in full speed, having an impact, first
and foremost on the consumer.

• Tailor-made design: a personalised production. AI and wide use of
algorithms shape the design of products, which are specially designed
according to the needs of people, based on a thorough big data
collection and analysis by the companies. This means that every product
purchased is tailored to the customer. Already from the late 2010s,
surveillance in stores, such as Bluetooth beacons, could track from the
location of the customers in the store, which products they prefer, the
path they follow in a store, so as to later send targeted advertisements
or organise the branding of the shop (Kwet, 2019). Further to this, AI
can develop the customers\' identity, analyse the purchase history and
suggest items that interest the customer, matching his own preferences.
Nevertheless, it is not only industries that can offer tailor-made
design, but 3D printing also is available in most houses, enabling
people printing from clothing, to daily products to office material just
at home and recycle them or throw them away when they are not needed
anymore.

• E-commerce versus brick-and-mortar. Online shopping is now more
accessible, faster and reliable, as products can be tailored to the
needs of people, AI can remember previous purchases and provide
suggestions that match with the style of the people. This has a
consequence in the rather more traditional shops, the brick-and-mortar
shops which start losing ground in the BSR. Few that remain are rather
the commerce environment. People do their shopping through online
services, which are also more tailored to their preferences, from their
nutritious needs and allergies to being tailored to their size and
preferences. Smaller shops and local productions are gradually
disappearing, making local shopping identities harder though creating a
more universal consumption profile.

• How do we react? Social inequalities have been a consequence of this
transition, especially between skilled personnel who are able to be
employed in niche jobs and those which due to the full automation of
manufacturing works are unemployed. The state has been responsive, and
after several experimental trials, trying already in the 2010s in
Finland has developed and issued a universal basic income for all
citizens. This universal basic income is generated by the profit gained
through the job automation and the taxes imposed globally exposed
industries. Especially people fully relying on the universal basic
income may invest their free time to social activities or new innovation
and patent ideas, given that the civil society and democracy in this
scenario is high. Also ageing, in this case, turns into an advantage.
First, due to technological advancements, people are healthier and live
longer. This means that they can support with taking over different
jobs, i.e. be that 'older' more traditional jobs, or supporting in the
different other activities.

• Hyper consumerism in place. As robots have taken over several jobs for
faster and more efficient production and the use of innovation for green
technology, an apogee of guilt-free consumerism is observed. In
parallel, the 3D printing has allowed for more printing material at
home, which, together with high recycling opportunities, makes
consumption easier and faster. People have the tendency to consume more
and more as everything is more environmentally friendly, and more things
get recycled. In that case, we see a link between consumerism and the
need to look for more resources becomes necessary due to the large
exploitation of the existing ones for production. In response to this
resource scarcity, the recycling industry becomes more important, where
material from electronic devices to biodegradable goods can be recycled
or biodegraded. Especially today, where more research on technologies on
using cellulose or lignin to produce plastics, a trend already discussed
in 2019 (World Economic Forum, 2019), which allows a more effective
recycling, gives higher hopes to people for a 'guilt-free consumerism'.

• Continuous learning and new skills are vital. The education system has
been adapted to the new needs and improved so that citizens are able to
meet the skill requirements for the new niche jobs. Being digitally
literate is another prerequisite of 2050, where the majority of people
are already digital natives, compared the to late 2010s there was a gap
of e-skills supply of about 900,000 people by 2020. People need to
constantly upgrade their skills and learn throughout their lives to be
able to adapt to the different requirements (European Strategy and
Policy Analysis System, 2015). They change jobs often, and hence
continuous learning is necessary (European Political Strategy Centre,
2017). In that respect, online courses are a key lifelong learning
opportunity, at least for the masses who cannot afford more tailor-made
and specialised private education.

• [**[Ag]{.mark}riculture** [and]{.mark} **[natural
resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Given the focus on growth and mass
productions, agricultural production and forestry need to cope with
these developments. [[Green tech]{.mark}nology [allows for]{.mark}
**[increased production]{.mark}** [of crops]{.mark} and
vegetables]{.underline}. [[This is]{.mark} mainly [possible]{.mark}
**[through smart farming]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[which uses advanced
tech]{.mark}nology [such as **IoT**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to manage
farms and increase]{.mark} the **[quantity]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[quality]{.mark}** of products]{.underline} and optimise the human
labour that is necessary for agricultural processes (Sciforce, 2019). In
2050, [**[genetically modified]{.mark}** [crops
prevail]{.mark}]{.underline}, so that they can resist pests, grow in the
demanding climatic conditions and reduce production losses, through
genetically editing the code of crops (World Economic Forum, 2015). Bio
and organic agriculture is very limited and hence very expensive;
instead, a lot of vegetables and fruits are produced in greenhouses
thanks to clean energy, which are built across areas that in the 2010s
were not arable. The last decades, [citizens favour vegetables based
nutrition, reducing their red meat consumption]{.underline}. Trends such
as 'beyond meat' and veganism prevail, while new food concepts such as
insects and bacteria emerge.

• **[Transforming transport]{.underline}**. As more products are being
produced, transport and accessibility play a vital role in their
transportation. Hence transport accessibility is the core of logistics.
[[Through]{.mark} the development of the **[cyber-physical]{.mark}**
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, automobiles and [**[autonomous
vehicles]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[drones]{.mark}**, together with the
**electric** and **hydrogen** engines]{.underline}, [but also
**satellite navigation**]{.underline} [systems now shape not only the
urban mobility]{.underline} (European Strategy and Policy Analysis
System, 2015), [but such [technologies
revolutionise]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
transportation and [delivery of different goods]{.underline}. At the
same time, thanks to the clean energy, [[transport has become
**faster**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **[cleaner]{.mark}**]{.underline},
allowing for more exports and imports of goods with new technologies
used for aviation. Trends already discussed in 2015, such as 'fuel cell'
cars running on hydrogen are now mainstream, with the latter being
clean-burning with only water vapour as waste, reducing air pollution
(World Economic Forum, 2015). As a result, there was an increase in the
use of cars is also to be observed, given the cleaner fuel technologies.
Congestion remains a problem in the urban areas, as the increased
efficiency of public transport has not decreased the use of electric and
hybrid cars. Furthermore, new transport modes such as solar planes are
also being considered and experimented for passenger connections (see as
an example from the 2016s, Carrington, 2016).

• **[Green Shipping]{.underline}**. [In the [BSR tech]{.mark}nology [is
used for]{.mark} an **[emission-free]{.mark}** maritime
transport]{.underline} (based on Green Ship of the future organisation,
n.d.), for eliminating accidents and improving safety, navigation
routes, emergencies, through e-navigation and other relevant
technologies (EUSBSR, n.d.). As ports are overloaded with traffic, the
role of rail and roads that connect the ports to the mainland has also
been increased, creating a transport spillover effect (VASAB, 2018).
Shipping, at the same time, is highly dependent on global factors. For
instance, globalisation and the increasing international competition for
resources, markets and consumers influence shipping in the BSR (Interreg
Baltic Sea Region, Baltic LINes, 2018).

• Energy in demand. The increased production and growth require
increased use of natural resources, resulting in an increase in energy
consumption in the region. Already in the 2010s, it was assumed that by
2030 energy consumption would reach 30% higher than in 2010, with the
natural gas market increased to 50% in 2035 (European Strategy and
Policy Analysis System, 2015). [Green technology has allowed for a
cleaner and]{.underline} '[greener']{.underline} [energy production
which reduces the environmental footprint]{.underline}. [Renewables are
**widely**]{.underline} exploited and **[used]{.underline}**. New forms
of energy are also experimented, such as [fusion energy]{.underline},
which [could bring a **revolution**]{.underline} in the way energy is
produced and solve globally the climate change effects (European
Strategy and Policy Analysis System, 2015). Given this increased need
for natural resources, the recycling industry is gaining attention, as
goods and material are being fully recycled so as to save resources and
reuse them in future. [The recycling of]{.underline} thermostat
[plastics]{.underline}, a seed trend in 2015 (World Economic Forum,
2015), [is under further development to **reduce plastic
waste**]{.underline} [and support a form of **circular
economy**]{.underline}.

• [Clearing up the **ecological footprint**]{.underline}. Green
technology developments in the BSR managed to eliminate carbon emissions
contribute towards mitigating the temperature increase and its possible
effects in the region. Furthermore, the eutrophication in the Baltic Sea
has considerably been reduced over the last decades, improving and
minimising the ecological footprint in the region. In 2050 climate
change is overall anticipated and action has been taken so that the
region is the first one to adjust to the risks. Risk management is also
advanced in the region with the latter being able to deal with natural
disasters.

• **[Tech Health]{.underline}**. [The technological advancements have
also **revolutionised healthcare**]{.underline}, [through the **nano**-
and **biotechnologies**]{.underline}, [which results in people being
**healthier**]{.underline} [for a longer period and living
longer]{.underline}. **[Genome editing]{.underline}** [in humans is also
part of health developments]{.underline}. Radical health treatments have
been invented where [**diseases** formerly uncurable can now be
cured]{.underline}. Given, however, the costs of this healthcare this is
also targeted to those who 'have'. Unemployment and inequalities, but
also the high pressure at work increase the risks for health problems,
such as stress and mental problems or burnouts and depressions.
Technology investments have also a more direct impact on people's
everyday lives. Tech implants to people become a reality, for tracking
health or fitness trackers, devices serving as the new IDs, companies
check-ins, or event mobile phone transplants. Tele-medicine and medical
support through drones, especially in remote and sparsely populated
areas are part of everyday life, while robots support the elderly at
home.

• New virtual values? Dilemmas related to ethical and societal values
are emerging due to the mass use of technology in different aspects of
people's lives. Although green technology mediates the environmental
concerns and mitigates climate change, still ethical constraints remain
in society. These mainly regard the extent of the technological use, the
accelerated production, the limited data protection, which pose
questions on people's fundamental rights and freedoms (based on European
Strategy and Policy Analysis System, 2015) especially when it comes to
e-governance which is today what shapes current politics. New rules on
participatory governance mechanisms and creation of trust are necessary
(World Economic Forum, 2018). This becomes relevant when social
inequalities emerge due to the 'unlimited growth', with elite groups
participating in and shaping decision making. [Cyber-attacks are a
**common threat**]{.underline} with not only businesses being hacked but
also resulting in harming the global economy (World Economic Forum,
2018). Thus, [cybersecurity has been elevated to a **top
priority**]{.underline}, with blockchain technologies in support, while
the development of ethical guidelines for the global competition seems
necessary (based on European Strategy and Policy Analysis System, 2015).

• The neighbourhood relationship: A global 'coompetition'. In 2050 [the
BSR is a global key player in green technology]{.underline} to increase
its growth and development. Given the high growth prospects, [the region
is very attractive to FDI, increasing its **global stand**]{.underline}
(based on ESPON, 2018). Overall, European and cooperation values are
much respected where relevant; nevertheless, there is high global
competition, e.g. with other technologically advanced regions in the
European Union, as well as other global players in technology, such as
China, India or the United States. The relationship with Russia is
characterised by limited cooperation, given especially the fact that the
BSR is still dependent but to a lesser extent on energy supply from

**[[EXISTENTIAL RISK]{.underline}]{.mark}** AND A CHANGING HUMANITY

Humanity has already changed a lot over its lifetime as a species. While
our biology is not drastically different than it was 70,000 years ago,
the [capabilities enabled by our **scientific**]{.underline},
[**technological**,]{.underline} and **[sociocultural
achievements]{.underline}** have changed what it is to be human. Whether
through the processes of agriculture, the invention of the steam engine,
or the practices of storing and passing on knowledge and ideas, and
working together effectively as large groups, [we have]{.underline}
dramatically **[augmented]{.underline}** [our biological
abilities]{.underline}. [We can]{.underline} lift heavier things than
our biology allows, store and access more information than our brains
can hold, and [collectively **solve problems**]{.underline} that we
could not individually.

The [[species will change]{.mark} **even more**]{.underline} over coming
decades and centuries, as we develop the ability to modify our biology,
extend our abilities through various forms of human-machine
interaction[, and [continue]{.mark} the process of]{.underline}
sociocultural **[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The long-term
[future holds]{.underline} tremendous **[promise]{.underline}**:
continued progress may allow humanity to spread throughout a galaxy that
to the best of our knowledge appears devoid of intelligent life.
However, what we will be in the future may bear little resemblance to
what we are now, both physically and in terms of capability. Our
descendants may be augmented far beyond what we currently recognize as
human.

This is reflected in the careful wording of Nick Bostrom's definition of
existential risk, the standard definition used in the field. An
**[existential risk]{.underline}** "is one that [threatens the premature
**extinction**]{.underline} [of earth-originating intelligent
life]{.underline}, or the permanent and drastic destruction of its
potential for desirable future development."3 Scholars in the field are
less concerned about the form humanity may take in the long-term future,
and more concerned that we avoid circumstances that might prevent our
descendants\-\--whatever form they may take\-\--from having the
opportunity to flourish. One way in which this could happen is if a
**[cataclysmic event]{.underline}** [were to wipe out our
species]{.underline} (and perhaps, with it, the capacity for our planet
to bear intelligent life in future). But another way would be if a
cataclysm fell short of human extinction, but changed our circumstances
such that further progress became impossible. For example, **[runaway
climate change]{.underline}** might not eliminate all of us, but might
leave so few of us, scattered at the poles, and so limited in terms of
accessible resources, that further scientific, technological, and
cultural progress might become impossible. Instead of spreading to the
stars, [we might]{.underline} [remain locked in a **perennial
battle**]{.underline} [for survival]{.underline} in a much less
bountiful world.

The [[Risks We]{.underline}]{.mark} Have Always
**[[Faced]{.underline}]{.mark}**

For the first 200,000 years of humanity's history, the risks that have
threatened our species as a whole have remained relatively constant.
Indonesia's crater lake Toba is the result of a catastrophic
**[[volcanic super-eruption]{.underline}]{.mark}** that occurred 75,000
years ago, blasting an estimated 2800 cubic kilometers of material into
the atmosphere. An erupted mass just 1/100th of this from the Tambora
eruption (the largest in recent history) was enough to cause the 1816
"year without a summer," where interference with crop yields caused mass
food shortages across the northern hemisphere. Some lines of evidence
suggest that the Toba event may have wiped out a large majority of the
human population at the time, although this is debated. At the Chixculub
Crater in Mexico, geologists uncovered the scars of the meteor that most
likely wiped out seventy-five percent of species on earth at that time,
including the dinosaurs, sixty-six million years ago. This may have
opened the door, in terms of available niches, for the emergence of
mammalian species and ultimately humanity.

Reaching further into the earth's history uncovers other, even more
cataclysmic events for previous species. The Permian-Triassic extinction
event wiped out 90--96% of species at the time. Possible causes include
**[meteor impacts]{.underline}**, **[rapid climate change]{.underline}**
possibly due to increased methane release, large-scale volcanic
activity, or a combination of these. Even further back, the
cyanobacteria that introduced oxygen to our atmosphere, and paved the
way for oxygen-breathing life, did so at a cost: they brought about the
extinction of nearly all life at the time, to whom oxygen was poisonous,
and triggered a "snowball earth" ice age.

The threats posed by meteor or **[[asteroid]{.mark}
impact[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** and supervolcanoes have not gone away.
In principle an asteroid could hit us at any point with little warning.
A number of geological hotspots could trigger a volcanic eruption; most
famously, the Yellowstone Hotspot is believed to be "due" for another
massive explosive eruption.

However, on the timescale of human civilization, these risks are very
unlikely in the coming century, or indeed any given century. 660,000
centuries have passed since the event that wiped out the dinosaurs; the
chances that the next such event will happen in our lifetimes is likely
to be of the order of one in a million. And "due around now" for
Yellowstone means that geologists expect such an event at some point in
the next 20,000--40,000 years. Furthermore, these threats are static;
there is little evidence that their probabilities, characteristics, or
modes of impact are changing significantly on a human civilizational
timescale.

New Challenges

New challenges have emerged alongside our civilizational progress. As we
organized ourselves into larger groups and cities, [it became easier for
**[disease]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to spread among us]{.underline}.
During the Middle Ages the Black Death outbreaks wiped out 30--60% of
Europe's population. And our travel across the globe allowed us to bring
diseases with us to places they would never have otherwise reached;
following European colonization of the Americas, disease outbreaks wiped
out up to 95% native populations.

The Industrial Revolution allowed huge changes in our capabilities as a
species. It allowed **[rapid progress]{.underline}** [in scientific
knowledge, **engineering**, and manufacturing capability]{.underline}.
It [allowed us to draw heavily from]{.underline} cheap, powerful, and
rapidly available **[energy sources]{.underline}**\-\--fossil fuels. It
helped us to support a much greater global population. The global
population more than doubled between 1700 and 1850, and population in
England\-\--birthplace of the Industrial Revolution\-\--increased from 5
to 15 million in the same period, and doubled again to 30 million by
1900.4 In effect, these **[new technological capabilities]{.underline}**
[allowed us to extract more resources]{.underline}, create much greater
changes to our environment, and support more of us than had ever
previously been possible. [This is a path we have been **accelerating**
along]{.underline} ever since then, with greater globalization, further
scientific and technological development, a rising global population,
and, in developed nations at least, a rising quality of life and
resource use footprint.

On July 16, 1945, the day of the Trinity atomic bomb test, another
milestone was reached. Humans had developed a weapon that could
plausibly change the global environment in such an extreme way as to
threaten the continued existence of the human species.

Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA) is home to one of the planet's
hot spots, where a massive volcanic explosion could someday occur.

Power, Coordination, and Complexity

**[Humanity]{.underline}** [now]{.underline} has a [far **greater
power**]{.underline} [to shape its environment]{.underline}, locally and
globally, than any species that has existed to our knowledge; more so
even than the cyanobacteria that turned this into a planet of
oxygen-breathing life. We have repurposed huge swathes of the world's
land to our purposes\-\--as fields to produce food for us, cities to
house billions of us, roads to ease our transport, mines to provide our
material resources, and landfill to house our waste. We have developed
structures and tools such as air conditioning and heating that allow us
to populate nearly every habitat on earth, the supply networks needed to
maintain us across these locations, **[scientific
[breakthroughs]{.mark}]{.underline}** such as antibiotics, and practices
such as sanitation and pest control to [[defend ourselves
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
pests of our environments. We also modify ourselves to be better adapted
to our environments, for example through the use of vaccines.

This **[increased power]{.underline}** over ourselves and our
environment, combined with methods to network and coordinate our
activities over large numbers and wide areas, has [[created]{.mark}
**great [resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline} against many threats we face.
In most of the developed world [we can guarantee]{.underline} adequate
**[food]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[water]{.underline}** access
for the large majority of the population, given normal fluctuations in
yield; our food sources are varied in type and geographical location,
and many countries maintain food stockpiles. Similarly, **[electricity
grids]{.underline}** [provide a stable source of]{.underline} energy for
developed populations, given normal fluctuations in supply. We have
adequate hygiene systems and access to medical services, given normal
fluctuations in disease burden, and so forth. Furthermore, we have
sufficient societal stability and resources that we can support many
**[brilliant people]{.underline}** to [work on
**solutions**]{.underline} to emerging problems, or [to advance our
**sciences** and **technologies**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} give us
ever-greater tools to shape our environments, increase our quality of
life, and [solve]{.underline} our future [problems]{.underline}.

It goes without saying that these privileges exist to a far lesser
degree in developing nations, and that many of these privileges depend
on often exploitative relationships with developing nations, but this is
outside the scope of this chapter. Here the focus is on the resilience
or vulnerability of the human-as-species, which is tied more closely to
the resilience of the best-off than the vulnerability of the poorest,
except to the extent that catastrophes affecting the world's most
vulnerable populations would certainly impact the resilience of less
vulnerable populations.

[Many of the **tools**]{.underline}, **[networks]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[processes]{.underline}** [that make us more
resilient]{.underline} and efficient in "normal" circumstances, however,
[may make us more **vulnerable**]{.underline} in the face of extreme
circumstances. While a moderate disruption (for example, a reduced local
crop yield) can be absorbed by a network, and compensated for, a
catastrophic disruption may overwhelm the entire system, and cascade
into linked systems in unpredictable ways. Systems critical for human
flourishing, such as food, energy, and water, are inextricably
interlinked (the "food-water-energy nexus") and a disruption in one is
near-guaranteed to impact the stability of the others. Further, these
affect and are affected by many other human- and human-affected
processes: our physical, communications, and electronic infrastructure,
political stability (wars tend to both precede and follow famines),
financial systems, and extreme weather (increasingly a human-affected
phenomenon). These interactions are very dynamic and difficult to
predict. Should the water supply from the Himalayas dry up one year, we
have very little idea of the full extent of the regional and global
impact, although we could reasonably speculate about
**[[droughts]{.underline}]{.mark}**, major **[crop
failures]{.underline}**, and **[mass [starvation]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[financial crises]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a massive immigration
crisis, **[regional [warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [[could go
**nuclear**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[escalate
internationally]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and so forth. Although unlikely,
it is not outside the bounds of imagination that through a series of
unfortunate events, [a catastrophe might escalate to one that would
threaten the **[collapse]{.mark}** of **global
[civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Two factors stand out.

Firstly, the processes underpinning our planet's health are interlinked
in all sorts of complex ways, and our activities are serving to increase
the level of complexity, interlinkage, and
unpredictability\-\--particularly in the case of extreme events.

Secondly, the fact is that, despite our various coordinated processes,
we as a species are very limited in our ability to act as a globally
coordinated entity, capable of taking the most rational actions in the
interests of the whole\-\--or in the best interests of our continued
survival and flourishing.

This second factor manifests itself in global inequality, which benefits
developed nations in some ways, but also introduces major global
vulnerabilities; the droughts, famines, floods, and mass displacement of
populations likely to result from the impacts of climate change in the
developing world are sure to negatively affect even the richest nations.
It manifests itself in an inability to act optimally in the face of many
of our biggest challenges. More effective coordination on action,
communication, and resource distribution would make us more resilient in
the face of pandemic outbreaks, as illustrated so vividly by the Ebola
outbreak of 2014; a relatively mild outbreak of what should be an easily
controllable disease served to highlight how inadequate pandemic
preparedness and response was.5, 6 We were lucky that the disease was
not one with greater pandemic potential, such as one capable of airborne
transmission and with long incubation times.

Our limited ability to coordinate in our long-term interest manifests
itself in a difficulty in limiting our global resource use, limiting the
impact of our collective activities on our global habitat, and of
investing our resources optimally for our long-term survival and
well-being. And it limits our ability to guarantee that [[advances in
**science**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
**[technology]{.underline}** be applied to
**[f[urther]{.mark}]{.underline}**ing [our well-being and
[resilience]{.mark}, as opposed to being **destabilizing**]{.underline}
[or even used for **catastrophically hostile purposes**]{.underline},
[such as in the case of **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}.

Collective action problems are as old as humanity,7 and we have made
significant progress in designing effective institutions, particularly
in the aftermath of World War I and II. However, the stakes related to
these problems become far greater as our power to influence our
environment grows\-\--through sheer force of numbers and distribution
across the planet, and through more powerful scientific and
technological tools with which to achieve our myriad aims or to
frustrate those of our fellows. We are entering an era in which [our
**greatest risks**]{.underline} [are overwhelmingly likely to be caused
by our **own activities**]{.underline}, [and our own lack of capacity
to]{.underline} collectively steer and [limit our power]{.underline}.

OUR FOOTPRINT ON THE EARTH

[**[Population]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Resource
Use]{.underline}**]{.mark}

The United Nations estimated the earth's population at 7.4 billion as of
March 2016, up from 6.1 billion in 2000, 2.5 billion in 1950, and 1.6
billion in 1900. Long-term growth is difficult to predict (being
affected by many uncertain variables such as social norms, disease, and
the occurrence of catastrophes) and thus varies widely between studies.
However, UN projections currently point to a steady increase through the
twenty-first century, albeit at a slower growth rate, reaching just shy
of 11 billion in 2100.8 Most estimates indicate global population will
eventually peak and then fall, although the point at which this will
happen is very uncertain. Current estimates of resource use footprints
indicate that the global population is using fifty percent more
resources per year than the planet can replenish. This is likely to
continue rising sharply; more quickly than the overall population. If
the average person used as many resources as the average American, some
estimates indicate the global population would be using resources at
four times the rate that they can be replenished. The vast majority of
the population does not use food, energy, and water, nor release CO2 at
the rate of the average American. However, the rapid rise of a large
middle class in China is beginning to result in much greater resource
use and CO2 output in this region, and the same phenomenon is projected
to occur a little later on in India.

[[Catastrophic **Climate Change**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Without a significant change of course on CO2 emissions, the world is on
course for significant human-driven global warming; according to the
latest IPCC report, an increase of 2.5 to 7.8 °C can be expected under
"business as usual" assumptions. The lower end of this scale will have
significant negative repercussions for developing nations in particular
but is unlikely to constitute a global catastrophe; however, the upper
end of the scale would certainly have global catastrophic consequences.
The wide range in part reflects significant uncertainty over how robust
the climate system will be to the "forcing" effect of our activities. In
particular, scientists focused on catastrophic climate change worry
about a myriad of possible feedback loops. For example, a reduction of
snow cover, which reflects the sun's heat, could increase the rate of
warming resulting in greater loss of snow cover. The loss of arctic
permafrost might result in the release of large amounts of methane in
the atmosphere, which would accelerate the greenhouse effect further.
The extent to which oceans can continue to act as both "heat sinks" and
"carbon sinks" as we push the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere
upward is unknown. Scientists theorize the existence of "tipping
points," which, once reached, might trigger an irreversible
shift\-\--for example, the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheets or
the melt of Greenland's huge glaciers, or the collapse of the capacity
for oceans to absorb heat and sequester CO2. In effect, beyond a certain
point, a "rollercoaster" process may be triggered, where 3 degrees of
temperature rise rapidly and irreversibly may lead to 4 degrees, and
then 5.

Laudable progress has been made on achieving global coordination around
the goal of reducing global carbon emissions, most notably in the
aftermath of the December 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference.
174 countries signed an agreement to reach zero net anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the twenty-first century,
and to "pursue efforts to limit" the temperature increase to 1.5 °C. But
many experts hold that these goals are unrealistic, and that the
commitments and actions being taken fall far short of what will be
needed. According to the International Energy Agency's Executive
Director Fatih Birol: "We think we are lagging behind strongly in key
technologies, and in the absence of a strong government push, those
technologies will never be deployed into energy markets, and the chances
of reaching the two-degree goal are very slim."9

**[[Soil Erosion]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Soil erosion is a natural process. However human activity has increased
the global rate dramatically, with deforestation, drought, and climate
change accelerating the rate of loss of fertile soil. There are reasons
to expect this trend to accelerate; some of the most powerful drivers of
soil erosion are extreme weather events, and these events are expected
to increase dramatically in frequency and severity as a result of
climate change.

**[[Biodiversity Loss]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The world is entering an era of dramatic species extinction driven by
human activity.10 Since 1900, vertebrate species have been disappearing
at more than 100 times the rate seen in non-extinction periods. In
addition to the intrinsic value of the diversity of forms of life on
earth (the only life-inhabited planet currently known to exist in the
universe), catastrophic risk scholars worry about the consequences for
human societies. Ecosystem resilience is a tremendously complex
phenomenon, and it seems plausible that tipping points exist in them.
For example, the collapse of one or more keystone species underpinning
the stability of an ecosystem could result in a broader ecosystem
collapse with potentially devastating consequences for human system
stability (for example, should key pollinator species disappear, the
consequences for agriculture could be profound). Current human
flourishing relies heavily on these ecosystem services, but we are
threatening them at an unprecedented rate, and we have a poor ability to
predict the consequences of our activity.

Everything Affects Everything Else

Once again, the sheer complexity and interconnectedness of these risks
represents a key challenge. None of these processes happen in isolation,
and developments in one affect the others. Climate change affects
ecosystems by forcing species migration (for those that can), a change
in plant and animal patterns of growth and behavior, and by driving
species extinction. Reductions in available soil force us to drive more
deeply into nonagricultural wilderness to provide the arable land we
need to feed our populations. And the ecosystems we threaten play
important roles in maintaining a stable climate and environment.
Recognizing that we cannot get all the answers we need on these issues
by studying them in isolation, threats posed by the interplay of these
phenomena are a key area of study for catastrophic risk scholars.

All these developments result in a world with greater uncertainty, the
emergence of huge and unpredictable new vulnerabilities, and more
extreme and unprecedented events. [These events will play out in a
crowded world that contains more **powerful technologies**]{.underline},
and more powerful weapons, than have ever existed before.

HUMANITY AND TECHNOLOGY IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY

[Our progress in **science** and **technology**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} related **[civilizational advances]{.underline}**,
have [allowed us to house]{.underline} far more [people]{.underline} on
this planet, and have provided the power for those people to influence
their environment more than any previous species. This progress is not
of itself a bad thing, nor is the size of our global population.

There are good reasons to think that with careful planning, this planet
should be able to house seven billion or more people stably and
comfortably.11 [[With]{.underline} **[sustainable]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[agricultural]{.underline}** practices [and]{.underline}
**[[innovative use]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline}
**[irrigation]{.underline}** methods, [[it should be
**possible**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for]{.underline} many relatively
uninhabited and agriculturally **[unproductive]{.underline}**
[parts]{.underline} of the world [[to support]{.underline}]{.mark} more
**[people]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[[food]{.mark}
production]{.underline}**. An endless population growth on a finite
planet is not possible without a collapse; however, growth until the
point of collapse is by no means inevitable. Stabilization of population
size is strongly correlated with several factors we are making steady
global progress on: including education (especially of women), and
rights and a greater level of control for women over their own lives.
While there are conflicting studies,12 many experts hold that decreasing
child mortality, while leading to population increase in the near-term,
leads to a drop in population growth in the longer term. In other words,
as we move toward a better world, we will bring about a more stable
world, provided intermediate stages in this process do not trigger a
collapse or lasting global harm.13, 14

Current [advances in **science**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[technology]{.underline}**, while not sufficient in themselves, [will
play a key role in making a more resilient and **sustainable
future**]{.underline} possible. Rapid [progress is happening in
**[carbon-zero energy]{.mark}**]{.underline} [sources such as solar
photovoltaics and other renewables]{.underline}.15 Energy storage
remains a problem, but [progress is occurring on **[battery
efficiency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Advances in]{.underline} irrigation
techniques and desalination **[technologies]{.underline}** [may allow us
to provide water to areas where this has not previously been
possible]{.underline}, allowing both food production and other processes
that depend on reliable access to clean water. [Advances in **materials
technology**]{.underline} [will have wide-ranging benefits,
from]{.underline} lighter, more energy-efficient vehicles, to [more
efficient]{.underline} buildings and **[energy grids]{.underline}**, [to
more **powerful scientific tools** and **[novel technological
innovations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Advances in our understanding of
the genetics of plants are leading to crops with **greater
yields**]{.underline}, [greater resilience to **temperature
shifts**]{.underline}, droughts and other extreme weather, and greater
resistance to pests\-\--resulting in a reduction of the need for
polluting pesticides. We are likely to see many further
**[innovations]{.underline}** [in food production]{.underline}; for
example, exciting advances in lab-grown meat may [[result
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [production]{.underline} of meat [with a
[fraction of the **environmental footprint**]{.mark}]{.underline} of
livestock farming.

Many of the processes that have resulted in our current unsustainable
trajectories can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution, and our
widespread adoption of fossil fuels. However, the Industrial Revolution
and fossil fuels must also be recognized as having unlocked a level of
prosperity, and a rate and scale of scientific and technological
progress that would simply not have been possible without them. While a
continued reliance on fossil fuels would be catastrophic for our
environment, it is unclear whether many of the "clean technology"
breakthroughs that will allow us to break our dependence on fossil fuels
would have been possible without the scientific breakthroughs that were
enabled directly, or indirectly, by this rich, abundant, and easily
available fuel source. The goal is clear: having benefitted so
tremendously from this "dirty" stage of technology, we now need to take
advantage of the opportunity it gives us to move onto cleaner and more
powerful next-generation energy and manufacturing technologies. The
challenge will be to do so before thresholds of irreversible global
consequence have been passed.

With 537 square meters of solar panels and six blocks of lithium-ion
batteries, PlanetSolar is the world's largest solar ship, as well as its
fastest. It is also the first to have sailed round the world using
exclusively solar power.

The broader challenge is that humanity as a species needs to transition
to a stage of technological development and global cooperation where as
a species we are "living within our means": producing and using energy,
water, food, and other resources at a sustainable rate, and by methods
that will not impose long-term negative consequences on our global
habitat\-\--for at least as long as we are bound to it. There are no
physical reasons to think that we might not be capable of developing an
extensive space-faring civilization at a future point. And if we last
that long, it is likely we will develop extensive abilities to terraform
extraterrestrial environments to be hospitable to us\-\--or indeed,
transform ourselves to be suitable to currently inhospitable
environments. However, at present, in Martin Rees's words, there is no
place in our Solar System nearly as hospitable as the most hostile
environment on earth, and so we are bound to this fragile blue planet.

Part of this broader challenge is gaining a better understanding of the
complex consequences of our actions, and more so, of the limits of our
current understanding. Even if we cannot know everything, recognizing
when our uncertainty may lead us into dangerous territory can help us
figure out an appropriately cautious set of "safe operating parameters"
(to borrow a phrase from Steffen et al.'s "Planetary Boundaries"16) for
our activities. The second part of the challenge, perhaps harder still,
is developing the level of global coordination and cooperation needed to
stay within these safe operating parameters.

Technological Wild Cards

While much of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk's research
focuses on these challenges\-\--climate change, ecological risks,
resource use, and population, and the interaction between these\-\--the
other half of our work is on another class of factors: transformative
**[emerging]{.underline}** and future **[technologies]{.underline}**. We
might consider these "wild cards"; [technological developments
significant enough to change the course of **human
civilization**]{.underline} significantly in and of themselves.
**[Nuclear weapons]{.underline}** [are such a wild card]{.underline};
their development changed the nature of geopolitics instantly and
irreversibly. They also changed the nature of global risk: now many of
the stressors we worry about **[might escalate]{.underline}** quite
[quickly]{.underline} through human activity [to a worst-case scenario
involving a **large-scale [exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline} **[nuclear missiles]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The
[scenario of most concern from an **existential risk
standpoint**]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} one that might
trigger a **[[nuclear winter]{.underline}]{.mark}**: a level of
[destruction sufficient to send huge amounts of particulate matter into
the atmosphere and cause a lengthy period of **global
darkness**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[cold]{.underline}**. If
[such a period]{.underline} persisted for long enough, [[this
would]{.mark} collapse global **food production** and could
[drive]{.mark} the human species to]{.underline} near- or
**[full-[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There is disagreement among
experts about the scale of nuclear exchange needed to trigger a nuclear
winter, but it appears eminently plausible that the world's remaining
arsenals, if launched, might be sufficient.

Nuclear weapons could be considered a wild card in a different sense:
the underlying science is one that enabled the development of nuclear
power, a viable carbon-zero alternative to fossil fuels. This dual-use
characteristic\-\--that the underlying science and technology could be
applied to both destructive purposes, and peaceful ones\-\--is common to
many of the emerging technologies that we are most interested in.

A few key sciences and technologies of focus for scholars in this field
include, among others:

Topics within bioscience and bioengineering such as the manipulation and
modification of certain viruses and bacteria, and the creation of
organisms with novel characteristics and capabilities (genetic
engineering and synthetic biology).

**[[Geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark}**: a suite of proposed
large-scale technological interventions that would aim to "engineer" our
climate in an effort to slow or even reverse the most severe impacts of
climate change.

Advances in **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence\-\--in particular, those that
relate to progress toward artificial general intelligence\-\--AI systems
capable of matching or surpassing human intellectual abilities across a
broad range of domains and challenges.

Progress on these sciences are driven in great part by a recognition of
their potential for improving our quality of life, or the role they
could play in aiding us to combat existing or emerging global
challenges. However, in and of themselves they [may]{.underline} also
[[pose]{.underline}]{.mark} **[large [risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Virus Research

Despite advances in hygiene, vaccines, and other health technology,
natural [**[pandemic outbreaks]{.underline}**
[remain]{.underline}]{.mark} [among the most potent **global
[threat]{.mark}s**]{.underline} we face; for example, the 1918 Spanish
influenza outbreak killed more people than World War I. This [threat is
of]{.underline} particular [concern in]{.underline} our increasingly
crowded, **[interconnected world]{.underline}**. [[Advances in
**virology**]{.mark} **research**]{.underline} are likely to
[[play]{.mark} a central role in better [defense]{.mark}s
against]{.underline}, and responses to, viruses with **[pandemic
potential.]{.underline}**

A particularly controversial area of research is "gain-of-function"
virology research, which aims to modify existing viruses to give them
different host transmissibility and other characteristics. Researchers
engaged in such research may help identify strains with high pandemic
potential, and develop vaccines and antiviral treatment. However,
research with infectious agents runs the risk of accidental release from
research facilities. There have been suspected releases of infectious
agents from laboratory facilities. The 1977--78 Russian influenza
outbreak is strongly suspected to have originated due to a laboratory
release event,17 and in the UK, the 2007 foot-and-mouth outbreak may
have originated in the Pirbright animal disease research facility.18
Research on live infectious agents is typically done in facilities with
the highest biosafety containment procedures, but some experts maintain
that the potential for release, while low, remains, and may outweigh the
benefits in some cases.

[Some worry]{.underline} that advances in some of the same underlying
sciences may make the development of novel, targeted **[[biological
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** [more feasible]{.underline}. In 2001 a
research group in Australia inadvertently engineered a variant of
mousepox with high lethality to vaccinated mice.19 An accidental or
deliberate [release]{.underline} of a similarly modified virus infecting
humans, or a species we depend heavily on, [[could have **catastrophic
consequences**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Similarly, **[synthetic biology]{.underline}** [may lead to a wide range
of tremendous **scientific benefits**]{.underline}. The field aims to
design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems, and to
comprehensively redesign living organisms to perform functions useful to
us. This may result in synthetic bacterial and plant "microfactories,"
designed to produce new medicines, materials, and fuels, to break down
waste, to act as sensors, and much more. In principle, such biofactories
could be designed with much greater precision than current genetic
modification and biolytic approaches. They should also allow products to
be produced cheaply and cleanly. [Such advances would be transformative
on many **challenges**]{.underline} we currently face, [such as global
health care, energy, and fabrication]{.underline}.

Moreover, as the tools and facilities needed to engage in the science of
synthetic biology become cheaper, a growing "citizen science" community
is emerging around synthetic biology. Community "DIY Bio" facilities
allow people to engage in novel experiments and art projects; some
hobbyists even engage in synthetic biology projects in their own homes.
Many of the leaders in the field are committed to synthetic biology
being as open and accessible as possible worldwide, with scientific
tools and expertise available freely. Competitions such as iGEM
(International Genetically Engineered Machine) encourage undergraduate
student teams to build and test biological systems in living cells,
often with a focus on applying the science to important real-world
challenges, and also to archive their results and products so as to make
them available to future teams to build on.

Such citizen science represents a wonderful way of making cutting-edge
science accessible and exciting to generations of innovators. However,
the increasing ease of access to increasingly powerful tools is a cause
of concern to the risk community. Even if the vast majority engaging in
synthetic biology are both responsible and well intentioned, the
[possibility of **bad actors**]{.underline} or unintended consequences
(such as the release of an organism with unintended ecological
consequences) [exists]{.underline}. Further, we may expect that the
range and severity of negative consequences will increase, as well as
the difficulty in tracking those who have access to the necessary tools
and expertise. At present, biosafety and biosecurity is deeply embedded
within the major synthetic biology initiatives. In the United States,
the FBI works closely with synthetic biology centers, and leaders in the
field espouse the need for good practices at every level. However, this
area will progress rapidly, and a [balance will **need to be
struck**]{.underline} between allowing access to powerful tools to a
wide number of people who can do good with them, while
[restricting]{.underline} the [potential for]{.underline} accidents or
deliberate **[misuse]{.underline}**. It remains to be seen how easy it
will be to achieve this.

Geoengineering represents a host of challenges. Stratospheric aerosol
geoengineering represents a particularly powerful proposal: here, a
steady stream of reflective aerosols would be released into the upper
atmosphere in order to reduce the amount of the sun's light reaching the
earth's surface globally. This effectively mimics the global cooling
phenomenon that occurs after a large volcanic eruption, when particulate
matter is blasted into the atmosphere. However, current work is focused
on theoretical modelling, with very minimal practical field tests
carried out to date. Questions remain about how practically feasible it
would be to achieve this on a global scale, and what impact it would
have on rainfall patterns and crop growth.

It should be highlighted that this is not a solution to climate change.
While global temperature might be stabilized or lowered, unless this was
accompanied by reduction of CO2 emissions, then a host of damages such
as ocean acidification would still occur. Furthermore, if CO2 emissions
were allowed to continue to rise during this period, then a major risk
termed "termination shock" could manifest. In this case, if any
circumstance resulted in an abrupt cessation of stratospheric aerosol
geoengineering, then the increased CO2 concentration in the atmosphere
would result in a rapid jump in global temperature, which would have far
more severe impacts on ecosystems and human societies than the already
disastrous effects of a gradual rise.

Critics fear that such research might be misunderstood as a way of
avoiding the far more costly process of eliminating carbon emissions;
and some are concerned that intervening in such a profound way in our
planet's functioning is deeply irresponsible. It also raises knotty
questions about global governance: should any one country have the right
to engage in geoengineering, and, if not, how could a globally
coordinated decision be reached, particularly if different nations have
different exposures to the impacts of climate change, and different
levels of concern about geoengineering, given we are all under the same
sky?

Proponents highlight that we may already be committed to severe global
impacts from climate change at this stage, and that such techniques may
allow us the necessary breathing room needed to transition to
zero-carbon technology while temporarily mitigating the worst of the
harms. Furthermore, unless research is carried out to assess the
feasibility and likely impacts of this approach, we will not be well
placed to make an informed decision at a future date, when the impacts
of climate change may necessitate extreme measures. Eli Kintisch, a
writer at Science, has famously called geoengineering "a bad idea whose
time has come."20

**[[Artificial intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, explored in detail
in Stuart Russell's chapter, [may represent the wildest card of
all]{.underline}. Everything we have achieved in terms of our
civilizational progress, and shaping the world around us to our
purposes, has been a product of our intelligence. However, some of the
intellectual challenges we face in the twenty-first century are ones
that human intelligence alone is not best suited to: for example,
sifting through and identifying patterns in huge amounts of data, and
integrating information from vast and interlinked systems. From
analyzing disparate sources of climate data, to millions of human
genomes, to running thousands of simulations, artificial intelligence
will aid our ability to make use of the huge amount of knowledge we can
gather and generate, and will help us make sense of our increasingly
complex, interconnected world. Already, [AI is being used to optimize
energy use across **Google's servers**]{.underline}, [replicate
intricate **physics experiments**]{.underline}, [and discover new
**mathematical proofs**]{.underline}. Many specific tasks traditionally
requiring human intelligence, from language translation to driving on
busy roads, are now becoming automatable; allowing greater efficiency
and productivity, and freeing up human intelligence for the tasks that
AI still cannot do. However, [many of the same [advances]{.mark} have
more **worrying applications**]{.underline}; for example, allowing
collection and deep analysis of data on us as individuals, and
[[paving]{.underline}]{.mark} the road for the development of cheap,
**[powerful]{.underline}**, and easily [scalable **[autonomous
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the battlefield.

These advances are already having a dramatic impact on our world.
However, the vast majority of these systems can be described as "narrow"
AI. They can perform functions at human level or above in narrow,
well-specified domains, but lack the general cognitive abilities that
humans, dogs, or even rats have: general problem-solving ability in a
"real-world" setting, an ability to learn from experience and apply
knowledge to new situations, and so forth.

There is renewed enthusiasm for the challenge of achieving "general" AI,
or AGI, which would be able to perform at human level or above across
the range of environments and cognitive challenges that humans can.
However, it is currently unknown how far we are from such a scientific
breakthrough, or how difficult the fundamental challenges to achieving
this will be, and expert opinion varies widely. Our only proof of
principle is the human brain, and it will take decades of progress
before we can meaningfully understand the brain to a degree that would
allow us to replicate its key functions. However, if and when such a
breakthrough is achieved, there is reason to think that progress from
human-level general intelligence to superintelligent AGI might be
achieved quite rapidly.

Improvements in the hardware and software components of AI, and related
sciences and technologies, might be made rapidly with the aid of
advanced general AI. It is even conceivable that AI systems might
directly engage in high-level AI research, in effect accelerating the
process by allowing cycles of self-improvement. A growing number of
experts in AI are concerned that such a process might quickly result in
extremely powerful systems beyond human control; Stuart Russell has
drawn a comparison with nuclear chain reaction.

[**[Superintelligent AI]{.underline}** [has]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
potential to unlock]{.underline} **[unprecedented
[progress]{.mark}]{.underline}** on science, technology, and global
challenges; to paraphrase the founders of Google DeepMind, if
intelligence can be "solved," it can then be used to help solve
everything else. [However]{.underline}, the [risk]{.underline} from this
hypothetical technology, whether through deliberate use or unintended
runaway consequences, **[could be greate]{.underline}**r than that of
any technology in human history. If it is plausible that this technology
might be achieved in this century, then [a great deal of **research**
and **planning**]{.underline}\-\--both on the technical design of such
systems, and the governance structures around their
development\-\--[will be **needed**]{.underline} in the decades
beforehand in order [to achieve a desirable transition]{.underline}.

Predicting the Future

The field also engages in exploratory and foresight-based work on more
forward-looking topics; these include future advances in neuroscience
and nanotechnology, future physics experiments, and proposed
manufacturing technologies that may be developed in coming decades, such
as molecular manufacturing. While we are limited in what we can say in
detail about future scientific breakthroughs, it is often possible to
establish some useful groundwork. For example, we can identify
developments that should, in principle, be possible based on our current
understanding of the relevant science. And we can dismiss ideas that are
pure "science fiction," or sufficiently unfeasible to be safely ignored
for now, or that represent a level of progress that makes them unlikely
to be achieved for many generations.

By focusing further on those that could plausibly be developed within
the next half century, we can give considerations to their underlying
characteristics and possible impacts on the world, and of the broad
principles we might bear in mind for their safe development and
application. While it would have been a fool's errand to try to predict
the full impacts of the Internet prior to 1960, or of the development of
nuclear weapons prior to 1945, it would certainly be possible to develop
some thinking around the possible implications of very sophisticated
global communications and information-sharing networks, or of a weapon
of tremendous destructive potential.

Lastly, if we have some ideas about the directions from which
transformative developments might come, we can engage in foresight and
road-mapping research. This can help identify otherwise insignificant
breakthroughs and developments that may indicate meaningful progress
toward a more transformative technology being reached, or a threshold
beyond which global dynamics are likely to shift significantly (such as
photovoltaics and energy storage becoming cheaper and more easily
accessible than fossil fuels).

Confronting the Limits of Our Knowledge

A common theme across these emerging technologies and emerging risks is
that a tremendous level of scientific uncertainty and expert
disagreement typically exists. This is particularly the case for future
scientific progress and capabilities, the ways in which advances in one
domain may influence progress in others, and the likely global impacts
and risks of projected advances. Active topics of research at CSER
include how to obtain useful information from a range of experts with
differing views, and how to make meaningful scientific progress on
challenges where we have discontinuous data, or few case studies to draw
on, or even when we must characterize an entirely unprecedented event.
This might be a hypothesized ecological tipping point, which when passed
would result in an irreversible march toward the collapse of an entire
critical ecosystem. Or it might be a transformative scientific
breakthrough such as the development of artificial general intelligence,
where we only have current trends in AI capability, hardware, and expert
views on the key unsolved problems in the field to draw insight from. It
is unrealistic to expect that we can always, or even for the most part,
be right. We need to have humility, to expect false positives, and to be
able to identify priority research targets from among many weak signals.

Recognizing that there are limits to the level of detail and certainty
that can be achieved, this work is often combined with work on general
principles of scientific and technological governance. For example,
[[work under]{.mark} the heading of "**[responsible
innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}" [focuses on the challenge of
developing collective stewardship of progress in
**science**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[technology]{.underline}**
in the present, with a view [[to achieving **good**]{.mark} **future
[outcomes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.21 This combines scientific foresight
with processes to involve the key stakeholders at the appropriate stages
of a technology's development. At different stages these stakeholders
will include: scientists involved in fundamental research and applied
research; industry leaders; researchers working on the risks, benefits,
and other impacts of a technology; funders; policymakers; regulators;
NGOs and focus groups; and laypeople who will use or be affected by the
development of a technology. In the case of technologies with a
potential role in global catastrophic risk, the entire global population
holds a stake. Therefore decisions with long-term consequences must not
rest solely with a small group of people, represent only the values of a
small subset of people, or fail to account for the likely impacts on the
global population.

There have been a number of very encouraging specific examples of such
foresight and collaboration, where scientific domain specialists,
interdisciplinary experts, funders, and others have worked together to
try to guide an emerging technology's development, establish ethical
norms and safety practices, and explore its potential uses and misuses
in a scientifically rigorous way. In bioengineering, the famous 1975
Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA established important precedents,
and more recently summits have been held on advances such as human gene
editing. In artificial intelligence, a number of important conferences
have been held recently, with enthusiastic participation from academic
and industry research leaders in AI alongside interdisciplinary experts
and policymakers. A number of the world's leading AI research teams have
established ethical advisory panels to inform and guide their scientific
practices, and a cross-industry "partnership on AI to benefit people and
society" involving five companies leading fundamental research has
recently been announced.22

More broadly, it is crucial that we learn from the lessons of past
technologies and, where possible, develop principles and methodologies
that we can take forward. This may give us an advantage in preparing for
developments that are currently beyond our horizon and that
methodologies too deeply tied to specific technologies and risks may not
allow. One of the key concerns associated with risks from emerging and
future technologies is the rate at which progress occurs and at which
the associated threats may arise. While every science will throw up
specific challenges and require domain-specific techniques and
expertise, any tools or methodologies that help us to intervene reliably
earlier are to be welcomed. There may be a limited window of opportunity
for averting such risks. Indeed, this window may occur in the early
stages of developing a technology, well before the fully mature
technology is out in the world, where it is difficult to control. Once
Pandora's box is open, it is very difficult to close.

WORKING ON THE (DOOMSDAY) CLOCK

**[Technological progress]{.underline}** now [offers us a vision of a
**remarkable future**]{.underline}. The [advances]{.underline} that
[have]{.underline} brought us onto an unsustainable pathway have also
raised the quality of life dramatically for many, and have [unlocked
scientific directions that can lead us to a]{.underline} safer, cleaner,
more **[sustainable world]{.underline}**. With the right developments
and applications of technology, in concert with advances in social,
democratic, and distributional processes globally, **[progress can be
made]{.underline}** on all of the challenges discussed here. Advances in
renewable energy and related technologies, and more efficient energy
use\-\--advances that are likely to be accelerated by progress in
technologies such as artificial intelligence\-\--can bring us to a point
of zero-carbon emissions. New manufacturing capabilities provided by
synthetic biology may provide cleaner ways of producing products and
degrading waste. A greater scientific understanding of our natural world
and the ecosystem services on which we rely will aid us in plotting a
trajectory whereby critical environmental systems are maintained while
allowing human flourishing. Even advances in education and women's
rights globally, which will play a role in achieving a stable global
population, can be aided specifically by the information, coordination,
and education tools that technology provides, and more generally by
growing prosperity in the relevant parts of the world.

[There are]{.underline} catastrophic and **[existential
risks]{.underline}** [that we will simply not be able to overcome
without advances in **science** and]{.underline}
**[technology]{.underline}**. These [include]{.underline} possible
**[pandemic]{.underline}** outbreak**[s]{.underline}**, whether natural
or engineered. The early identification of incoming
**[asteroids]{.underline}**, and approaches to shift their path, is a
topic of active research at NASA and elsewhere. While currently there
are no known techniques to prevent or mitigate a **[supervolcanic
eruption]{.underline}**, this may not be the case with the tools at our
disposal a century from now. And in the longer run, a civilization that
has spread permanently beyond the earth, enabled by advances in
**[spaceflight]{.underline}**, **[manufacturing]{.underline}**,
**[robotics]{.underline}**, and **[terraforming]{.underline}**, is one
that is much more likely to endure. However, the breathtaking power of
the tools we are developing is not to be taken lightly. We have been
very lucky to muddle through the advent of nuclear weapons without a
global catastrophe. And within this century, it is realistic to expect
that we will be able to rewrite much of biology to our purposes,
intervene deliberately and in a large-scale way in the workings of our
global climate, and even develop agents with intelligence that is
fundamentally alien to ours, and may vastly surpass our own in some or
even most domains\-\--a development that would have uniquely
unpredictable consequences.

It is reassuring to note that there are relatively few individual events
that could cause an existential catastrophe\-\--one resulting in
extinction or a permanent civilizational collapse. Setting aside the
very rare events (such as supervolcanoes and asteroids), the [most
plausible candidates include]{.underline} **[nuclear
winter]{.underline}**, [extreme **global warming**]{.underline} or
cooling scenarios, the accidental or deliberate [release of an organism
that **radically altered**]{.underline} [the planet's functioning,
or]{.underline} the release of an **[engineered pathogen]{.underline}**.
They also include more speculative future advances: [new]{.underline}
types of **[weaponry]{.underline}**, **[runaway]{.underline}**
**[a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence, or maybe
physics experiments beyond what we can currently envisage. Many global
risks are, in isolation, survivable\-\--at least for some of us\-\--and
it is likely that human civilization could recover from them in the long
run: less severe global warming, various environmental disasters and
ecosystem collapses, widespread starvation, most pandemic outbreaks,
conventional warfare (even global).

However, this latter class of risks, and factors that might drive them
(such as population, resource use, and climate change) should not be
ignored in the broader study of existential risk. Nor does it make sense
to consider these challenges in isolation: in our interconnected world
they all affect each other. [The threat of **global nuclear
war**]{.underline} [has not gone away]{.underline}, and many scholars
believe that it may be rising again (at the time of writing, North Korea
has just undergone its most ambitious nuclear test to date). If climate
pressures, drought, famine, and other resource pressures serve to
escalate geopolitical tensions, or if the potential use of a **[[new
technology]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as geoengineering, [[could lead
to a **nuclear standoff**]{.underline}]{.mark}, then [the result is [an
**existential threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For all these reasons and more, a growing community of scholars across
the world believe that the twenty-first century will see greater change
and greater challenges than any century in humanity's past history. It
will be a century of unprecedented global pressures, and a century in
which extreme and unpredictable events are likely to happen more
frequently than ever before in the past. [It will also be a century in
which the power of **[technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline} unlike any we
have had in our past history [will hang over us like multiple
**Damocles' swords**]{.underline}. But it will also be a century in
which the [technologies we **develop**]{.underline}, and the
institutional structures we develop, [[may aid]{.mark} us in solving
many]{.underline} of the **[[problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** we
currently face\-\--[[if we **guide**]{.mark} their
**[development]{.mark}**, and their uses and applications,
carefully]{.underline}.

**Sustainable development [solves]{.underline} extinction, but failure
causes [cascading risks]{.underline} that [cumulatively]{.underline}
outweigh [any single risk]{.underline}.**

Fig. 3 demonstrates that [cascade failures can be transmitted
through]{.underline} the [complex inter-relationships that
link]{.underline} the [Sustainable Development Goals]{.underline}.
Randers, Rockstrom, Stoknes, Goluke, Collste, Cornell, Donges et al.
(2018) have suggested that where meeting some SDGs impact negatively on
others, this may lead to "crisis and conflict accelerators" and "threat
multipliers" resulting in conflicts, instability and migrations.
[[Ecosystem stresses]{.mark} are likely to [disproportionately

**whole global system**\"]{.underline}(Mastrojeni, 2018).
[Such]{.underline} possibilities [are likely to go beyond incremental
damage and [lead to **runaway collapse**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The **[W]{.underline}**orld **[E]{.underline}**conomic
**[F]{.underline}**orums' Global Risks Report for 2018
[shows]{.underline} the [**[top]{.mark}** five **[global risks]{.mark}**
in]{.underline} terms of [**likelihood** and **impact**]{.underline}
have [changed]{.underline} from being economic and social in 2008 [to
environmental and technological]{.underline} in 2018, and are
[[**closely aligned** with]{.mark} many [SDGs]{.mark}]{.underline}
(World Economic Forum, 2018). The report notes "that [we are much less
competent]{.underline} when it comes to [dealing with complex risks in
systems characterised by feedback loops, tipping points and opaque
cause-and-effect relationships that]{.underline} can [make intervention
problematic]{.underline}". The most likely risks expected to have the
greatest impact currently include extreme weather events natural
disasters, cyber attacks, data fraud or theft, failure of climate change
mitigation and water crises.

These are represented in Fig. 3 by the following exogenous variables.
"Climate change" drives the need for Climate Action (SDG 13), "Cyber
threat" may adversely impact technology implementation and advancement
which will disrupt Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11); Decent
Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8) and the rate of introduction of
Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7), with reductions in these goals
having direct consequences in also reducing progress in the other goals
which they are closely linked to. "Data Fraud or Threat" has the
capacity to inhibit innovation and Industrial Performance (SDG 9),
reducing competitiveness (and having the potential to erode societal
confidence in governance processes). "Water Crises" (linked with climate
change) have a direct impact on Human Health and Well Being (SDG 3) as
well as reducing access to Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6) and
reducing agricultural production which increases Hunger (SDG 2). The
causal loop diagram also highlights "Conflict" as a variable (driven by
multiple environmental-socio-economic factors) which together with
regions most impacted by climate degradation will lead to an increase in
migrant refugees enhancing the spread of disease and global pandemic
risk, thus impacting directly on Human Health and Well Being (SDG 3)

4.2. Existential and catastrophic risk

The level and consequences of these risks may be severe. Existential
Risks (ER) have a wide scope, with extreme danger, and are "a risk that
threatens the premature extinction of humanity or the permanent and
drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development"
(Farquhar et al., 2017,) essentially being an event or scenario that is
"transgenerational in scope and terminal in intensity" (Baum & Handoh,
2014). [With]{.underline} a [smaller scope, and lower level of severity,
global catastrophic risk is defined as a scenario]{.underline} or event
[that results in at least 10 million fatalities]{.underline}, or \$10
trillion in damages (Bostrom & Ćirković, 2008). Global Catastrophic Risk
(GCR) events are [those]{.underline} which [are global, but]{.underline}
they are [durable]{.underline} in that [humanity is able to
recover]{.underline} from them (Bostrom & Ćirković, 2008;
Cotton-Barratt, Farquhar, Halstead, Schubert, & Snyder-Beattie, 2016)
but which still have a long-term impact (Turchin & Denkenberger, 2018b).

[[Achieving]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[S]{.mark}**ustainable
**[D]{.mark}**evelopment **[G]{.mark}**oal**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} be considered to [be a means of
**[reduc]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} the [long-term global
**catastrophic** and **[existential risks]{.mark}** for humanity.
**Conversely** [if]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[targets]{.underline}]{.mark} represented across the SDGs [[remain
**unachieved**]{.underline} [there is]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[potential for]{.mark} these]{.underline} forms of
[**[risk]{.underline}** [to **develop**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[This]{.underline} association [**combined** with]{.underline} the
[**likely emergence** of **new challenges** over the next
decade]{.underline}s (Cook, Inayatullah, Burgman, Sutherland, & Wintle,
2014) [means]{.underline} that [it is of great value to identify points
within the systems representations of the Sustainable Development Goals
that could]{.underline} both [lead to]{.underline} [global catastrophic
risk and]{.underline} [existential risk, and conversely]{.underline}
that could [act as **prevention**, or **leverage points**]{.underline}
in order [to avoid such outcomes]{.underline}. This identification in
turn enables sensible policy responses to be constructed (Sutherland &
Woodroof, 2009).

Whilst [**existential threats** are **unlikely**, there is **extensive
peril** in [**global catastrophic risks**.]{.mark} Despite being lesser
in severity than existential risks, they [**increase** the **likelihood
of**]{.mark}]{.underline} human **[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Turchin & Denkenberger, 2018a) [through **chain
reactions**]{.underline} (Turchin & Denkenberger, 2018a), and
**[inhibiting]{.underline}** humanity's **[response to other
risks]{.underline}** (Farquhar et al., 2017). [It is **necessary** to
**consider** **risks** that **may seem small,**]{.underline} as [**when
acting together**, they can have **extensive consequences**]{.underline}
(Tonn, 2009). Furthermore, the [high adaptability]{.underline} potential
of humans, and society, [means]{.underline} that [[for humanity to
become extinct, it is **most likely**]{.mark} that [there would be a
**series**]{.mark} **of events** [that **culminate** in
**extinction**]{.mark} **as opposed to one** large scale
**event**]{.underline} (Tonn & MacGregor, 2009; Tonn, 2009).

[Whilst]{.underline} the prospect of [existential risk,]{.underline} or
global catastrophic risk [can seem distant]{.underline}, the Stern
Review on the Economics of Climate Change estimated the
[risk]{.underline} of extinction for humanity [as 0.1 % annually, which
accumulates to provide]{.underline} the [risk of extinction over the
next century as 9.5 %]{.underline} (Cotton-Barratt et al., 2016). With
respect to identifying these risks, it is known that in particular,
"[**[positive feedback loops]{.mark}**... [represent the
**gravest**]{.mark} existential **[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}"
(Kareiva & Carranza, 2018), with pollution also having the potential to
pose an existential risk.

- [**[Precipitous]{.mark}** insect [declines]{.mark} are being
  **[escalate]{.mark}**d by humanity as soaring population and advanced

  [decline]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Chances are, the works of the world's insects touch your lips every day.
The coffee or tea you savor, both are pollinated by insects. Apples,
oranges, cabbages, cashews, cherries, carrots, broccoli, watermelon,
garlic, cinnamon, basil, sunflower seeds, almonds, canola oil\-\--all
are insect-pollinated. Honey, dyes, even some vaccines require insects
to come to fruition.

[[Vital to]{.mark} the world's **[food web]{.mark}**, nested in
[**nutrient cycling**, and]{.mark} embedded in
**[industries]{.mark}**]{.underline}\-\--the closer we look, the more
[we see insects as **vital** to maintaining **life's
frameworks**]{.underline}. Referring to this fact, famed biologist E.O.
Wilson wrote in 1987, **[["\[I\]f invertebrates]{.mark} were to
[disappear, I doubt the human species could last]{.mark} more than a few
[months."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Which is why [the precipitous decline of insects is **raising
alarms**]{.underline}.

Insect populations are being reduced at varying rates across space and
time, but on average, the decline in their abundance is thought to be
around 1-2% per year, or 10-20% per decade.

"Think of a landowner with a million-dollar house on a river that's a
little bit wild. And they're losing 10% to 20% of their land every
decade, and [[it's **horrifying**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It means that
[after **even a century**, you]{.underline} really [don't have
**anything left**]{.underline}," David Wagner, an entomologist with the
University of Connecticut told Mongabay in an interview. That, he says
of this comparison, is the danger we now face.

Wagner has just edited a newly released in-depth feature in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Global Decline of
Insects in the Anthropocene, in which 56 researchers present scientific
studies, opinions and news on insect declines. The journal offers
perspectives on the ecological, taxonomic, geographical and sociological
dimensions of insect declines, along with suggestions on how we move
forward to study and reverse this drain on global biodiversity.

Insect "death by a thousand cuts"

In a perspective piece that leads off the special issue, Wagner and his
co-authors address the likely causes of insect decline. The main
stressors to insects, they write, are changes in land use (particularly
deforestation), agriculture, climate change, nitrification, pollution
and introduced species. However, the importance of each stressor and how
they interact still puzzles scientists.

"There are so many good scientists that can't figure out what the cause
is," Wagner said. He poses the well-known honeybee as an example. "I
mean, this thing is worth billions upon billions of dollars and we don't
know why it's having such a hard time. And I think the reason is, it's
death by a thousand cuts... most of these things are hit by four or five
pretty important stressors, and they're acting synergistically."

The articles that follow that opening essay zero in on the key causes
for some of the biggest known losses:

A study by Wagner and Peter Raven, president emeritus of the Missouri
Botanical Garden, concludes that [[declines]{.mark} in insect
biodiversity and biomass [are linked to]{.mark} the **[intensification
of ag]{.mark}riculture**]{.underline} over the past 50 years.

Research by Dan Janzen and Winnie Hallwachs\-\--both biologists from the
University of Pennsylvania who describe themselves as "intense observers
of caterpillars, their parasites, and their associates"\-\--focuses on
climate change as a stressor. Since the late 1970s, they write, they've
watched as insect declines came to the dry forests, cloud forests, and
rainforests of Costa Rica's Guanacaste Conservation Area, as the region
was plagued by rising temperatures, increasingly erratic seasons and
inconsistent rainfall.

Another study in the special feature, titled, Insects and recent climate
change, argues that climate may be playing even more of a role in
declines than land-use change\-\--which is massive around the planet
mostly due to agribusiness expansion. The authors base their climate
findings on a Northern California butterflies case study, where declines
were severe even in areas suffering little habitat loss. Similar losses
within well-protected areas have been detected in Germany and Puerto
Rico.

Likewise, butterfly populations in Europe face challenges. In the UK,
butterfly numbers have declined by around 50% over the past 50 years,
with 8% of known resident species considered extinct. In the
Netherlands, upwards of 20% of species have been lost and in Belgium
29%. Researchers suggest habitat loss, habitat degradation and chemical
pollution as the primary causes. The authors offer conservation
solutions and recommend policy changes to conserve butterflies and other
insects\-\--but so far political will has been lacking.

Moving from the winged creatures of the day to night fliers, Wagner and
colleagues give an overview of the global state of moth declines. Moths
are extremely diverse and cosmopolitan. "For every butterfly that
Mongabay readers see during the daytime, there are 19 species of moths
flying around at night," Wagner revealed.

Although moth numbers have declined in some areas, such as in parts of
Europe and Central America, in other, mostly temperate areas, many moth
taxa are increasing in abundance. Another study found that the overall
abundance of arthropods in the Arctic has increased in recent years.
Researchers attribute these increases in insect abundance to climate
change, which scientists say has both its species winners and losers. As
warmer temperatures march northward, new suitable habitats open up for
insects. The consequences of this range expansion\-\--and the conflicts
which may occur with plant and insect species already occupying those
ranges\-\--have yet to be analysed.

Insect declines are emblematic of a larger problem: the earth is in the
midst of what some call the "sixth mass extinction." Birds, amphibians,
freshwater mussels, large mammals, all have seen dwindling numbers. The
question for entomologists, Wagner said, is whether or not the decline
of insects is actually occurring faster than for some other groups,
especially because [insects are **often** [the **direct target**]{.mark}
of destruction by human, [due to **pesticide**]{.mark} and **herbicide**
[use]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Sarah Cornell, a scientist at the Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC),
raises an insect-related question relevant to our time: "There might
have been many more mass extinctions. It's just that we only see
extinctions with the things that leave a record... things with
skeletons... When people \[say\], 'we're entering the sixth mass
extinction.' Okay, well, how do we know that? We might be entering the
17th?... [[We might make **ourselves extinct**]{.underline}]{.mark}
before we even reach these hallowed glories of the sixth."

Overshooting planetary boundaries

Clearly, [the [loss]{.mark} of insect abundance\-\--[depending
on]{.mark}]{.underline} where and [**[how fast]{.mark}** it
occurs\-\--[could have]{.mark} far more **[dire,]{.mark} unforeseen
[impacts]{.mark}**]{.underline} than the loss of coffee or cashews. [The
wholesale transformation of global ecosystems, triggering **mass**
insect declines, could]{.underline} be
**[[pushing]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[Earth past]{.underline}]{.mark}

[from]{.underline} Finland, [Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia]{.underline},
[and showing a preference for]{.underline} other **[markets

Küüsvek, chief executive of the Nordic Investment Bank, which is backed
by governments in the region.

"Larger bond funds --- the more global funds --- say it's very difficult
for them to assess how big the risk is," Küüsvek said.
"[It's]{.underline} **[easier]{.underline}** to [take a]{.underline}
'**[wait and see']{.underline}** [attitude]{.underline}."

Appetite for NIB financing started to grow before the war in Ukraine in
response to higher inflation and rate rises from central banks, and has
increased in 2022, Küüsvek said.

The NIB agreed €1.2bn in loans in the first quarter of 2022, almost five
times the amount in the same period of 2021, and an increase of more
than 25 per cent on the previous quarter, with the bulk of its financing
aimed at companies.

"It's a combination of high inflation and rate hikes and the
[geopolitical uncertainties]{.underline} that [have]{.underline} mostly
**[affected]{.underline}** \[new bond issues\] in [the

In government debt markets, the yield on Finland's benchmark 10-year

per cent, according to Tradeweb data. The spread, or riskiness of the
bond relative to Europe's benchmark 10-year German bond, has widened
from 0.36 percentage points to 0.46 percentage points over the same

consistently balks at infrastructure projects in the Baltic

[are]{.underline} all **[vital]{.underline}** [for the security of the

with resistance from other countries and EU bodies; just to cite here
that Germany's Federal Network Agency rejected the project's request for
a pass from a new EU gas directive\[25\]. One notable example is also
the Belarusian nuclear power plant----located some 55 kilometers off
Vilnius----that got funds from Russia and violates international safety
requirements. In its report, the International Atomic Energy Agency, or

2.2.1 Well-being in a circular economy. A RE-mind for a good life

A metanoia5 to circular economy. By 2050 the Baltic Sea Region has
abandoned the linear economic model that had structured the economy in
the region and beyond for several years. Linear economy, summarised as
the 'take -- make -- waste' model, was based on taking natural resources
to make products for different uses, to then discard them as waste
(Ellen MacArthur Foundation, n.d.). Realising that resources are not
eternal and to maintain resource efficiency, the Baltic Sea Region is
the first macro-region in Europe to adopt instead a circular economy
model, continuing to be a pioneer in environmental protection. A
circular economy can operate at different levels, ranging from a
macro-level, i.e. at the city, region, nation or beyond level, to a
meso-level, i.e. at eco-industrial parks to a micro level, i.e. at
products, companies and consumers level (EESC, 2019). In a circular
economy, all resources matter and every waste count. Waste can not only
be recycled but also transformed into other forms of resources and new
materials, while products can be designed to live longer and be
repaired. Circular economy, is, however, not only about reshaping the
production model. It is all about changing the mindset of people towards
endorsing a sharing, reusing and repairing culture and transforming
their lifestyles for their well-being. The well-being of the Baltic Sea
Region citizens does not rely on GDP growth, but instead on de-growth
and less intense production due to an advanced repairing and sharing
culture.

Averting an environmental fallout. The environmental situation in the
Baltic Sea Region was at a crucial stage already from the early 2020s.
Air pollution created pressure, especially in the urban areas of the
region, mainly as a consequence of fossil fuels burning and industrial
processes. This had affected especially places in coal transition or
highly coal dependant. At the same time, looking at the conservation
status of the Baltic Sea marine Natura 2000 habitats, the situation was
at risk. Several sandbanks, estuaries and coastal lagoons were heavily
endangered in most of the Baltic Sea Region, especially in Germany and
Denmark (EESC, 2019). Furthermore, the Baltic Sea used to be the most
polluted sea in the world, suffering from eutrophication, where nutrient
inputs to the sea resulted in a series of ecosystem changes, mainly due
to high shipping traffic and intense agriculture. All these developments
stimulated and generated a large civil society action, sparked in 2019
by the 'Fridays for future' school movements initiated in Sweden and
spread across Europe. At the same time, the UN SDGs recognised the
increased demand for natural resources puts a burden on environmental
resources and highlight the need for reducing the material footprint and
urged for a fundamental shift towards sustainable consumption and
production (United Nations Economic and Social Council, 2019). Following
these, a strong political and social movement took the big leap: to
transform the status quo so as to improve citizens' quality of life
through a paradigm shift to a circular economy.

• Sharing is more than caring. The sharing or collaborative economy is
the first key notion prevailing in a circular economy. The sharing
culture is recognising its hype by the millennials and the generation Z,
who choose access to ownership being more reluctant to buy items but
rather favour services that give access to different goods (Goldman
Sachs, n.d.). This sharing economy can be organised through sharing
business models: sharing products, such as sharing of tools within the
local community, sharing of washing machines within blocks of buildings,
car-sharing in the case of commuting or longer trips. The development of
the socalled 'time banks', i.e. a system where people agree to exchange
services and different skills without money, using hours as currency, is
also one part of the sharing economy. Sharing houses is also common,
offering shared apartments, not only as holiday accommodation but as the
new living. In addition to these, people do not only share objects and
skills. They also share offices working in open work-spaces abandoning
the rather centralised working structures of the past.

• Repairing is now a state of mind changing consumption patterns. People
do not consume uncontrollably favouring the low prices to high quality.
Instead, they adopt new consumption behaviours, where they consciously
choose higher quality products, designed and crafted with higher quality
resources so as to last longer and be repairable. E-waste, for instance,
is either recycled or repaired to be sold at lower prices. This
repairing culture is adopted by big and smaller industries offering
repairing guarantees, and also in-house repairs are possible, especially
given the continuous technological progress. 3D printers are available
in local shops, allowing to print smaller parts needed to replace and
fix in-house and with limited costs. People organise themselves through
online platforms, offering repairing services in different local and
urban centres. The repairing economy allows for urban and local
communities to revive, as small companies and community initiatives are
more networked. Additive manufacturing plays a role in, having an impact
on the production localisation and costs and the recycling potential of
a different material (ESPAS, 2016) when it comes to larger productions.

• Companies close the circle. Companies or bigger industries specialised
in producing from electrics to furniture to clothing adjust their
production to the new sharing and repairing economy and the emergence of
the 'prosumer model' (people produce and consume their products in a
rather regional or local scale). Companies produce less, higher quality,
hence more expensive, products, to ensure they last longer. They 32 also
offer special repair services for the products they produce extending
the lives of their products or guarantee that their products can be
fully recycled after their use, or that they have used recycled products
for the production. Unlike the linear economy where selling of products
is the ultimate goal, in a circular economy, companies may rent their
materials so that they are returned for reuse, or companies create
incentives to guarantee the return (McKinsey Quarterly, 2014). This
shift in the different industries is also supported by tax reliefs,
allowing them to cope with the competition. Circular-label gives
companies more credibility and respect for their social and
environmental responsibility. Most smaller shops are also going
zero-waste, having abolished any packaging, plastic or paper bags and
alike.

• Re-industrialisation through products 'made in the BSR'. The new
consumption and production models shape and form the
re-industrialisation in the BSR, as more products are now produced by
local communities, in-house or in small scale productions. Products, now
being produced in the Baltic Sea Region, labelled as 'Made in the Baltic
Sea Region' may increase competitiveness and resilience of the regional
economy, increase business success, create new jobs and reduce the
dependence from global resources, making the BSR less dependent on
global changes.

• Digital accessibility is essential. The 4th industrial revolution is a
reality, and continuous technological progress is unavoidable in 2050.
There is high speed, and accessible internet in all corners of the BSR
and everyone in 2050 is a digital native. Online platforms do not only
serve as a basis for services exchange. They also function as online
support, providing videos with instructions or interactive sessions on
how to repair different machines or items, so that people can repair
them at home. This becomes particularly handy for the elderly or people
in remote areas. Furthermore, AI accelerates the circular economy
process, by allowing rapid prototyping and testing when designing
circular products or different components, support to increase product
circulation when operating circular business models and optimise
circular infrastructure through improving the processes of the circular
economy loops (Ellen MacArthur Foundation and Google, 2019).

• Eco-vation: an ecological touch to innovation. Eco-vation, i.e.
innovation in the area of green economy is also necessary for the
circular economy model. Among the eco-innovation leaders have been
Sweden, Finland and Denmark, Estonia, but also to a lesser extent
Lithuania being average eco-innovation leaders and the rest of the BSR
countries catching up. Among the eco-innovation activities belong
eco-innovation patents, products exports of eco-industries, value of
green early-stage investments and others (European Commission, n.d.)
related to building up research on new ways of producing or new
solutions to waste management.

• Technology gives employment a new twist. Robotization has taken up,
with increasing use of machine learning algorithms and AI. Most of these
platforms may be organised through automated algorithms and AI machines
without necessarily any human interaction. The technological progress
has also changed employment types, where more jobs are automated in the
BSR in 2050. Hence 'technological unemployment' is also to be expected
in the Baltic Sea Region. To balance social inequalities, governments
impose higher taxes to the big companies managing the different online
platforms. Pigouvian taxes (i.e. taxes on activities generating negative
effects) have also be imposed to companies not introducing the circular
economy model in their production, or on the contrary give incentives to
companies, smaller SMEs or micro-enterprises through tax reliefs or
other benefits for introducing circular economy business models
(Interreg Baltic Sea Region, 2019).

• Manufacturing is back on track. The shift to a circular economy in the
BSR opens new employment opportunities. Although the technological
advancements may automate a number of jobs, new jobs related to the new
model are created (e.g. repairing or related to high-end innovations,
where niche professions are needed). The circular economy model in the
Baltic Sea results in a more de-scaled production and consumption that
increases the repair industry. This requires people and staff with
relevant and specific knowhow. Jobs related especially to manufacturing
or similar handcrafting professions will be necessary to accommodate the
new regionalised production systems. In addition to the hand-made,
higher quality products, manufacturers are also employed in the
repairing industry. Such a reviving manufacturing focus puts older
professions and hence older people who used to be employed in that
sector into the spotlight. In this case, ageing turns into an advantage
as the silver economy here plays a role and older people can, on the one
hand, teach younger generations those arts, while at the same time
continue earning ends meet. In the line of the sharing economy, a lot of
voluntary work is also seen. People get engaged in supporting actions
for cleaning the environment, being organised in groups to clean streets
or beaches, or mobilising the civil society for similar actions.
Furthermore, given the more minimalist, localised and regional
production, as well as the lower lose their global character and
importance in the region and small shops with a rather regional identity
flourish. 33

• Bio and organic agricultural production. [Agricultural practices have
become less intense, and producers focus on more sustainable, bio and
organic production where pesticides are banned or reduced to the
minimum]{.underline}. [This results in a healthier and more sustainable
production of food]{.underline} with increasing local farming. People
responsively have reduced meat consumption, going rather 'beyond meat',
vegan or vegetarian and hence reducing the need for arable land (Baltic
Ecological Agriculture and Society, n.d.). Sustainable forestry and
logging and provision of wood materials are also an important element
for the provision of material (ESPON, 2019b). At the same time, urban
gardening is also promoted with citizens even in the urban areas being
engaged in gardening and very local production activities. Hence, people
in the BSR prefer the socalled 'slow' food, supporting local food
cultures and traditions. Nevertheless, this limits the available sources
and cannot cover the needs of the whole BSR, making the reliance on
other countries for the import of primary sources a necessity.

• Transportation changes. Due to regionalisation of production, the long
livelihood of products, the local food production, sharing culture and
the minimalist choice of the way of living, freight transport and
logistics become secondary as fewer bulks of products need to be
transferred across the region. This specifically regards air, rail and
road logistics with the respective hubs losing importance. At the same
time, transport becomes more expensive as its importance is reduced.
Further logistics means are experimented, such as drone deliveries,
especially to the more remote areas. On the other hand, as car sharing
is a norm and people choose to use fewer cars and more public transport
and bikes where possible, the regional and multi-modal transport
increases. Faster, reliable and well-connected public transport is
necessary to facilitate people's transportation when necessary. Given
the rather regionalised production and less dependency on global
markets, shipping has declined. • Renewables' added value. The renewable
energies capacity is expanded and the main energy source, with
especially bioenergy, wind, solar, hydro energy capacity dominating.
Furthermore, given the reduced global connections of the region in this
scenario, the substitution of fossil fuels with renewables reduces the
exposure of the region to global energy prices and changes.
Decentralised energy solutions such as small-scale biomass,
photovoltaic, wind and hydropower support the 'prosumer' model.
Renewable energy production creates added value in the income and
employment, generated from its production, transformation distribution,
as well as manufacturing, R&D and trade (Interreg Baltic Sea Region,
2018). Investments in buildings energy efficiency have also taken place,
with better insulation material being used and solar panel windows
replacing glass windows.

• [The environment is getting better]{.underline}. [Natural resources
are **highly preserved**, and their exploitation is
controlled]{.underline}. Also, [eutrophication in the Baltic Sea has
reached a good status, as people have become more aware of the
environmental consequences]{.underline} of their consumption habits.
Back in 2015, it was estimated that about 3.8 -- 4.4 billion euros were
lost in citizens' welfare every year due to eutrophication (based on
HELCOM, 2018). The increased citizens' commitment and 'willingness to
pay' has played a role in improving the environmental conditions in the
Baltic Sea Region and thus, their well-being. Environmental valuation
methods are applied to see the changes in human welfare due to the
effects of the environmental changes looking at the citizens'
willingness to pay for these changes. Furthermore, less mass production,
together with the increasing sharing culture and the high % of market
share in the collaborative economy, results in a high environmental
impact, reducing the environmental footprint of the region in the 2050
(European Commission, 2017). Similarly, the decreased use of cars and
aeroplanes and the shift to renewable energy production also resulted in
less CO2 emissions reducing air pollution.

• Living a healthier life. A cleaner environment constitutes a
precondition for a healthier life. At the same time, technological
advancements allow people to live healthier and longer. Specialised
medicine built upon nano- , bio- and information technology
revolutionise healthcare, delivering high-end and personalised treatment
(European Strategy and Policy Analysis System, 2015). This, however, may
increase social disparities, as high-end healthcare may be accessible to
those citizens who can afford it, causing the reshape of health
policies. There is less stress and burnout effects, as a clean and
peaceful environment reduces anxiety. 'Horticultural therapies' and
gardening practices help in relaxing and de-stressing people (Shechet,
2019). People of the Baltic Sea Region aim for happy and healthy life,
following and living in practice well-being trends as 'hygge' and
'lagom' for a life fulfilment and joy, anticipating the UN SDGs of 2019
on ensuring 'healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages'
(United Nations Economic and Social Council, 2019).

• Educating the new state of mind. A good education is a prerequisite in
2050. First, this is the means towards educating citizens for a more
sustainable way of living, starting from recycling to sharing and
repairing. Although the education levels remain high in the first levels
of education, more specialisation is seen in high school and higher
education. Even for the manufacturing jobs, more specialised training
and education are 34 necessary, while for the niche innovation jobs,
high-quality education is needed. Given the technological progress,
massive online courses are a norm, and the majority of people join
online courses, leaving the high end and high-quality education only for
those who can afford it.

• Well-being in a circular economy. In a circular economy, prosperity
and well-being are of utmost importance and goes beyond GDP. It is
achieved through improving especially the environment quality, health
and government. Especially the latter, together with trust, are key
aspects for a circular economy implementation. In a world where
technology accelerates and digital technologies prevail, more openness
and participation of citizens is possible, bringing at the same time
more responsibility, accountability and transparency of the different
players of society (European Commission, Joint Research Centre, 2019).
Hence a political and social will are necessary to achieve a mindset
shift towards a circular economy that goes beyond resource management
and waste reduction (ESPON, 2018b) and finds eudaemonia in a 'less is
more' attitude.

• New virtue values? Peoples' lifestyles have transformed towards a way
of living that is in full accordance with nature. This virtuous life,
following the virtual ethics as expressed by the Stoic philosophers,
aims at improving the quality of life and the well-being of people, who
have chosen to live in harmony with their overall environment. A new
societal model has emerged, where people share more and consciously
change their consumption habits for the common good and environmental
sustainability. Good government has contributed to achieving better life
fulfilment by introducing policies that support such actions and improve

• Neighbours relation: together we stand. Cooperation on the transition
towards a sustainable economy was highlighted as a common priority focus
area for the Baltic Sea Region in the Baltic 2030 Action Plan. The
Sustainable Development Goals related to 'zero hunger', 'industry,
innovation and infrastructure', clean water and sanitation',
'responsible consumption and production', 'affordable and clean energy',
'life below water' and 'decent work and economic growth' have taken up
and cooperation both within the Baltic Sea Region, as well as with its
Russian and Belarussian neighbours has increased so as to reduce waste,
adopt more sustainable production and consumption patterns and
lifestyles, more sustainable agriculture, protect the ecosystems and
reduce water pollution, support among others, green and blue economies
(Council of the Baltic Sea States, 2017). Furthermore, there is still
energy dependency from the Russian market, to a much lesser extent,
though, than 30 years ago.

• United in diversity in the European Union. The BSR is not an island.
European Union policies continue playing an important role in the BSR in
2050 and shape the future where possible. Policies related to improving
waste management, recycling, plastic bans and circular economy are
largely taken up by Baltic Sea Region policymakers, as also do new
developments in the Common Agricultural Policy, towards more sustainable
agriculture and policies around renewable energies and reduction of CO2
emissions. Cooperation with other regions and involvement in
transnational and cross-border programmes within the BSR, but also
beyond are necessary. Cohesion Policy needs to be further strengthened
in the region to reduce spatial disparities that are also possible in
this scenario. At the same time, policies that can strengthen the
competitiveness of the region are needed, given the highly decentralised
and regionalised territorial character of the circular economy.

Is the Baltic States really the new Mecca for innovation and technology?
That question was among a number discussed at an international online
conference where representatives of five countries of the Baltic Sea
Region---Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and Germany---deliberated
the changes to the political, economic and business landscapes, as well
change and crisis management strategies.

**[Renowned [experts]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in]{.mark} fields as
**diverse** as politics, diplomacy, economy, business and trade,
**foreign affairs**, regulatory compliance, **[tech]{.mark}nology**
[and]{.mark} **[innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as well as
consultancy agencies, together [[concluded]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
pandemic had had significant effects on the region's future. The
reflection can be summarized as: \"Things will never be as they were,
therefore we need to work together in order to provide the best possible
outcomes for our businesses and comunitites."

The strategic dialogue revealed [that [advancements in digitalisation
have]{.mark} **[sped up]{.mark}**]{.underline} by five to ten years as a
result of the pandemic and the EU Green Deal initiative, yet they have
also brought new challenges. Therefore, the need for alignment on
strategic transformations were discussed, at the centre of which should
be region-wide cooperation and change management strategies for all
areas of life.

Progress in the region is hampered by competition

The Honorary Consul of the Republic of Lithuania in Hamburg, Dr. Dietmar
O. Reich, noted that [[Baltic]{.mark} States [are]{.mark} often
[described as a]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[Mecca]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[[for **innovation**]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}. [International
[investors are drawn to the region's]{.mark}
**[laser]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} **[tech]{.mark}nology**
sector]{.underline}, [[as well as the]{.mark} **[strong
conditions]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} **[start-ups]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[that exist there, [and development of]{.mark} **[IT]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[innovations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Internal
competition, however, is limting progress for the entire region.

Global Change Expert, CEO and Founder of ADMIS Consultancy, Vaiva
Adomaityte, stated: "[[If the]{.mark} entire **[B]{.mark}**altic
**[S]{.mark}**ea **[R]{.mark}**egion
**[collaborates]{.mark}**]{.underline} to centralise their strategic
investment management functions and international commerce, as well as
streamlining economic development projects, [[they could become
a]{.mark} **very [strong]{.mark}** independent economic
[bloc]{.mark}]{.underline}."

According to the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the
Parliament of the Republic of Latvia, Rihards Kols, projects such as
GovTech Lab in Lithuania, e-Residency in Estonia and the e-Parliament
model in Latvia, which went live in May 2020, are among a number of
examples of how a model created in one country can be successfully
transferred and implemented in another country, thereby achieving
greater alignment and mutual progress.

The pandemic has demonstrated the growing need to diversify partnerships
in order to create more opportunities and build more resilient models.
Discussions at the conference thus sought out ways to improve
cooperation mechanisms within the Baltic region and the wider EU, and
with other countries globally, including in Asia and Africa. At the same
time, [[relations with]{.mark} neighbouring [Russia]{.mark} remain
**[complicate]{.mark}d** due to **political tensions**]{.underline},
[and do not]{.underline} currently [allow for the building of **stable
partnerships**]{.underline}, despite the mutual benefits those could
bring.

It is necessary to change govarnance models to foreground an agile and
socially responsible strategy

[[In times of **seismic change**]{.mark}, [**major political** decisions
can only be implemented if]{.mark} they are **[accepted by
society]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Adomaityte highlighted how recent global
events demanded a strategic shift among governments towards social
responsibility.

Alexander Kulitz, a member of Parliament at the German Bundestag in his
speech about Germanies preparedness to face the challenges of the 21st
century noted: "it is important to allow the economy to breathe for it
to grow". Kulitz urged [the [importance of]{.mark}
**[digitalisation]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} countries governance and in
[the]{.mark} overall **[B]{.mark}**altic **[S]{.mark}**ea
**[R]{.mark}**egion strategy]{.underline}.

Result of the dialogue: 500 expert recommendations

The objective of the research study, international Baltic Sea Region
debates and questions answered by **[[500 experts]{.underline}]{.mark}**
from Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Germany and Poland- is to create a
report containing strategies and recommendations on the current
situation and [[suggest]{.mark}ing]{.underline} key priorities for
international collaboration, while outlining a joint economic strategy
for the Baltic Sea Region countries.

"[[The **potential**]{.mark} [of the **B**]{.mark}altic **[S]{.mark}**ea
**[R]{.mark}**egion has been mentioned]{.underline} in Germany's
strategic business development plans for quite a long time and the first
priority should be to strengthen geopolitical relations so that close
cooperation emerges," the Chairman of the Board of Federal Association
for Economic Development and Foreign Trade (BWA), Michael Schumann,
stated.

But [[recent events]{.mark} have [raised]{.mark} **[troubling
signs]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that [the norms against]{.mark} nuclear
weapons [prolif]{.mark}eration [are **breaking down**]{.mark} and that
more countries may see it in their interest to acquire
them]{.underline}. [[Governments looking at Ukraine]{.mark} and Russia
[may]{.mark} well [conclude]{.mark} that [a nuclear arsenal can help a
powerful state]{.mark} **[impose its will]{.mark}** [on its
neighbor]{.mark}]{.underline}. And they may look at North Korea and see
how even the most erratic and isolated rogue regime can acquire a degree
of international clout by building a nuclear arsenal.

And as these norms break down, the bigger concern is that the norms
against the use of nuclear weapons could follow.

"[The more [states that pursue nuclear weapons]{.mark}, that threaten to
pursue nuclear weapons, that threaten to use nuclear weapons, all of
that [increase]{.mark}s **[nuclear risk]{.mark}**, in part [because it
increases]{.mark} the risk of **[miscalc]{.mark}**ulation]{.underline},"
Kelsey Davenport, director of nonproliferation policy at the Arms
Control Association, told Grid.

Where are these risks most acute? And what can be done to contain them?

Ukraine

On the one hand, if anything demonstrates the dangers of a world with
nuclear weapons, it's the war in Ukraine. And yet, it's also a
demonstration of why countries want to have them. Russia's nuclear
arsenal is one big reason why it has been able to invade a neighboring
country (a relatively rare event in today's world) without facing an
international military response.

It also seems far less likely that Russia would have invaded had Ukraine
possessed a nuclear arsenal of its own. Compounding the frustration for
Ukrainians is the fact that the country did have nuclear weapons on its
territory --- around 1,900 Soviet warheads at the end of the Cold War in
1991, making it, on paper, the world's third-largest nuclear power. In
1994, the newly independent nation of Ukraine agreed to give those
weapons to Russia in exchange for internationally negotiated security
guarantees that turned out to not be so ironclad. While Ukraine never
actually had control of the weapons, which were connected to
command-and-control systems in Moscow, it's a powerful narrative
nonetheless. As the country's former defense minister told the New York
Times in February, shortly before the invasion, "We gave away the
capability for nothing."

Nicholas Miller, a political scientist at Dartmouth College who studies
nuclear proliferation, said the current war and recent history underline
the advantages of the nuclear capability. "It's already well understood
that nuclear weapons seem to do a pretty good job at deterring outright
invasions," he told Grid, pointing out that North Korean officials
regularly invoke the examples of Iraq and Libya, which abandoned their
weapons of mass destruction programs and then found themselves targets
of U.S.-led regime change operations. "This just kind of reinforces
that."

None of which suggests a looming global rush to obtain the bomb.
Davenport said the more likely possibility is more states engaging in
nuclear "hedging": developing the capabilities to quickly build a bomb
without crossing the red line of actually doing so. Countries have done
this as an insurance policy in case security guarantees provided by
their partners turn out not to be flawed, or weak. Japan and Germany are
often cited as examples of this "hedging" strategy.

Another potential casualty of the war in Ukraine is nuclear diplomacy
between countries that already have the weapons. Just after Biden took
office in January 2021, he and Russian President Vladimir Putin reached
a last-minute agreement to extend the New START treaty by five years.
The deal, which was signed in 2010 and limits each country to 1,550
deployed nuclear weapons, was set to expire in February 2021. Notably,
the U.S. and Russia have continued to provide each other with regular
updates about their nuclear forces, as required under the treaty, even
amid the carnage and saber-rattling of the war in Ukraine.

But it's now much harder to imagine any serious progress on arms control
diplomacy. The New START treaty will formally expire in 2026, and Ankit
Panda, senior fellow in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, told Grid "it's incredibly difficult
for me to imagine the U.S. Senate being in any mood to sort of approve
an arms control agreement with Russia that isn't anything but completely
in the United States' asymmetric favor. And that just isn't how these
agreements play out in practice."

Without progress, the New START deal and any potential future
U.S.-Russia arms-reduction agreements will be at risk.

Iran and the Middle East

The negotiations over a revival of the Iran nuclear deal have been on
life support for so long, it sometimes seems like they will never
actually die. But at the moment, it's hard to see a path forward toward
an agreement. The current sticking point is Iran's demand that the Biden
administration remove the country's Revolutionary Guard Corps from the
U.S. terrorist blacklist, where Trump placed it in 2019.

Biden has reportedly made a final decision not to delist the group,
which is accused of repressing dissent within Iran and fomenting
violence throughout the Middle East. While the two sides appeared to be
on the verge of an agreement as recently as March, talks are now
deadlocked, and the other parties to the landmark nuclear pact are
getting nervous. "Every day which passes without achieving agreement,
the risk to lose everything increases considerably," one European
diplomat told the journalist Laura Rozen. Even the chief U.S.
negotiator, Rob Malley, conceded in congressional testimony last week
that "the odds of a successful negotiation are lower than the odds of
failure."

The stakes are high. Since the U.S. quit the pact, Iran has been ramping
up the enrichment activities that the agreement prohibited. A report
from the International Atomic Energy Agency this week reportedly
concludes that Iran now likely has enough enriched uranium to allow it
to build a weapon and could convert that uranium to weapons-grade
material in just a few weeks. Does this mean that failure at the
negotiating table will lead inevitably to a nuclear-armed Iran? Not
necessarily. Some experts believe Iran, which still denies it has any
intention of building a bomb, is also pursuing a hedging strategy,
stopping just short of doing so. In this scenario, Iran would avoid the
additional sanctions and isolation that would result from actually going
nuclear, while preserving the option to do so quickly were conditions to
change.

If Iran did actually build a bomb, the risk of a regional arms race
would spiral. Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the de facto ruler of
Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival, has explicitly said that "if Iran
developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible." U.S.
intelligence agencies have reportedly been scrutinizing Saudi Arabia
efforts to produce nuclear fuel, allegedly assisted by China; these
remain far short of what would be needed to produce a bomb, but some
experts believe they represent a way for the kingdom to keep its options
open. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president of Turkey, which hosts a number of
U.S. nuclear weapons on its territory, has also talked openly about
developing a nuclear deterrent.

For the time being, the only nuclear power in the Middle East is Israel,
and it would like to keep it that way. Israel has possessed weapons
since the 1960s, though it does not publicly acknowledge that fact.
Israel has been linked to an ongoing campaign of sabotage and
assassination targeting Iran's nuclear program, including the killing of
the country's top nuclear scientist with a remote-controlled machine gun
last year. Israel has also carried out drills simulating a military
strike on Iran's nuclear program. There's reason to think this is not an
idle threat: In previous decades, Israel has carried out airstrikes on
suspected nuclear sites in Syria and Iraq.

This highlights one of the drawbacks of the "hedging" strategy: If a
country is close to developing a nuclear deterrent without actually
acquiring one, it increases rather than decreases its risk of being
attacked.

East Asia

North Korea became the world's ninth nuclear power in 2006, and as much
as the rest of the world may not like it, there's little chance it will
give up its nuclear status as long as the Kim regime is in power. From
the North Korean perspective, nuclear weapons represent a powerful hedge
against foreign invasion or regime change, and allow the country to
exert pressure and extract concessions from the U.S. and its neighbors.

Would those neighbors be better off with nuclear weapons of their own?
Most South Koreans think so. About 70 percent support their country
developing its own nuclear deterrent, according to recent polls. South
Korea had a nuclear weapons program in the 1970s but gave it up under
heavy pressure from the U.S. The country also hosted a number of U.S.
nukes from 1958 until 1991, and the U.S. continues to provide security
guarantees to South Korea, under what is often referred to as the
"nuclear umbrella."

Still, the polls suggest many Koreans would prefer to have their own
nuclear program, for the autonomy and prestige it would afford. Notably,
many of those who support a nuclear deterrent see China rather than
North Korea as the country's biggest national security threat going
forward. (China's nuclear arsenal is still tiny compared with the U.S.
and Russia, but the Pentagon assesses it could quadruple by the end of
this decade.)

The politics are starkly different in Japan, the only country where a
nuclear bomb has ever been dropped and where public opposition to their
use remains high. Nonetheless, Japan has a highly developed nuclear
enrichment program and enough materials to produce a bomb in about six
months, a state of affairs that has been dubbed its "bomb in the
basement."

Then there is Taiwan, where fears of conflict run high. An increasing
number of prominent commentators in both Washington and Taipei are now
also calling for Taiwan to develop a nuclear deterrent, rather than rely
on security guarantees from Washington, no matter how forcefully Biden
might articulate them. The lessons of the war in Ukraine may only
reinforce such jitters and increase the calls for a nuclear capability.

U.S. credibility

[**[Ultimately]{.mark}**, [when it comes to]{.mark} nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration, [the]{.mark} **most important** [country to
watch may be the **U.S**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Most proliferation
scholars argue that [countries]{.mark} tend to [build]{.mark} nuclear
[weapons]{.mark} not only when they feel threatened from abroad, but
also [when they cannot count on]{.mark} **[security
guarantees]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And for many countries, [the most
important such guarantee involves the United States.]{.underline}

This isn't a new problem. France decided to develop a nuclear deterrent
of its own in the 1950s and 1960s over concerns about the reliability of
U.S. security guarantees. President Charles de Gaulle famously asked
John F. Kennedy if the U.S. would be really be willing to "trade New
York for Paris" in the event of a Soviet attack.

[The concept of "**[extended deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}" --- [the
ability of U.S. military power to **deter attacks** against its
allies]{.underline} --- [[looks **less ironclad**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[after]{.mark} the presidency of [Trump]{.mark}, [who repeatedly
questioned]{.mark} the value of alliances with
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} and individual nations including
**[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} **[[So]{.mark}uth
[Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline}**. [[Trump denigrated]{.mark} those
[countries as]{.mark} **[freeloaders]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[suggested
they develop nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} of their own
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} may well have [[pushed to
**withdraw**]{.mark} the U.S. from NATO]{.underline} had he won a second
term, according to senior officials, including former national security
adviser John Bolton.

"For pretty much any country that is a beneficiary of American extended
deterrence, the most important national security issue is American
domestic politics," said Panda, of the Carnegie Endowment. "All their
military planning flows from this idea that at the end of the day,
American presidents would probably come to their assistance. So, I think
this 'America First' thinking really does cause a great degree of
concern in many of these countries."

[Perhaps the [Trump years were an **aberration**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
For one thing, there is now strong (though not universal) bipartisan
support for military aid to Ukraine. [[But it's worth noting that **no
existing**]{.mark} [alliances or]{.mark} prewar [**pledges** of support
were enough to deter Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}, and Ukraine had none of
the mutual defense guarantees enjoyed by members of NATO or some U.S.
allies in East Asia.

[[In the wake of]{.mark} Russia's [invasion]{.mark}, **other
[countries]{.mark}** [facing the threat]{.mark} of attack and invasion
[are likely to seek]{.mark} protection and security
[guarantees]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If [the U.S]{.mark}. and other major
powers don't want those guarantees to involve **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}, [they [need to show]{.mark} that [there
are]{.mark} **[alternative sources]{.mark}** [of
security]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[and that they]{.mark} **[actually
work]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[If not, a]{.mark} **[new race]{.mark}**
[for nuclear weapons may be on the]{.mark}

[With]{.underline} [Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} **[stability]{.underline}** [of Europe has
been]{.underline} **[shattered]{.underline}**. After four months of the
"special operation" launched by Vladimir Putin on February 24 to
"demilitarize and de-nazify Ukraine," the liberal international order is
in disarray. The devastation in [Ukraine]{.underline} with total
casualties of more than 10,000 civilians and tens of thousands of
soldiers [has]{.underline} **[resuscitated]{.underline}** [the debate of
whether]{.underline} [**relinquishing** nuclear weapons]{.underline}
[landed Ukraine in this terrible situation.]{.underline}

In 1994, [under the]{.underline} **[Budapest]{.underline}**
[memorandum]{.underline}, [Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan returned
almost 2,000 nuclear weapons to Russia]{.underline}, although Ukraine
never had operational control over the weapons. Politically, Ukraine's
decision to hand over nuclear weapons to Russia allowed Kyiv to sign the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Russia would also likely have
perceived Kyiv's nuclear arsenal as a threat, inflating regional
insecurities. More so, housing nukes could have attracted severe
international economic punishment, which would have curtailed the
prospects of Ukraine's post-Cold War economic growth.

**[However, today]{.underline}** [Ukraine might be wondering whether
keeping its nuclear weapons would have been]{.underline} a
**[better]{.underline}** idea. [The West\'s]{.underline}
**[reticence]{.underline}** [to provide]{.underline} **[timely
help]{.underline}** to Ukraine [could be persuading]{.underline}
**[other states]{.underline}** [to do so]{.underline}.

The West's sympathy for Ukraine and support through sanctions on Russia
shows an appreciation for Kyiv's dire situation. But the West does not
want to get too involved in the war or risk provoking Russia. Direct
intervention would escalate the conflict, as the West's involvement will
be interpreted by Moscow as seeking a "total defeat" of Russia. The fear
of getting entrapped in such a situation precludes NATO from providing
full-fledged support to Ukraine. [Since NATO]{.underline} military [aid
is]{.underline} still **[inadequate]{.underline}**, though generous, [it
will embolden]{.underline} Ukraine to help itself and end up in [the
quest to acquire nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

[Other states]{.underline} **[are suspicious]{.underline}** [of
Washington's **commitment to**]{.underline} [keep them "dry"
under]{.underline} the cover of [its nuclear umbrella]{.underline}. As
more states like Finland and Sweden join NATO, [the reluctance of the
United States]{.underline} "**[to trade]{.underline}** [New
York]{.underline}" [for Helsinki or Stockholm]{.underline} in a nuclear
confrontation **[will increase]{.underline}**. [Fearing]{.underline}
American [abandonment]{.underline}, [states like Germany and Japan
that]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}** [maintain]{.underline}
**[latent nuclear]{.underline}** [capabilities will **activate**
them]{.underline}.

The neutral states turning to the West have increased Washington's
responsibility to navigate the risks posed by the Russo-Ukrainian War
carefully. The West\'s disposition, ultimately, will be a litmus test of
its credibility as a reliable partner. [Failing to]{.underline}
**[assuage]{.underline}** [their fears]{.underline}, the [states
observing the plight of Ukraine may]{.underline} **[seriously
consider]{.underline}** [going nuclear]{.underline}. Sweden, by applying
for NATO membership, is hedging against future risks. After World War
II, Swedish policymakers discontinued the development of nukes due to
domestic constraints. But [the possibility of further Russian aggression
and the fear of American abandonment will]{.underline}
**[compel]{.underline}** [Sweden to resume its]{.underline} **[dormant
mission]{.underline}**.

[Kyiv\'s vulnerability]{.underline} **[is enough]{.underline}** [to
propel other states to pursue nuclear weapons as the]{.underline}
**[most strategic]{.underline}** [optimal choice for]{.underline}
**[self-preservation]{.underline}**. [Since nuclear weapons are
a]{.underline} "[defensive weapon]{.underline} **[par
excellence]{.underline}**", [Kyiv could have leveraged its nuclear
capability to]{.underline} **[blackmail]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
[Russian regime]{.underline} into backing down. If Russia failed to
oblige, the threats of using nuclear weapons to inflict heavy damage on
the other side would have been enough to discourage Russian aggression.
[Such coercive nuclear tactics]{.underline} [are easily discernible in
the case of North Korea]{.underline}, which has not shied away from
invoking nuclear threats to achieve political objectives.
**[Today]{.underline}**, [the lack of security assurances from
NATO]{.underline} and the United States [might drive Kyiv to
find]{.underline} **[solace]{.underline}** [in nuclear weapons
while]{.underline} also **[emboldening]{.underline}** [other
states]{.underline} [like]{.underline} **[Japan]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[South Korea]{.underline}** [to follow
a]{.underline} **[similar strategy]{.underline}**.

Despite Ukraine's past decision to give up nuclear weapons, Kyiv may be
wondering now about the fallacy of such a decision. Bearing the brunt of
the invasion, Ukraine could have alerted Moscow by signaling its
reliance on nuclear weapons. If threatened states, as Vipin Narang
explained in his book Seeking the Bomb: Strategies of Nuclear
Proliferation, anticipate the plausibility of coercion from other
powers, they will pursue technical capabilities to develop a nuclear
weapon no matter the challenges involved. Further, [technological
constraints]{.underline} **[rarely obstruct]{.underline}** [a state's
pursuit of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [States like
**Syria,**]{.underline} **[Taiwan]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[South Africa]{.underline}** all [tried to acquire nuclear
weapons]{.underline} **[clandestinely]{.underline}** [by generating the
necessary]{.underline} **[technical]{.underline}**
[capabilities]{.underline}. Others failed, but [South
Africa]{.underline} **[did succeed]{.underline}**. Nuclear weapons could
have forestalled Russian aggression.

The whole Russia-Ukraine crisis has caught Washington between a rock and
a hard place. [Washington will]{.underline} **[have to
navigate]{.underline}** [this geopolitical]{.underline}
**[tightrope]{.underline}** [cautiously]{.underline}. [Russian threats
have]{.underline} **[created anxiety]{.underline}** [in most
states]{.underline}, [demanding a]{.underline} **[more
credible]{.underline}** [commitment from the United States]{.underline}.
[While assurances may have mattered before, allies will now]{.underline}
**[demand]{.underline}** [more tangible commitments.]{.underline}
[Failing to do that will]{.underline} **[ensure]{.underline}** [greater
nuclear proliferation]{.underline} which may ensure peace but could also
be more menacing if not handled responsibly.

KL\]

One of the most dangerous and far-reaching repercussions of Russia's
invasion of Ukraine is the subversion of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT)---perhaps the most critical multilateral agreement for the
survival of humanity. Since its first attack on Ukraine in 2014,
Russia's actions have put the logic of the treaty to prevent the spread
of atomic weapons on its head. Because Ukraine once possessed nuclear
weapons but gave them up when it joined the NPT in 1994, Russia's
renewed aggression makes it look as if the treaty's purpose is to keep
weak countries defenseless and prey to the nuclear-weapon states.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said as much at the start of the war,
when he announced that he had put his country's nuclear forces on alert
and issued ominous threats to anyone daring to get in Russia's way.

In the early 1990s, newly independent Ukraine briefly possessed more
nuclear warheads than Britain, France, and China combined. Ukraine had
inherited from the Soviet Union some 1,900 strategic and 2,500 tactical
nuclear weapons stationed on its territory. However, against the
background of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster and in the spirit of
the geopolitical optimism of the early post-Cold War years, Kyiv decided
that Ukraine would become entirely free of nuclear weapons.

To be sure, Ukraine was unable to use most of its nuclear weapons at the
time, as the command centers were still in Moscow. Yet it had
accumulated not just the warheads, but also the specialized technology
and engineering expertise it could easily have used to be a nuclear
weapons state---by keeping a reserve of enriched uranium or plutonium,
or even nuclear ammunition and warheads. Under considerable pressure
from Moscow but also with generous help from Washington, Kyiv quickly
transferred its entire nuclear arsenal to Russia. Ukraine signed and
ratified the NPT as a non-nuclear state.

In exchange for full denuclearization, Washington, Moscow, and London
agreed to provide Kyiv with additional security pledges. At a summit of
the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (the predecessor
of today's Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) in
1994, the four countries signed the now-famous Budapest Memorandum,
named for the city where the summit was held. In this document, the
nonproliferation regime's three guarantor powers---the United States,
Britain, and Russia (as the legal successor of the Soviet
Union)---assured Ukraine of its sovereignty, the security of its
territory, and its freedom from economic and political pressure.

The two other official nuclear-weapon states under the NPT, China and
France, followed suit. They provided Ukraine with separate governmental
declarations expressing their respect for Ukraine's state and borders.
Similar written pledges were made to Belarus and Kazakhstan, two other
post-Soviet states that had inherited parts of the Soviet nuclear
arsenal. The two countries also agreed to transfer their warheads to
Russia.

The NPT---which has been signed by 191 countries, more than any other
arms control agreement---was finalized in 1968 and went into effect in
1970. The treaty's goal is to avert the spread of nuclear weapons,
foster cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and work
toward complete nuclear disarmament. It was extended indefinitely in
1995, not the least against the background of the successful
denuclearization of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.

The NPT is the bedrock of the global nuclear nonproliferation regime. It
contains the only binding commitment to the goal of disarmament by the
nuclear-weapon states. The agreement explicitly acknowledges that
preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons cannot be achieved by
individual states but requires the dedication and collaboration of the
global community.

The NPT also contains the obligation of nuclear-weapon states to not
transfer nuclear arms to other states---and of non-nuclear-weapon states
to refrain from receiving, manufacturing, or acquiring nuclear weapons.
It includes a promise by nuclear-weapon states to help promote the
development of civilian nuclear applications of all treaty parties. In
its preamble, the NPT recalls that countries must refrain, in accordance
with the United Nations Charter, "from the threat or use of force
against the territorial integrity or political independence of any
State."

The effect of the nonproliferation regime has so far been that the vast
majority of countries have abstained from acquiring atomic arms. Outside
the NPT, only India, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan have developed
their own nuclear weapons capability. However, their arsenals are
smaller than those of the NPT's five official nuclear-weapon states:
Britain, China, France, Russia, and the United States, which are also
permanent U.N. Security Council members. More than half a century after
its signing, the NPT remains largely intact. Its 10th review conference
is scheduled for later this year after several postponements due to the
coronavirus pandemic.

With Russia's military and nonmilitary attacks on Ukraine since 2014,
the seizure and annexation of Ukrainian territory, and the ongoing
invasion, the Kremlin has put the logic of the nonproliferation regime
on its head. With the nuclear-weapon states' security guarantee to
Ukraine so obviously worthless, it looks now as if the NPT's purpose is
to provide the five official nuclear-weapon states---which happen to be
the world's strongest conventional military powers as well---with an
opportunity to extend, at relatively low cost, their territories. They
can do so at the expense of smaller nations naive enough to believe in
the rule of international law, which have signed the NPT as
non-nuclear-weapon states.

Russia's behavior toward Ukraine since 2014 is thus a threat to the
integrity of the NPT, the global order of which it is a foundation, and
the security of the NPT's 191 signatories, including Russia itself. By
so obviously breaking the NPT, Russia has severely undermined worldwide
faith in the plausibility of nonproliferation, diminished the will of
individual states to participate in its pursuit, and increased the
potential and temptation for additional states and nonstate actors to
acquire and use nuclear weapons. Russia's attacks on and dismemberment
of Ukraine thus erode the security of all.

What long-term incentives will Russia's renewed attack on Ukraine
create?

Russia was able to attack Ukraine because the former is a nuclear-weapon
state. Not only does Ukraine lack these arms to deter an attack, but it
is also forbidden by the NPT to obtain them. Were Ukraine a nuclear
power, Putin and his military leaders surely would have thought twice
before launching their invasion.

Middle powers not protected by larger alliances such as NATO can learn
three simple lessons. First, it is good to have nuclear weapons---either
to advance your designs on another country's territory or to deter just
such an attack. Second, it is not good to give your weapons away. Third,
it makes little sense to rely on treaties, memoranda, assurances, and
other statements---even if they are fully ratified, legally binding, and
supported by the governments of the world's most powerful countries.

For many countries, the lesson will be to follow a wiser policy than
Kyiv did when it gave away its warheads and nuclear material. Instead, a
country's chances to stay sovereign and keep its territory intact will
be higher if it obtains and keeps nuclear warheads. Starting a new
nuclear weapons program isn't easy today, but once a new, disruptive
technology makes it easier to develop or buy nuclear weapons, many
countries will want to get them---all the more so if they have a
rapacious neighbor that already has such weapons or that they suspect of
wanting to get some.

For that rapacious neighbor, the lesson is that it might get a chance to
grab a piece of another country lacking sufficiently deadly arms and
naively trusting international law. Following Putin's playbook, resolute
threats to use nuclear warheads will make sure that no outside powers
will come to the help of a non-nuclear neighbor that's under attack.
Russia has shown that an attacker with nuclear arms is fundamentally
safe. Even far short of a full-scale invasion, Russian behavior in
Georgia and elsewhere demonstrates again and again that it can act with
impunity, with a few minor arms deliveries and economic sanctions the
worst possible reaction by outside powers---and even those sanctions are
usually weak and abolished over time.

What else do you need to know to find the bomb an attractive solution?

NATO Nuclear Deterrence

[**Nuclear deterrence** has been at the **core**]{.underline} [of NATO's
collective defence]{.underline} for 70 years.

In an uncertain world, nuclear weapons continue to play a critical role
in NATO's deterrence and defence. The purpose of NATO's nuclear
capability is to preserve peace, prevent coercion, and deter aggression.

Nuclear weapons are unique, and the circumstances in which NATO might
contemplate the use of them are extremely remote. However, [[if
the]{.mark} **fundamental [security]{.mark}** [of **any Ally**]{.mark}

capabilities and **[[resolve]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to defend
itself]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [including [with **nuc**]{.mark}**lear
weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

NATO is committed to creating the conditions for a world without nuclear
weapons, in line with Allies' commitments to the Non-Proliferation
Treaty. Since the end of the Cold War, the number of nuclear weapons
available to NATO in Europe has been reduced dramatically, by around 90
percent.

However, [as long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a **nuclear
Alliance**]{.underline} and Allies will continue to take all steps
necessary to ensure NATO's nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and
effective.

Two key words were missing from the statements that followed the
inaugural in-person summit in September of the Quadrilateral Security
Dialogue, also known as the Quad, which features Australia, India,
Japan, and the United States. The first absent word was predictable:
"China." Although the country's growing strength is the clear
geopolitical impetus for this Indo-Pacific grouping, officials are at
pains to portray their efforts as positive and not about containing a
rival. The other omitted word, however, was both less obvious and more
important. The four governments released a set of joint principles on
technology, emphasizing shared values, fair competition, and an "open,
accessible, and secure technology ecosystem." That rhetoric may sound
familiar enough from four countries meeting to champion a "free, open,
rules-based order." But for years, each of these governments, almost
reflexively, would also have advocated for an even bigger technological
vision: a "global" one.

Almost from its inception, idealists saw in the Internet the radical
potential to help bridge divides among people. Digital connectivity
spread rapidly during the heady post--Cold War period in which
globalization surged and democracy, to many, seemed triumphant.
Techno-globalism took root as an ideal among diplomats, scholars, and
technologists who believed in free and open exchange both as a virtue in
and of itself and as a means to spread political and economic freedoms.

The most utopian techno-globalist visions were never realized. Indeed,
one reason political leaders embraced a free and open global Internet
was to advocate against efforts to wall off parts of the Web:
authoritarian governments, especially in China, worked quickly and
effectively to erect digital barriers that prevented their citizens from
freely accessing the Internet. Even as U.S. diplomats preached openness,
the country's defense and intelligence sectors perceived new risks and
used the Internet to advance more parochial national security interests.
Today, far short of the leveled playing field many hoped for, access to
the Internet and the benefits that flow from it remains highly unequal
around the world.

The recent statements and actions at the Quad and beyond suggest that
many long-standing supporters of a global Internet now have moved toward
a new vision of technological development: a world fractured between
competing national or ideological blocs, each relying on its own trusted
hardware and software suppliers to defend against malign interference.
To abandon the global ideal in favor of clubs of techno-democracies or
techno-autocracies, however, is to abandon a crucial recognition of the
Internet age---that despite real divides, humanity and its technologies
are stubbornly interconnected.

[[A]{.mark} permanent [tech]{.mark}nological [divide is
**unlikely**]{.mark}, **[costly]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark}
**[impractical]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, [[it is
**undesirable**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Without
**interdependence**]{.mark}, [rivals will treat each other with]{.mark}
**[less restraint]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[increasing the likelihood
of]{.mark} **[serious confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The United
States already has a special responsibility to think in global terms
about the Internet and digital technology; from Facebook to Google,
American titans of industry bestride the world. The Internet's ability
to advance human rights may have been hugely exaggerated, but its
capacity to do harm has not, and Washington must think and act globally
in keeping its technology giants in check.

THE DUSK OF TECHNO-GLOBALISM

Like it or not, the Internet and its associated [[tech]{.mark}nologies
[are]{.mark} **[global endeavors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Their
development---especially in the United States---has depended on human
ingenuity, raw materials, and labor sourced from around the world.
[[They have required]{.mark} **[knowledge
sharing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**[o]{.mark}**pen-**[source]{.mark}**
development]{.underline}, [[and **scientific collaboration**]{.mark}
a[cross]{.mark} [borders]{.mark}]{.underline}. Internet technology's
most radical contribution to history---near-instantaneous communications
networks that reach a huge portion of humanity---relies upon fiber-optic
cables that span borders and traverse the sea floor, a place the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea dubs "the common heritage of mankind."

For decades, diplomats and intellectuals from the United States and many
other countries promoted the ideal of "one internet, one global
community, and a common body of knowledge that benefits and unites us
all," as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in her landmark 2010
Internet freedom speech. The Obama administration's 2011 International
Strategy for Cyberspace warned that "the alternative to global openness
and interoperability is a fragmented Internet, where large swaths of the
world's population would be denied access to sophisticated applications
and rich content because of a few nations' political interests."

A permanent technological divide is unlikely, costly, and impractical.

Until recently, other Quad countries shared the same enthusiasm for this
techno-globalist view. Australia's 2017 international strategy for
cyber-engagement is thick with references to a global community, global
rule making, and a global online marketplace. Cybersecurity strategies
issued by India and Japan in 2013 likewise spoke approvingly of a
worldwide Internet community. These governments, in words if not always
in deeds, advocated for an open and global technology environment as
opposed to the more fenced-off and draconian corners of the Internet in
China, Russia, and elsewhere.

A global Internet, however, need not be an ungoverned one. Countries
that advanced a techno-globalist vision of the Internet and decried the
"cyber-sovereignty" claims of authoritarians still exercised sovereign
powers of their own, for instance in restricting child pornography. Some
governments in Europe have instituted strong limits on hate speech, such
as Germany's Network Enforcement Act, which requires the swift deletion
of illegal speech online. Still, until recently, these countries'
strategies took openness to the world as a starting point and sought to
protect against a limited number of specific risks.

The liberal principles of openness, universal human rights, and fair
market access still appear in current diplomatic initiatives, such as in
the Quad's statement of principles regarding technology or at the
EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council launched in September. But this
rhetoric does not negate a tilt away from techno-globalism. The United
States and its allies are increasingly aware of new vulnerabilities
emanating from their connections to the world. The Internet's
dangers---such as the potential for cyberattacks and the dissemination
of disinformation on a vast scale---have become clearer, inspiring a
nationalist turn in several key democratic countries.

RISING BARRIERS

The democratic countries where techno-globalists were once unrestrained
in their advocacy of an open Internet now have become preoccupied with
technology's risks. The Internet has allowed hostile state and nonstate
actors to traverse borders. Criminal groups have launched ransomware
attacks that paralyzed transnational shipping companies and wreaked
havoc on global trade. Systemic problems in the digital device market
have led to basic security vulnerabilities in everything from connected
thermostats to industrial control systems used by power and water
utilities. From elections to vaccines, disinformation presents acute
domestic and global challenges.

As a result, leaders in India, the United States, and other erstwhile
champions of a global Internet have in the last four years sought to
impose more control over networks. Mirroring the actions of
authoritarian governments, they seek to sever operational and supply
chain ties, especially with China and especially in Internet sectors.
The perceived threat of infiltration or sabotage is no longer confined
to critical infrastructure vendors such as the Chinese firm Huawei but
radiates now from other areas, such as social media and the consumer
drone industry.

The Internet's dangers have inspired a nationalist turn in key
democratic countries.

Amid this shift, official rhetoric has dropped the "global" in speaking
of technology and the Internet. The Trump administration's 2018 National
Cyber Strategy aspired to "promote an open, interoperable, reliable, and
secure Internet"---but not necessarily a global one. Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo's Clean Network initiative called for expelling "untrusted"
Chinese applications from U.S. app stores and keeping U.S. data away
from Chinese-run cloud systems. The government of Narendra Modi, India's
nationalist prime minister, recently upheld its 2020 ban on dozens of
Chinese software applications.

Distrust of the global Internet goes beyond nationalist politicians. A
wide range of cybersecurity, data governance, and industrial policy
experts identify integration between the United States and China in
hardware supply chains and online services as a risk to national
security. Questions around the integrity of the 2016 U.S. presidential
election sparked broad fears that the Internet could undermine
democratic institutions. Many thinkers who recoiled at the Trump
administration's caustic style---for instance, the president's crude
insistence on terms such as the "Wuhan virus" for the novel
coronavirus---nevertheless believe China represents a model of digital
authoritarianism that must be confronted, or at least isolated. In this
darkening light, the global Internet can appear like a naive dream of
years past.

Today, [[many democracies are making]{.mark} **[messy efforts]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} build consensus around [countering
China]{.mark}]{.underline} and other countries identified with digital
authoritarianism. [The]{.underline} British-led [**D-10**, for
example]{.underline}, seeks alternatives to China's telecommunications
firm Huawei in the rollout of 5G technology. In December, the White
House will hold a "Summit for Democracy," which advocates hope will
advance a multilateral democratic counterweight to authoritarian
technological practices. [[These efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} are not
without merit, but they [[represent a **defensive**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**[reactive]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[response to a]{.mark}
**[deeper]{.mark}** [problem]{.mark}]{.underline}. At best, these
initiatives might allow like-minded countries to regroup and find common
ground before turning to face global challenges; just as likely,
[[they]{.mark} could [prove to be]{.mark} simply **[diplomatic
busywork]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[as]{.mark} **[stubborn
disagreements]{.mark}** [persist among democratic governments]{.mark}
and interest groups]{.underline}.

SALVAGING THE GLOBAL

A better approach would recognize from the outset that the Internet and
the development of technology are invariably global and cannot be easily
fractured between competing political blocs. Dividing the Internet at
the infrastructure level into two or more independent networks would
mean duplicating entire highly complex supply chains, which would be
extremely costly, carbon-inefficient, and impractical, if even possible
in the first place. Such fissures would also not prevent innovations or
indeed threats---including malicious attacks and natural
disasters---from crossing political divides.

A stark technological divide is not just unrealistic but also
undesirable. Embracing a trend toward politically delineated
technological ecosystems will undermine the open ethos that fuels and
benefits freer societies---and bolster the top-down, controlling ethos
favored by repressive regimes. And if rivals are less interdependent,
they have less incentive to refrain from crippling attacks on each
other's critical infrastructures.

A stark technological divide is not just unrealistic but also
undesirable.

Only a renewed and pragmatic embrace of techno-globalism will offer
comprehensive solutions to the real problems of technological
governance. [Policymakers must adopt a global vision]{.underline} that
avoids the folly of believing that technical systems and industrial
supply chains can be totally walled off from countries such as China.
They should develop solutions that recognize the value and inevitability
of international connection. Moreover, as home to many of the companies
and individuals that most influence the experience of the Internet
around the world, the United States has a special role it cannot ignore.
Firms such as Google and Facebook shape how rights to privacy and free
expression are protected---or abused---and their motivations cannot be
assumed to be virtuous, nor their stewardship of online communities
ethical, simply because they reside in the United States. Cyber-utopians
once dreamed of liberation spreading from an Ethernet cable; now
Washington must ensure that its companies don't spread exploitation and
insecurity instead.

Responsible techno-globalism starts at home. The U.S. Congress must pass
a comprehensive federal data privacy law to protect Americans from the
overreach of technology companies and to demonstrate a commitment to
democratic governance in the Internet age. U.S. thinkers and
policymakers should take a global view in analyzing the human rights and
security implications of surveillance technology produced in both
democratic and authoritarian contexts. Officials must seek ways to enjoy
the maximum benefits of open scientific exchange and cooperation while
protecting important national security interests, for instance by
narrowly targeting security-related areas for special scrutiny but
actively reaffirming openness in other fields, including for students
and researchers with connections to countries of concern such as China.

This urgent domestic work can form a platform for positive international
efforts. With a new State Department bureau dedicated to cybersecurity
and digital policy issues, the U.S. government should consult and
cooperate with other democracies that are experiencing
technology-related challenges and social eruptions. It may not always be
easy to find consensus. The United States and the European Union, for
instance, have long been at loggerheads over data governance, despite
their many shared interests and values. But efforts to piece together an
international, democratic, rights-respecting coalition on technology
governance will fail before they get off the ground if they do not
acknowledge---in assessing the challenges and shaping the
solutions---that such a project is inherently a global one.

Abstract

[Multinational military [exercises are]{.mark}]{.underline} among the
most notable demonstrations of military cooperation and intent. [On
average, one is [initiated]{.mark} **[every]{.mark} 8.[9
days]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But it has often been argued that joint
military exercises (JMEs) increase the risk of war. Using a relational
contracting approach, we claim that [**formal military
[alliances]{.mark}** [mediate]{.mark} the effect of
[JMEs]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Exercises and alliances serve
**complementary functions**]{.underline}: [The former
allows]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[targeted

provocations by [[adversaries]{.mark}, [while the latter
provides]{.mark} **[institutional constraints]{.mark}** [on

**dampen**]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark}
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline} effects of exercises, [[**deterring**
adversaries while simultaneously **restraining

two-stage model on directed dyadic [data]{.mark} of JMEs [from]{.mark}
19**[73]{.mark}** [through]{.mark} 20**[03]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We
find that JMEs in general do not escalate conflict, and that [[JMEs
