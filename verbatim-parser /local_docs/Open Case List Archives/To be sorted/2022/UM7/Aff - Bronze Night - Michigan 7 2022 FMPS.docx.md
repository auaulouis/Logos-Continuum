# Bronze Night Aff

### Notes

Evidence from the starter packet file and from the neg section in this
file can both be useful for case extensions/answers to other off-case
positions; I just didn't want to be any more duplicative than necessary.
I tried to largely keep stuff specific to the aff here.

I think this is a strategic K aff against framework and against K
strats. In the latter context, you might want to defend more of the
"governable" part of "governable stacks"---take a look at the
"Governance Turn" card for more of an idea for that. Part of the
"governable stacks" proposal certainly involves governance, but I think
that it can be possible to walk a line of saying that the aff can say
the state is not always irredeemably awful without having to defend USFG
action in the plan---see more in the framework notes section.

I would recommend researching the (many, many) examples in the 1AC
Schneider evidence!

### 1AC

#### "At the start of the twenty-first century, we are faced with the increasing dependence of our life support systems on global networks and the possibility of system-wide catastrophe. From energy supplies to agriculture to the global climate, these systems are now directly exposed to... the possibility that a local breakdown could spread globally. We seem to be learning repeatedly that the unavoidable dark side of our networks of... information is the ever-present threat of contagion and cascading system failure."

#### It's funny, then, that debaters hail plan-focused debates as the best way to "learn repeatedly" on this topic when they have [repeatedly failed]{.underline} to learn this fact. US-NATO cybersecurity cooperation is embedded within a [vast network]{.underline} of information architectures that the alliance has become [fully dependent on]{.underline}. We cannot [hope]{.underline} to debate about that network through the [unfathomably limited]{.underline} model of policy scenario comparison, for cyberwar's [essence]{.underline} is that it is a war [against knowledge itself]{.underline}. 

#### Thus, when exploring how we [can]{.underline} debate it, "we must resist deciding in favor of catastrophe or boredom, for in doing so, the entirety of cyberwar will certainly escape us. Instead, we must attempt to interrogate the history and discourses of cyberwar... as it hides in the theoretical space between war and nonwar."

[[At the start of the twenty-first century]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we
are faced with the **increasing dependence** of our life support systems
on global networks and the possibility of **system-wide
catastrophe**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[From **energy supplies** to
**agriculture** to the **global climate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[these
systems are now directly exposed to]{.underline}]{.mark} global
fluctuations and, with them, [[the possibility that a local breakdown
could **spread globally**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[We seem to be
**learning repeatedly** that the **unavoidable dark side** of our
networks of]{.underline}]{.mark} communication, production, finance, and
[[information is the ever-present threat of **contagion** and
**cascading system failure**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Nowhere is]{.underline} the logic of [this threat]{.underline} of
global system breakdown [**clearer** than in the expanding discourse
around **cyberwar**]{.underline}. Over the past decades, [a **growing
chorus**]{.underline} of politicians, military strategists, computer
security experts, and journalists [has cited the **dangers** and
**opportunities** that the subversion of digital systems provides for
future conflicts]{.underline}. Governments are investing increasing
amounts of energy and money in guaranteeing that they can attack,
subvert, and monitor opponents' digital networks, from
command-and-control systems to banking to electric grids. The early
outbreaks of cyberwar, such as a series of [Russian attacks on
**Estonia** in **2007**]{.underline}, have [resulted mainly in
**temporary inconveniences**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} as
militaries invest in being able to destroy physical infrastructure
through networked attacks and governments attempt to subvert other
states, [future cyberwars threaten the possibility of **massive
destruction**]{.underline} and destabilization.

Cyberwar seizes directly on the networked nature of twenty-firstcentury
economic, military, and communicative power by exploiting
vulnerabilities, bugs, and insecurities in the code and systems that run
these networks; the more well connected and technologically advanced one
is, the more one has to fear the contagious threat of both networked
accidents and attacks. The military investment in cyberwar and the
political, media, and economic responses to acts of cyberwar speak
directly to the complicated nature of our networks and information
technologies. It is here, where these technical, programmatic, and
social systems begin to break down and are transformed into sites of
military intervention, that we can most fully begin to elucidate what is
at stake in these global networks.

DEFINING CYBERWAR

[There is **no easily agreed-upon definition** of cyberwar]{.underline}.
Even within closely related literatures, [there exists an **ongoing
debate** over what constitutes cyberwar]{.underline}. Some, such as Rid,
who has written at length declaring there is no such thing as cyberwar,
question whether such a concept is a helpful lens for thinking the
present situation at all.1 The term cyberwar, in most invocations,
refers to the notion of cyberspace and the possibility of a war carried
out in this global networked space, wherein computer systems are taken
over to disrupt and surveil an enemy's communication and networked
infrastructure either as part of a "kinetic" war or as a form of
low-level conflict aimed at gaining geopolitical advantages. Though it
is important to follow authors, strategists, legal scholars, and others
wherever they happen to see "cyberwar" occurring, one particular
etymological meaning will guide this inquiry. [The prefix **cyber-**
refers to the term **cybernetics**]{.underline}. Cybernetics,
originating from the Greek kubernētēs ("steersman" or "governor"), is
[the science and study of systems]{.underline}, their structures,
regulation, emergent properties, and possibilities, spanning disciplines
from technology to biology to society. [By **explicitly
thinking**]{.underline} the **[cyber-]{.underline}** in cyberwar [as
referring to **systems**]{.underline}, [it will be **fruitful** to
understand cyberwar as a war against systems]{.underline}: computer
systems, state systems, systems of organization, and even systems of
meaning.

This etymological understanding of cyberwar closely mirrors some of the
earliest deployments of this term. One of the first unclassified uses of
the term cyberwar comes from a 1992 publication by Arnett.2 For him, the
term means the replacement of human operators with machines that decide
on targets, trajectories, movement, and so on---essentially the
culmination of a long history of the insertion of "intelligent machines"
into the arsenal of war fighting. That same year, Der Derian used the
term "in the sense of a technologically generated, televisually linked,
and strategically gamed form of violence."3 Arquilla and Ronfeldt
subsequently published a paper defining cyberwar as a tactical and
strategic movement whereby communication, information, and the
visibility of the battlespace become the central concern. They assert
that while information technology brings cyberwar to the fore, it is not
necessarily a technological phenomenon. In fact, the exemplary case of
cyberwar they recount is a thirteenth-century Mongol offensive against
Khwarizm, where the Mongols succeeded in defeating a significantly
larger army by cutting off communications and disrupting the control of
forces.

These definitions complement each other. Der Derian and Arnett's
definitions focus on carrying out a kinetic war through the cybernetic
organization of humans and technology, while Arquilla and Ronfeldt's
definition stresses disrupting all of the enemy's cybernetic systems
regardless of whether they are human, technological, or a combination.
We are faced, then, with something much more expansive than war in
cyberspace; rather, what these authors begin to explore in the early
1990s is an understanding of war in which one tries to construct and
defend systems of communicating, knowing, controlling, and, ultimately,
existing. Simultaneously, one attempts to disrupt, infiltrate, corrupt,
and destroy these same systems belonging to the enemy. Arquilla and
Ronfeldt state that such a strategy "may aim to confound people's
fundamental beliefs about the nature of their culture, society, and
government, partly to foment fear but perhaps mainly to disorient people
and unhinge their perceptions."4

Clearly this is not completely new. Belligerents have always attempted
to deceive their opponents and disrupt economies and governments.
Furthermore, war has often had as a central objective the destruction of
one critical system and the infiltration of another: the body and the
territory of the opponent. Despite this, we can outline three critical
factors that mark cyberwar as a historical shift. First, proponents of
cyberwar, such as Arquilla and Ronfeldt, stress that in cyberwar,
information and structures of knowing become central rather than
peripheral to conflict. They say that [cyberwar]{.underline} "[means
**disrupting** if not **destroying** the information and communications
systems]{.underline}, broadly defined to include even military culture,
[on which an adversary relies in order to know itself]{.underline}."5
Second, cyberwar attempts to disrupt not only the enemy's knowledge but
also the entire structure of knowledge. In short, [cyberwar invests
**epistemology itself** as a battlespace]{.underline}. Third, cyberwar
seeps outside of "war" proper. In calling into question modes of
knowing, cyberwar breaks down the limits of the time and space of war.

Thus the term cyberwar describes two distinct but related phenomena. On
one hand, it is a strategy for fighting war, and we will include
whatever is named cyberwar by strategists, legal theorists, authors, and
warriors. On the other hand, we will mean a historical shift---in a
sense, a global cyberwar that marks a tendency whereby the critical
element in war becomes the flow of information and the fortification and
disruption of systems. In making this shift, [cyberwar has opened an
**epistemological** and **cybernetic battlespace** wherein notions of
war]{.underline}, [enmity]{.underline}, [and knowing become **directly
contestable**]{.underline}. While these concepts have always been
unstable and problematic, cyberwar seizes them as systems of direct
military intervention, [turning what was once a question for
**philosophers** into a domain of the **global
battlespace**]{.underline}. In its most abstract sense,
[cyberwar]{.underline} has become an event that calls everything
including itself into question at the moment it arrives. It [is the
historical possibility that **all systems may break
down**]{.underline}---or, in their military occupation, be caused to
break down---but it is also possible that cyberwar may undermine itself
before anything actually "happens." Cyberwar as historical event marks a
moment of radical militarized unknowability.

A COMPROMISED HISTORY

[Many discussions of cyberwar]{.underline}, be they historical,
strategic, or legal, [begin not with]{.underline} the earliest
[**examples** or **contemporary attacks** but]{.underline} rather [with
a **future catastrophe** that demonstrates the danger of our
overreliance on]{.underline} vast, connected, yet [vulnerable
systems]{.underline}. These catastrophes normally start with a nonstate
actor or a "rogue" state hacking into key networks, destroying critical
infrastructure in the United States or multiple European countries.
Airplanes crash into each other, trains derail, communication channels
shut down, and electrical systems are disabled. Not only are these
systems forced to shut down but they are hijacked and made to spin out
of control, sometimes destroying themselves so completely that they
would take months to return to normal usage. [These **imagined
scenarios** often place the reader at the time immediately following the
catastrophe]{.underline}. At this point in time, one can survey the
wreckage of our technological hubris before the aftermath begins in
earnest. It is the moment when the full scale of a possible collapse is
revealed but not yet realized.6

Where a historical account begins in the past, it often starts with a
CIA attempt to secretly destroy a Soviet gas pipeline.7 According to
Thomas Reed, a National Security Council staffer, in 1982, the CIA was
able to insert an intentionally faulty piece of code into a pump that
the Soviet Union obtained from a Canadian company. According to Reed's
account, the pump was installed in the Trans-Siberian gas pipeline;
varying pump speeds and valve settings produced extreme pressures that
caused an explosion large enough to be detected by U.S. satellites. The
secret introduction of a so-called logic bomb---a somewhat antiquated
term for a malicious piece of code inserted into software---has been
touted by a number of commentators as one of the earliest examples of
cyberwar.

Although Reed, who made this story public for the first time in a 2004
book, never referred to this attack as cyberwar, this story has become
something of an origin myth for those who write about cyberwar more
generally.8 The event prefigures a number of issues that arise again and
again in the myriad discourses surrounding cyberwar. Most important, it
becomes clear how vulnerable complex systems of computation have become.
These systems aggregate code written across the globe and parts
manufactured outside the purview of their owners into complex networks
that belie attempts to control them. Computation is exposed to the
exterior places in which it is produced.

Furthermore, even if unintentionally, the use of this event as the first
in a series of international cyberattacks offers an answer to a question
that is often asked of theorists of cyberwar: how can such an event lay
claim to being "war"? Is this merely sabotage? Placing the origin in the
Cold War responds to those critics of cyberwar hype who believe it is
nothing more than a collection of high-tech tools in service of the
ancient techniques of spying, deception, and sabotage. For [the Cold War
proved that wars **need not be explosive** and could consist of
**decades** of low-level conflict]{.underline}. As Virilio says of [the
threat posed by **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, "the weapon's serious
danger [is not that it could **explode tomorrow**]{.underline}. . . [but
that for **thirty years** it has been **destroying
society**]{.underline}."9 [The bomb's destructive power has been **felt
directly** through its threat]{.underline}. Likewise, as can be seen in
the futuristic scenarios described earlier, [cyberwar **seems always to
threaten catastrophe**]{.underline}. Placing [cyberwar]{.underline}'s
origins in the Cold War [suggests the possibility of a **nonwar** that
is **as destructive as a kinetic war**]{.underline}. The second half of
the twentieth century has demonstrated that [even in the **absence** of
a hot war]{.underline}, [conflict can **destroy governments** and
**societies**]{.underline}.

Furthermore, at least for those theorists and strategists of cyberwar in
the United States, this origin story contextualizes contemporary
cyberwar discourses in another way. Several military and political
commentators writing about cyberwar as a strategic area of study were
the same theorists who worked on nuclear deterrence strategy in the
latter part of the Cold War. A number of authors---many of whom work for
the RAND Corporation, a think tank that was created in 1948 to provide
research and analysis to the U.S. military---even attempt to employ
strategies learned from nuclear deterrence research to mitigate military
hacking and offensive use of global networks.10 Tying the origin of
cyberwar to Cold War global strategic thinking offers an opportunity for
those making the transition from strategizing in a bipolar world defined
by nuclear weapons to a multipolar, interconnected global economy.

While the Siberian pipeline attack's similarity to contemporary issues
surrounding cyberwar is noteworthy, the most striking aspect of the
whole affair is that it possibly never happened. Following the release
of Reed's book, an ex-KGB officer with direct knowledge of the region at
the time disputes Reed's account. He acknowledged there was an explosion
but claims it was at a different, smaller pipeline and was caused by
specific construction mistakes, not by faulty equipment.11 Moreover, no
known media reports from the time confirm an explosion, which Reed
claims was the size of a small nuclear blast. Other than Reed's account,
no other documentation has been found, and the CIA has never confirmed
the event.12

The origins of cyberwar in this event are seemingly impossible to
verify. Pipeline explosions were common at the time, and there would
have been no way for the CIA to know for certain if it was caused by
their purposefully faulty equipment or accidently faulty Soviet
equipment. Given our current evidence, the event is completely
unknowable. Moreover, even if there was an explosion, it is impossible
to verify if it was the logic bomb or a mechanical failure. Depending on
one's perspective, either the fake event or fake refutations seep into
the historical record like a computer virus corrupting the system's
memory.

Thus, in a largely unrecognized way, this event is archetypal for
cyberwar. Cyberwar and [**cybersecurity** weave a **complicated
relationship** between the knowable and the unknowable]{.underline}.
[Our networked world has become **so complex** in sheer technical terms
that the system as a whole **cannot be known** from the
outside]{.underline}. [Mapping even just the public Web has become a
scholarly pursuit in its own right]{.underline}. Computers and networks
represent [information]{.underline} as tiny bits on a magnetic disk or
pulses of light across a cable that, owing to their size, speed, and
complexity, [are on their own **essentially meaningless** and
**impenetrable** to human observers]{.underline}. [One always interacts
with **abstractions** and **complex representations** of]{.underline}
the [material reality]{.underline} of computing. Cyberwar, in attacking
these systems, is always on the verge of being meaningless itself.
Moreover, [in attacking systems of knowing that guarantee
information]{.underline}, [a successful attack impairs even our ability
to know if something has happened]{.underline}. Cyberwar is fought
precisely in this space between the possible catastrophe and the
possibility of nothing happening at all.

The event itself is ambiguous and our public historical record is
already compromised. It could of course be argued that all history is
ambiguous, constructed, and selective. [What is **unique**
in]{.underline} the case of [cyberwar is that the **whole structure** of
knowing and observing is opened as a site of **direct military
intervention**]{.underline}. It is not only a question of interpretation
and selective archives. [The entire archive and our ability to
comprehend the archive may be attacked at any moment]{.underline}. In a
sense, we are dealing with a limit case of historical
unknowability---not just ambiguity but a military attack on the data of
history itself. Now, even if the victors write history, it may no longer
be written from data they control.

Thus [an **effective understanding** of cyberwar will only be possible
by **not prematurely deciding** in favor of an event **happening** or
**not happening**]{.underline}. [Cyberwar operates]{.underline} both as
a strategy and as a mediatized cultural phenomenon directly [in the
space **between** happening and not happening]{.underline}. [It
**succeeds**]{.underline} as a military strategy [by **never succeeding
too much**]{.underline}. [It always **seems** to be leading us to the
verge of **catastrophe** and at the same time to an **interminable
boredom** where nothing will ever actually happen]{.underline}. Cyberwar
could easily be dismissed as not really being war or violent, but [what
is **so virulent** and **dangerous** about cyberwar is its ability to
**atomize** and **distribute** warfare into everyday life]{.underline}.
[Cyberwar succeeds **so much more effectively** for being either
**overhyped** or **dismissed**]{.underline}. [[Ultimately]{.underline},
[we must **resist** deciding in favor of **catastrophe** or
**boredom**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[for in doing
so]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the **entirety** of cyberwar will **certainly
escape us**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we
must attempt to **interrogate the history** and **discourses** of
cyberwar]{.underline}]{.mark} by following its vacillations between
these two poles [[as it **hides** in the theoretical space between war
and nonwar]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Our historical interrogation begins relatively recently, on April 26, 2007. Not a very important date by American standards, but one remembered by many Estonians as the "Bronze Night." Estonia decided to move the Bronze Soldier, a Soviet memorial statue, out of Tallinn, its capital, provoking violent pro-Russian protests. Soon after, the extremely Internet-reliant Estonia was devastated by a DDoS cyberattack of Russian origins, isolating the country and shutting its economy down for two weeks.

#### The Bronze Night is now widely considered the world's first cyberwar. Though the Russian government has denied official responsibility, NATO saw the attack on its vulnerable member as not just a threat, but the harbinger of a [new era of war]{.underline} which it was [woefully unprepared for]{.underline}. In response, Estonia led the alliance in establishing its Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence, as well as a comprehensive overview of the laws of cyberwarfare---the Tallinn Manual---and, gradually, the small country became the [epicenter]{.underline} of NATO's cybersecurity efforts.

#### NATO missed the real significance of the Bronze Night, which was not simply that it was [vulnerable]{.underline} to a new form of warfare, but that it was [fundamentally outdated]{.underline} in the face of the cybernetic transformation of the planet, as it was founded on the relevance of geopolitical factors like nation-states and physical boundaries like the "North Atlantic" which hold [no sway]{.underline} in the digital era. NATO did get one thing right, though: [there's no going back]{.underline}.

and Time of Cyberwar," *Deconstruction Machines: Writing in the Age of
Cyberwar*, Chapter 1, 38-43, dml)

While Moonlight Maze was declared a cyberwar by a few individuals, [a
row between Russia and Estonia in 2007]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
often mentioned as [one of the **earliest all-out
cyberwars**]{.underline}.17 On April 26 of that year, [Estonia moved the
**Bronze Soldier**]{.underline}, a memorial to Soviet soldiers killed
during World War II, [from]{.underline} the center of the Estonian
capital **[Tallinn]{.underline}** to a cemetery on the outskirts of
town. [Russians]{.underline} within both Estonia and Russia
**[protested]{.underline}**. [**Riots** broke out]{.underline} in
Tallinn, killing one and injuring more than a hundred people.18 In
response, the Russian parliament called for the resignation of the
Estonian government and stopped rail service from St. Petersburg, train
shipments of oil through Estonia, and even heavy vehicles from crossing
a major bridge from Russia into Estonia.19

At the same time, [a host of computer-based services in Estonia were hit
with a]{.underline} distributed denial-of-service
(**[DDoS]{.underline}**) [attack]{.underline}. A DDoS attack involves
overwhelming a server with traffic such that it is no longer able to
respond to legitimate requests. It is relatively easy to automatically
block computers that are sending inordinate numbers of requests to a
server, so most DDoS attacks must be distributed across a large number
of machines to succeed. This is achieved either by maliciously taking
over machines to create what is called a botnet, some of which have
involved tens of millions of computers, or by convincing people to
voluntarily lend their machines for the purpose of an attack. These
voluntary or commandeered machines are then turned against servers to
overrun them with requests and disable them. DDoS attacks thus do not
require breaking into a machine and do not compromise private data that
may reside on the server; rather, they disable the server for as long as
the botnet can continue sending requests.

In Estonia, [these attacks targeted government websites and critical
businesses]{.underline} such as banks and newspapers, [shutting down
ATMs and]{.underline} some means of [communication]{.underline} within
the country. [These attacks were **especially symbolic**
because]{.underline}, at the time, [Estonia was one of the **most
well-connected countries** in Europe]{.underline}, [with **more than 90
percent** of bank transactions completed online]{.underline}. [The
country even allowed Internet voting]{.underline} by this point. Seven
years prior, in 2000, the Estonian parliament declared Internet access a
human right.20 [Estonia was ultimately unable to counter the attacks and
responded by **shutting off Internet connections** to other
countries]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} allowed services to resume
within the country but [**prevented access** to those outside the
country]{.underline}. The attacks finally slowed down two weeks later.
The Russian government denied any responsibility, and a number of
security specialists have speculated that the attacks would have likely
been more destructive if there had been direct government or military
involvement, but there were extensive calls on Russian Internet for
participation and instructions for how to join the attacks against
Estonian institutions.21

The attacks on Estonia were carried out with a clear intent to disrupt
the country in response to moving the Bronze Soldier, but beyond that
and some technical details of the attack, little is discernable. The
underlying purpose and the actors involved remain largely unknown, as
Russia has refused any cooperation with Estonian law enforcement in
finding and apprehending those responsible, despite a treaty
guaranteeing mutual legal assistance. While it seems unlikely that the
Russian government or military directly organized the specifics of the
attacks, they have offered it their tacit approval by refusing to assist
in any investigations. Thus [the attacks]{.underline} against Estonia
[appear]{.underline} most likely [to have been a]{.underline}
"**[war]{.underline}**" carried out by patriotic hackers [not
**officially** affiliated with the military]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} perhaps [with **military support**]{.underline}, and
clearly [**outside** the bounds and means of traditional kinetic
warfare]{.underline}.22 As much as it is possible to discuss the purpose
of these attacks that were carried out by a variety of unidentified
individuals, [the attacks were aimed directly at **disconnecting**
Estonia from the global Internet and economy]{.underline}. In addition
to the DDoS attacks, the other provocations all served to disconnect
Estonia. Cutting rail and heavy truck connections to Estonia act in this
light as physical denial-of-service attacks. To return to Castells's
point mentioned earlier, [exclusion from global networks is]{.underline}
perhaps now [one of the **gravest threats** that could be wrought upon a
nation]{.underline}. A denial-ofservice attack, in both its digital and
physical forms, relegates the target to the space of place, severing its
connections to global networks. While cyberwar functions through a
variety of modes, it seems one goal that is often invoked is to
disconnect one's enemies from global spaces of flow.

All [these attacks function]{.underline} at the same time [to allow a
level of **plausible deniability**]{.underline}. The physical
infrastructure disruptions were claimed to be due to lack of passengers,
repairs, and safety concerns rather than retribution. The cyberattacks
were attributable to unknown patriotic hackers rather than a government
or military group that could be held accountable. [While in some
cases]{.underline} it may be that [governments and militaries **truly**
were not involved]{.underline}, [in the cases in which they **were**
and]{.underline} attempt to [deny their involvement]{.underline}, it is
likely in many cases that [this is due to fear of being **cut off** from
global networks themselves]{.underline}. Ene [Ergma]{.underline}, [the
speaker of the Estonian parliament]{.underline} at the time,
[claimed]{.underline} in an interview that "[attacking us is one way of
**checking NATO's defenses**]{.underline}. [They could **examine the
alliance's readiness** under the cover of the statue
protest]{.underline}."23 [While Estonia did not invoke **Article
5**]{.underline} of the NATO treaty, which outlines countries'
responsibility of mutual defense, [NATO responded by creating
the]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}** Cooperative
**[Cyber]{.underline}** Defence **[Centre]{.underline}** of Excellence
in Estonia's capital.24 The creation of the Centre of Excellence served
[to **reassert Estonia's position** in a network of mutual
defense]{.underline}, from which it was believed that Russia was
attempting to sever Estonia. Thus this conflict can be read as a series
of actions aimed at severing and reasserting Estonia's connection to
global flows of information, capital, people, military assistance, and
goods.

[It is]{.underline} also [**clear** from these attacks that we are
witnessing a **significant blurring** of the distinction between
civilian]{.underline}, [military]{.underline}, [and political
spheres]{.underline}. Just over a year after the Estonian crisis, when
Russia entered a kinetic war with Georgia over South Ossetia, a wave of
cyberattacks against Georgian targets followed Russian physical attacks.
Like the Estonian attacks, the degree of Russian involvement was largely
indeterminable. These attacks followed a similar logic of attempting to
disconnect Georgia from global networks and also to assert the
legitimacy of the Russian cause, perhaps with the hope of winning the
global media's blessing and thus support for maintaining global
connections.25 In both these conflicts, it is evident that [cyberwar
does not merely seize upon an increasingly connected world but rather
**intervenes directly** in global space itself to attempt to
define]{.underline}, [create]{.underline}, [and undermine spaces of
connection and disconnection]{.underline}. The increasing military and
state interest in cyberwar is, then, not simply a result of the rise of
global networks but rather an active force that both promotes and
attacks such connections. Although [the attacks in Estonia]{.underline}
and Georgia were in response to geopolitical (and networked) change,
they [sought actively to **reshape**]{.underline} a set of
[interconnected networks]{.underline} and spaces.

OPERATION ORCHARD AS MICROSCOPIC WAR

A few months after the attacks against Estonia, on September 6, 2007,
Israeli fighter jets attacked a supposed nuclear installation in Syria.
The jets entered Syrian air space, destroyed the site, and returned
without being fired upon. Despite the two countries technically being at
war since 1948, both downplayed the event, which is now known as
Operation Orchard.26 One of the most noteworthy elements of the attack
was that a state-of-the-art radar system completely failed to detect the
Israeli airplanes. Although it is unclear why the radar system failed, a
number of commentators have suggested that the most likely cause was an
advanced electronic attack on the system. Some sources even suggested it
was possible that the computer chips that ran the radar system were
fabricated with a "back door" so that they could be forced to
malfunction.27

Even if this was not the case in the Israeli attack on Syria, chips
being compromised during their production is becoming a growing military
concern. The U.S. military has been working to create verified
production facilities within the United States, but the growing number
of commercial chips used in military equipment has complicated these
efforts. There have been attempts to create systems to verify chips
after production, but with current technology, it is nearly impossible
to guard against a back door that is only triggered under specific
conditions.28

[There arises in cybersecurity a **numbers game** that]{.underline}
generally [favors attackers over defenders]{.underline}. For instance,
microchips have become so complicated that a few transistors arranged in
such a way that they can be activated for some malicious purpose are
almost impossible to detect in chips now made of billions of
transistors.29 Furthermore, even if it were possible to check chips for
insecurities, it would be possible to limit the number of compromised
chips to a small number in a production run, requiring that nearly every
chip be checked to guarantee security (and one would, of course, have to
guarantee that the system that checked the chips had not been
compromised itself).

Two important phenomena emerge from the insecurity of supply chains in a
digital and globalized world. First, [the space and time of war spread
**outside war itself**]{.underline} in an even more insidious way than
we saw previously. [Cyberwar]{.underline}, especially as it includes
physical points of intrusion into chips, [requires]{.underline}, in a
sense, [that the war start **before** the war]{.underline}. [The trap
must be laid **long before** a conflict breaks out]{.underline}. The
[war]{.underline} then [extends along the **entire supply
chain**]{.underline}. [Any]{.underline} place that
[weapons]{.underline}, [infrastructure]{.underline}, [or]{.underline}
any [systems]{.underline} containing chips are designed, assembled, and
stored [becomes a **potential battle space** in a future
conflict]{.underline}. Though sabotage has always been a threat for
warring parties, the globalization and commercialization of the computer
chip market mean that [a country may end up fighting the very country
that designed and manufactured the majority of its computing
power]{.underline}. Prior to the growth of computerbased weapons, it may
have been possible to sell low-quality armaments or steel to a potential
future enemy, but hiding such built-in failures was difficult. Now the
situation is inverted, and the work required to find faults and back
doors in chips is substantially greater than the work involved in
creating and hiding them. It is, then, not only that a nation or group
can be disconnected from global flows but also that these global flows
can be turned against an adversary, quickly turning supply chains and
capital flows into potential threats.

Second, new, more complicated gaps open between knowing and seeing. The
military reliance on more and more complicated technology has, over the
course of the past century or so, pushed military operations beyond the
field of sight. With the introduction of computer chips, and especially
chips that could be attacked or sabotaged, the battle space now includes
the microscopic. Moreover, technologies like radar and other advanced
warning systems now rely exclusively on these technologies, and thus
attacks that are imperceptible and microscopic can disrupt one's ability
to see on a macroscopic level. This is precisely what is believed to
have happened in Syria. As Richard Clarke said of the attacks, "the view
seen by the Syrians bore no relation to the reality that their eastern
skies had become an Israeli Air Force bombing range. Syrian air defense
missiles could not have been fired because there had been no targets in
the system for them to seek out."30 [While war can now happen at **every
level** from the microscopic to the global]{.underline}, [defeat on one
level **easily spills over** to all the others]{.underline}. [Not only
does war expand into cyberspace as a new domain of battle but other
domains with their own geographies]{.underline}---including the
macroscopic geographies of supply chains and the internal microscopic
geographies of chips themselves---[become realms of war and localized
battle spaces]{.underline}.

[War becomes **rhizomatic** and spreads out in **all
directions**]{.underline}, [including downward to the microscopic and
imperceptible]{.underline}. Supply chains have always been important to
war efforts, but what has changed is both the depth and breadth of
global supply chains. Following World War II, the European Coal and
Steel Community was created with the express purpose of tying French and
German markets together to prevent another war, but this relied on the
products of coal and steel being perceptible and war being a macroscopic
phenomenon.31 Now [supply chains are intertwined on an
**imperceptible**]{.underline}, **[molecular level]{.underline}**,
[making their interdependency a potential source of
**instability**]{.underline} rather than stability.

While **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}** harness the microscopic power of
atoms to create unprecedented levels of destruction, they [are
**anathema** to any type of precision]{.underline}, [rendering them
**useless** in any conflict short of all-out warfare]{.underline}.
[Cyberweapons act to **counter** this lack of precision]{.underline}.
Instead of releasing the maximum power from atoms, bits are manipulated,
corrupted, and destroyed with exacting precision. [Not only are precise
sites and types of machines selected]{.underline} for destruction [but
levels of destruction are dialed in to precisely determine the possible
responses]{.underline}. [This is **not** to say that these political
calculations are **always**]{.underline}, [or even
**often**]{.underline}, [done **well** or to the benefit of
anyone]{.underline}. [Nor is it to say that what is precisely chosen and
destroyed will not create results that will **spiral out of
control**]{.underline}. Still, interventions are weighed and aimed at
specific nodal sites in global networks, moving these calculations away
from geopolitics toward a nodal politics.32 This networked political
calculus does not replace the geographic but rather embeds geopolitics
in what Virilio calls "metageophysics."33 Ultimately, [war]{.underline}
in this new nodal space [spreads out in **every perceptible** and
**imperceptible direction**]{.underline}, [intertwining with the
**civilian** and the **everyday**]{.underline}. It follows the supply
chains of advanced industrial nations all over the world, [increasing
the possibility that an imperceptible war could be fought **unbeknownst
to all observers**]{.underline}. War then atomizes and moves along these
multiple geographies, both spatial and aspatial, exploiting global flows
and seeking infinitesimal advantages.

#### This transformation is occurring at a level [beyond]{.underline} material infrastructures or international governance: digital technology has transformed [life]{.underline}, [communication]{.underline}, and the [mind itself]{.underline}. The [cybernetic episteme]{.underline}---the [global system of understanding]{.underline} based on quantification and data analysis---is upon us. It weighs [thirty trillion tons]{.underline}, it's [alienating]{.underline} friends and families, and it will [destroy the planet]{.underline}.

**Emmelhainz, 21**---independent researcher and writer who has lectured
and taught at an array of international institutions (Irmgard,

Disappearance of Everything on Earth," e-flux #122, November 2021, dml)
\[section 4 was not omitted, the article just skips from 3 to 5\]

[Life and society worldwide have been **transformed** by digital
technology]{.underline}, [including the **fabrics** of emotional
relationships]{.underline}. [Many believed the internet would be
the]{.underline} largest ungoverned [space]{.underline} in the world
[with **unlimited**]{.underline} emancipatory
**[potential]{.underline}**, and trusted Big Tech to make the world a
better place. [Yet power and capitalism filled that space
with]{.underline} surveillance systems, the production of private
capital, the monetization of data, and the **[control]{.underline}** of
human lives. Social media now shape daily life and many have lost faith
in the possibility of a shared consensus reality. We are living in a
scenario similar to one imagined by Black Mirror: our belief in digital
communication and social media creates narcissistic personalities,
selves dissociated and dislocated from their reflections online. Digital
communication offers an opaque mirror that delivers egos without bodies,
eliding alterity.

The collapse of reality, however, is not an unintended consequence of
advancements in, for instance, artificial intelligence: it was the
long-term objective of many technologists, who sought to create machines
capable of transforming human consciousness (like drugs do).
[Communication has become a site for the **extraction of**]{.underline}
surplus **[value]{.underline}**, and images operate as both commodities
and dispositives for this extraction. Moreover, [data mediates our
**cognition**]{.underline}, that is to say, the way in which we exist
and perceive the world and others. The image---and the [unlimited
communication]{.underline} promised by constant imagery---[have
**ceased** to have emancipatory potential]{.underline}. [Images place a
veil over a world in which the **isolated living dead**]{.underline},
[thirsty for stimulation and dopamine]{.underline}, [give and collect
likes]{.underline} on social media. Platform users exist according to
the Silicon Valley utopian ideal of life's complete virtualization.

The internet, moreover, has radically changed the political
communications game and must be considered a complex propaganda
apparatus. Although a single Tweet can destroy someone's career, and
fake news can start a real news cycle, [meaning is **subordinate** to
the circulation of vacuous content]{.underline}. The capitalist capture
of data for profit does not rely on policing content; [the production of
capital **only** relies on the **constant exchange** and **circulation**
of information]{.underline}. We don't yet know the full extent of the
manipulation of companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon in the
last two elections in the US or in other elections around the world. But
it is undeniable that digital platforms are actively censoring content
in the interests of particular political actors. For instance: in
October 2020, Zoom canceled a meeting hosting Palestinian human rights
activist Leila Khaled; a month before, Facebook and Twitter censored
information detrimental to Joseph Biden's presidential campaign. The
same two companies intervened and shut down pro-Trump accounts in 2020,
even Donald Trump's own Facebook and Twitter accounts.

After the attempted coup at the US capitol on January 6, 2020,
Facebook's recently instituted oversight board ruled that Trump had
created "an environment where a serious risk of violence was possible."
In this light, it seems likely that he will continue to be banned from
the platform. According to journalist Shoshana Zuboff, however, this is
insufficient, given that the oversight board's decision (whose work is
supported by a \$130 million endowment from Facebook) follows years of
inaction by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who indulged and appeased Trump while
entrenching what Zuboff calls "[surveillance capitalism]{.underline}." A
liberal might think that shutting up Trump and helping Biden is not bad,
as they are actions that seemingly advance the interests of the
Democratic Party. What is at stake here, however, is not whether the
platforms take a "good" or "bad" stance on a particular issue; the
problem [is]{.underline} that they have immense unchecked power and can
act as they please. Platforms are [allowed to **secretly extract**
behavioral data]{.underline} from users, whether or not users are aware,
transforming the information into targeted ads, [destroying
privacy]{.underline}, [changing human experience into data]{.underline},
[altering elections]{.underline}, [and **reshaping human
civilization**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} structure [can be
termed]{.underline} [the]{.underline} "**[cybernetic
episteme]{.underline}**," [and the new form of control]{.underline},
which goes beyond the previous regime of biopower, can be termed
"**[neuropower]{.underline}**."

According to its Greek etymology, [an]{.underline}
"**[episteme]{.underline}**" [is a **system of
understanding**]{.underline}. In The Order of Things, Michel Foucault
uses the term "épistemè" to mean the nontemporal or a priori knowledge
that grounds what is taken as truth in a given moment. Several epistemes
coexist at a given time, as they constitute parts of various systems of
power and knowledge. [The **cybernetic episteme**]{.underline}, as
defined by the collective Tiqqun some twenty years ago, [describes our
relationship to technology and machines]{.underline} (which are
inseparable from the workings of capitalism). The cybernetic episteme is
[based on the modern tenet of **progress** and **human-led
transcendence**]{.underline} achieved [through science and
technology]{.underline}.

Under neuropower, the sensible gives way to cognitive pathologies. These
pathologies depend on the consumption of content rather than the sharing
of meaning. As Thomas Metzinger explains, [the internet has become an
**integral part** of how we model ourselves]{.underline}, as we use it
for external memory storage, as a cognitive prosthesis, and for
emotional self-regulation. [This has **radically changed** the structure
of conscious experience]{.underline}, [creating]{.underline} a new form
of waking consciousness that resembles "a mixture of dreaming, dementia,
intoxication, and infantilization." Other effects of neuropower are
humans' growing invisibility to each other and [a **paroxysmal racism**
that]{.underline} infiltrates power, technology, culture, language, and
work. For Franco "Bifo" Berardi, racism has become a "virus" that
[exacerbates]{.underline} fear---above all, [the **fear of
extinction**]{.underline}, [which seems to have become one of the
**motors behind white supremacy**]{.underline} in the world. Dissociated
from our environment, alienated from each other, we are oblivious to the
challenges that are being posed to humanity by the Capitalocene.

[A **complex form of authoritarianism** is emerging]{.underline}, linked
to digital platforms owned by the powerful CEOs who make up the
notorious "Silicon Six." Under the new authoritarianism, [populations
are no longer **commanded**]{.underline}: [they are **asked to
participate**]{.underline}, and in [this **simulation** of
involvement]{.underline}, the "ideology of connection"
**[replaces]{.underline}** the idea of [social relations]{.underline},
[**neutralizing** democratic demands]{.underline} from users to have
control over their own lives, rights, and data. In this way, [people are
made passive]{.underline}. Cédric Durand explains the difference between
the original conception of the World Wide Web and the subsequent
development of closed platforms. The WWW began as a decentralized
architecture in which a generic transaction protocol (http) and a
uniform identification format (URI/URL) generated a space of flat
content. In this space, human and nonhuman agents could have access to
information without any third-party mediation. In contrast, closed
platforms use application programming interfaces, or APIs, to mediate
interaction, giving way to data loops in which interactions are more
dense. The technical object that sustains this hierarchical architecture
is the API, each of which is owned by a platform. On the one hand, big
platforms, by way of APIs, offer apps that incorporate basic and
indispensable data for users. On the other, platforms have access to the
additional information generated by the API, such as user activity and
buying habits. As the ecosystem grows in complexity, the platform is
able to accumulate more and more data. We become more densely connected
with each other and with the platforms every day, as our lives get more
and more tied to the cloud. [Our dependency on platforms provides the
ground for **technofeudalism**]{.underline}. Historically, feudalism was
characterized by a fundamental inequality that enabled the direct
exploitation of peasants by lords. The lord was both the manager and
master not only of the process of production, but of the entire process
of social life. In today's technofeudalism, [platform owners are the
digital lords and users are the serfs]{.underline}. Rather than
commodity production, these platforms are geared towards accumulation
through rent, debt, and the privatization of the basic infrastructure
that sustains our lives. [What is at stake is **no longer**]{.underline}
"true" or "fake" [**information** but the **cybernetic episteme** upon
which our lives and subjectivities have been built]{.underline}.

The cybernetic episteme is premised upon modernity's enclosure of
experience. In modern epistemology, which is the precondition of the
cybernetic episteme, [the self is **externalized** and experienced at a
**remove** from the body]{.underline}. Perception is centered on the
brain and eyes instead of the whole body, separating sensation from
reason. The self's relationship with the world is mediated through
mirrors, camera lenses, the canvas, the microscope, and mathematical
models. [The cybernetic episteme]{.underline}, moreover, [is
**inextricable from colonialism**]{.underline}, [which entails
**dispossession**]{.underline}, **[dislocation]{.underline}**,
**[dissociation]{.underline}**, [and **appropriation**]{.underline}.
Ariella Azoulay has called the logic underpinning these processes "the
shutter"; [this logic]{.underline} is materialized in photographic
technology that separates humans from objects, self from the world, and
people from their lands. The shutter [is the **principle of
imperialism** by which campaigns of plunder have left people both
**worldless** and **objectless**]{.underline}. For Azoulay, the logic of
the shutter was invented centuries before photography gave it a
technological apparatus, and it enabled the dispossession of non-Western
peoples in tandem with the accumulation of visual and material wealth in
archives and museums in the West.

[The cybernetic episteme]{.underline} is likewise conceptually
constituted by this shutter, since it [relies on
**capturing**]{.underline}, **[naming]{.underline}**,
**[moving]{.underline}**, [and **archiving** subjects]{.underline}---[as
does imperialism]{.underline}. In [this]{.underline} regard, the
cybernetic episteme [**naturalizes** the mediation of the
self]{.underline}; [it creates not only the condition of **detachment**
from the world]{.underline}, [but allows the **appropriation** of the
cultures of others]{.underline}, [as well as the **dissolution** of
collective being]{.underline}. The shutter is akin to Heidegger's
Gestell or "representation," which goes hand in hand with Eurocentrism
and Anthropocentrism. The Gestell and the shutter both imply that the
world and experience have become representation, through an aesthetic
order in which what is produced as artifice becomes the reality of
experience.

In a 2017 Facebook promo video for a new virtual reality technology,
Mark Zuckerberg and his colleague Rachel Frank tele-transported
themselves to Puerto Rico after a devastating flood. They intended to
showcase the potential of the new technology, but instead revealed its
inherent violence. The ability to transport oneself to faraway places
"as if" one's body were present gives the illusion that one we can make
a difference in the world through technology. Another example, in a
different register of colonial modernity is that way Western museums
allow visitors to \"transport\" themselves by observing objects looted
from elsewhere, like the Pergamon Museum in Berlin where museumgoers can
roam around the Ishtar Gate, which has been on display in the museum
since 1930. In a section of Ariella Azoulay's video Undocumented:
Unlearning Imperial Plunder (2020), she films actual visitors to the
Pergamon while noting that dislocation is the essence of (imperial)
modernity. The VR museum visitor is at the center of a world, but they
are not really there (an effect similar to the dispositive of
perspective in painting). For globalized Western culture, the ground for
vision, enlightenment, culture, and even social change is the
dislocation and disappearance of bodies.

Disembodiment and dislocation are also fundamental epistemological
premises of transhumanist Silicon Valley ideology. In this ideology, the
teleology of secular modern individualism culminates in the uploading of
a person's mind to a new biological, artificial, or
biological-artificial body. The utopian goal of expanding and preserving
human consciousness is physically and spiritually achieved.
Transhumanism is the dream of enhancing the human body through
technology, and ultimately escaping human suffering by transcending the
"errors" of death and aging.

Posthumanism takes things a step further: its goal is to immortalize
consciousness by uploading it to a robotic or synthetic body.
Posthumanism does away with the biological dimension of the self,
fundamentally altering what it means to be "human." In both trans- and
posthumanism, technology promises to give us the divine attributes of
omnipresence, omnipotence, and omniscience, making humans into "pure
consciousness," achieving a kind of individual and secular
transcendence. In the first episode of the British TV series Years and
Years (2019), Bethany, an adolescent whose face is hidden behind a 3D
emoji mask, announces to her parents that she is "transhuman." She
declares: "I don't want to be flesh. I want to escape this thing and
become digital, I want to live forever as information." Eventually
Bethany becomes a hero with transhuman superpowers: her mechanized eyes
and brain, which are connected to all the data in the world, allow her
to make visible the horrors that the British government have perpetrated
in a refugee camp. This techno-utopian narrative implies a democratic
ideology, insofar as one political goal of democracy is to make visible
the ordeals of oppressed minorities---in this case through virtual
disembodiment.

In contrast to this techno-utopian narrative, science
fiction---especially cyberpunk literature--- generally portrays
transhumanism as a nightmarish apocalyptic scenario of social control
and individual subjection. Several episodes of Black Mirror do this, for
example. But what Black Mirror and Years and Years have in common is
that technological advances and the increasing symbiosis between humans
and machines are associated with political, economic, and social
instability. In reality, "mind uploading" has attracted millions of
dollars of investment from the billionaires of Silicon Valley and
beyond. In a mixture of engineering and enlightenment, consciousness is
now being hacked through biofeedback techniques, meditation practices,
and microdosing drugs. Many critics have observed that the utopian
ideology of transhumanism underpins the Valley's culture of "move fast,
break things, and make as much money as possible." Technologies aiming
to expand human consciousness are rooted in purely extractivist,
capitalist values. In this sense, cybernetics is a political project on
a planetary scale. As described by Tiqqun, cybernetics is a gigantic
"abstract machine" made up of binary machines deployed by empire, and a
form of political sovereignty that has merged with the capitalist
extractivist project.

In the pre-cybernetic era---that is to say, before the 1940s---machines
were intended to emulate humans; their actions resembled human behavior,
but ostensibly without intent or emotions. This is why Donna Haraway
describes pre-cybernetic machines as "haunted." They seemed animated by
ghosts, reminiscent of Walter Benjamin's automaton that was inhabited by
a hunchbacked dwarf. Machines were not self-moving, self-designing, or
autonomous. They could not achieve human dreams, only mock them. In
turn, humans related to machines by using or acting upon them: switching
them on or off, using them as tools to achieve an end. Today, the
relationship between human and machine is based on internal, mutual
communication in a feedback loop. Early machines were led; today,
machines lead us. This does not mean that machines have simply become
humanized through the proliferation of androids. Rather, [humans have
**surrendered consciousness** to AI]{.underline}, [becoming **obedient**
and **predictable**]{.underline}. In the twenty-first century, machines
have blurred the distinction between the artificial and human mind, not
only because machines can imitate human functions, but because [humans
have become **increasingly passive**]{.underline}, [since we are now
subject to **neuropower**]{.underline}.

Within the cybernetic episteme, [it is no longer enough to talk about
a]{.underline} "**[control society]{.underline}**"; [we must talk
instead about a composite of **interlinked forms of
oppression**]{.underline} (exploitation, alienation, and domination),
[in tandem with]{.underline} extreme securitarianism. Another way to see
the cybernetic episteme is as [the reconceptualization of social worlds
into **information-processing systems**]{.underline}. Practices of
computation are used to produce new organizational and infrastructural
apparatuses, which in turn create value and profit by exploiting and
disposing of human life. [Social worlds are **subsumed** into
technologies]{.underline} through techniques such as statistical
forecasting and data modeling.

The cybernetic episteme stems from a world brought into being by
Europeans; this world began with the discovery of the "new world" and
the creation of empires and colonies (which coincided with the
scientific revolution). In this sense, [the cybernetic episteme is
**inseparable** from the **Western civilizing project** for the whole
world]{.underline}, which connected disparate places through
technologies like the telegraph and steam shipping, often powered by the
extraction of fossil fuels like coal. [This project has culminated
in]{.underline} globalization as [the **deregulation** and
**financialization** of world economies]{.underline}.

The Western civilization project, based on Enlightenment values
including equality, peaceful public life, access to modern science, the
rule of law, democracy, and technological progress, involved the
creation of infrastructure to unify nations and the world. [We can call
this]{.underline} infrastructure [the]{.underline}
"**[technosphere]{.underline}**." The technosphere comprises [not only
digital technology but all]{.underline} machines, factories, computers,
cars, buildings, railways, and mobility [infrastructure]{.underline}, as
well as systems of [food production]{.underline}, [resource
extraction]{.underline}, [and energy distribution]{.underline}. Today,
the infrastructure of the world---[the technosphere]{.underline}---[is
shaped by information]{.underline}, which means that the world we
inhabit is designed by data.

The technosphere is a supplement humans have created to help overcome
the limits of "human nature" insofar as humans cannot live independently
from structures geared towards sustaining life. [The technosphere has
promised to enable us to]{.underline} increase production and
reproduction with less human effort. Moreover, the technosphere is also
regarded as the main tool humans have to **[fight decay]{.underline}**,
**[entropy]{.underline}**, [and **death**]{.underline}, since it
comprises all the structures humans have built to keep themselves alive
on the planet. [The total mass of the technosphere amounts
to]{.underline} fifty kilos for every square meter of earth's
surface---a total of **[thirty trillion tons]{.underline}**, [which
coexists with the **diminishing hydrosphere**]{.underline} (water, the
frozen polar regions) [and the **biosphere**]{.underline} (all of
earth's living organisms). [The ultimate price]{.underline} of the
technosphere [is **global warming** and **environmental
devastation**]{.underline}. Like humans, the technosphere needs external
energy input, which is not sustainable as long as it comes from fossil
fuels that will eventually be depleted.

From this standpoint, the cybernetic episteme represents the gradual
merging of human activity into the activity of what we have built and
surrounded ourselves with. Much of this built environment is invisible.
Infrastructure and data are partially occult because we are alienated
from them, even as we are produced and managed by them. The invisible
infrastructure that sustains our lives is what matters politically right
now. And insofar as the technosphere is cybernetic, it is inextricable
from capitalism and politics.

3\.

Human [communication is at the **center** of the cybernetic global
order]{.underline}. The neural system of globalized networked society is
digital communication. In a 1975 film called Comment ça va?, Anne-Marie
Miéville and Jean-Luc Godard discuss the "illness" of information. They
begin with an image of the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, published
in the leftist newspaper Libération. At the time, photojournalistic
images had begun to proliferate as a form of information, and Godard and
Miéville critique Libération (the most left-wing newspaper in Europe in
those days) for failing to include the reader in the creation and
dissemination of information. They ask: "How is it that things enter and
exit the machine?" (Comment ça va de l'entrée à la sortie de la
machine?). [This question is about how ideas]{.underline},
[words]{.underline}, [discourses]{.underline}, [human
interaction]{.underline}, and images [**become information** and then
reach readers]{.underline} and viewers.

In Comment ça va?, mass media represents an illness that has killed
communication and language. Last year, Godard updated his critique of
the media in an interview posted to Instagram. He stated: "Plato's cave
has been fixed on paper/screen." For Godard, [the consequence of the
becoming-information of communication and language is the **loss of
ambiguity**]{.underline} in communication. Digital technology has
infiltrated every aspect of existence, and [the margin of error between
the transmission and the reception of a message has been
**eliminated**]{.underline} by mediatization and digitization. For
Godard, [digital communication]{.underline} denies the force of the
image or the word because it [eliminates **redundancy**]{.underline},
**[misunderstanding]{.underline}**, the possibility of reading between
the lines, [and the **possibility of alterity**]{.underline}.

In a more recent film of his---Adieu au language from 2014---Godard
suggests that digital media have destroyed face-to-face communication.
He asks: What kind of self could emerge in a time when objects and
bodies are disfigurable and refigurable through virtual manipulation?
Godard posits that [the **origins of**]{.underline} today's
[**totalitarianism** can be traced to the **interruption of interior
experience** by the spectacle]{.underline}. In the film, Godard features
a lengthy quote from Philippe Sollers explaining that the spectacle
"cuts off" the subject from its interior life---a process that is,
paradoxically, highly seductive. Furthermore, for Godard [digital
communication creates a new form of **isolated solitude** where people
lack ties to others]{.underline}. In this light, technology has not
become an extension of man, as Marshall McLuhan predicted, but has
instead attained autonomy from man, since digital media can communicate
amongst themselves without human mediation. For Godard, this means that
[the]{.underline} "[face-to-face]{.underline}"
[encounter]{.underline}---a basic form of human relation that is [the
**foundation of ethics**]{.underline}---[is **no longer
possible**]{.underline}.

Sherry Turkle, a clinical psychologist and sociologist, comes to similar
conclusions: daily conversations no longer involve eye contact, and
face-to-face discussion has been replaced by words on a screen.
According to Turkle, texts, tweets, Facebook posts, Instagram messages,
and Snapchats split our attention and diminish our capacity for empathy.
They have created new codes of etiquette; no longer do we feel
restrained from reaching for our phones in the presence of other people.
[This]{.underline} new etiquette [entrenches a culture of
**individualism** and **isolation**]{.underline} from each other.
[This]{.underline} isolation [cultivates the **perfect ground for
fascism**]{.underline}.

The [digitization]{.underline} of communication [not only has political
and communal consequences]{.underline}. [It also affects the
**neuroplastic potential** of the living brain]{.underline}. The
cybernetic episteme reshapes our working memory by rearranging its
contents. As Warren Neidich writes, [the new focus]{.underline} of power
[is]{.underline} not only the false reproduction of the past (the
manipulation of the archive), but [the manipulation of our]{.underline}
working memory---the type of memory that influences our
**[decision-making]{.underline}**. [Authoritarian neuropower wants
**nothing less**]{.underline} than to shape our future memory, argues
Neidich.

If the nervous system of cybernetics is digital communication, at the
center of digital communication is desire. Mark Fisher devoted his last
lectures at Goldsmiths in 2017 to this subject. During one lecture, he
played for his students a famous Apple TV commercial from 1984, directed
by Ridley Scott and originally broadcast during the Superbowl. In an
overt reference to George Orwell's novel 1984, the commercial depicts a
dreary, repressive control society. This society is seemingly liberated
when a buxom blonde woman tosses a sledgehammer at a large screen
broadcasting the image of an authoritarian figure, causing the screen to
explode. The commercial ends with these lines crawling across the
screen: "On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And
you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984." Fisher observes that the video
counterposes top-down bureaucratic control to upstart
entrepreneurialism. The dreary control society depicted in the
commercial is an allusion to not only the Soviet Union, but also IBM,
the dominant computer maker at the time. Apple posits itself as the
dynamic, colorful new company that will liberate society from dreary
IBM, ushering in a new, more vibrant world order. This new world order
will fulfill our (capitalist) desires in a way that the communist world
cannot. As Fisher suggests, we now live in that world of libidinal
capitalism.

Elsewhere Fisher writes that what drives the circulation of information
is the user's desire to make one more connection, to leave one more
reply, to keep on clicking. Capitalism persists because cyberspace is
already under our skin, writes Fisher; to retreat from it would be like
trying to retreat into some nonexistent precapitalist imaginary. In his
view, we believe we have as much a chance of escaping capitalism as we
do of crawling back inside our mother's womb.

By means of the cybernetic episteme, Silicon Valley has shaped the world
we all live in. As we are poisoned equally by microplastics and fake
news, losing our grasp of a shared reality, the "Silicon Six"---as Sacha
Baron Cohen called the titans of Silicon Valley in a 2019
speech---propagate algorithm-fueled fear, propaganda, lies, and hate in
the name of profit. As Baron Cohen pointed out, the major online
platforms largely avoid the kind of regulation and accountability that
other media companies are subject to. "This is ideological imperialism,"
he said. "Six unelected individuals in Silicon Valley impos\[e\] their
vision on the rest of the world, unaccountable to any government, and
acting as if they are above the law." He called digital platforms the
greatest propaganda machine in history.

[Democratic institutions have **failed to reign in** the information
chaos and the destruction of the public sphere]{.underline}. As Shoshana
Zuboff argues, [we inhabit a communications sphere that is **no longer a
public sphere**]{.underline}. She describes this situation as an
"epistemic coup" that has taken place in four stages: First, by way of
companies gathering personal data about us and then claiming it as their
own private property. Second, through data inequality, which means that
companies know more than we do. Third, through the epistemic chaos
created by algorithms. And fourth, through the institutionalization of
this new episteme and the erosion of democratic governance.

Baron Cohen observes that [people can take a stand against platforms by
recognizing our power to **boycott** them]{.underline}. (One example is
the mass defection from WhatsApp to Telegram when the former announced
that would share its user data with Facebook.) [But we also need
to]{.underline} defend the existence of facts and a shared reality,
[understand]{.underline}ing [the world **not** as something we **see**
but as something we **inhabit**]{.underline}---treating life not as
something we have, but as something we live. [Anti-platform
strategies]{.underline} might be accused of Luddism, but they [are **not
necessarily opposed** to technology]{.underline}---[only]{.underline} to
**[certain uses]{.underline}** of technology.

[It is also **crucial** that we regard the cybernetic episteme as
**inextricable** from a broader malaise]{.underline}: [humanity's
relationship to **life** and the **planet** is]{.underline} a
**[toxic]{.underline}** one. The very [technologies]{.underline} that
supposedly enable us to read, think, flourish, and desire [are
**destroying the world**]{.underline} we inhabit.

#### Vote affirmative to pursue insurgent governable stacks that increase security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the area of cybersecurity. The aff [reassembles]{.underline} the technical layers of the cybernetic episteme into new [stacks]{.underline}---layered architectures of hardware, software, networks, and infrastructure which divide the world into sovereign spaces---that can [fractally spill up]{.underline} to align with radical struggles across the globe. 

**Schneider, 22**---assistant professor of media studies at the
University of Colorado Boulder (Nathan, "Governable Stacks against
Digital Colonialism," tripleC 20 (1): 19-36, 2022, dml)

The spinning wheel remains a cipher and a site of conflict, an everyday
technology summoned to a contest over the meaning of democracy. Despite
having political ties with Gandhi's assassin, the Hindu nationalist
prime minister Narendra Modi promotes homespun cloth and has done
photo-ops operating a spinning wheel. Modi has meanwhile shuttered
boards that gave artisans a voice in policy under the slogan "Minimum
Government and Maximum Governance" (Vincent 2020). The [technology
itself does not guarantee self-governance]{.underline}, [but it can be
the **symbolic base** from which **ever-enlarging acts** of
self-governance **defeat an empire**]{.underline}.

In the spirit of the technological cipher [I propose the pursuit
of]{.underline} "**[governable stacks]{.underline}**": [an orientation
toward **ungovernable organising** under digital
colonialism]{.underline}.

The geek-colloquial meaning of stack, in the most relevant sense, is a
set of interoperating hardware and software. Benjamin H. Bratton (2016,
xvii) goes further, describing [the stack as]{.underline} "[a new
architecture for how we divide the world into sovereign
spaces]{.underline}". Its layers [come with **intersecting relations**
of dependency]{.underline}, [along with **emergent
freedoms**]{.underline}. [A stack might include all that enables one to
use a]{.underline} social media [service]{.underline}, for instance:
[the **server farms**]{.underline}, [the **corporation**]{.underline}
that owns them, [its **investors**]{.underline}, [the
**software**]{.underline} the servers run on, [the]{.underline} secret
**[algorithms]{.underline}** that analyse one's data, [the **mobile
device**]{.underline}, its accelerometer sending biometric data to the
server farm, [the **network provider**]{.underline}, [the backdoor
access for **law enforcement**]{.underline}, and so on. The layers of a
stack might further include [the **sun** or **coal** powering
it]{.underline}, [the **wars** fuelled by rare-earth
mining]{.underline}, [and the **mythologies** and **rituals** that
dictate what people in it will tolerate]{.underline}. Each layer is in
fact multiple layers, and layers build on each other.

Before governable stacks were the topic of this article, they were an
experience for me, particularly through an organisation in which I have
been an anecdotal participantobserver for a decade. **[May
First]{.underline}** Movement Technology (mayfirst.coop) is a
cooperative that [provides **web hosting**]{.underline}, **[cloud
services]{.underline}**, [and **public education** for]{.underline} a
850-strong membership composed largely of [activist
organisations]{.underline} in the United States and Mexico (Lopez et al.
2007). Through [the tools]{.underline} May First offers, I have been
able to [move]{.underline} much of my daily [computing **away** from
companies that **surveil** and **extract** into]{.underline} servers I
co-own and govern, running **[commons-based software]{.underline}**. I
have formed relationships with the people who maintain these services
and participated in decision-making over bilingual conference calls and
online ballots. I learn about new tools from fellow members, and we
sponsor events that teach people outside our membership how to challenge
the power of big tech in their lives and their communities. Akin to the
slow food movement, [this is **slow computing**]{.underline} (Schneider
2015), its pace [measured not by bandwidth or processing speed but by
the attention to the **social dimensions** of everyday
practice]{.underline}.

While Silicon Valley elites escape to phone-free retreats (Marantz 2019)
and agonise about their children's exposure to screens (Bowles 2018),
May First offers no such "abhorrence of machinery" (Chaplin 1966, 373).
[It **does not accept the false choice** between]{.underline} addictive,
[**surveillance-addled apps** and a **fantasy of**]{.underline}
returning to **[some blissful innocence]{.underline}**. Instead,
[members share technologies that **do what they need** and that they can
**reasonably control**]{.underline}. [These technologies]{.underline},
[and the self-governance we surround them with]{.underline}, [are our
stack]{.underline}. May First does not demand that you 'learn to code',
or otherwise trade traditional knowledge for digital expertise. For me,
[being part of a governable stack]{.underline} like May First
[has]{.underline} **[unlocked political possibilities]{.underline}**.
[The experience motivated years of working to build governable stacks
elsewhere]{.underline}, because I know that it can be done. I poured
myself into [developing alternative ownership models like]{.underline}
"**[platform cooperatives]{.underline}**" (Schneider 2018)
[and]{.underline} "**[exit to community]{.underline}**" (Mannan and
Schneider 2021) [that are **better suited** to making tech
governable]{.underline}. With time, ungovernable stacks have come to
feel like foreign lands. I may use them, but they never feel like home.

[Governable stacks are cyborg assemblages of inter-operating
technology]{.underline}, [in symbiosis with human
relationships]{.underline} (Haraway 1991; Puar 2012). [Those
relationships]{.underline} [organise power]{.underline}, [in
**partnership** with the technology more than through **domination**
over it]{.underline}. [We learn with each other]{.underline}, [and we
learn with the machines]{.underline}, which take on life of their own --
through their own intelligence, or that which we affectionately project
onto them. In the sense of Grace Lee and Jimmy Boggs's dialectical
humanism, [governable stacks]{.underline} [invite the people who use
them to **change their relationship** with technologies]{.underline},
[to **imagine different sorts** of technologies]{.underline}, [and to be
**changed themselves**]{.underline}.

[Perhaps governability can be achieved by **reconfiguring** tools that
already exist]{.underline}; [perhaps it is necessary to **make new
ones**]{.underline}. Tiziana Terranova (2014), who has proposed the
complementary idea of a "red stack", writes that [insurgent stacks
become]{.underline} "[new platforms through a **crafty bricolage** of
existing technologies]{.underline}, the enactment of new subjectivities
through a detournement of widespread social media literacy". Older
technologies may be better suited to this than newer ones (Maxigas and
Latzko-Toth 2020). [Even the colonial platforms can be
**repurposed**]{.underline} -- as the Algerian writer Kateb Yacine said
of the French language -- [as **spoils of war**]{.underline}. [The
lifeblood of the governable stack is not any claim to innovation but the
self-governance that flows through it]{.underline}. What emerges from
there is the point.

The **[Guifi.net]{.underline}** community Internet network in Catalonia
(guifi.net) [became the condition of possibility for a suite
of]{.underline} "**[community cloud]{.underline}**"
[services]{.underline} deployed through it (Selimi et al. 2015).
**[FairTEC]{.underline}** (fairtec.io) [combines]{.underline} into one
product [a stack of preexisting services across]{.underline} three
[European countries]{.underline}: a sustainably manufactured smartphone,
a non-commercial operating system, a cooperative telecom, and a
cooperative phone rental company. The developers of the
**[CommonsCloud]{.underline}** (commonscloud.coop) [see their shared
technology as only one layer of a larger community stack]{.underline},
[which also includes]{.underline} "**[social]{.underline}**"
[and]{.underline} "**[discursive]{.underline}**" [layers]{.underline} --
the context and substance of their self-governance. Layers form over
time, too. [Governable stacks of the past lurk in the archaeology of
colonial systems through legacies like **Indymedia**]{.underline}, an
activist social network whose participatory servers and software
prefigured the corporate "Web 2.0" (Pickard 2006). Indymedia itself drew
from decades of organising among activist communityradio stations,
particularly in Latin America (Ruiz Martinez 2021). [There can be **no
one governable stack**]{.underline} -- [only **many**]{.underline},
[whose archipelagos of commoning **enable each other** and **give rise
to more**]{.underline}.

Technologists seeking alternative visions have often gravitated to the
Free Software and Open Source movements, which employ creative licensing
to enable the sharing of accessible and modifiable code. These movements
have been successful in terms of the sheer volume of widely used
software in their commons. But their emphasis on the freedoms of
individual users, as well as of corporations, has privileged those with
the technical know-how to take advantage. The software commons has
spawned operating systems that fly in military jets and databases that
aid in the imprisonment of asylum seekers (Ehmke 2020). In the name of
freedom, too, developers have harboured sexism and other forms of
exclusionary culture (SSL Nagbot 2016). Governable stacks should
prioritise community accountability alongside individual freedom.

[Another emerging strategy for challenging digital colonialism has come
from **within**]{.underline}. [Employees]{.underline} at Silicon Valley
giants [have achieved reforms by organising against certain ethical
outrages at their workplaces]{.underline} (Tarnoff 2020). [Yet there are
**limits** to what these campaigns are likely to achieve]{.underline},
[since these]{.underline} workers are invested -- often literally,
through stock options -- in the basic business models of their
employers. Employees' actions [can present the impression that their
protest **cleanses** the colonial tools they produce]{.underline}.
[Governable stacks do not seek merely to **improve the
occupier**]{.underline}. "Decolonization is not an 'and'", as Tuck and
Yang (2012) put it. "It is an elsewhere" (36).

Experiences with governable stacks introduce us to possible elsewheres.
The spinning wheel was an elsewhere, the invention of a democratic
India. May First Movement Technology is an elsewhere for its members,
who in turn become part of its learning and evolving. Collectives,
families, and movements can assemble and adjust their stacks over time,
wherever possible seeking to make their technological lives ever more
governable. I next turn to strategies to guide the process of doing so.

5\. Governable Strategy

May First is infinitesimally small by the standards of the tech economy.
"Goldman Sachs doesn't care if you're raising chickens", as the
political theorist Jodi Dean (2011) has said. It's a reminder for anyone
tempted to see too much potential in personal practices, technological
or otherwise. But spinning wheels are small, too, and they helped drive
away the British Empire.

adrienne maree brown (2017) credits Grace Lee Boggs for helping her see
that (her emphasis) "[what we practice at the small scale **sets the
patterns** for the **whole system**]{.underline}". She explains this in
a chapter called "Fractals", which recalls how she shifted her activism
to better reflect her political values in daily practice. [Fractals are
mathematical phenomena]{.underline}, frequent in nature, [whose patterns
at smaller scales **repeat** at larger scales]{.underline}. They are
appealing and widely used as a metaphor, being both mathematically
precise in theory and conveniently vague when applied to human affairs.
Those like brown and Boggs who apply fractal-talk to politics exercise a
kind of faith. To make good on that faith, there must some linkage, some
strategy, that connects self-governance from the scale of small
communities to the larger societies those community seek to transform.
[There was a fractal in the **free maroons of Saint-Domingue** who
stormed down from their mountains into combat with French troops so the
whole island could be free]{.underline}.

[There was a fractal in]{.underline} the spinning wheel on [the **Indian
National Congress** flag]{.underline}, [extending from a traditional
practice to an eventual industrial policy]{.underline}. These chickens
came to roost because they were part of a strategy that involved
organised confrontation with colonial power. [Self-governing became a
**challenge**]{.underline}, [a **threat**]{.underline}. In **[even small
experiments]{.underline}**, governable stacks [can begin to
**normalise** the otherwise elusive fact that **better ways of
organising technology** are possible]{.underline}. [Carefully chosen
practices **sever habits of dependency** on the systems we seek to
resist]{.underline}.

It is an uncomfortable matter of fact that nowhere has been so
successful a counterweight to the power of Silicon Valley as China. The
country has not only barred certain data-colonising companies with its
'Great Firewall' but has cultivated comparably ubiquitous Internet
firms, using comparably invasive colonial practices to produce platforms
that are at once hyper-capitalist and dominated by state interests (Chu
2017; Hong 2017). And yet China's policy of sovereignty shows that
dependence on hostile stacks is not inevitable.

Rather than trading one colonial power for another, [**Western Europe**
has sought a high road in demanding **privacy regulations** and
investments in **commons-based technology**]{.underline} (Lemley 2020).
[Projects such as the **Sovereign Cloud Stack**]{.underline}
(scs.community) [seek to supplant reliance on corporate walled gardens
with **globally replicable**]{.underline}, **[locally deployed
tools]{.underline}**. [Several]{.underline} European [governments have
adopted and funded **free/open-source software**]{.underline} like the
Matrix (matrix.org) messaging protocol and NextCloud (nextcloud.com), a
file-sharing platform. Countries far from the power centres, like Uganda
and Lebanon, have experimented with imposing taxes on the use of foreign
social media (Boxell and Steinert-Threlkeld 2019). [Although such
efforts have been widely perceived as acts of repression more than
solidarity]{.underline}, [similar policies could be used for **different
goals**]{.underline}. Echoing the Cold War-era Non-Aligned Movement
among countries caught between the United States and the Soviet Union,
[some have been calling for a]{.underline} "**[digital non-aligned
movement]{.underline}**" [that asserts many diverse
sovereignties]{.underline} against the duelling forces of Silicon Valley
and Shenzhen (Freuler 2020; Mejias 2020).

**[Sovereignty need not be solely the purview of nation
states]{.underline}**. [The discourse of digital sovereignty has been
particularly important among **indigenous communities** whose members
are used to seeing their pre-digital sovereignty effaced]{.underline};
[they have developed **governable stack-layers** such as **tribal
broadband lines**]{.underline} (Blackwater 2020),
**[cryptocurrencies]{.underline}** (Tekobbe and McKnight 2016), **[data
governance]{.underline}** (Carroll et al. 2020), [and **linguistic
autonomy**]{.underline} (Pinto 2018). Amelia Winger-Bearskin (2020)
draws on the Haudenosaunee practice of wampum agreements to propose
"**[ethical dependencies]{.underline}**" in software; these [would
encode and enforce certain commitments **up** and **down the
stack**]{.underline}. [Laying claim to collective
sovereignty]{.underline} is central to such practices. Glen Sean
Coulthard (2014) [**challenges** the]{.underline} "**[colonial politics
of recognition]{.underline}**" -- [when people accept their
**colonisers' definition** of their sovereignty]{.underline}, [rather
than their **own**]{.underline} -- [to insist on **more autonomous
forms** of self-determination]{.underline}. He describes how tribal
nations can produce sovereignty through "community-scale activities"
such as cooperatives and assemblies in everyday life (68). The
indigenous organiser Berta Cáceres, before her murder by Honduran
paramilitaries, denounced the pseudo-democracy of political
representatives but affirmed the "decisive" democracy possible through
poor people's movements (Castellanos and Pine 2020).

[Sovereignty can occur at levels ranging from the **network backbone**
to **last-mile connections**]{.underline}, [up through the **hardware**
and **software** of devices]{.underline}, [to the **collaboration
tools** in the cloud]{.underline}. [Sovereignty looks like a
**user-owned cooperative** or a **city providing
connectivity**]{.underline}, [or like **Douglass**]{.underline}
(douglass.io), an operating system whose apps take their names from
icons of Black liberation. The tech publication The Markup has paid
[a]{.underline} "**[privacy tax]{.underline}**" by developing its own
software that protects user data rather than adopting the standard
surveillance-based offerings (Angwin 2020). For **[Archive of Our
Own]{.underline}** (archiveofourown.org), a fan-run fandom repository,
sovereignty puts creators in control of how they publish and protects
their work against copyright overreach. [What makes technology sovereign
is when its stewards are the **people** who depend on it]{.underline},
[**protected** from outside control]{.underline} by any legal or
extra-legal means available. [The data]{.underline}, [the
algorithms]{.underline}, [and the interfaces are **for** their
users]{.underline}, [rather than acting surreptitiously **against**
them]{.underline}.

5.2. Democracy

[The other side]{.underline} of sovereignty [is participatory
democracy]{.underline} -- its guarantor and its everyday practice. Here
[we **resist** the temptation of **autocratic vanguardism** by designing
governable stacks to be **accountable** and **alive**]{.underline}. [The
style of democracy may be that of the **Debian operating
system**]{.underline}, [a constitutional republic of coders]{.underline}
(debian.org/devel/constitution), [or like the **Ethical Source
Movement's vision** of many collectives deciding on the ethical limits
of how their software can be used]{.underline} (ethicalsource.dev).
[Digital democracy is beginning to have dedicated tools]{.underline} --
[from smaller-group decisions on **Loomio**]{.underline} (loomio.org)
[to the scale of cities or countries through **Barcelona's
Decidim**]{.underline} (decidim.org) [or **Polis**]{.underline}
(pol.is), which is employed [by]{.underline} the government of
**[Taiwan]{.underline}** (Stempeck 2020). [Platform cooperatives
practice democracy at the level of the company]{.underline}, [such as at
**Stocksy**]{.underline} United (stocksy.com), co-owned by artists in
dozens of countries (Schneider 2018). [On a network scale]{.underline},
the federated social network [**Mastodon** was able to counteract an
incursion by]{.underline} the alt-right platform **[Gab]{.underline}**,
[as it did earlier with]{.underline} **[I]{.underline}**slamic
**[S]{.underline}**tate accounts -- [through self-organised
activity]{.underline} by server administrators and app developers
(Caelin 2020). [Countering hate speech doesn't need to depend on the
might of a **global monopoly**]{.underline}; [it can be **tangible** and
**empowering**]{.underline}.

[Practices of local democracy from the Global South have been migrating
into **governable online tools**]{.underline}. [Participatory budgeting
practices originating from **Porto Alegre**]{.underline}, Brazil
(Cabannes 2004), [have appeared in]{.underline} apps like
**[Cobudget]{.underline}** (cobudget.co) [and **Decidim**]{.underline}.
A founder of an experimental political party in Argentina, **[Partido
Red]{.underline}**, [has applied the same logic]{.underline} of "liquid
democracy" [to a blockchain-based governance platform]{.underline},
**[Democracy Earth]{.underline}** (democracy.earth). **[Mexico
City's]{.underline}** 2016 [exercise in crowdsourcing its constitution
has]{.underline} been studied as [a **model around the
world**]{.underline}.

[Digital democracy has the potential to evolve **rapidly** and
**creatively**]{.underline}. [People can participate in **far more
rapid** and **fine-grained ways** than was possible when the prevailing
regimes of corporate and state governance first appeared]{.underline}.
Organisational [designs that work well could become part of a
**governance commons**]{.underline}, [enabling other groups to
**adopt**]{.underline}, **[adapt]{.underline}**, [and **share** them
back into the common pool]{.underline} (Schneider et al. 2021). In this
way, [small-scale accountability can **spread**]{.underline}, [and it
can creep into **larger** and **larger kinds** of
communities]{.underline}, [demonstrating that colonial control was
**never necessary**]{.underline}. **[The more we demand and practice the
arts of self-governing]{.underline}**, **[the harder we are for someone
else to govern]{.underline}**.

5.3. Insurgency

The spinning wheel stood for household autonomy, but it was also
defiance against British rule. [Governable stacks must be]{.underline}
similarly **[insurgent]{.underline}**. [Some of the earliest online
social media emerged through **Indymedia's coverage** of anti-capitalist
protests]{.underline}. [**Twitter** has its roots in technology for
coordinating street protests]{.underline} (Costanza-Chock 2020, Chapter
3). [While investors and accelerators receive frequent credit for
innovation]{.underline}, [insurgency is **just as much** a source of
it]{.underline}.

[Insurgency might mean challenging government subpoenas of member
data]{.underline}, [as **May First** has done]{.underline}, [or
facilitating leaks about abuses of power]{.underline}. [Resistance might
take the form of what the **Catalan Integral Cooperative**
calls]{.underline} "**[economic disobedience]{.underline}**"
(cooperativa.cat/economic-disobedience), [which includes refusing to pay
unjust taxes or interest]{.underline}. [Insurgents might choose not to
submit the data of a friendship to the social graphs of colonial
platforms]{.underline}, [or to actively deceive those
platforms]{.underline}, [just as the **Tor** network]{.underline}
(torproject.org) [disguises its users' locations]{.underline}. [Like
**Copwatch** groups or the **Driver's Seat Cooperative**]{.underline}
(driversseat.sco), [insurgents can do data collection on the
colonisers]{.underline}, **[sousveillance from below]{.underline}**
(Browne 2015).

To the extent that establishing the expansionist, slaveholding republic
of the United States was also an anticolonial conflict, it relied on
self-governance as resistance. The colonists organised through a
Continental Congress, which extracted lessons from the Haudenosaunee
nations -- yes to confederation, no to matriarchal authority -- to
prefigure a future government. After independence, Alexis de Tocqueville
(1840/2006) observed how the flourishing of civic associations energised
the politics of the fledgling republic. Successful poor people's
struggles against the country's wealthy elites, from the 19th-century
Populists (Goodwyn 1978) to the 20th-century movements for Black power
(Nembhard 2014), grew out of tangible collective organising in labour
unions and cooperatives.

[Insurgents might use colonial platforms for **education** and
**organising**]{.underline}. [They might **spread viral messages** and
**enjoy themselves**]{.underline}. [But if they have **governable
stacks** to go back to]{.underline}, [they are **more than just
subjects**]{.underline}. [They are **maroons**]{.underline}, [with
**swamps** and **forests** of their own]{.underline}.

#### Governable stacks are the only solvent mechanism for cybersecurity cooperation. Legal mechanisms for constraining cyberwar are a [pipe dream]{.underline}; the proliferation of debates on those terms creates a [smokescreen]{.underline} for cybernetic infrastructure to spread across the planet, which makes militarism and nuclear annihilation [inevitable]{.underline}. We must [reorient]{.underline} the resolutional model of thought towards [corporeal care]{.underline}.

**Dyer-Witheford and Matviyenko, 19**---associate professor of
information and media studies at the University of Western Ontario;
assistant professor of communication at Simon Fraser University (Nick
and Svitlana, "What Is to Be Done?," *Cyberwar and Revolution: Digital
Subterfuge in Global Capitalism*, Chapter 3, 151-161, dml)

As we have argued, from 1945 on, [the hegemonic status of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, as
the world's chief capitalist power, [was **intrinsically related** to
the development of]{.underline} computers and networks. The role of
[digital systems]{.underline} in its military--industrial complex,
initially tightly coupled with nuclear weapons, spread through other
aspects of its war-making system as well as through the general economy.
In both aspects, it contributed to the United States's eventual Cold War
victory. In the aftermath of that victory, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [continued to
develop]{.underline} its digital military capacities into the ever more
direct weaponization of network, creating [the **technological human
assemblages** of]{.underline} what is today referred to as
**[cyberwar]{.underline}**. The scope of NSA global surveillance and
sabotage programs and the sophistication of the Stuxnet nuclear
centrifuge-destroying malware are only the most manifest instances of
[this process]{.underline}, which [is]{.underline} today [an **integral
part** of a wider upgrade of U.S. military capacities that ties together
a **nuclear primacy** with the **militarization of space** and **drone
warfare**]{.underline}. [Accompanying and spurring on this process is
the]{.underline} additional [dynamic of cyberwar adoption by the forces
**antagonistic** to]{.underline} the global dominance of
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
its **allies**]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} antagonists
[include]{.underline} the defeated socialist powers, [**Russia** and
**China**]{.underline}, now paradoxically resurrected as capitalist
competitors in the world market, or, in the case of **[North
Korea]{.underline}**, surviving in a macabre afterlife of state
socialism. They also include the forces of **[militant Islamic
jihadism]{.underline}**, beckoned into existence by the West as an
anticommunist ally, only to become its opponent in the long war on
terror. [All these actors **converge** on the militarization of digital
networks]{.underline}. Many observers today see a moment that
recapitulates the decline of previous imperial hegemons within the
global capitalist system---Spain, Holland, Britain---and parallels the
moments of extreme instability as old powers and new contenders confront
each other.7 [The rise of cyberwar is]{.underline} part of this tumult
and quite possibly [a precursor and preparation for **widening** and
**intensifying conflict**]{.underline}. Schematically, [we can
envisage]{.underline} three potentially intertwining trajectories such a
process might take:

1\. Network degradation. Alexander Klimburg (2017) outlines the
possibility of a "darkening web" characterized by [**persistent** and
**gradually intensifying** cyberwar between states and between states
and terrorist movements conducted in a **variety of
registers**]{.underline}. [Security breaches]{.underline}, [aggressive
malware]{.underline}, [and botnet attacks **proliferate**]{.underline}.
[Digital industrial sabotage and critical infrastructure attacks begin
to **multiply**]{.underline}, [as do the **accidental runaway effects**
of cyberweapons]{.underline}. Networks are deeply and chronically
infected with computational propaganda, fake news, and viral mis- and
disinformation. [In response to adversarial incursions]{.underline},
[states intensify **algorithmic surveillance**]{.underline},
**[censorship]{.underline}**, [and **preemptive virtual
policing**]{.underline}. [Cybersecurity provisions become **increasingly
mandatory** and **elaborate**]{.underline}. [Attribution
problems]{.underline}, [falsification]{.underline} of evidence,
[and]{.underline} the [overlap]{.underline} between military and
intelligence forces and criminal networks [create a **chaotic digital
twilight**]{.underline} of hacking and trolling, botnets and viruses,
malware, surveillance, and bugs, shutdowns, blocking, and filtering, [in
which uncertainties **exacerbate** suspicions and
hostilities]{.underline}, altogether making the internet increasingly
impossible to use. In short, the "darkening web" is what already exists
now, only more so. One of the cofounders of Twitter, Evan Williams,
offered his diagnosis, suggesting that "the Internet is broken"
(Streitfeld 2017). But maybe it's not. Maybe the internet is finally
what it was always meant to be. Maybe it is perfect, but not for us, the
excommunicated user-subjects. For cyberwar.

2\. Hybrid escalations. Similarly rooted in the present is the
likelihood that the [simultaneous virtual and kinetic
conflicts]{.underline}, such as the Syrian civil war, the fighting in
Donbas, and the many branches of the war on terror, [continue and break
out in new regions]{.underline}, [bringing **ever higher levels** and
**varieties** of cyberweapons]{.underline}, deployed for purposes
ranging from intelligence gathering, battlefield surveillance, and
munitions delivery to sabotage of enemies' domestic and military
resources. The use of drones and other semi- or fully automated weapons
systems expands and takes new directions, such as the development of
swarms of small autonomous vehicles---"slaughterbots" (Economist
2017a)---for house-to-house fighting in ruined cities. The biometric and
networked tracking of refugees created by such conflicts, and the
control and interdiction of their entry to affluent fortressed
homelands, becomes a major activity of the nation-state security
apparatus. Because present hybrid wars are also in large part proxy
wars, where local battlefield actors are directly or indirectly
supported by major powers, they are charged with the possibility of
abrupt collisions between the most powerful militaries on the planet.

3\. "Thermonuclear cyberwar." We borrow this phrase from Erik Gartzke
and Jon Lindsay (2017), who are among several authors currently pointing
to a renewed and dangerous rendezvous between cyber- and nuclear
weaponry. The last decade of debates between defense intellectuals about
cyberwar has split those who see digital attacks a new equivalent of
nuclear weapons, capable of disabling whole societies through critical
infrastructure attacks, and skeptics who deride such anxieties as
hyperbolic and implausible. But "**[cyber]{.underline}**"
[and]{.underline} "**[nuke]{.underline}**" [are **not
separate**]{.underline}. As we have seen, [they were twinned at the
moment of conception]{.underline}, with the development of each
dependent on the other. And [the connection is not just
historical]{.underline}; [it is **current**]{.underline}. Now [cyberwar
weaponry is part of a new approach to nuclear war fighting]{.underline},
the left-of-launch approach. Early ventures in antiballistic missile
defense, such as Reagan's "Star Wars" strategic defense initiative,
depended on shooting down swarms of missiles as they plunged through the
atmosphere toward their target. Left of launch, in contrast, aims to
"strike an enemy missile before liftoff or during the first seconds of
flight," using "cyber strikes, electronic warfare and other exotic forms
of sabotage" (Broad and Sanger 2017). This doctrine was incubated during
the Obama administration and inherited by the Trump presidency.
Advocates of the left-of-launch nuclear strategy present it as a
defensive measure. However, [the doctrine **destabilizes basic
premises** of deterrence that have]{.underline}, since 1945,
[**restrained** nuclear weapon use]{.underline} (Cimbala 2017).
Deterrence depends on a dread faith by all parties that both their own
and their enemies' nuclear weapons will work. [The possibility
that]{.underline} nuclear weapons [systems might be secretly disabled
raises prospects both of **overconfidence**]{.underline} (trusting one
can sabotage an opponent's system) [or **panicked
preemption**]{.underline} (fearing left-of-launch attacks on one's own
nukes and falling into a "use 'em or lose 'em" mind-set). More
generally, [control and command of nuclear weapons depend on
communication systems whose collapse in a crisis situation could have
**catastrophic results**]{.underline}.8 The origin of the internet lay
in the U.S. attempt to ensure continuance of such systems in the event
of nuclear war; now [the weaponization of the internet]{.underline}
itself [constitutes a possible cause of **nuclear war**]{.underline}.

Facing such prospects, [liberal commentators propose **diplomatic
measures** to control and mitigate cyberhostilities]{.underline}.
Klimburg (2017), for example, suggests a series of initiatives to be
undertaken primarily by the United Nations and the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the long-standing (and
controversy-ridden) forum for internet governance. In these venues, he
suggests, it should be possible to work out a series of
agreements---"[digital arms]{.underline}" **[limitation
treaties]{.underline}**, comparable to those on nuclear weapons;
[an]{.underline} "[attribution and adjudication]{.underline}"
[**council** to assess and arbitrate responsibility]{.underline} for
cyberattacks; [**international cooperation** against
cybercrime]{.underline}; the [promotion]{.underline} within ICANN
[of]{.underline} "**[civil society]{.underline}**"
[perspectives]{.underline} to counter those of states and corporations.
He suggests that "standing bodies" regulating cyberwar would be
comparable to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and
emphasizes the importance of "scientific and authoritative advice from
experts to political decision makers on how to avoid disaster" (344).

[Such proposals]{.underline}, seemingly eminently sensible, [**ignore**
the reality that the tensions driving the rise of cyberwar are also
**incapacitating** the fragile apparatuses and institutions of
international cooperation]{.underline} that have existed since 1945. As
Jon Lindsay (2012) observes, while proposals for [cyberwarfare
treaties]{.underline} are "well meaning," they [would]{.underline},
[within the current state of international great power
relations]{.underline}, [be]{.underline} "**[hacked to
bits]{.underline}**," [because]{.underline}
"[cyberoperations]{.underline}, like other types of intelligence and
covert operations, [take place in the **shadows**]{.underline}. [An
international treaty on cyberweapons would be]{.underline} . . .
**[totally unenforceable]{.underline}**, [since such activity is
designed to **evade** detection and attribution]{.underline}." The
conjuncture in which cyberwar rises, and part of the reason for its
ascent, is the breakdown of nuclear arms limitation and nonproliferation
treaties. Klimburg's comparison of the regulation of cyberwar and
climate change is unfortunately all too telling, given the failure of
global capitalism to generate any binding interstate agreements on
carbon emissions and the recent withdrawal of the United States from
even the nonbinding Paris accord on global warming. And like slowing
climate change, reducing the risk of cyberwar requires deep, systemic
social change.

The argument of this book is that cyberwar is a manifestation of the
competitive nature of capitalism, which, beneath the surface of
globalization, fosters a war of all against all, conducted in the
accelerated, automated, and abstracted forms on which this entire mode
of production now depends. It follows from this that [the prospects for
reducing the dangers of cyberwar]{.underline}, and of the other types of
war of which it is now part, [**depend strongly** on movements and
struggles to **constrain** and]{.underline}, ultimately, [**abolish**
this internally antagonistic order]{.underline}. A recognition of the
extreme difficulty of this project is inherent in the point on which we
opened this chapter, namely, Noys's observation that [the]{.underline}
military high-technology "**[endocolonization]{.underline}**" [of
society has been]{.underline} a factor in **[decomposing]{.underline}**
the traditional industrial working-class [movements]{.underline} that
were historically the main agencies of socialist and communist projects.
[However]{.underline}, [there is also a possible **reversal** of this
logic]{.underline}, [if averting]{.underline} war, including
[cyberwar]{.underline}, [becomes]{.underline} entwined with other
issues, such as struggles for social equality and ecological
sustainability, [a **focal point** for recomposition of movements
looking beyond capital]{.underline}, drawing on new and diverse
constituencies. We have indicated some of the issues that we think might
be drawn together around resistance to the rise of cyberwar:
antisurveillance sentiment, rejection of the secrecy of the security
state and its new digital complexes, concern over the corruption of the
general intellect by mis- and disinformation, objection to corporate and
military criminality, and, of course, revulsion at the exterminatory
horrors of war, from the terror of dirty wars to global thermonuclear
catastrophe.

In his reflections on Marxist theories of war and revolution, Balibar
(2002) remarks on the coexistence within this body of thought of two
contradictory elements, one stressing the idea of "revolutionary war,"
the other of "revolutionary peace." The first stresses "armed struggle
against capital," the second "the refusal of capitalist wars"---"in many
respects this class war is therefore also a non-war, or an anti-war"
(11). If, in the title to this chapter, we invoked Lenin's What Is to Be
Done?, it is partly to remember that, though Lenin is today primarily
thought of as a theorist of revolutionary war, perhaps the major
decision of Leninism was one for peace (even if his later adoption of
Trotsky's formula of "no war, no peace" resonates with today's state of
cyberwar). The outbreak of World War I precipitated a schism in the
international socialist movement. Leading European socialist democratic
parties all too rapidly discarded their longheld view that war
exemplified the irrationality of competitive capitalism, forgot their
commitments to peace and worldwide worker solidarity, rallied behind
their governments, and joined the march to mass slaughter. Only the
faction of what is sometimes known as the Zimmerwald Left (Nation 1989),
led by Lenin, continued to speak out for internationalism. It was thus
not just revolt against exploitation but rejection of the holocaust of
World War I, a program of "bread and peace," that gave communism a moral
claim to universality. Terrifying contemporary parallels to the pre1914
years today demand an updated strategy for "bread and peace," with
"bread" understood as a securing of ecological conditions for species
life and "peace" as elimination of systemic social violence.

One of the slogans of the Zimmerwald Left was "Krieg dem Krieg," "war on
war," and it is tempting to take this up, in a very literal sense, and
propose a "cyberwar on cyberwar." As we have seen, there is a hacking
front to both the struggles against digital militarism and contemporary
anticapitalist movements. They have exposed the workings of the cyberwar
complex and brought it to light. Their main figures are defectors from
that complex. More broadly, over recent decades, many critical theorists
have argued for forms of "cyborg" dissent and for deployment of the arms
available to "immaterial labor," whether in the networked mobilization
of protest or in more direct digital disruptions of war making. Cyberwar
on cyberwar is both a metaphorical and practical possibility, and we
have seen situations when "Krieg dem Krieg," in the most concrete sense,
is the only effective response to murderous attack.

However, we would suggest that to conduct "cyberwar on cyberwar," though
it may sometimes be necessary, is to fight on unfavorable terrain. We
have seen that hacktivism suffers problems of accountability,
transparency, provocation; can itself be compromised and ensnared within
the exploits of the military--internet complex; and is ultimately highly
vulnerable to the police and intelligence apparatus. And, as Noys (2013)
observes, even reliance on the speed with which networks can circulate
struggles tends to discount how much more advantage such velocity today
gives capital's military--security complexes (in this respect, we note
that the huge, worldwide, and digitally mobilized protests against the
Iraq War in 2003 must be reckoned a tragic failure of networked
activism). Cyberwar on cyberwar is a method of fast politics, and speed
is where the user-subjects ultimately lose, encountering the inhuman
acceleration of machinic processing power. To succeed, such resistance
requires a break from the mainstream paradigm of today's "platform
capitalism" with all its repetitious "Twitter revolutions," "Facebook
revolutions," or "Snapchat revolutions," slogans that should remind us
that, as Lacan once notoriously noted, an ultimate misconception of
revolution is as a desire for a new master or a master in a new form
that leads away from the systemic change rather than not toward it. Here
we disagree with the conclusion of Brian Massumi's (2015, 243) otherwise
excellent study of the new "ontopowers" of military networking, where,
discussing the logic of speed and preemption, he suggests that
countermovements have no choice but to "go forward, with the flow."

While tactical resistance can involve any and all of the "memes of
production" (Deterritorial Support Group 2012), a reconstitution of the
left today must ask, what is the opposite of cyberwar? To this, we would
answer that [the antithesis of cyberwar is **corporeal care of the
subject** achieved through the]{.underline} "[balanced conceptions of
space and time within culture]{.underline}" [and]{.underline}
"[awareness of]{.underline} spatial and temporal [dynamics]{.underline}
\[[that]{.underline}\] [keep state and market power in
check]{.underline}" (Sharma 2013, 314). It is from this perspective that
[we need to recognize cyberwar's production of time and space and
envision different times and spaces]{.underline}---those [of the **care
of bodies**]{.underline}. [This orientation]{.underline} against the
social destruction, physical, psychological, and infrastructural, of
cyberwar [does not mean **totally abandoning** the
digital]{.underline}---[which]{.underline}, because it so much composes
the very texture of everyday life, [would be not only **difficult** but
often **politically fatal**]{.underline}. But [it does mean its
**rearticulation** to a set of purposes **radically different** from
those of digital capital]{.underline}. In particular, [this]{.underline}
strategy [requires **theoretical reconsideration** and **practical
subversion**]{.underline} of the addicted, complicit digital user, the
figure envisioned by neoliberal Silicon Valley, [by way of]{.underline}
desynchronization and emancipation.

This can be described as [recognizing a position **in** and **against**
the military environment of cyberwar in which all of us are now
imbricated and finding ways to **develop subjectivities** that are
simultaneously **of** the network and **off** the network]{.underline}.
[It requires the]{.underline} "**[slow]{.underline}**" [time necessary
for the **in-person**]{.underline} ([rather than
**online**]{.underline}) [organization of **antiwar
collectives**]{.underline}, **[movements]{.underline}**, [and
**alliances**]{.underline}; defection from compulsive social media use;
trammeling corporate capacities to intensify and maintain such addictive
behavior; [the **patient defense** and **reconstruction** of the basic
public institutions of corporeal care]{.underline}---free health
services; the cultivation of mental health; [the recovery and deepening
of the]{.underline} legacy of a semidestroyed (or, in many places, never
created) **[welfare state]{.underline}** in a new "commonfare";
[**universal education** provisions]{.underline}; [**worker--community
control** of workplaces and the means of production]{.underline};
**[ecological protections]{.underline}**---[and the assertion of such
priorities **against** the expense and logic of **networked
militarization**]{.underline}. [In this work of solidarity]{.underline},
[the subject **exploited** and **excommunicated** by digital capitalism
can transition from **alienation** toward **reciprocity**]{.underline}.
And [to those who say that the accelerated logic of cyberwar means we
**don't have time** to do all this before catastrophe
arrives]{.underline}, we just say, **[you may be right]{.underline}**,
**[but still we have to do it anyway!]{.underline}** We can build a
"counterwar machine" constructed on the diagonal line that runs between
waging cyberwar on cyberwar and fostering the caring corporeality that
is opposite of cyberwar.

At the end of her study of world labor activism, Beverly Silver (2003,
176) notes a major reason for the shortage of militant working-class
movements in the early twenty-first century. Neoliberalism's
restructuring, globalization, and financialization, with its "growing
structural unemployment, escalating inequalities and major disruptions,"
has repeated the crisis patterns of previous eras of capitalism, with
one crucial exception. The missing condition is large-scale armed
conflict. This "global political--military context contrasts sharply
with . . . that \[which\] produced radicalized and explosive labour
unrest in the first half of the twentieth century." As Silver notes, war
then involved the mass mobilization of populations that characterized
total war. States depended on their working classes to provide not just
millions of soldiers but labor in munition plants, shipyards and
aircraft factories, hospitals, and farms. When mass mobilization met the
horror of mass deaths and mutilation, revolutionary social turmoil could
result.

As Silver (2003, 175) observes, advanced capitalism's turn to high
technological weaponry apparently breaks this link between war and
worker revolt. Cyberwar can be seen as an extension of
[this]{.underline} "**[automation of war]{.underline}**." Nonetheless,
as we have suggested, the tendency of digital militarization to
liquidate the labor of war [is **not yet completely
fulfilled**]{.underline}. [Humans remain as the **indispensable
conscious links** and **relays** within the networks and nodes of
digital conflict]{.underline}. Indeed, what [we have seen]{.underline}
in this book is [the **surprisingly wide diffusion** of
participation]{.underline} in cyberwarfare, from the highly specialized
military and intelligence units at the cutting edge of advanced
cyberoperations to strata of mercenary and criminal proxies, online
vigilantes, patriotic hackers, corporate and criminal marketers of
cyberweaponry, cybersecurity personnel, and on to the corporate content
moderators and state censors and surveillance agents now indispensable
to the prosecution of war waged in cyberspace and across scores of
hybrid battlefields. To these more or less intentional contributions to
the mechanisms of cyberwar must be added [the]{.underline} unknowing (or
partially unknowing) [participation of network users]{.underline}, whose
online activities and addictions [provide the **vital vectors**
for]{.underline} the memes, exploits, and hijackings of [subterranean
cyberconflicts]{.underline} and whose reconstitution as data-subjects
habituated to ceaseless state and commercial surveillance constitutes
the inevitable accompaniment to such operations.

Surveying this field, we can say that military mobilization has not so
much been abolished from cyberwar as reconfigured in subterranean,
etiolated, and unfamiliar forms. This decomposition of the labor of war,
equivalent to Virilio's state of "**[endocolonization]{.underline}**"
[by the apparatus of high-technology militarism]{.underline},
[may]{.underline}, as we have proposed in this chapter, [contain
potentials for **reversal**]{.underline}. If, to date, cyberwar is not,
at least in the centers of capitalism, producing the massive havoc of
earlier forms of war, the migrant refugees of hybrid conflicts around
the world, fleeing algorithmically directed drones, social
media--activated death squads, and cybernetic strikes at social
utilities, bear witness to its potential to do so.
[Already]{.underline}, [even in ostensibly secure zones of the
planet]{.underline}, [the costs of militarized and criminalized
networks]{.underline}, [in terms of **escalating social
paranoias**]{.underline}, [**crumbling confidence** in everyday
communication and **polarizing social relations**]{.underline}, [becomes
daily more apparent]{.underline}. [If this]{.underline} course
[persists]{.underline}, [**unforeseen forms of unrest** by the new
workforces of cyberwar may **interrupt** its inhuman
trajectory]{.underline}.

#### Plan-focused debates replicate the folly of the Tallinn Manual by attempting to apply liberal technological literacy to a problem that has [outpaced liberalism itself]{.underline}. The formation of governable stacks begins [not]{.underline} with the question of how security cooperation over cybersecurity "should" occur, but what "is" cybersecurity and how it came to be that way in the first place.

**Gray and Eloff, 22**---School of Philosophy at North-West University
(Chantelle and Aragorn, "Fabulation in a Time of Algorithmic Ecology:
Making the Future Possible Again," *Technology, Urban Space and the
Networked Community*, Chapter 5, 105-133, SpringerLink, dml)

In his 2008 article, "The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the
Scientific Method Obsolete", Wired editor Chris Anderson notoriously
argues that the era of the scientific method built around testable
hypotheses is fast-becoming obsolete due to the advent of
"petabyte-scale" data accumulation and analytics. Observing that tech
companies like Google treat this "massive corpus as a laboratory of the
human condition" (Anderson 2008), Anderson polemically implores us to
forget every theory of human behaviour, from linguistics and sociology
to ontology and psychology. "With enough data", he avers, "the numbers
speak for themselves" (ibid.), and statistical correlation renders
superfluous any theorisation of causality. The Californian Ideology
(Barbrook and Cameron 1996)1 implicit in this overstatement of the
benefits of data-driven research has been challenged by several
commentators (see, e.g., Pigliucci 2009 and Mazzocchi 2015) and is
patently specious. [The appeal]{.underline} made by Silicon Valley
zealots [to]{.underline} '**[pay no attention to the man behind the
curtain]{.underline}**' [relies on a **mythical**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} sometimes even **[eschatologically
feverish]{.underline}**, [conception of science as a **purely
objective** pursuit]{.underline}, [as well as a **facile conception** of
human]{.underline} thought and behaviour---indeed,
[subjectivity]{.underline}---[wherein we can be **comprehensively
understood** via]{.underline} the [purely quantitative
approaches]{.underline} of Big Data analyses [and]{.underline} the
[statistical aggregation]{.underline} of deep learning systems. As
Louise Amoore underscores in Cloud Ethics, [this ideology confronts
our]{.underline} "[fallible]{.underline}, [intractable]{.underline},
[fraught political world with]{.underline} a curious kind of
**[infallibility]{.underline}**. In the cloud, [the promise is that
everything can be rendered **tractable**]{.underline}, [all political
difficulty and uncertainty nonetheless **actionable**]{.underline}"
(Amoore 2020, 55). [This dream of **complete**]{.underline} mathematical
and technological [**control** over reality]{.underline}---of "a kind of
atlas of clouds for the ineffable, a condensed trace of the trajectories
of our future lives with one another" (ibid.)---[is hardly
new]{.underline}. What legal theorist Antoinette Rouvroy refers to as
"algorithmic governmentality"2 (Rouvroy and Stiegler 2016, 6), by which
she means "the increasingly statistical governance of the 'real' ensuing
from a convergence of contemporary technological and socio-political
evolutions" (Rouvroy 2011, 119), can be traced at least as far back as
first-order cybernetics (Wiener 1965, 12) and, before that, to Leibniz's
calculus ratiocinator (cf. Couturat 1901). [What makes the contemporary
problem **novel**]{.underline}, however, [is that the latest
technologies]{.underline}, for example cloud computing, practically
unlimited data storage, high-speed global communications networks and,
most importantly, machine learning---and here we mean specifically new
forms of connectionist 'artificial intelligence' that, unlike older
symbolic AI models, rely on multi-layer artificial neural networks that
are assumed to represent the biology of human cognitive
structure---[have **powerfully exacerbated** the quest for]{.underline}
([and assumptions of]{.underline}) '**[Algorithmic
Supremacy]{.underline}**'. As digital technology theorist Dan McQuillan
argues, data-driven modelling via statistical induction is assumed to
bear inherent significance, but this approach, which McQuillan describes
as a form of "machinic Neoplatonism" (McQuillan 2018), tends to entirely
elide the broader subjective and inter-subjective contexts within which
analyses and modelling unfold [and is thus]{.underline}, via this
unwarranted delimitation, [able to present itself as operating with a
level of mathematical objectivity it **simply does not
possess**]{.underline}.

This creates several insidious problems. For one, as Bernard Steigler
observes in The Age of Disruption, [this deferral to]{.underline} the
'superiority' of [algorithmic reason legitimises]{.underline} "the
**[systematic exploitation]{.underline}** and physical reticulation of
interindividual and transindividual relations" in the service of the
data economy (Stiegler 2019, 7). In other words, [the]{.underline} kinds
of transgenerational, intergenerational, interpersonal, personal and
even pre-personal3 [circuits that used to]{.underline} "[emerge through
**affective relations**]{.underline} of various kinds" over time within
and across societies [to forge]{.underline} "**[dreams]{.underline}**,
**[goals]{.underline}**, [**objectives** and **common
horizons**]{.underline}" [have been **disrupted** in unprecedented
ways]{.underline} (ibid., 16). Rouvroy argues, in fact, that
[subjectivity is **bypassed** by contemporary digital automisation so
that subjects are rendered **little more** than a]{.underline}
"[collection of]{.underline} infraindividual **[data]{.underline}**"
that are "recomposed at a supra-individual level under the form of
profile" (Rouvroy and Stiegler 2016, 12). Second, the speed at which
what we have elsewhere termed the Algocene4 has emerged, as well as [the
level of **technological literacy** a coherent understanding of this
shift entails]{.underline}, [has **far exceeded** our capacity to
theorise its effects]{.underline}, with the result that [many
analyses]{.underline} of our contemporary condition [remain **trapped in
anachronism**]{.underline}, [projecting the image of an **old world**
and its struggles onto a **new**]{.underline} and largely **[alien
terrain]{.underline}**. It is perhaps not too hyperbolic to claim, as
many have, that the staggering technological shifts of the last 20-odd
years necessitate theoretical engagement on the scale of a new
geological era or epoch. [This is **no longer** the world of
**industrial capitalism**]{.underline}, nor even of Foucault's
disciplinary societies (Foucault 1977), Deleuze's control societies
(Deleuze 1992) or Guattari's Integrated World Capitalism (Guattari
2000), although these are all vestigially inflected in the new
situation, which has variously, although far from exhaustively, been
termed societies of hyper-control and computational capitalism (Stiegler
2019), cognitive capitalism (Yann Moulier-Boutang 2012), platform
capitalism (Srnicek 2016), the age of planetary computerisation
(Guattari 2013), The Stack (Bratton 2015), infopolitics (Koopman 2018),
instrumentarianism (Zuboff 2019) and algorithmic governmentality
(Rouvroy and Berns 2013). Third, because of the speed at which digital
innovation operates, whatever effects this new "hyper-synchronization of
consciousness" (Vignola 2017, 188) is having on subjectivity can only be
perceived in the most miniscule of ways, yet we have to rely on this
minimum of information for a symptomatology because, if we follow
Deleuze via Nietzsche, it is only through a symptomatology that we can
trace etiological factors in order to find the most inventive corrective
therapy. A difficult task indeed considering the constraints we are
outlining here! The point is, [we **urgently require new tools** to
grapple with the implications of the encroachment of algorithmic reason
and governmentality into **more** and **more aspects** of our lives and
minds]{.underline}. [Far from **eschewing** theory]{.underline} in
favour of the transcendent mathesis universalis of our new digital
overlords, [situated thinking about our times has **never been more
crucial**]{.underline}. If, however, this kind of thinking has not been
forthcoming to the extent we would hope for, then this too perhaps forms
part of the symptomatology of the Algocene. In describing something that
is unprecedented, [we need to take care]{.underline}, as McKenzie Wark
argues, [to find]{.underline} "[a renewed language for **describing**
the present situation and **identifying** what in the received
language]{.underline} of capitalism \[or, for those further behind the
times, Marxism\] [**impedes** forward movement]{.underline} in thought
and action" (Wark 2019, 6). Having said this, we also hold [that it is
important **not** to reduce the entire social field to algorithmic
control]{.underline}, despite its near-ubiquity. [What is]{.underline}
rather [**vital** is to understand what this new way of experiencing
subjectivity **produces** and what]{.underline}, in turn, **[produces
it]{.underline}**. As Guattari explains of the Freudian Unconscious, it
produced new desires, which included "hysteria, infantile neurosis,
psychosis, family conflict, the reading of myths, etc." (Guattari 1995,
10). So too what Stiegler refers to as "negative collective protention",
or the nihilistic expectation of nothing, except perhaps The End
(Stiegler 2019, 19, 50), has produced new desires, and here [we have to
seriously consider that **The End**]{.underline} might in
fact---probably [is]{.underline}---**[desired]{.underline}**, even
**[collectively]{.underline}** so (especially given that we also face
Anthropogenic doom).5

[How]{.underline}, then, [do we **change** this desire]{.underline}?
[How do we use the **diagnostic tools** at our disposal]{.underline} in
the schizoanalytic mode---that is, a therapeutic mode---[to produce
something **new**]{.underline}, something healthier? [How do we change
our **practices** and **ways of being**]{.underline} in the world [so
that **life**]{.underline}---[rather than]{.underline} a misguided idea
of **[Algorithmic Supremacy]{.underline}**---**[matters]{.underline}**
again? In this chapter, we attempt to give a broad symptomatology of
algorithmic subjectivity, drawing on a range of scholars who have gone
before us. [Our aim]{.underline}, diverging from most theorists,
however, is **[not to propose legal]{.underline}** or other
**[reforms]{.underline}**. [We understand the algorithm to already
present itself as an **ethicopolitical arrangement** of
values]{.underline}, [assumptions and propositions about the
world]{.underline}. [Our question]{.underline}---yes, our desire---[is
**not**]{.underline}: [How **ought** the algorithm be arranged for a
good society?]{.underline} [but rather]{.underline}: [What **is** a good
society?]{.underline} For [it is from the **latter**]{.underline}
question, we hold, [that **healthier algorithmic arrangements** will
flow]{.underline}, **[not the other way around]{.underline}**.

#### Cybernetics has robbed meaning of its stability.

**Dyer-Witheford and Matviyenko 19**(Nick and Svitlana, Associate

[There is no longer a Master-Signifier that stabilizes meaning, that
knits together the chain of signifiers and hinders their tendencies to
float off into indeterminacy. While the absence of such a master might
seem to produce a situation of complete openness and freedom---no
authority is telling the subject what to do, what to desire, how to
structure its choices]{.underline}---Žižek argues [that in fact the
result is unbearable, suffocating closure]{.underline}. A "[setting of
electronically mediated subjectivity \[that\] is one of infinite doubt
and ultimate reflexifisation" intensifies "the fundamental uncertainty
accompanying the impossibility of totalization]{.underline}" in a
symbolic environment where "there is always another option, link,
opinion, nuance or contingency that we haven't taken into account" (Dean
2014, 212). [Computational propaganda that aims to mystify invasions and

political system, actively weaponizes the "decline in symbolic
efficiency," but it is endemic to the whole field of
cyberwar]{.underline}. The extreme uncertainty and opacity of cyberwar
do not, however, inhibit the interpellative effects of contending
cyberwar apparatuses as they summon up cybersoldiers, patriotic hackers,
vigilante militias, and security-conscious digital citizens. On the
contrary, [the problems of verifying or disproving multiple alarms and
accusations accelerates these processes and puts them into overdrive. To
put this point in psychoanalytic terms,]{.underline} as we noted
previously, commentators on Althusser have criticized the appropriation
of Lacan's theories of the subject in his account of ISAs. These critics
point out that what Althusser misses in Lacan's account is that [the
subject is always incomplete; it is precisely what can never be fixed by
a specific subject position or identity. However, the implication of
this incompletion is not that the subject remains some untouched and
primordial haven of authenticity but rather that this lack drives to
ever more compulsive (because unfulfillable) attempts to attain a
definitive identity]{.underline}. Translating this into political
terms[, we would say that it is the inescapably incomplete, provisional,
and easily falsified nature of all accounts of cyberwar that energizes
the adoption of increasingly militarized, extreme, paranoid, and
unshakable subject positions vis-à-vis its alleged events.]{.underline}

[Increasingly]{.underline}, [there is]{.underline} also [a **merger** of
political power and tech power in the **US**]{.underline}, [which is
then **extrapolated** to the rest of the world]{.underline}. [A
**handful of huge corporations**]{.underline}, like Amazon Web Services
and Palantir, [have built a]{.underline} '**[revolving
door]{.underline}**' [to **develop** and **entrench** Silicon Valley's
capacity to **expand** their services abroad]{.underline}.19 [The
neocolonial role of international aid takes a **new
shape**]{.underline}, this time [as **technology**]{.underline}, [as the
revolving door between the most powerful governments in the world and
technology companies manifests in global diplomacy]{.underline}. [The
CEOs of tech companies navigate the world as]{.underline} '**[new
envoys]{.underline}**' [of **digital colonialism**]{.underline} --
[**diplomats** showcasing the power of their **enormous technical
empires** to heads of state]{.underline}. Often, [their revenues are
larger than the **entire GDP** of their countries they are
visiting]{.underline}, [and their arrival sends a **distorted message**
of prosperity and progress to **overcome** systemic inequalities and
**leapfrog** into a better future]{.underline}. For many precarious and
debt-fuelled governments, it is difficult to reject offers of 'free'
digital infrastructure and services. In addition, [current global trade
rules run the risk of consolidating a regime **favourable to digital
empires**]{.underline}, [**blocking** the possibility of smaller actors
to]{.underline} innovate and [**take ownership** of their digital
futures]{.underline}.

#### Infrastructurally.

**Avila, 20**---former Non-Resident Fellow at the Digital Civil Society

Ethnicity at Stanford University (Renata, "Against Digital Colonialism,"
<https://autonomy.work/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Avila.pdf>, dml)

Early manifestations of this process can be seen in the 'free' provision
of critical infrastructure -- from cables to [connectivity]{.underline}
-- to large populations. This process [led to the **silent
privatisation** of the digital infrastructure of **entire
nations**]{.underline}.7 [Big Tech CEOs]{.underline} were meeting heads
of state, shaking hands and promising alliances for a connected future.8
The most audacious even [used **Washington** as a **backdoor** to reach
places like **North Korea**]{.underline}, [**Cuba** and
**China**]{.underline}.9 [Some nations even opened **tech embassies** in
Silicon Valley]{.underline}, [signalling their availability to **tech
companies**]{.underline}, [which **increasingly behaved like states**
who provided]{.underline} "**[aid]{.underline}**" [and well-intentioned
efforts to **digitise** countries through free infrastructure and
services]{.underline}.10 This included proposals to build broadband
cables and spread connectivity in remote areas using balloons.11 What
started as an aggressive public relations campaign around 2013 has
continued discreetly by the five leading tech companies in developing
countries across the world, particularly in Africa.

The accelerated penetration of tech companies in emerging markets has
taken place not only via generous offers of connectivity and
infrastructure to populations. [Tech giants have]{.underline} also [been
providing digital infrastructure to **dozens** of
governments]{.underline}, [ranging from cloud services to entire mail
and office suites]{.underline}. Amazon and Microsoft have led this
process, followed closely by Facebook and Google. The fact that an
entire nation delegates its digital services to a company based in
Silicon Valley is alarming. The company is then in a position to handle
not only highly sensitive government documents, but also is in
possession of critical information relating to the entire country.

But national security advisors, parliaments and watchdogs remain largely
silent about this new form of dependency aside from a few notable cases
where sanctions and political pressure have been deployed. This has
included the case of Microsoft providing services to Russian firms;12
Iranian users unable to get security updates from US-based products and
services;13 and even deleted accounts on services as vital as GitHub, a
platform which hosts code for developers. [This is an **important
reflection** on the fragility of a tech industry **highly dependent** on
a **US-based ecosystem** of products and services]{.underline}, which
becomes vulnerable to political vendettas, national security letters and
collaboration with security services.14

CRITICISM OF ARMS, ARMS OF CRITICISM [Our project requires an analysis
in terms very different from those of official discussions of
cyberwar]{.underline}, and its echoes in the media, [discussions often
cast in a language that assumes and imposes the inescapable necessity of
a technocratic realpolitik and prepares and armors its audiences for
trajectories of mounting crisis.]{.underline} Just as, in previous
decades[, we were habituated to apocalyptic prospects by an anodyne
"nukespeak," so today we are being trained to a more creeping
catastrophe by a militarized "cyberspeak]{.underline}" [that promises us
resilience against hostile intrusion through social media service
upgrades, improved smartphones, and the steady surrender of individual
and social freedoms to enhanced powers of the security
forces]{.underline}. [This numbing discourse must be broken open and
defamiliarized. The topic of cyberwar has, however, largely been ignored
by critical social theorists, sometimes where one would least
expect.]{.underline} [The most ambitious]{.underline} and sophisticated
of all recent [scholarly attempts to conceptualize the
scope]{.underline} and depth [of the internet as a technosocial
institution]{.underline} [is]{.underline} in our opinion Benjamin
[Bratton's]{.underline} (2016) [The Stack]{.underline}: On Software and
Sovereignty. For Bratton, [**the concept of a "stack**"]{.underline} (in
computer science, a collection of data elements that must be accessed in
a specific order[) **provides a metaphor for the architecture of the
internet, envisaged as a layered series of terrestrial, platform,**
urban, communication, **interface**, and user operations.]{.underline}
[The combined interactions of **these different digital
levels**]{.underline}, Bratton argues, **[now compose an "accidental
megastructure" of global governance either destabilizing or reinforcing
the spatial and temporal boundaries of the nation-state]{.underline}**.
[Yet what is striking is **the limited attention** **this** otherwise
comprehensive, virtuoso **examination of digital networks gives to**
that most **sovereign of activities, war, and the possibility** **of**
what Bratton]{.underline} (2016, 298) [glancingly refers to as "**Stack
versus Stack**" conflicts, a topic that he defers as a matter for later
study]{.underline}. This is all the more surprising because, as [Bratton
acknowledges]{.underline} in a footnote, th[e modeling of the internet
as a "stack" of technosocial activities was pioneered within U.S.
cyberwar agencies with very nonaccidental strategic agendas]{.underline}
(441n8). One of the NSA documents released by Snowden, "[Bad Guys Are
Everywhere, Good Guys Are Somewhere]{.underline}" (Risen and Poitras
2013; Müller-Maguhn 2014), [contains a diagram of the architecture of
the internet in terms of an interdependent "stack" of geographical,
physical network, logical, cyberpersona, and persona levels, derived
from the work of national security intellectual Paul
Rosenzweig]{.underline} (2012). The diagram is defined as a tool that
enables the NSA to conceive how to scan and disrupt the operations of
antagonists at multiple levels: "[the stack" is a concept for cyberwar
fighting. No account of networked sovereigns and subjects can now
postpone reckoning with this reality, so we hope that our book can
supplement Bratton's, even though it is written in a different political
register]{.underline}

### AT: Stack=Bad Metaphor

#### Hate to say it, but not our Stack---we [reclaim]{.underline} the metaphor via [stacktivism]{.underline}.

**Lovink, 20**---founder of the Institute of Network Cultures at the
Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Geert, "Principles of
Stacktivism," tripleC 18 (2): 716-724, 2020, dml)

Lately, [the concept of]{.underline} "**[the stack]{.underline}**", once
a technical insider term used amongst engineers and geeks\[10\],
[has]{.underline} jumped context and [**transformed** into a **general
container concept**]{.underline}, [in **danger** of becoming an **empty
signifier**]{.underline}. [As a **meta-concept** The Stack has
been]{.underline} detached from its author and his Californian-nihilist
program for the aspirational cool-crowd and [turned into a **symbol**
for the need to bring together interrelated crises]{.underline}, from
climate change, inequality, AI and automation to covid-19. In Bratton's
world, you sign up from the program and carry the card, otherwise the
entry sign points to exit. No affect, behavioural noise or regional
ambiguities please -- **[we're performing Important Theory
here]{.underline}**. Perhaps this is a form of group therapy for the
insecure? That's fine if you like the taste of testosterone in your milk
shake.

[This is the time to design]{.underline} one, two, three, indeed
[**many** stacks and **not to dismiss**]{.underline} the [ambitious
efforts]{.underline} of others because, after all, where are the
European antidotes to Bratton or Zuboff? Europe tragically fails in the
production of contemporary reference texts, both at the speculative and
the critical level. While the late Bernard Stiegler comes in mind, a lot
of translation work is still to be done in order to transform his
philosophy of technology into workable programs decoupled from his
often-obscure neologisms. For instance, where are the counterproposals
of the crypto-blockchain system? The [Bratton]{.underline} bible,
written in the quasi-authoritarian voice of a Master Designer,
[can]{.underline} also [be read from a **grass-roots perspective** and
should be **praised** for its multi-disciplinary analysis of
techno-social]{.underline} (power) [practices]{.underline}. Why not be
ambitious? There's a lot at stake. As a proposal, Bratton's reading of
The Stack should be compared to Dante's hell, Sloterdijk's notion of the
spheres, Deleuze and Guattari's Mille plateaux, Hui's cosmotechnics and
Stiegler's The Age of Disruption. But instead of conducting hermeneutic
exercises, [the proposal here is to **transplant** the term into the
**hacktivist context** and define the principles of]{.underline}
"**[stacktivism]{.underline}**": dancing stacks\[11\].

#### Stack design is a useful metaphor.

**Crombie et al. 21**(David, Canadian politician, professor and
consultant, "Rethinking the Stack: New Narratives for an Era of
Collective Intelligences", 12.1, CS)

[We are neither coders nor engineers but driven by a shared sense that
the scope and speed of technological change has literally implicated us
-- folded us -- in the workings of distributed intelligent systems that
affect how we relate, speak, work]{.underline}. It is this
transformation of our own agency we wish to comprehend, and the
emergence of collective intelligences that bring human and non-human
agency together in new constellations. [While we realize that "stack
design" is an abstract design proposition, we want to build on the
technical metaphor of the stack as a layered system to facilitate a more
holistic systems design conversation -- and find out more about the role
each of us might play in that process.]{.underline} Stacks are generally
defined as "the set of technologies an organization uses to build a web
or mobile application \... a combination of programming languages,
frameworks, libraries, patterns, servers, UI/UX solutions, software, and
tools used by its developers".2 A quick look at [the stacks used by key
players in and across the platform economy suggests that these
modularized systems have more in common than their fierce competition
for users might suggest]{.underline}. Rather than repeating the usual
invocations of global brands (and their market power), [we want to shift
the focus of our conversation to the stacks that sustain the power of
these actors -- a first step toward a more comprehensive understanding
of the relational infrastructures behind data-driven
societies]{.underline}, what we have termed the condition of
distribution, [and a different way of thinking]{.underline} about the
design of (fairer) markets [for a more cooperative
economy]{.underline}.3 Adopting the principle that [technology stacks
are in principle subject to codesign]{.underline}, we showcase a series
of complementary co-design processes to explore how we might best
facilitate such a conversation. In these examples, we focus on the role
of data -- from the data monetization controversy (data-as-right vs data
as-commodity) to "platform" cooperatives adding a digital technology and
data governance layer to the much older organizational practices of the
cooperative. We do not, however, assume a comprehensive understanding of
data governance approaches. [Our invitation to join the "stack
design]{.underline}" conversation [begins with a much simpler idea --
the search for a narrative]{.underline} (with a wide range of characters
and multiple conflicting plots) [that might be able to frame a
cross-sectoral systems design conversation in which many actors see a
role for themselves]{.underline}. So before we turn to technology, we
define our non-technological point of departure, leaving the question of
where exactly to draw the line between the technological and the
non-technological to the side for now. While we are not yet sure what
the scope and structure of such a conversation will be, we do know that
we want such a narrative to allow us to comprehend the condition of
distribution that serves as infrastructural context for the ways in
which we live and work.

### AT: State Key To Solve Cyberwar

#### Stacktivism overcomes divisions, pools information, and develops interconnectivity in order to create a digital commons to combat the new era of technological war

**Lovink 20**(Geert, founding director of the Institute of Network
Cultures, PhD from the University of Melbourne, "Principles of
Stacktivism", CS)

[We need to define new forms of collective action that some call the
commons that is defined by the ability to act together]{.underline}. The
design question here is what comes next after the model of social
networks, which has been so compromised and overshadowed by the social
media monopolies. [This is a digital commons in which collective forms
of money is included, a redistribution of wealth that has been produced
together and should never again be allowed to be expropriated. We need
to collectivise our knowledge]{.underline} and learn from the mistakes
that were made in projects such as Wikipedia and Creative Commons, [but
also of the self-centric notion of free software]{.underline} as
promoted by Richard Stallman, who could only think in terms of
individual freedom of the singleuser- as-programmer -- until his 2019
downfall. What Bratton's static metaphysical view in particular lacks is
the role of actors (and their interests, ideologies). Instead of
trashing the stack, [the proposition here is to make the model more
dynamic (or dialectical) by introducing stackivism]{.underline}. Let's
define [stacktivism as a form of Internet activism that no longer
bothers with the distractive nois]{.underline}e on social media channels
[and dares to dig deeper in order to make a real difference.
I]{.underline}nstead of talking only about upload filters, fake news or
the deployment of cheap online moderation armies, we are working on a
next Internet. The charm of protocol driven direct action or
[stacktivism is that it goes both up (from network to platform to stack)
and down (protocols, data centres, cables), at the same
time.]{.underline} The Internet is more than social media, more than you
and your app. This may sound like a simple, self-evident slogan but the
integral practice-based vision of [stacktivism is a promising one,
beyond techno-solutionism and it critics, the liberal-tech engineering
status quo procedures, the discontent offline romanticism, liberal
privacy concerns, legalistic NGO approaches and the after-the-fact
Academic Truth that confines itself to the closed monads of peer-review
journals]{.underline}. Stacktivism embodies Adorno's critique of
totality as a lie while climbing up the abstraction ladder in order to
enjoy the view. Digitisation Takes Command. The stacktivist dilemma is a
classic one: [How can the multitudes gain power while pulverizing power
at the same time? The digital is now an encompassing global sphere. Is
this dark enlightenment in action?]{.underline} In this light, how
should we judge the Will to Stack? Dare to think in term of political
strategies when talking about cosmotechnics (or cosmic networks, for
that matter). We've left the era of technology-as-tool far behind us.
[The nasty feedback machines strike back and try to corner us,
suppressing our desires and needs, even without us noticing the closing
down of communication and expression]{.underline}. Can The Stack
(formerly known as the Internet) only be understood in its totality once
it has fallen from its unity and been reduced to fragments (read:
geo-political blocks and national webs)? [Can we be global in scope on
the protocol level, yet act locally in networks of strong-ties? Is it
worth to think of cosmotechnics-for-good? Stealing code from the rich
and inserting into networks of the poor]{.underline}, in the spirit of
Aaron Schwartz and Anonymous' SkyNet? Do you still believe that another
WikiLeaks is possible, beyond the focus on celebrity? [**Let's upgrade
and broaden the vision how the** **fight against moral injustices could
look like in the age of geo-political cyberwarfare** **and attacks on
our critical infrastructure, not just the Internet but water, gas,
electricity,** **bridges and hospitals. These are The Stacks of the
People, and we'll better not be naïve about their vulnerability. We
depend on The Stack. Making visible and defending critical public
infrastructure could be one of the many tasks of
stacktivism**]{.underline}. This leaves us with the question how to
organise strategic forecasting in times of collapse. How can we bring
together new forms of collective intelligence that are truly planetary
in nature, which is to say conflictual and variegated, and not merely
designed to replicate Western policy production? [Call them organised
networks or think tanks, we're gathering in a closed forum, on Telegram,
Mastodon or Signal in order to get **t**hings done, overcoming the
divisions that aren't ours. In theory we have all the communication
skills, tools and ideas, yet we often do not know how to organise
ourselves outside of surveillance capitalism and state
control]{.underline}. Ni Zuckerberg, ni Xi Jinping19. How can we
redistribute critical resources and talents? The need to bring together
different and messy idioms of knowledge (technical, spiritual, cultural,
political) is widely felt. [What we will do next is act, together. What
we need are simple, appealing images, models that bring people together
to act.]{.underline}

### AT: Tallinn Manual Good

#### The Tallinn Manual is an [ethical]{.underline} and [juridical failure]{.underline}.

**Barrett 17**(Edward, Ethics professor in the Department of Leadership,
Ethics and Law, "On the Relationship Between the Ethics and the Law of
War: Cyber Operations and Sublethal Harm", CS)

To begin, [the manual's purely legalistic
assumptions]{.underline}---derived from applicable treaties and
customary international law---[can generate ethically problematic
definitions of just cause]{.underline}. Functionally, Article's concept
of armed attack and the ethical concept of just cause are the same: they
define a casus belli to which one may justifiably respond with lethal
defensive force. But the related [legal definitions]{.underline} of
"uses of force" and "armed attacks" can---from an ethical
perspective---[lead to both overly permissive and overly restrictive
conclusions]{.underline}. Following international law, the manual
defines uses of force as acts "that injure or kill persons or damage or
destroy objects." Those of sufficient "scale and effects" are deemed
armed attacks. On the one hand, this framework can be too permissive
vis-à-vis property. Ethically speaking, [large-scale property
destruction and damage do not in themselves justify lethal defensive
harm;]{.underline} the property in question must be lifesustaining, and
this prerequisite is not intrinsic to the definition of armed attack. On
the other hand, this framework can be too restrictive vis-à-vis persons.
From an ethical perspective, one may respond to unjustified and culpable
threats to life with lethal force if necessary; the scale of death is
irrelevant. While legally limiting forceful responses to cases of armed
attack--level fatalities might promote utility, [it also might
contravene the moral right of self-defense.]{.underline} This problem
accounts for the "contrary view" of the United States following the
International Court of Justice's Nicaragua judgment, which asserted that
"any illegal use of force can qualify as an armed attack triggering the
right of self-defense; there is no gravity threshold distinguishing
illegal uses of force from armed attacks[." In addition to being
simultaneously overly permissive and restrictive, legal definitions of
just cause can also be arbitrary because of the way in which judgments
are made]{.underline}. What counts as harm sufficient to rise to the
level of an armed attack is determined through practice, which in
reality can mean that [the definitions of stronger parties will
prevail]{.underline}. [Reliance on international law therefore does
little to discourage wars initiated by the powerful in defense of
"national interests" that merely support a desired standard of
living.]{.underline} A dialogue between ethics and international law
thus serves to provide necessary critiques of self-serving legal
interpretations of both kinetic and cyber operations. A second ad
bellum-related flaw in the manual involves the relationship between
culpability and just cause. In assessments of whether an armed attack
has occurred, the experts were "divided over the issue of whether the
effects in question must have been intended." The minority of experts
asserted that espionage "unexpectedly result\[ing\] in significant
damage" should not be considered an armed attack. On the other hand, the
majority concluded that "intention is irrelevant in qualifying an
operation as an armed attack and that only scale and effects matter."
According to their analysis, victims of unintentional grave harm would
possess a right to respond in kind, if necessary. But from an ethical
perspective, on the relationship between the ethics and the law of war
majority's position is erroneous. Culpable acts are those done
intentionally, freely, and with knowledge or vincible ignorance of the
relevant normative and empirical facts; and only culpable murderous acts
compromise one's capacity for justice and dignity to the degree required
to forfeit one's right to life and incur liability to lethal defensive
harm. [Although the response advocated by the manual's majority would be
excused if the victim were unable to know that the act was unintended,
the response would still not be justified.]{.underline} Third, the
discussion of ad bellum proportionality is problematic primarily because
it misunderstands the criterion, which requires that the total expected
good caused by a war outweighs the total expected harm. Instead, [the
manual asserts that the issue at hand is "how much force . . . is
permissible once force is deemed necessary"]{.underline} (that is, once
last resort has been satisfied), and concludes that the proportionality
criterion limits this amount to "that required to end the situation that
has given rise to the right to act in self-defense." In other words,
[the manual stipulates that the ad bellum criterion of proportionality,
instead of ensuring that the goods at stake are commensurate with
anticipated harms, requires one to use only a necessary amount of force
to put an end to the situation. One can easily imagine a case in which
this leads to massive defensive retaliation to stop a much less harmful
attack.]{.underline} Additionally, the entire analysis is misplaced, as
the imperative to use only necessary amounts of force is an in bello
issue. Fourth, [the manual's treatment of when temporary functionality
losses would qualify as a just cause is self-contradictory. Like kinetic
weapons, cyber weapons can physically destroy or damage computers. But
because of their potential to be transitory or reversible, cyberattacks
can also merely compromise functionality]{.underline}. While permanent
losses of functionality can create the same effect as physical
destruction, temporary functionality losses are unique to cyber
operations and require additional analysis. Part of the manual's
discussion on functionality occurs in the in bello section that defines
a cyberattack. Associating attacks on objects with damage or
destruction, the majority asserted that interference with functionality
would qualify as damage and thus constitute a use of force only if
"restoration of functionality requires replacement of physical
components." Accordingly, a transitory or reversible loss of function
not requiring the replacement of physical components would constitute
neither an attack nor, by extension, a just cause. But elsewhere in the
manual some experts argue that actions not resulting in physical damage
would qualify as an armed attack if the ensuing negative effects
were---although others still maintain that direct "harm to persons or
physical damage to property" is a precondition for an armed attack[.
Ethically speaking, justified responses would be a function of both an
attack's culpability and overall effects. Assuming culpability, a
temporary loss of the functionality of a system that was not physically
damaged would be a casus belli if the event resulted in
death,]{.underline} for example, in the event of the temporary disabling
of an air traffic control system that caused mass casualties. Fifth,
from an ethical perspective, although the manual's treatment of in bello
proportionality is excellent, it could be improved in one way: Since
civilians on both sides retain all of their rights, one should not
dismiss consequences such as loss of email or banking services from
collateral damage calculations. Of course, such costs could be awarded
relatively low values. Sixth and finally, [the manual unfortunately
adopts a purely legal approach to targeting nonparticipating
civilians]{.underline}, arguing that cyber operations that do not
qualify as "uses of force"---ones that merely inconvenience---may be
intentionally directed against civilian objects such as computers.
Interference with functionality is permitted if physical repair or
operating system reinstallation is not required. Data, related or
unrelated to functionality, is also targetable. Large-scale email
blockage also does not qualify as an attack. Additionally, and as
mentioned earlier, none of these harms need to be minimized or
considered in collateral damage proportionality assessments. That these
conclusions follow logically from their premises demonstrates the danger
of purely legal approaches. From an ethical perspective, [intentionally
harming civilians, in addition to usually being strategically
ineffective, is unjust. In peacetime or wartime, persons who have not
culpably transgressed the rights of others have forfeited none of their
own, and are not liable to any degree of harm---not even the
inconveniences described above.]{.underline} Accordingly, domestic and
international statutes should define these injustices as punishable
crimes, and appropriate executive and legislative oversight should be
implemented. And if nonparticipating civilians are to be affected by
cyber operations before or during war, these effects must be minimized
and weighed in the ways currently associated with, respectively,
economic sanctions and dual-use objects.

## Alternative Methods/Theses

### Mediation

#### We begin our analysis at the [medium]{.underline}, the aesthetic space that separates the human from the nonhuman world. Cybernetics has changed the altered the field of our [medialogical relationship]{.underline} with the world around us. Our desires, fears, affects, are embedded within the network of the [technosphere]{.underline} -- In the face of this we look to *[radical mediation]{.underline}*. We look to the middle. To the [infinite, chaotic, flux of the world]{.underline} as a lens imbued with radical potential. This radical aesthetic dwells in the gap between [subject and object]{.underline}, [individual and milieu]{.underline}. Only through this interjection can we move to openness and dismantle the cybernetic drive towards [complete interconnectivity.]{.underline}

**Grusin 2015** (Richard Grusin, English, University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee, "Radical Mediation") //ansel

**[I develop the concept of radical mediation in order to]{.underline}
[make related but independent arguments about the dualistic character of
mediation in Western thought]{.underline}**. I argue that although
[media and **media technologies have operated and continue to operate
epistemologically as modes of knowledge production**, th**ey also
function technically, bodily, and materially to generate and modulate
individual and collective affective moods or structures of feeling among
assemblages of humans and nonhumans**]{.underline}.6 [This affective
mediation of collective human and nonhuman assemblages operates
independently of (and often more efficaciously than) the production of
knowledge]{.underline}.7 [Like the way media operate affectively,
mediation must also be understood ontologically as a process or event
prior to and ultimately not reducible to particular media
technologies]{.underline}. [Mediation operates physically and materially
as an object, event, or process in the world, impacting humans and
nonhumans alike]{.underline}. [Radical mediation participates in recent
critiques of the dualism of the Western philosophical tradition, which
make up what I have elsewhere called the nonhuman turn]{.underline} in
twenty-first-century studies.8 Indeed, as I suggest in the essay's final
sections, [radical mediation might in some sense be understood as
nonhuman mediation]{.underline}. I derive the term radical mediation
from the concept of radical empiricism set forth by William James in
Essays in Radical Empiricism, published in 1912, two years after his
death.9 James's [radical empiricism has been redeployed]{.underline} in
recent books by Adrian Mackenzie and Anna Munster in order [to make
sense of the technical and embodied experience of our current media
environment]{.underline}, what Mackenzie calls "[wirelessness"
and]{.underline} Munster characterizes as [the "anaesthesia of
networks]{.underline}."10 Both books start from James's paradigmatic
definition of radical empiricism in "A World of Pure Experience": To be
radical, an empiricism must neither admit into its constructions any
element that is not directly experienced, nor exclude from them any
element that is directly experienced. For such a philosophy, the
relations that connect experiences must themselves be experienced
relations, and any kind of relation experienced must be accounted as
'real' as anything else in the system. 1

[**In developing** the concept of **radical empiricism James means to
reject both the empiricism or realism that starts with objects or the
real in itself and the rationalism or idealism that sees the real as an
imperfect manifestation of a universal logos or spirit**. **In so doing
he also means to insist on the affectivity of relations and the reality
of affect**]{.underline}, in a way that I take as consonant with the
famous claim in The Principles of Psychology that [we do not cry because
we are sad but we are sad because we cry]{.underline}.12 For James
"[ordinary empiricism," despite "the fact that conjunctive and
disjunctive relations present themselves as being fully co-ordinate
parts of experience, has always shown a tendency to do away with the
connections of things, and to insist most on the
disjunctions]{.underline}." On the other hand, [rationalism, to counter
empiricism's dismissal of relations, has sought "to correct its
incoherencies by the addition of trans-experiential agents of
unification, substances, intellectual categories and powers, or
Selves]{.underline}."13 [James's alternative to the debate between
empiricists and rationalists suggests a promising way to move past
current debates about objects and relations, or ontology and
politics]{.underline}. [Object-oriented ontologists like Graham Harman
insist on the disjunction between objects]{.underline}, [their
"withdrawal" from contact with other objects, and thus the separation of
ontology from politics]{.underline}.14 Contemporary and historical
Marxists, not unlike rationalists, introduce "trans-experiential agents
of unification" like capital or capitalism to hold together disparate
and unrelated objects or practices.15 [By starting with experienced
relations, and insisting that "any kind of relation experienced must be
accounted as 'real' as anything else in the system," **James would start
in the middle, in** what he famously called in the 1890 Principles of
Psychology "**the blooming, buzzing confusion" of the
world**]{.underline}.16

With radical mediation I too would start in the middle. [By taking
James's radical empiricism as a source for the concept of radical
mediation, we just need to substitute mediation for "relation" and
immediate for "real" to retain a sense of James's meaning in the new
term]{.underline}: ["the \[mediations\] that connect experiences must
themselves be experienced \[mediations\], and any kind of \[mediation\]
experienced must be accounted as \['immediate'\] as anything else in the
system]{.underline}." [Where James is concerned with the empirical
reality of relations, my concerns start with the immediacy of
mediation]{.underline}. [James describes relations primarily as
connecting experiences. I see mediations as generating, refashioning,
and transforming experiences as well as connecting them, similar to what
Bruno Latour calls "translations" or Karen Barad describes as
"intra-actions]{.underline}."17 [Mediations are always remediations,
which change or translate experiences as well as relating or connecting
them]{.underline}. I substitute mediation for James's relation to
emphasize that while [radical empiricism insists on the reality of
experienced relations]{.underline}, [radical mediation also insists upon
an immediacy that transforms, modulates, or disrupts experienced
relations]{.underline}. [Radical mediation challenges what Barad calls
representationalism: "the belief in the ontological distinction between
representations and that which they purport to represent]{.underline}"
(MU, p. 46). [In these traditional representationalist accounts,
mediation is understood to come between, or in the middle of, already
preformed, preexistent subjects or objects, actants or
entities]{.underline}. [The role of mediation in such accounts is
precisely to connect, or negotiate between, actants, categories, and
events (or subjects and objects]{.underline}), [which would otherwise
have no way of understanding or interacting with one
anothe]{.underline}r. [Especially in post-Hegelian, Marxian thought,
mediation has been opposed to immediacy, functioning as what might be
called an agent of correlation, which filters, limits, constrains, or
distorts an immediate perception or knowledge of the world or the
real]{.underline}.18 [**Mediation** **has** in these accounts **been
understood both as enabling our knowledge of reality** **and as
preventing or making impossible the direct** and immediate **relation
with the world**]{.underline} [that Brian Massumi (and others) insist
upon as a fundamental component of human and nonhuman experience. In
many traditional philosophical accounts **we cannot experience the
world** directly or immediately **because we cannot know the world
without some form of mediation**]{.underline}.

Although Massumi has at times taken issue with the concept of mediation,
I want to follow his claim that "[philosophical thinking must begin\...
immediately in the middle" by suggesting that we understand mediation
itself as a place to begin]{.underline}.19 As articulated in different
ways in the nineteenth- and twentieth-century American tradition by
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Sanders Peirce, or
James, or in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries by Alfred North
Whitehead, Gilbert Simondon, Gilles Deleuze, Massumi, or Barad, where we
begin is immediately in the middle.20 [Mediation should be understood
not as standing between preformed subjects, objects, actants, or
entities but as the process, action, or event that generates or provides
the conditions for the emergence of subjects and objects, for the
individuation of entities within the world]{.underline}. [Mediation is
not opposed to immediacy but rather is itself immediate]{.underline}.
[It names the immediacy of middleness in which we are already living and
moving: "Where do we find ourselves?" Emerson asks]{.underline} in the
opening of his famous essay "Experience" and then answers: "In a series
of which we do not know the extremes, and believe that it has none. [We
wake and find ourselves on a stair]{.underline}; [there are stairs below
us, which we seem to have ascended; there are stairs above us, many a
one, which go upward and out of sight]{.underline}."21 [In asking where
we find ourselves, Emerson is asking where the world and its nonhuman
entities find themselves as well.]{.underline} [In developing the
concept of radical mediation I operate from a sense that where we find
ourselves]{.underline} (both at the beginning of the twenty-first
century and in human and nonhuman history more generally[) is
immediately in the middle, in mediation itself]{.underline}.

[Remediation I have been thinking and writing about the history and
theory of mediation for twenty years---most notably in my work on the
logics of mediation in the late twentieth and early twenty-first
centuries]{.underline}. [I have also been concerned throughout this work
with thinking through in various and partial ways the ontological status
of mediation]{.underline}.22 [In the nearly twenty years since
"Remediation," I have included the ontological and affective reality of
mediation among the methodological premises of my work]{.underline}.23
[Building upon Latour's distinction between intermediaries and
mediators, in which mediators are not neutral means of transmission but
actively involved in transforming whatever they mediate]{.underline}, [I
insist that **mediation** **operates** not by neutrally reproducing
meaning or information but **by actively transforming human and nonhuman
actants**]{.underline}**, [as well as their conceptual and affective
states]{.underline}**. [Thus, the concept of radical mediation helps
make sense of how in the twenty-first century media and mediation
operate within the world as objects or events]{.underline} [no different
from any other and how their contemporary operation lets us see some
things about mediation that have often been obscured. This]{.underline}
[concept of radical mediation departs from the way mediation has been
used in Western thought]{.underline} at least since Immanuel Kant and G.
W. F. Hegel, but more likely going back to Aristotle---although [as a
literary critic turned media theorist, I hesitate in making definitive
assertions about the history of the Western philosophical
tradition]{.underline}. The history of philosophy notwithstanding, [I am
concerned with interrogating the way in which mediation has been
conventionally defined and deployed as a secondary concept or
category]{.underline}, [as something that enters the scene belatedly,
after humans and nonhumans, representation and reality, or culture and
nature have already been divided up and parceled out]{.underline}.

Although [remediation has not always been recognized as doing so, from
very early on I have understood it to be making a case for the
experiential immediacy of mediation]{.underline}. [Perhaps this concern
has not been evident because remediation's double logic divides
immediacy from hypermediacy in a formal sense, having to do with the
visual aesthetics of the screen, its composition and
design]{.underline}. [As half of the double logic of
remediation]{.underline}, [the logic of transparent immediacy imagines a
form of visual mediation in which the medium erases itself so that there
is an immediate subjective encounter with, or apprehension of, the
object of mediation, or the real]{.underline}. [**This visual logic of
transparent immediacy can now be seen as** a version of what, following
the terminology of speculative realism, **we might call media
correlationism, in which mediation functions as the necessary
intermediary between human agents and the nonhuman world**]{.underline}.
[As half of the double logic of remediation, transparent immediacy holds
that **the subject's contact with the real depends upon the erasure of
the medium**]{.underline}, [which correlates **and thereby obscures the
relationship between subject and world**]{.underline}. [Hypermediacy, on
the other hand, refers to the proliferation of media forms and
practices. From a media correlationist standpoint, therefore,
hypermediacy would seem to block or prevent the erasure of the medium
that defines transparent immediacy]{.underline}. [From the perspective
of radical mediation, however, hypermediacy does not prevent immediacy
but rather constitutes it]{.underline}---[not through the erasure of an
intervening visual medium but through the immediacy of mediation
itself]{.underline}. [By using remediation I emphasize the point that
both logics are at play in mediation, that the double logic of
remediation entails both the transparency of media correlationism and
the obscurity of radical mediation, and that these two different
concepts of mediation are just as contradictory as immediacy and
hypermediacy are]{.underline}. [But remediation deploys the concept of
immediacy in another way as well, which moves toward what I am defining
here as radical mediation]{.underline}. [In addition to referring to a
formal style or logic of visual mediation in which all signs of
mediation are erased or concealed**, immediacy is also used in
remediation to refer to the embodied, affective experience that comes
both from the direct encounter with the real provided by transparent
mediation and from the immediate encounter with mediation** provided by
hypermediated modes of mediation]{.underline}. [Remediation tried to
underscore the phenomenal or experiential aspects of mediation by
mobilizing Derrida's argument in "Economimesis" that mimesis is not
about the resemblance between a representation]{.underline} ([or
mediation) and its object, but a relation between "two producing
subjects.]{.underline}"24 [With premediation, I developed the affective
immediacy of mediation further in terms of Maurice MerleauPonty's
contention that the optic is an extension of the haptic, claiming that
because all bodily senses are haptic, mediation is as well (readers of
Marshall McLuhan will undoubtedly hear echoes of his claim that print is
visual, while electric media are haptic)]{.underline}. [As Silvan
Tomkins and Daniel Stern help us to understand, our interactions with
media are always affective, and media themselves can be said to possess
affective lives]{.underline}.25 And [as I have argued elsewhere in
relation to the 2011 Sendai earthquake and its consequent tsunami and
technical catastrophes, **the affectivity of media aftershocks caused by
the quake must be understood to have the same ontological immediacy as
its geotechnical aftershocks**]{.underline}.26 [To understand radical
mediation as affective and experiential rather than strictly visual is
to think about our immediate affective experience of mediation as that
which is felt, embodied, near---not distant from us, and thus not
illuminated or pictured, but experienced by us as living, embodied human
and nonhuman creatures]{.underline}. [Where remediation focused largely
on the visual aspects of mediation, **radical mediation would take into
account the entire human sensorium**]{.underline}**. [For radical
mediation, all bodies (whether human or nonhuman) are fundamentally
media and life itself is a form of mediation]{.underline}**.27 [As
Benjamin had similarly noted about mechanical reproduction, the
remediation of new digital media has worked to bring our media devices
nearer our bodily medium]{.underline}, [engaging us directly in what I
have elsewhere characterized as the affective life of
media]{.underline}.28 [**The core of radical mediation is** its
immanence, immediacy itself---not the transparent immediacy that makes
up half of remediation's double logic but **the embodied immediacy of
the event of mediation**]{.underline}. [In our affective, bodily
interactions with media devices, indeed with the world of humans and
nonhumans, there is no distance or perspective from which to see
immediacy, from which immediacy could be made into something one could
paint or draw or re-present, or something that needed
mediation]{.underline}. "[**Bodies**," writes Barad apropos the
invertebrate brittlestar, "**are not situated in the world**; **they are
part of the world**]{.underline}" (MU, p. 376). Interestingly Emerson
makes a similar point in "Nature" when he includes "all other men and my
own body" under the category of "NATURE" or the "NOT ME."29 [The same
claim, I would aver, can be made for media and mediation as
well]{.underline}. [In theorizing the affective embodiment of radical
mediation, **we should attend to the immediate affective experience of
mediation itself**]{.underline}. [But to suggest that mediation is
immediate is to swim against a strong popular current running through
the history ofWestern thought]{.underline}, [one which would
categorically distinguish mediation from immediacy, a distinction that
both remediation and premediation set out to challenge and that is
further problematized by the concept of radical mediation]{.underline}.

\*modified for gendered language

[As the 21st century unfolds, [a global renewed desire]{.mark} from both
citizens and their respective states [for a tighter control of mobility
is evident]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Wherever we look, the drive is towards
enclosure, or in any case an intensification of the **dialects of
territorialisation** **and deterritorialisation**]{.underline}, [a
dialectics of opening and closure]{.underline}. [**[The belief that the
world would be safer, if only risks]{.mark}**, ambiguity **[and
uncertainty could be controlled]{.mark}**]{.underline} and if only
identities could be fixed once and for all[, **is gaining
momentum**]{.underline}**. [Risk management techniques are increasingly
becoming a means to govern mobilities]{.underline}**. **[In particular
the extent to which the biometric border is extending into multiple
realms, not only of social life, but also of the body, the body that is
not mine.]{.underline}**

[I **would like to pursue [this]{.mark} line of [argument
concern]{.mark}ing [the redistribution of the
earth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Not only through the control of bodies
but the control of movement itself and its corollary,
speed]{.underline}, which is indeed what migration control policies are
all about: controlling bodies, but also movement. More specifically
[[I]{.mark} would like to [see]{.mark} whether and [under what
conditions we could re-engineer the utopia of a borderless
world]{.mark}]{.underline}, and by extension, a borderless Africa,
since, as far as I know, Africa is part of the world. And the world is
part +of Africa.

It is important to attend once again to what is obviously a utopian
intent, the question of a borderless world. [From its inception
"movement" or more precisely "[borderlessness" has been central to
various utopian traditions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} very
[concept of utopia]{.mark}, [refers to]{.mark} that which has no
borders, [beginning with the imagination itself]{.mark}. **[The power of
utopianism]{.mark}** lies in its ability to instantiate the tension
between borderlessness, movement and place, a tension]{.underline}---if
we look carefully---**[that [has marked social transformations in the
modern era]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This tension continues in
contemporary discussions of movement-based social processes,
particularly international migration, open borders, transnationalism and
even cosmopolitanism]{.underline}. [In this context, **[the idea of a
borderless world can be a powerful]{.mark}** albeit problematic
**[resource for social]{.mark}, political and even aesthetic
[imagination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Because of [the current atrophy of
an utopian imagination, apocalyptic imaginaries and [narratives of
cataclysmic disasters]{.mark} and unknown futures [have colonised the
spirit of our time]{.mark}]{.underline}. [But what politics do visions
of apocalypse and catastrophe engender, if not a politics of separation,
rather than a politics of the humanity, as species coming into
being]{.underline}? [Because we inherit a history in which the
consistent sacrifice of some lives for the betterment of others is the
norm]{.underline}, [and [because these are times of deep- seated
anxieties]{.mark}, including anxieties [of racialised others taking over
the planet]{.mark}]{.underline}; [because of all of that**, [racial
violence is increasingly encoded in the language of the]{.mark}**
[**border and** **of** **security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result,
[[contemporary borders are in danger of becoming sites of
reinforcement]{.underline}]{.mark}, reproduction and intensification
[[of]{.mark} [vulnerability for stigmatised]{.mark}]{.underline} and
dishonoured [[groups]{.underline}]{.mark}, for the most racially marked,
the ever more disposable, those that in the era of neoliberal
abandonment have been paying the heaviest price for the most expansive
period of prison construction in human history. I refer to the prison
here, the carceral landscapes of our world, precisely as the antithesis
of movement, of freedom of movement. There is not a more dramatic
opposition to the idea of movement than the prison. And the prison is a
key feature of the landscape of our times.

In proposing to re-examine the question of a borderless Africa and a
borderless world, [I would like to stay away from]{.underline} dominant
ways with which this issue has been dealt. That is under [the sign of
Kant and his promise of unbounded cosmopolitanism]{.underline}, [and
under the sign of liberal individualism understood as an antidote or to
the deeply ingrained fascist impulses of European governance and
bureaucracies]{.underline}. Although they seem to be worlds apart, both
of these approaches are articulated around the concept of the fourth
freedom.

In classical liberal thought there are three core freedoms: First of
all, freedom of movement. Within freedom of movement, there is freedom
of movement of capital, priority number one. But, since there is no
capital without goods, there is freedom of movement of goods. Number
three is services, and especially in these times of ours, the freedom of
movement of those who can provide services. Those are the three core
freedoms. So the concept of the fourth freedom has to do with freedom of
movement of persons. Traditional engagements with the idea of a
borderless world aimed at precipitating the advent of that fourth
freedom. Within that configuration a borderless world would be a world
of free movement of: capital, goods, services and persons. Such
movement, such freedom of movement would not be restricted to the core
economically rich countries or states, which is the case as we speak.
The Schengen system, for instance, is limited to the core European
countries. In fact, **[[if you have an American passport you can
basically go wherever you want]{.underline}. [The world belongs to
you]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But this is not the case for every
inhabitant of our planet. S[o in the configuration I have just referred
to, the fourth freedom, [the ability to move around the planet]{.mark}
would no longer be limited to Europeans and Americans]{.underline}. [It
[would be a radical right that would belong to everybody]{.mark} by
virtue of each and every individual being a human being]{.underline}.
[It is a right that would be extended to poor members of the earth. So
we keep going back to the question of the earth]{.underline}. There
would be no visas, in some instantiations of the fourth freedom of
movement there would be no quotas, and no bizarre category to fill in,
because you would not even have to apply for a visa. One could just get
on a plane, a train, a boat, on the road, or on a bike. Rights of
non-discrimination would be extended to all. I will give you one little
example. In Cameroon, until the beginning of the 1980s, it was possible
to travel to France with one's national identity card. Most people went
to France and came back. They did not go because they wanted to settle
there. Most people want to live where they "belong". But they want to be
able to come and go. And they are more likely to come and go when the
borders are not hermetically closed. So,  a borderless world imagined by
the fourth freedom of movement is premised, therefore on this right of
non-discrimination and on this circulatory and pendular set of
migrations.

To elucidate or pose differently the question of a borderless world, is
to contrast two paradigms. On the one hand, examine the liberal idea of
a borderless world through the free movement concept and contrast it
with African precolonial understandings of movement in space.
Contrasting these two paradigms will hopefully give us conceptual
resources to expand on this utopian project of a borderless world.

When I say liberal classical thought, of course it is extremely
complicated, we understand that. I am giving you an archetype, which
itself needs to be properly deconstructed. And here I will rely in
particular on a recently published work called Movement and the Ordering
of Freedom published by Hagar Kotef, an Israeli scholar who teaches at
School of Oriental and African Studies  in London. You might let your
imagination work and understand why it is an Israeli who is interested
in this. What Kotef shows in that work is the extent to which liberal
political thought has in fact always been saddled with a contradiction
when it comes to imagining the possibility of a borderless world. Her
argument is that this contradiction stems from its conception of
movement. She shows that, in fact, two dominant configurations of
movement constantly come into conflict with one another, cancelling each
other at times within classical liberal thought. [[**Movement**]{.mark}
here **[is seen]{.mark}** both as a manifestation of freedom and as an
interruption, **[as a threat to order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[One of
the functions of the state is, therefore, to craft a concept of order,
stability and security]{.mark}** that is reconcilable with its concept
of freedom and its concept of movement. **That is the
contradiction**]{.underline}. [Kotef argues, **[the liberal classical
state is the enemy of people who restlessly move
around]{.mark}**]{.underline}.  **[[Such people are configured as an
unassimilable other]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [You cannot assimilate them.
**[They are constantly on the move]{.mark}**. There are colonial
repercussions to all of this]{.underline}. The biggest problem of [**the
colonial state in** the continent of **Africa**]{.underline} from the
19th century onwards [was to make sure people stayed in the same place.
It **had a hard time achieving this**. They were constantly on the move.
**They were "uncaptured**]{.underline}".

[So, the business of the state is how to capture them. Without capturing
them, sovereignty does not mean anything]{.underline}. **[[Sovereignty
means you capture a people, you capture a
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}**, you delimit borders [and this allows
you, in turn, to exercise the monopoly of territory, of course, monopoly
over the people and in terms of the use of legitimate force and, very
importantly---because everything else depends on that---monopoly over
taxation]{.underline}. **[Y[ou cannot tax people who have no
address]{.underline}]{.mark}**[. [The state sees such people as
enemies]{.mark}]{.underline}, [both of freedom, because they do not
exercise it with restraint, and [of security and
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [You cannot build an order on the basis
of that which is unstable]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The same state is a friend of self-regulated movement. Why? Because
freedom here is understood as being about moderation, about
self-regulation. It's not about excess---excessive movement immediately
conjures problems of security. [So, as Kotef argues, movement not only
has to be restrained via an array of disciplinary mechanisms, it has to
be reconciled with freedom and to some extent
self-restraint]{.underline}, [but the ability to restrain or regulate
oneself is not assumed to be the share of all subjects]{.underline}. Not
everybody is able to restrain ~~him- or herself~~ themself. [**[Some
movements were therefore configured as freedom, and others
were]{.mark}** deemed improper and were **[conceived as a
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [That is the bifurcation we have in
classical liberal thought**. [It is the spectre that haunts classical
liberal states]{.mark}**, from those years up to now. We have not gotten
rid of that spectre]{.underline}.

The way in which classical liberal states have tried to resolve this
contradiction has been by managed mobility, which is back on the agenda
right now as I speak, in Europe and even in South Africa where I have
been doing some work with the Department of Home Affairs on
recalibrating inter-African migrations. The key concept is "managed
mobility". So, within the framework of managed mobility, certain
categories of the population are constantly seen as posing a threat, not
only to themselves and to their own security, but also to others'
security. Such a threat, it is thought, can be diminished if their
movements are confined and if they are domesticated and subject to some
type of reform.

[In the classical liberal model security and freedom came to be defined
as a right of exclusion]{.underline}. [Order within that model is about
securing the unequal ordering of property relations]{.underline}.
[Asserting the boundaries of the nation goes hand in hand in that model
with the assertion of the boundaries of race]{.underline}. [Now,
defining the boundaries of race within that model requires a proper
definition of the boundaries of the body; the centrality of the body in
the calculus of both freedom and security]{.underline}.

First of all, let me say that **[[pre-colonial
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}** might not have been a borderless world, at
least in the sense in which we **[[have]{.underline}]{.mark}** been
defining borders, but where the existing
**[[borders]{.underline}]{.mark}** were **[[always porous and
permeable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [**[business of a border
is,]{.mark} in fact[, to be crossed]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} That is what
borders are for]{.underline}. [There is no conceivable border outside of
that principle, the law of permeability]{.underline}. As evidenced by
traditions of long-distance trade, circulation was fundamental. It was
fundamental in the production of cultural forms, of political forms, of
economic and social and religious forms. [[The most important vehicle
for transformation and change was mobility]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It
was not class struggles in the sense that we understand
it]{.underline}]{.mark}. Mobility was the motor of any kind of social or
economic or political transformation. In fact, it was the driving
principle behind the delimitation and organisation of space and
territories. So the primordial principle of spatial organisation was
continuous movement. And this is also still part of present day culture.
**[[To stop is to run risks. You have to be on the move
constantly]{.mark}. More and more, especially in conditions of crisis,
being on the move is the very condition of your survival[. If you are
not on the move, the chances of survival are
diminished]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [So **[dominance over sovereignty was
not exclusively expressed through the control of a territory,]{.mark}
physically marked with borders**]{.underline}. [It was not.  How was it
then? [**If** **you do not control a territory, how** **can you exercise
sovereignty**]{.mark}]{.underline}? [How can you extract anything, since
as far as we know, power expresses itself also, if not primarily,
through one or the other form of extraction]{.underline}.

[[All]{.mark} of that [was expressed through
networks]{.mark}]{.underline}. Networks and crossroads. The importance
of roads and crossroads in African literature is astounding. Read
Soyinka, read Achebe, read Tutuola. Roads and crossroads are everywhere
in their literature. [So crossroads, flows of people and flows of
nature, both in dialectical relationships because in those cosmogonies
people are unthinkable without what we call nature]{.underline}. So
while the Anthropocene's turn seems to be a novelty in parts of our
world today, we have always lived in that. It is not new. Because you
cannot think of people, without thinking of nonhumans. Read Tutuola, it
is a world of humans and non-humans, interacting, acting with others. I
do not want to exaggerate this. [Fixed geographical spaces, such as
towns and villages did exist. People and things could be concentrated in
a particular location. Such places could even become the origin of
movement and there were links between places, such as roads and flight
paths, but places were not described by points or lines]{.underline}.
What mattered the most was the distribution of movement between places.
[[Movement was the driving force]{.mark} of the production of space and
movement itself, if we are to belief some [of those
cosmogonies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here I have in mind the Dogon
cosmogonies that were particularly studied by Marcel Griaule, or other
cosmogonies in Equatorial Africa dealt with by anthropologists and
historians like Jan Vansina, John M. Janzen and others. [Movement itself
was not necessarily akin to displacement. What mattered the most was
**[the extent to which flows and their intensities intersected]{.mark}**
and interacted **[with other flows]{.mark}**, the new forms they could
take when they intensified]{.underline}. [Movement]{.underline},
especially among the Dogon, [could lead to diversions, conversions and
intersections]{.underline}. [[These were more important than points,
lines and surfaces, which are, as we know cardinal references in western
geometrics]{.underline}]{.mark}. So, [what we have [here is a different
kind of geometry out of which concepts of]{.mark} borders,
[power,]{.mark} relations and [separation derive]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[If we want to harness alternative resources, the conceptual vocabulary
type, [**to imagine a borderless world**, **here is an
archive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is not the only one]{.underline}.
**[But [what we harness are the archives of the world at
large]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and not only the western
archive]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [In fact, the western archive does not
help us to develop an idea of borderlessness**. [The western archive is
premised on the crystallisation of the idea of a
border]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

## Framework

### Notes

This strategy against framework is centered around reasonability. This
might seem odd with a K aff---most people don't read K affs to be
topical in the first place, so reasonability doesn't come up nearly as
much. However, I think it's a pretty underutilized strategy that, with a
lot of practice and explicit judge instruction, can appeal to a lot of
more policy-leaning judges, because it lets you translate it into terms
that make sense to them.

The most important thing to make clear is that this isn't the same
reasonability argument that you'd make with a policy aff against a T
argument, because you can't really pass off your interpretation as
"reasonable"---at least, not in the same sense as a policy
interpretation. Instead, you should **explicitly instruct** the judge to
**choose** to decide that your interpretations are reasonable readings
of the resolution, **even if they don't think that our interpretations
are the "true" definition of the word at hand**. Your offensive argument
for why this is a good way for the judge to evaluate T debates (or, at
least, the T debate that you are having) is that choosing to race to the
"truest" interpretation enables the operations of cyberwar even if
individual debates seem like they might be able to resist those
operations, because the essence of cyberwar is redefining truth itself
(editing the value of bits of information in computers to send false or
faulty messages). Every attempt to establish a particular definition as
"true" over the course of time has some militarized dimension; it's just
a question of how much. Thus, choosing to read seemingly unreasonable
interpretations of the resolution as "reasonable" feeds faulty data into
the algorithm and interrupts this process, if only a little bit.

You should only read the counter-interpretations that make sense based
on the 1NC! Obviously these cards are pretty long! If you only had time
to read one card (besides Joque, the reasonability card), I would read
Collier, because it also references the US and NATO and says
"cooperate." **Don't prioritize reading cards** (that's why there aren't
many)---the 1AC has a lot of framework tricks and arguments built in.
Use those!

### C/I---Cybersecurity---2AC

#### Cybersecurity is "the security of the environment formed by physical and non-physical components and characterised by the use of computers and other networked devices." Debates about US-NATO security cooperation are [more accurate]{.underline} when they theorize states as [assemblages]{.underline} rather than [unitary actors]{.underline}.

**Collier, 18**---Cyber Security DPhil Candidate based at the Department
of Politics and International Relations, and the Centre for Doctoral
Training in Cyber Security, University of Oxford, formerly worked at the
NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Jamie, "Cyber
Security Assemblages: A Framework for Understanding the Dynamic and
Contested Nature of Security Provision," Politics and Governance, Volume
6, Issue 2, July 2018, dml)

Refreshed thinking is required to better understand the provision of
cyber security and the configuration of cyber security actors. Here,
[the **term cyber security** is **defined** as the security of the
environment formed by **physical** and **non-physical components** and
characterised by the use of **computers** and other **networked
devices**]{.underline}. Cyber security actors, by definition, provide
security in some capacity. Yet this does not mean that all actors strive
to achieve a single, unitary concept of security. [The prevalence of
private actors]{.underline} means that cyber security is often provided
by actors who prioritise other commercial objectives over security.
Encryption disputes between the US government and technology firms show
that different actors have altogether different motivations.

This [makes the study of the **different cyber security
providers**]{.underline}, [and how they **interact** with one another
**essential**]{.underline}. [The concept of **global cyber security
assemblages** provides a **conceptual anchor** that provides a means for
**further understanding** these issues]{.underline}. [The term provides
a **more appropriate concept for understanding contemporary cyber
security contexts** when compared to **more traditional
frameworks**]{.underline}. [The security assemblage term]{.underline}
refers to new hybrid structures that are often simultaneously public and
private, global and local. The use of the term is part of an emerging
body of scholarship within IR literature that [seeks to **empirically
assess** complex structures where a **range** of different global and
local]{.underline}, [public and private security agents]{.underline},
interact, **[cooperate]{.underline}** and compete [to produce
new]{.underline} institutions, practices and [forms of **security
governance** that **cannot be captured neatly though the boundaries of
nation states**]{.underline} (Abrahamsen & Williams, 2011; Williams,
2016).

[The assemblage concept]{.underline} therefore [moves **away** from
the]{.underline} traditional centre of the [nation-state to
**multi-layered**]{.underline}, networked [**configurations**
that]{.underline} are able to [accommodate a **range of entities**
including (inter)governmental]{.underline},
[para-governmental]{.underline}, [nongovernmental]{.underline}, [and
private organisations]{.underline} (Voelkner, 2013). [The boundaries of
an assemblage can be drawn in **alternative ways** to the traditional
contours of national borders]{.underline}. They can be drawn to examine
the provision of security within a territory but can also be used [to
examine security or governance contexts that are **inherently
international**]{.underline}. The issue of **[internet
governance]{.underline}**, for example, [comprises a **global
assemblage** of actors]{.underline}, [albeit one **dominated by US
actors**]{.underline} (Carr, 2014). Perhaps the most defining
characteristic of the assemblage concept is therefore an accommodation
of the forces of globalisation and a scepticism of rigid borders and
distinctions. Of course, much of the above relates closely to other
terms including actor network theory; indeed, the difference between the
terms is one of emphasis, rather than kind (Acuto & Curtis, 2014) with
the similarities and differences between the two concepts discussed in
greater detail elsewhere (Acuto & Curtis, 2014; Müller & Schurr, 2016).

[For]{.underline} the purposes of **[understanding cyber security
provision]{.underline}**, it is [the notion of **assembly** and
**disassembly**]{.underline}--- [where actors relinquish]{.underline},
[transfer and develop capacities and functions]{.underline}---that [is
**central**]{.underline} to the added value of the assemblage concept.
As security functions emerge and are captured by either public or
private actors, actors assemble greater capabilities and
responsibilities. [As private actors increasingly take on
strategic]{.underline}, [ethical]{.underline}, [and foreign-policy
alignment issues that were previously outside their
purview]{.underline}, [they are **assembling** into more political
actors]{.underline}. Conversely, as aspects of cyber security are
increasingly regulated and managed by states, other aspects of private
actors' capabilities and responsibilities are disassembling.
Contemporary cyber security practices are replete with these instances
of assembly and disassembly. Assemblage thinking therefore pays
attention to the instability of security networks. While cyber security
is provided by a vast array of actors, assemblage thinking also
highlights the contestation related to the roles and responsibilities of
security actors. In light of emerging and shifting actors, [the point is
**not** to demonstrate that states are **stronger** or
**weaker**]{.underline}. Rather, [the intention is to examine the
**complex configuration** of actors that maintain contingent and
multifaceted relationships with each other]{.underline} (relationships
[that **cannot be captured by static** and]{.underline} often
**[state-centric theories]{.underline}**). [Cyber security is
**replete** with global and local]{.underline}, [public and private
agents whose relationships are **deeply competitive** as well
as]{.underline} **[cooperative]{.underline}**, conflictual, and at times
coordinated. While the concept of a security assemblage has been applied
to cyber security in previous literature (Stevens, 2012, 2016, pp.
181--186), the argument for why and how the concept should be used and
applied to cyber security remains underdeveloped---an imbalance this
article hopes to correct.

These hybrid structures are clearly observed through contemporary
examples with the cyber security of critical national infrastructure
(CNI) in the UK a case in point. The vast majority of CNI is owned and
managed by corporations---itself a broad church that includes a variety
of actor types including not-for-profit community owned private limited
firms, regional and UK-based firms, multinational firms (National Grid
operates in both the US and UK for example, probing traditional
global-local distinctions) and state-owned or quasi-state owned firms
(the now approved Hinkley Point nuclear plant will be owned and managed
by a combination of French-state majority owned EDF energy and Chinese
state-owned China General Nuclear Power Corporation) (Ward, Pickard, &
Stothard, 2016). As a collective, these corporations cannot neatly be
categorised as 'private' given the variety of entities including the
presence of both partially and fully state-owned entities. [Corporations
provide cyber security alongside a **range of government
departments**]{.underline}, including GCHQ and its subsidiary, the
National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC); the Cabinet Office, the various
government departments that are largely responsible for infrastructure
related to their department and related institutions such as the Centre
for the Protection of National Infrastructure (Collier, 2016). All of
[these government entities have their **own identities**]{.underline},
[**agendas** and **motivations**]{.underline}---[a **reality** that
means that]{.underline} '**[the government]{.underline}**' [is **not
necessarily a coherent entity at all**]{.underline}. [Adding to the
plethora of actors are various **international organisations** and
**multilateral bodies**]{.underline}. [Various actors **work together**
within this cyber security assemblage]{.underline}, often in unusual
ways. With Chinese-based firm Huawei providing communication equipment
for CNI organisations, GCHQ employees will routinely monitor, take apart
and inspect the equipment supplied (due to security concerns) at a
centre that is itself funded by Huawei (Rifkind, 2013; Rosenzweig,
2013).

[An assemblage approach also considers the **normative agendas** behind
the traditional categories and distinctions used in IR
literature]{.underline}. [Pursuing assemblage thinking means paying
attention to the **relationships** between a variety of actors and the
**forces** that impel them to act in the way they do]{.underline}
(Lisle, 2013). [The process of assemblage formation is **not neutral**
but **deeply political**]{.underline}. [Different actors have **clashing
views** on]{.underline} what [aspects of cyber security]{.underline}
should be 'public' or 'private' [as well as where the boundaries of
these distinctions lie]{.underline}. Returning to the UK example, the UK
2016 Cyber Security Strategy declared that market based solutions to
cyber security have 'not produced the required pace and scale of
change', meaning that 'Government has to lead the way and intervene more
directly by bringing its influence and resources to bear' in a move that
overtly seeks to increase the government's cyber security purview (HM
Government, 2016). On the other hand, governments have also sought to
relinquish both their authority and responsibility of cyber security
issues within other contexts in order to avoid the backlash of security
failings (Carr, 2016). This is also observed in recent US encryption
disputes that reflect broader political disagreements about the agency
afforded to different actors. Law enforcement organisations' interests
in accessing intelligence on devices clash with technology firms who
instead seek to protect their customers' data from government access,
(albeit while simultaneously selling user data to other businesses and
using it themselves for the purposes of targeted advertisements).
Various government entities compete with each other for ownership of
cyber security and the tax revenue that accompanies the issue.
Alternative visions of cyber security are proposed within such
intra-governmental competition---the issue may be framed through a
military, business or criminal prism depending on the government entity
that seeks to capture the issue. [These tensions are **mirrored** at the
international level where]{.underline} various [multilateral
organisations **compete for relevance** on the issue
including]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[NATO]{.underline}**); the United Nations (UN) through the Group of
Governmental Experts on Information Security; The European Union Agency
for Network and Information Security (ENISA); the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU); etc. It is [this]{.underline} notion of
contestation that [further **distinguishes** an assemblage approach from
other theoretical lenses that **merely acknowledge** the importance of
units other than states or the increasingly blurry lines that exist
between different types of actors]{.underline}.

### C/I---NATO---2AC

#### NATO is an assemblage, "a number of disparate and heterogeneous elements convoked together into a single discernible formation." That's [limited]{.underline} and [predictable]{.underline}.

**Handeland, 19**---Master of Science candidate in International
Relations, Department of International Environment and Development
Studies, Norwegian University of Life Sciences (Lars, "Exploring the
knowledge-politics nexus in global governance: A case study of the
anti-chemical weapons assemblage in Syria (2013-2017),"
<https://nmbu.brage.unit.no/nmbu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2642646/Handeland2019.pdf>,
dml)

Originally developed as a concept by the philosopher Gilles [**Deleuze**
and]{.underline} his writing partner, the psychoanalyst Felix
**[Guattari]{.underline}**, **[defined assemblage]{.underline}** in the
following way: "[An assemblage is a **number of disparate** and
**heterogeneous elements** convoked together into a **single discernible
formation**]{.underline}" (Deleuze & Guattari as cited Bueger, 2014c, p.
60). Importantly, the French word they use is agencement. Derived from
the verb agencer, the noun agencement can roughly be translated into the
'act of assembling', and highlights the ongoing and neverending
processes of shifts and transformations (Phillips, 2006). 8

The term '**[convoked]{.underline}**' [implies that they are brought
together towards a **function** or **purpose**]{.underline}. Indeed,
"[every assemblage is characterized by the process of constituting
a]{.underline} \"**[territory]{.underline}**\" [that holds together
distinct]{.underline} or heterogenous [elements]{.underline}..."(Hayden,
1998, p. 96). [The territory]{.underline}, then, [comes to signify the
**identity** of a given assemblage]{.underline}, [which is derived from
its **purpose** or **function**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the assemblage is
**not**]{.underline} "[a **random collection of things**]{.underline},
since there is a sense that [an assemblage is a **whole** of some sort
that expresses some **identity** and claims a
**territory**]{.underline}" (Wise, 2005, p. 77).

Next, understanding how assemblages 'claims a territory' requires a look
at some of the associated ideas found in the work of Deleuze and
Guattari. As such, the terms territorialization-deterritorialization,
the material-expressive axis, and practices of assembling must be
outlined first.

To start with, I think it is worth quoting Deleuze and Guattari at
length here, giving their original formulation of an assemblage's
features:

On a first, horizontal axis, an assemblage comprises two segments, on of
content, the other of expression. On the one hand it is a machinic
assemblage of bodies, of actions and passions, an intermingling of
bodies reacting to one another; on the other hand it is a collective
assemblage of enunciation, of acts and statements, of incorporeal
transformations attributed to bodies. Then on a vertical axis, the
assemblage has both territorial sides, or reterritorialized sides, which
stabilize it, and cutting edges of deterritorialization, which carry it
away. (Deleuze & Guattari, 2013, pp. 102--103)

In other words, there are two axes in in the assemblage; a vertical axis
of territorialization and deterritorialization, and a horizontal axis of
components (DeLanda, 2006, p. 12). The vertical axis captures the
stability of the assemblage, i.e. whether its internal stability
increases or decreases , whereas the horizontal consists of elements
ranging from the purely material to the purely expressive (Patton, 2006,
p. 27). These four features gives the assemblage a tetravalent
systematization, which signifies the means of combination (Dewsbury,
2011). Next, I unpack these two axes to discuss and assess their
applicability as thinking tools for studies of international relations.

On the vertical material-expressive axis, there is the material or
machinic end, which consist of matter and bodies (Patton, 2006, p. 27).
On the other end there is what Deleuze and Guattari calls the collective
assemblage of enunciation, a rather broad category of different
expressive elements including discourses, knowledges, semiotics and
gestures. Taken together, the heterogeneous elements in an assemblage
include socially situated subjects, materials, objectives and different
"knowledges, discourses, institutions, laws and regulatory regimes"
(Murray Li, 2007, p. 266).

At the same time, [assemblage thinking accentuates **becoming** and
**emergence**]{.underline}, meaning that [its]{.underline}
'[territory]{.underline}' [is **never fully stabilized**]{.underline}.
In fact, [a **core perspective**]{.underline} in assemblage thinking [is
that]{.underline} "[structural stability is seen as **exception** rather
than the **norm**]{.underline}" (Bueger, 2018, p. 619). As such, the
territory claimed by the assemblage constantly undergoes processes that
stabilize, weakens and reshapes it. In assemblage thinking these are
termed: territorialization, deterritorialization and
reterritorialization, respectively. This leads us to the second and
processual horizontal axis of the assemblage.

As for processes that increase hegemony among the content or elements of
the assemblage, called territoritalization, this is "first to be
understood as a process that defines or sharpens the spatial boundaries
of actual territory" (Bueger, 2018, p. 620). For the study of global
governance, territorialization refers to the process of carving out a
territory of political space that can be governed. The physical
boundaries of such a space can be rather fluid, spread across great
distances and be located at many sites. For instance, in Bueger's (2018)
study of the counter-piracy assemblage, territorialization referred not
only to the creation of a special zone in the Indian Ocean, but also to
the various sites and fora all over the world where stakeholders met and
developed plans for action.

Importantly, "territorialization also refers to non-spatial processes.
Practices such as classifying or sorting in and out, defining which
actors, objects and practices belong to the territory, and what
particular role they have are also processes of creating homogeneity"
(Bueger, 2018, p. 620). Indeed, in Bueger's paradigmatic case study,
territorialization also included creating consensus on which practices
of governance were to be considered legitimate regarding counter-piracy
efforts, which ended up being inscribed in document called Best
Practices Management. Hence, the making of consensual knowledge was a
crucial aspect in the process of territorialization by creating
homogeneity among the vast array of relevant stakeholders.

As a result, [processes of territorialization in global governance
settings are **infused with power** when]{.underline}, for instance,
[boundaries are drawn up to **delineate specific knowledges as
authoritative** at the expense of other ways of knowing]{.underline}.
This is why [the act of **sorting out what belongs** and **does not
belong** in the assemblage directs attention to the **power dynamics**
at play in the assemblage]{.underline} as territorialization can work
"through shutting out contingency and entrenching one particular
assemblage...over others" (Müller, 2015, p. 36). Consequently,
[territorialization is a **crucial dimension for analysis** as it
highlights]{.underline} what might be termed [the practice of inclusion
and exclusion]{.underline}, [which **defines what belongs** and **what
does not**]{.underline}.

However, even though an assemblage could be deeply entrenched, it is
never final and always vulnerable to processes of deterritorialization,
which destabilize the it (DeLanda, 2006, p. 12). More concretely, the
idea of deterritorialization as a process that can undo the stability of
an assemblage allows this mode of inquiry to capture transformations and
changes on the 'territory'. Thus, the erosion of boundaries understood
in a broad sense, such as undermining identities, are processes of
deterritorialization (Alvesson & Sköldberg, 2017, p. 58).

The important point here is that for studies of expertise, [the concept
provides the means to **account** for how]{.underline}, for instance,
[knowledge claims put forwards by experts can be **contested**,
**challenged** and **critiqued**]{.underline}. [This can result in a
**destabilization** of the assemblage and make it **shift** and
**transform**]{.underline}. As such, by opening up for new relations to
be established means that [relations of authority can
**shift**]{.underline}, thus [creating]{.underline} '**[windows of
opportunity]{.underline}**' [where **new connections** can be
made]{.underline}. Therefore, "in the process of assembling one always
sees a territorialising force and a deterritorialising potential: here
is where power comes to play (Lancione, 2013, p. 359).

The territory, then, can be unmade by the forces of deterritorialization
and finally there is a potential for reterritorialization of the
relations between components in the assemblage (Hayden, 1998, p. 96). As
far as this author is aware, the notion of re-territorialization has not
been widely used in the literature on assemblages in IR. The idea here
is that [while assemblages are inherently unstable]{.underline}, [they
also tend to **reestablish themselves** because they express a
**purpose** or **function**]{.underline}. [The **longevity** of certain
institutions could be taken as an example of this]{.underline}. For
instance, one could say that [**NATO** expressed a **purpose** or
**function** so that while the **end of the Cold War** initiated a
deterritorialization of the **NATO-assemblage**]{.underline}, [it
**nonetheless reterritorialized**]{.underline}, albeit in a different
form. Importantly, the idea of reterritorialization is not a synthesis
of a territorialization thesis and a deterritorialization antithesis
(Legg, 2011, p. 129), but aims to capture yet another transformation
that the territory might undergo.

Taken together, these processes are then "the qualitative
transformations of complex assemblages on the basis of proliferating
relations between heterogeneous terms (Hayden, 1998, pp. 95--96).
Because this is an ongoing and constant process, [the assemblage is
**always becoming**]{.underline} or emergent [rather than a **static**
or **stable being**]{.underline} (Wise, 2005, pp. 78--79). Hence, [an
analysis centered on assemblage thinking should look for the **changes**
and **transformations** on a given]{.underline}
'[territory]{.underline}', [and **question** how the assemblage
**articulates relations** between its constituting
elements]{.underline}, for instance, the relationship between knowledge
and politics.

### C/I---USFG---2AC

#### The USFG is an assemblage. Did you not see Hamilton?

**Aroney, 2**---Professor of Constitutional Law at The University of
Queensland (Nicholas, "Imagining a Federal Commonwealth: Australian
Conceptions of Federalism, 1890-1901," Federal Law Review, 30(2), 265,
dml)

Putting these points together, Just apparently sought to show that it
was necessary to have [a **strong federal government**]{.underline} in
which the will of the majority prevailed, but that such a government
[must **first** be formed with the consent of]{.underline} each of the
several colonies as **[independent bodies politic]{.underline}**. As the
Herald had maintained, [a federation comes into being by **unanimous
agreement** of the constituent bodies politic]{.underline}, and [they
agree to confer **limited functions** on a central government that makes
its decisions by majority rule]{.underline}, [but the **remainder** of
their constituent and governmental powers are **retained**]{.underline}.

Just also felt it important to draw the attention of his Australian
readers to Hamilton\'s famous discussion of Montesquieu\'s classic
definition of the \'Confederate Republic\'. As reproduced by Just,
Montesquieu had said:

It is very probable that mankind would have been obliged, at length, to
live constantly under the Government of a single person, had they not
contrived a kind of constitution that has all the internal advantages of
a Republican, together with the external force of a Monarchical,
Government---I mean a Confederate Republic.

[This form of **Government**]{.underline} is a convention by which
several smaller States agree to become members of a larger one, which
they intend to form. It [is a kind of **assemblage** of
societies]{.underline}, [that constitutes a **new one**]{.underline},
[capable of **increasing** by means of new associations till they arrive
at such a degree of power]{.underline} as to be able [to
provide]{.underline} for the **[security]{.underline}** of the united
body. \... As this Government is composed of small Republics, it enjoys
the internal happiness of each, and with respect to its external
situation, it is possessed, by means of the association, of all the
advantages of large Monarchies.

A Republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force, may
support itself without any internal corruption. \... As this Government
is composed of small Republics, it enjoys the internal happiness of
each, and with respect to its external situation, it is possessed, by
means of the association, of all the advantages of large
Monarchies.\[47\]

In Montesquieu\'s day, political reflection suggested that large,
territorial monarchies had the advantage of external security, but they
also suffered the internal disadvantage of a tendency to despotism,
whereas the small republic had the advantage of a virtuous citizenry
actively participating in the government, but suffered the external
disadvantage of susceptibility to assimilation by larger powers.
Montesquieu suggested that the advantages of each might be secured in
what he called the confederate republic.

Hamilton commented on this idea in Federalist No 9. As reproduced by
Just, [**Hamilton** proposed that the]{.underline}
\'**[definition]{.underline}**\' [of a]{.underline} \'Confederate
Republic\' or \'**[Federal Government]{.underline}**\' [was]{.underline}
\'**[an assemblage of societies]{.underline}**\' or \'an association of
two or more States into one State\'. So long, Hamilton maintained, that
the \'separate organisation of the members be not abolished\', but
rather exists \'by a constitutional necessity for local purposes\', then
[despite their]{.underline} \'**[subordination]{.underline}**\' [to an
additional]{.underline} \'[general authority]{.underline}\' or national
government created for specific purposes, [the scheme
remains]{.underline} \'[an **Association**]{.underline} of States or a
Confederacy\'. Indeed, Hamilton pointed out, the proposed United States
Constitution treated the states as \'constituent parts\' of the Union,
allowing them \'direct representation in the Senate\' and leaving them
with \'certain exclusive and very important portions of the sovereign
power\'.\[48\]

### Reasonability---2AC

#### Reasonability: You should [choose]{.underline} to understand our interpretations as [reasonable readings]{.underline} of the resolution. Cyberwar operates at the level of [epistemology itself]{.underline}, which means competing interpretations is a [regime of veridiction]{.underline} that [furthers]{.underline} the militarization of the cybernetic episteme.

**Joque, 18**---PhD from the European Grad School, researches
philosophy, technology and media and is the visualization librarian at
the University of Michigan, go blue (Justin, "Spear Phishing: Nodal
Subjects," *Deconstruction Machines: Writing in the Age of Cyberwar*,
Chapter 4, 157-165, dml)

Leaking information, anonymity, and privacy are not only issues of
secrecy or its lack but are intimately tied to the subject's relation to
truth. [Faced with the **contingent** and **vulnerable** nature
of]{.underline} these [networks and information]{.underline}, [any
political subject **always** exists in a **complex relation to truth**
or]{.underline}, at the very least, [the **veracity of**]{.underline}
her **[information]{.underline}**. Any political efficacy from leaking
information and destroying institutional secrecy requires the production
of truth or some sort of truth-effect in the network that would engender
a political response. Given the risks that false information could be
leaked for the purposes of deception, or produced for other ends, as we
saw in the case of Sabu, [it becomes **difficult to determine the
veracity** of any individual bit of information]{.underline}. More
fundamentally, [cyberwar in its **very functioning** is an **attack on
truth** and its **material** and **epistemic
underpinnings**]{.underline}. [Under the threat of
cyberwar]{.underline}, [and the possibility that any information may
have already been compromised]{.underline}, [epistemology and truth
become not only **philosophical concerns** but **military-strategic
problems** as well]{.underline}.

In this light, [it becomes **difficult to separate any truth** from its
**political** and **military investment**]{.underline}. Derrida in
"Plato's Pharmacy" suggests that "the opposition between the true and
the untrue is entirely comprehended, inscribed, within this structure or
this generalized writing. The true and the untrue are both species of
repetition. And there is no repetition possible without the graphics of
supplementarity."18 Here, for Derrida, the true does not transcend the
structure of writing in general. There is no unity but only a relation
among units of inscription. [The true and the untrue are movements of
**repetition** within and between systems]{.underline}, [a movement
defined by text and network]{.underline}. [Truth and its opposite become
**emergent effects** of networks and texts rather than
**transcendental** or **global attributes**]{.underline} of systems.
[Like certificate authorities for verifying identity on open
networks]{.underline}, [the guarantee of any information is merely
**deferred** to a different level]{.underline}. [Truth emerges as a
result of the **structure** and **folds** of a given
system]{.underline}.

[This is **not** to suggest that truth is **relative**]{.underline}; [it
is **intimately tied** to the **real** and **material movement** of
texts]{.underline}, programs, bits, capital, and so on, through the
various global networks and systems at stake.19 [Still]{.underline},
[what makes information true is precisely its **inscription** within a
given network and its **repetition throughout** rather than through some
**preexisting global phenomenon**]{.underline}. Lacan's insights in this
regard are especially helpful. He suggests that [truth is a function of
**language**]{.underline}.20 [Truth is produced by the **entire
network** of signifiers and subjects and always points to the truth of
the **structure** rather than the veracity of an **individual
statement**]{.underline}.21 Thus [truth]{.underline} for Lacan [is
always a question of the **symbolic** and is **never synonymous** with
the real]{.underline}. The real can never be falsified, for it is always
exactly where it is; it is "always in its place."22 [A bit is **never**
on its own **true** or **false**]{.underline}; the signifier in the real
is, as Kittler suggests, merely a voltage difference.23 [It is **only
through**]{.underline} language, **[interpretation]{.underline}**, and
software [that the bit comes to produce an **effect**]{.underline};
[through the networks of signification]{.underline}, the networks of
voltage difference become capable of producing a truth-effect. [It is on
these grounds that cyberwar becomes **so insidious**]{.underline}, by
threatening to flip bits at the level of the real; [underneath
language]{.underline}, [it demonstrates both the **symbolic threat**
possessed by this real and the **inability** for the symbolic ever to
achieve]{.underline} a full unity or [mastery]{.underline}.

[Truth becomes an effect of its movements through space and the programs
that operate upon it]{.underline}. [Any politics that commits itself to
**truth alone** as the grounds for a politics risks merely partaking of
the **autoimmune violence of undecidability**]{.underline}. [The end of
secrecy **cannot in itself** be a panacea for political
injustice]{.underline}. In August 2010, Reporters without Borders sent
an open letter to Assange suggesting precisely that his politics
(insomuch as they were [a politics of truth]{.underline} rather than of
mere destruction) were shortsighted and paid little attention to the
chain of effects that followed the dissemination of the "Afghanistan War
Logs":

You have unintentionally provided supposedly democratic governments with
good grounds for putting the Internet under closer surveillance. . .
.Indiscriminately publishing 92,000 classified reports reflects a real
problem of methodology and, therefore, of credibility. Journalistic work
involves the selection of information.

Reporters without Borders insists that journalistic work
[is]{.underline} not simply about providing information but rather
[about **filtering**]{.underline}, **[selecting]{.underline}**, [and
**assessing** information]{.underline}, in short, about [the **program**
that is brought to bear upon information]{.underline}. Even though they
may take issue with Assange's choices of selecting information, his
attempts at sharing leaks were also founded on a commitment to selecting
information. Still, his selection was significantly more programmatic
and consisted largely of sharing all information, except for information
about sources (or even knowing, as the technological infrastructure
behind WikiLeaks was designed to completely protect leakers); this still
constitutes a decision to share only certain information.

Either way, [this decision amounts to a **political** and **strategic**
commitment]{.underline}. Terranova explains the stakes well when she
describes the circulation of images as a type of warfare:

The hyperreal does not really involve a metaphysics of being and
appearance so much as a kind of [information ecology]{.underline} which
also [includes a dimension of **warfare**]{.underline}---a warfare [to
determine the **differential power** and **dominance** of some types of
images over others]{.underline}.24

Alongside images, [**all texts** and **information** are subjected to
this dimension of warfare that differentiates their **efficacy** and
**ability** to reformulate flows and networks]{.underline}. It is not
merely the bits of information that determine their efficacy but their
selection and differential relation.

The specific politics and strategy of pure transparency ultimately turn
against themselves on two levels. On the level of truth, such a
commitment can never guarantee the secrecy of the leaker while producing
technologies that coax information from organizations. The same secrecy
tax that burdens corporations and governments also causes individuals to
reveal their secrets. On the level of effect, then, any technological
and social system for supporting leaks is forced to engage in these
complex networks and texts, in short, to decide what individuals'
secrecy matters and what secrecy does not matter. The problem then
becomes an undecidable political question. This is not to say that it is
a priori negative but that such an act constitutes an opening rather
than a necessarily efficacious politics.

With the belief in an abstract machine that moves unwaveringly toward
the end of secrecy or the belief that this decision can be avoided
through technology, we risk that information becomes its own truth.
Leaks become, as raw data, an objectification of the sociopolitical
relations that produce, use, and manipulate information and thus mark
and measure truth itself. [Information]{.underline} thus
[becomes]{.underline} what Foucault describes as [a **regime of
veridiction**]{.underline}, which "in fact, is not a law of truth, but
[the **set of rules** enabling one to **establish which statements in a
given discourse can be described as true or false**]{.underline}."25
Information and the [technologies]{.underline} of antisecrecy [establish
both the **truth** and the very rules enabling one to **ascertain** the
truth]{.underline}. [The regime of transparency in an informational
economy becomes not about the **quality** or **effect** of information
but about its **mere possession**]{.underline},
**[existence]{.underline}**, [and **exposure**]{.underline}. This is not
to downplay the importance of these leaks or to minimize the great risks
and costs individuals have taken on to bring this information to the
public but rather to insist that [this information alone **does not
guarantee** an effective politics]{.underline}.

RESISTANCE AFTER THEORY

In this light, we can understand the media as "tactical" insomuch as all
sides of these conflicts seize upon media, their reuse, and their
reconfiguration for the purposes of war and conflict. Raley, commenting
on the Critical Art Ensemble and Lovink's, among others', conception of
tactical media, states, "Tactical media comes so close to its core
informational and technological apparatuses that protest in a sense
becomes the mirror image of its object, its aesthetic replicatory and
reiterative rather than strictly oppositional."26 While the focus of
tactical media is largely on art and protest practices, with cyberwar,
media become tactical to all involved, including states and armies.
Despite these different forces who are now involved in using media
tactically, all of them appear caught in this system that Raley
outlines, where the use of these media requires that one mirror the
object of intervention. When media become objects of war and tactics, it
becomes impossible to step outside these processes of mediatization and
its disfiguration in the face of this violence.27

To understand the media as tactical under the constant siege of cyberwar
requires taking the McLuhanesque insight that "[the **media** is the
**message**]{.underline}" in the most deconstructed sense possible.
[There is **no longer any meaningful way** to separate the
two]{.underline}. Perhaps before the rise of computers, when command
functioned on the level of a physical machine and data could not touch
it (e.g., no message could be sent over the radio that would turn it
off---or worse yet, turn a car off while one is driving), a separation
could be made between media and message. The rise of reprogrammable
media that combine data and command requires abandoning any distinction
between media and message. [Subjects and truth are produced through
the]{.underline} topologies and [**texts** that send various messages
through a multiplicity of media]{.underline}. [Tactics]{.underline} in
relation to media [can]{.underline} then [truly **no longer be
oppositional**]{.underline}, [for there can be **no transcendental
space** from which a stable space of opposition could be
constructed]{.underline}. Rather, [the **only tactical movement** that
remains is to discover the **outsides** that are **folded inside
texts**]{.underline}, networks, [and the **unstable interface** between
them]{.underline}. But, the translation of local information to global
networks always risks perversions, corruptions, and interventions.

[Despite]{.underline}, [or perhaps even because of]{.underline}, [the
**difficulty** of acting or deciding within these complex global
networks]{.underline}, [there is a **great appeal** to]{.underline} the
possibility of controlling situations through instantaneously knowable
surfaces. Data appear as a vast field of computable truth. But the
coherence of these surfaces is always belied by the vulnerability and
contingency they contain within and the instability of the subjects
whose traces exist in these vast fields of data. Still, many discourses,
including those of information transparency, continually claim the
efficacy of managing surface effects. Rather than recognizing those
forces, which resist control, a host of actors
[increasingly]{.underline} seek out [**finer-grained modes** of
analysis]{.underline}, [holding on to the **fallacy** that everything
today is **flowing** and **visible**]{.underline}.

Chris Andersen, a prominent technology journalist, has stated the belief
in these analytic modes of knowing in its most radical [and]{.underline}
succinct form. In an argument analogous to Greenberg's claims of a
coming transparency, Andersen states that the age of huge data sets
means [that we **no longer need models** or **theories** of the world
and instead can]{.underline} "**[run the data]{.underline}**" [in real
time]{.underline}:

Out with every theory of human behavior, from linguistics to sociology.
**[Forget]{.underline}** taxonomy, **[ontology]{.underline}**, and
psychology. [**Who knows why people do what they do**?]{.underline} [The
point is **they do it**]{.underline}, [and we can **track** and
**measure** it with **unprecedented fidelity**]{.underline}. [With
enough data]{.underline}, [the numbers **speak for
themselves**]{.underline}. The big target here isn't advertising,
though. It's science. The scientific method is built around testable
hypotheses. These models, for the most part, are systems visualized in
the minds of scientists. . . . But faced with massive data, this
approach to science---hypothesize, model, test--- is becoming
obsolete.28

For Andersen, [we do not need to know **why** things happen but merely
be able to **predict** them]{.underline} in real time: [no
**theories**]{.underline}, [no **models**]{.underline}, [no
**interpretation**]{.underline}, [just a **pure flow of
data**]{.underline}. In many ways, it is the scientific version of Bill
Gates's fantasy of frictionless capitalism, but for Andersen, the
signifier of capital is gone too. His is a fantasy of an infinite flow
of information processed in real time, and the world constantly
re-created anew out of predicting algorithms. It is a utopia, a
nonplace, with no slowness and no topography that could hold information
into a theoretical system. Beyond theory, we no longer need categories,
only momentary statistical conglomerations. In this world, one need not
know or theorize gender, class, or even individual subjects; [everything
becomes an **individual record** in a large-scale database]{.underline}.

It is, in short, the fantasy of a world without cyberwar, a world beyond
cyberwar. [This utopian vision would only be possible if computation and
data were **perfectly secure** and always represented the world
**exactly**]{.underline}. [These descriptions]{.underline} of a pure
world of data-driven discovery [rest on the **fantasy** that all being
and becoming can be **perfectly encoded** as data]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} utopia [requires that all data be **perfectly
secure**]{.underline} and no accident, gap, or military force affect
this correspondence. [At the same time]{.underline}, [it is a fantasy of
the **utter success** of cyberwar]{.underline}, insomuch as it requires
that technicians, politicians, scientists, and bankers are able [to
extract data from every system]{.underline}. In sum, Andersen hopes for
a cyberwar that would end all cyberwars, an impossible cyberwar that
would defeat all resistances.

Andersen is not alone in this vision of the future. A whole field of
"hypothesis-free science" has gained traction in several disciplines.29
Advertisers, high-frequency stock traders, and security agencies all
mine massive stores of data to find customers, profits, and criminals
with no interest in theorizing what is being sought. Even Latour's actor
network theory appears committed to the tracing and recording of
surface-level phenomena that provide no theory aside from the method of
following an individual actor's own theory.30 Here, again, [information
**becomes its own veridiction**]{.underline}. [As long as the variables
correlate]{.underline}, [it **does not matter why** or
**how**]{.underline}, [and if the correlation is **off**]{.underline},
[the algorithm **updates automatically** to **improve accuracy for the
next round**]{.underline}.

### AT: Iteration

#### Machine Learning DA: Mechanistically weighing the consequences of fiated plans over and over makes debate algorithmically violent at the level of [form]{.underline}, which has [material significance]{.underline}. They've created [uniqueness]{.underline} for our offense because iteration is a [process]{.underline}, so disrupting one instance [jams the gears]{.underline}.

**Amoore, 22**---Professor of Human Geography in the Department of
Geography, Durham University (Louise, "Machine learning political
orders," Review of International Studies, February 15, 2022, dml)
\[language modifications denoted by brackets\]

Yet, what I propose here is that machine learning political orders
reverse Deleuze's dictum so that [the political problem is
**constituted** by the posited solution]{.underline}; or, the solution
gets the problem it deserves. [The]{.underline} retroactive
[logic]{.underline} of deep learning commonly [**begins** with the
identification of the **target output**]{.underline} from the model,
actively using the output signals that diverge or converge on the target
as an experimental space of modulation and adjustment. Though there are
multiple possible functions or 'solutions that will match the data', a
machine learning algorithm will use 'two sources of information to
select the best function: one is the dataset, and the other (the
inductive bias) is the assumptions that bias the algorithm to prefer
some functions over others'. 40 In order [to change the output
signal]{.underline}, [the **weights**]{.underline} within the hidden
layers of the neural network [**adjust** and **modify** the
signal]{.underline} that feeds forward to the next layer. Why does this
computational process matter for how the political problem and the
solution interact? The retroactive move from target solution to the
weights in the model means that [the parameters and dimensions of an
**intractably difficult** political question]{.underline} -- democracy,
pandemic response, border security, stability in the economy -- [become
configured as **infinitely adjustable** in relation to the
solution]{.underline}. Where the concept of problematisation suggests a
multiplicity of actions that could take place under the broad unifying
conditions of the formulation of the problem -- and, indeed a space for
normative deliberation of possible actions -- [this]{.underline}
retroactive [paradigm **forecloses** the multiplicity of plural
solutions to a **single target**]{.underline}, [and **reduces** the
framing of the political problem to the **weighting of
inputs**]{.underline}. Every adjustment or modification of the
parameters in the deep learning model is simultaneously an arrangement
of the political problem.

[To begin at the]{.underline} '**[end]{.underline}**', [with a **target
output**]{.underline} of the model, [is]{.underline} thus [to
**transform radically** what a political claim can be]{.underline} in
the world. For example, machine learning algorithms are increasingly
being deployed in immigration and borders decisions. The introduction of
machine learning in the sorting and classification of visa applications
does not merely automate some aspects of a previously human centred
bureaucratic process. More than this, the building of a model of the
flows of immigration claims actively constitutes what a border can be
and how it is understood as a political question. Moreover, [the space
to **challenge** the political formulation]{.underline}, such as for
example to question the racialised criteria that are applied to the
judgement on a person, [is]{.underline} also **[closed
out]{.underline}** by the machine learning process. In contrast to the
rules-based models that I described as engineering racialised
assumptions into association rules (for example, in Rakesh Agrawal's
data mining models), machine learning learns and generates new racial
formations from the data examples. With machine learning forms of
classification, there are no criteria as such; there are only inputs,
outputs, features, and functions. The model will also adjust with the
volatilities and geopolitical disruptions of migration, shifting its
thresholds so that the derived outputs are decoupled from the input data
of a visa application.

[There are **profound political consequences** of this]{.underline} more
generative and disruptive [approach]{.underline} to data inputs. In
2020, for example, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants
(JCWI) challenged the UK Home Office's use of a 'streaming algorithm' to
allocate visa applications to high, medium, and low levels of risk. The
JCWI identified the nationality data that were among the inputs to the
algorithm that scored some applicants as 'high risk', effectively
automating the decision to refuse the visa. JCWI and Foxglove Legal
successfully argued that the nationality data are proxies for race and,
therefore, in breach of the provisions of the Equality Act 2010.41 If
the algorithm had been a solely rules-based 'if ... and ... then ...
else' sequence, then the juridical removal of racist input data would
arguably substantially change the outputs of the system. However, with
machine learning it would be a mistake to conclude that the removal of a
racist input will excise the racialised propositions of the model. The
streaming of visa applications into risk-rated clusters, as exhibited in
the JCWI case brought by Foxglove, is an example of a solution defining
and configuring the political problem, so that immigration targets are
the starting point. When the input data are not variables (in the
functionalist sense) but features, the UK Home Office can agree to
remove a racist input (as they have done) while continuing to weight
other features in ways that revitalise racist inferences that were not
strictly present in the input data. For example, the weighting and
parameters applied to travel, to familial relationships, or to periods
of time spent outside the UK can serve to constitute a suspicious
population and to generate a red-flagged output. When the model is
learning about salient features and clusters from the dataset, its
racialised assumptions will exceed the categories of the input data and
extend to the groupings and communities created by the machine learning
process. It is not only the use of data from which race can be inferred,
but more significantly that the immigration algorithm forecloses the
potential of a person's future on the basis of a racism that pervades
the model all the way down.42 In short, [the question of what kinds of
**political actions**]{.underline}, [which **political
claims**]{.underline}, [or which **policy agendas** can be designed and
made]{.underline}, [is **condensed down** to the foreclosure of a target
output solution]{.underline}.

When the design of a machine learning model becomes a valued political
object in itself, the derivative outputs of the model are exchangeable
and tradeable beyond any specific defined political problem or 'domain'.
43 In common with the models built by Cambridge Analytica,
[**everything** becomes a function of deep learning to the point that
there are **no bad outputs**]{.underline} -- [even where this may be
**illness**]{.underline}, **[racism]{.underline}**,
**[death]{.underline}**, **[destitution]{.underline}**, **[social
hardship]{.underline}**, **[child poverty]{.underline}** -- [there are
only **target outputs** and the **adjustable parameters** of a
problem]{.underline}. Amid the loss of more than 170,000 lives to
COVID-19, the UK launched its national data strategy in 2020, describing
the 'high watermark of data use set during the pandemic' where
businesses, government, and organisations had been 'freed up' to
'innovate and experiment'. 44

A period marked by lack of effective emergency planning and horrifying
loss of life is thus articulated as a 'high watermark of data use'. In
his testimony before the UK House of Commons Science and Technology
Select Committee, former advisor to the prime minister, Dominic
Cummings, explained that conventional civil contingencies 'did not have
the data architecture', and that 'companies \[DeepMind\] had stuff we
could use off the shelf, hack it together for the NHS.' 45 Behind the
rhetoric of his testimony, Cummings's account does express the deep
faith placed in deep learning models to address the data gaps in
bureaucratic structures. On the day that he appeared before MPs,
Cummings released a photograph of a whiteboard used to map early
pandemic planning. Among the scrawled notes, a question is posed: 'who
do we not save?'. Viewed from the perspective of the building of machine
learning models for the pandemic -- or the 'hacking together' by private
tech companies -- the question of who will not be saved is but a mere
parameter in a model, to be adjusted in relation to NHS capacity. In the
event, this parameter was also a deeply racialised metric -- with people
of black and South Asian ethnic background four times more likely to die
from COVID-19 in the UK.46 In common with the racialised logics of the
immigration algorithm, the pandemic models did not need to begin with
race as a category or input to nonetheless generate a deeply racialised
model of algorithmic violence. [The]{.underline} machine learning
[model]{.underline} itself [has **extraordinary resilience** in the face
of **complete moral** and **political failures** because a **weight can
always be adjusted**]{.underline}, [a **threshold modified**, a
**parameter tweaked**]{.underline}. The question of 'who do we not
save?' is translated into the parameter of a model whose target outputs
are the starting point. [In]{.underline} a situation where there is a
[**total** and **abject failure** of policy and good
governance]{.underline}, the [innovation]{.underline} in data science
and AI [is **nonetheless fostered** by the racialised violence and
social turbulence that is generated]{.underline}. Whether this is
incorrect or unjust decisions made in an algorithmic benefits system,
poor judgements on policing deployment, or the catastrophic pursuit of a
modelled 'herd immunity', [machine learning political orders **learn
something** from the data generated by the volatility]{.underline}.

A similar sense of the productivity of fractured governance is present
in the UNHCR's statements that 'even in highly volatile and chaotic
environments', digital systems will 'radically expand the responses that
can be crafted for challenges in health care, education, migration, and
security'. 47 The organisation envisages machine learning technologies
within a process of 'competitive disruption' to what it calls 'obsolete'
institutional structures 'with legacies dating back to World War II'.
The flexibility and agility of a deep learning model -- deployed, for
example, in UNHCR's 'Project Jetson' predictive models of refugee
movements -- becomes a condition of possibility for the imagination of
adaptive digital humanitarian and pandemic response, so that social and
political relations are reconfigured as the parameters of a model.48

In each of the examples I describe above, functionally arranged
structures of postwar social and international orders are reimagined
along the dimensions of a machine learning universal function. That is
to say, a function that is immanently mappable from a target output to
the weightings of the layers of the problem. [To propose that a
policy]{.underline} or an institution [must deliver on a
function]{.underline} thus also [**shifts** its ground]{.underline} --
[for something to]{.underline} '**[function]{.underline}**' [it **no
longer needs to work** as such]{.underline}.49 As Debbie Lisle has
argued, the cultures of science and engineering mobilise a politics
within which '**[failure]{.underline}**' [itself is rendered
an]{.underline} '**[instructive experience]{.underline}**'. 50 Within a
machine learning logic, the instructive experience of failure permits
the model to learn those unknown things that are beyond the distribution
of data in a training dataset. Though machine learning orders cannot be
said to fail as such -- or at least the output of the model is never a
failure but only a signal -- the retroactive generation of political
problem from output solution means that the very idea that a neural net
can approximate any function becomes a powerful political idea. In
short, though these ideas of failure are ontologically distinct, they
become epistemically aligned; [there is **slippage** between failure as
learning]{.underline}, [and the idea that there can be **no ethical
failure**]{.underline}, [nor **catastrophic policy
failure**]{.underline}.

[At stake]{.underline} in retroactive design, then, [is not merely
that]{.underline} deep learning [algorithms are deployed to **govern
society**]{.underline}, [but rather that society comes to **understand
itself** and its **problems** through the lens of the **deep learning
model**]{.underline}. The [relations among people]{.underline},
[objects]{.underline}, [and space become rendered as features from which
something useful **can always be extracted**]{.underline}, from which a
function can always be found. However, [the plurality and multiplicity
of those relations]{.underline}, [and the potentiality for new or
alternative political projects to emerge]{.underline}, [is **radically
foreclosed**]{.underline} around the retroactive mapping from target
output to the weighting of parameters in a model. It is to the
usefulness of exposure to contingency that I now turn, with a discussion
of how technological trials became perennial and indefinite.

Trial by design: How the test became an indefinite trial

The concept of alpha and beta testing has its origins in IBM's 1950s
software development, when the 'A' test signalled the in-house testing
to improve the engineering and the 'B' test referred to the verification
through user engagement and development. [In]{.underline} his account of
Cold War America and the culture and politics of computers, Paul Edwards
describes [the emergence of cybernetic culture and its penetration of
**state** and **military thinking**]{.underline}. In the context of
Edwards's 'closed world' integration of a 'seamless web' of human and
machine systems, the engineer deploys [the **testing**
regime]{.underline} in a form that mirrors the hierarchical logics of
computers.51 As an engineering practice of the twentieth century, the
test [formed an **intrinsic part** of the rules-based and cybernetic
approaches to government]{.underline} and computer science. As Edwards
depicts the Cold War collaborations of IBM, RAND, and the aircraft
corporations, [the **process of political planning itself** became
an]{.underline} '**[if]{.underline}** ... **[then]{.underline}**'
[proposition]{.underline}, 'constructing a list of tests to perform',
[identifying failings as **information problems**]{.underline}, [and
creating **feedback loops**]{.underline} from test to engineer.52 In
this sense, the Cold War alliances between computer science,
mathematics, and the military state embodied a specific understanding of
testing as practice, and of errors as problems of fallible human
perception that could be corrected with machine systems.53

This conception of testing and the sequential procedures of the 'list of
tests to perform' is aligned with the rules-based
[computation]{.underline} and rules-based social and international
political orders I have described. It [is a conception of]{.underline}
the test that is deeply probabilistic and conceives as [testing as a
process concerned with the **calculation of
probabilities**]{.underline}. As Orit Halpern describes the
cyberneticians' practices, 'they focused on the ability to calculate the
probability that one set of interactions (the missile hitting the plane)
will occur, over other sets less likely but possible'. '[This is a
worldview composed of]{.underline} functionally similar entities --
black boxes', she writes, composed only of 'their [algorithmic actions
in **constant conversation** with each other producing a range of
probabilistic scenarios]{.underline}'. 54

Against this historical backdrop of probabilistic alpha and beta testing
within functionally similar entities, the rise of deep learning
algorithms is most profoundly possibilistic in its orientation to the
future.55 As a mode of political ordering, machine learning circumvents
modern notions of testing in science and engineering by turning to the
trial and trialling as experimental technology. The trial is a more
possibilistic approach precisely because it refutes the functionally
similar entities and probabilities Halpern denotes in cybernetics, and
it embraces instead the generation of multiple possible functions in
order to defer a decision on what is politically useful. Understood in
this way, the rise of trialling in contemporary machine learning has
more in common with the conduct of stress testing to anticipate
uncertainty in finance than it does with alpha and beta testing in
software engineering.56 The machine learning model dwells indefinitely
in its trial phase because it is designed and redesigned through its
exposure to people, objects, places, and scenes, perennially modifying
itself in response to what it has learned through its encounters. In
this way, the 'demo' as technological demonstration, has a close
relationship with the 'demos' as the people, the population and
democracy.57 'Our forms of technological testing and demoing', writes
Halpern, 'envision a world where artificial intelligences and computers
can replace the democracy that is now imagined to be obsolescent'. 58
[As deep learning models penetrate public space]{.underline}, for
instance in live facial recognition biometric systems in urban spaces,
at borders, and in military spaces, [**every trial** of a deep learning
model is also an **active reconfiguration** of that space as the model
adapts in response to the contingencies it yields]{.underline}.59

For example, in the world's first legal challenge to police use of
automated facial recognition algorithms (AFR), the appellant, Bridges,
argued that South Wales Police unlawfully extracted his biometric data
during two trials of the technology.60 Bridges had been subject to AFR
during a protest outside an arms fair in Cardiff in 2018, and during a
Christmas shopping trip in 2017, with each trial of the system storing
his biometric data, cross-matching with a watchlist, generating match
scores, and modifying the sensitivity of the model. The court of appeal
found in Bridges favour in 2020, following testimony from an expert
computer scientist whose account vividly illustrates how the trial
indelibly marks and recalibrates a gendered and racialised system. 'AFR
systems will have a higher error rate for women and people from black
and ethnic minority groups', he testified, and 'where an end user is
adjusting threshold values it may make the AFR system particularly
sensitive for some individuals. People from that ethnic group will be
wrongly matched more often.' Thus, the trial of AFR -- ongoing for a
seemingly indefinite period from 2017 -- will continue to generate
racialised outputs and clusters of suspicion, even where individual
biometric datasets are deleted. As Rocco Bellanova and Marieke de Goede
describe architectures of data analysis, 'the infrastructure aims at
defining the "right population" to be algorithmically governed.' 61 The
very communities who are already disproportionately targeted by the
state will experience an intensification of scrutiny and control. In
this way, the capacity of a person to be present, or to gather with
others, in public space is iteratively and intimately related to the
exposures of a machine learning model that is indefinitely trialled
across multiple spaces. Unlike the feedback loops of Edwards's Cold War
military-computer science collaborations, the error rate of the
biometrics are contingent on the shifting infrastructural thresholds and
parameters of the algorithm. Whereas the cybernetic mode of testing was
concerned with the engineering of human and machinic component parts,
the machine learning mode of indefinite trials makes the limit and the
threshold the object of the trial, so that setting sensitivities, moving
borders and boundaries reconfigures both algorithm and action.

In this way, the orientation of the indefinite trial is closer to an
experimental and open-ended process of design than it is to engineering.
The very etymology of design is from the Latin designare, to designate,
to mark out, and related to disegnare, to contrive or intend. It is
precisely this process of designating and marking out that I see at work
in the indefinite trials of deep learning technologies in cities, at
borders, in public space. Bruno Latour outlines a philosophy of design
in which 'design has been extended from the details of daily objects to
cities, landscapes, nations, cultures, bodies, genes.' 62 For Latour,
the practice of design is counterposed to historical notions of building
or engineering, so that 'things are no longer "made" or "fabricated",
but rather designed.' 'This was the old way', he writes, 'to build, to
construct, to destroy, to radically overhaul' through engineering.63 By
contrast, to design something, for Latour, is never to found something
radically new but always to seek perennial iterative modification, so
that 'it is never a process that begins from scratch: to design is
always to redesign.' It is for this reason -- the practices of design as
open-ended iterative modification, even as 'anti-revolutionary' -- that
I align contemporary machine learning models with design and not
strictly with engineering.64

Indeed, many contemporary deep learning practices such as 'transfer
learning' definitively reject 'handcrafting representations', in favour
of 'greedy exploration'. 65 Every action is a modification of the
residue that is already lodged within the layers of the model, it is
never a complete overhaul or disruption. As Latour suggests, 'to say
everything has to be designed and redesigned, it will never be
revolutionary'. 66 This foreclosure of something different, something
revolutionary, is a crucial problem in machine learning political
epistemes. As I have described, even where the practice of trialling a
model is found to be in breach of law, or where racist data inputs are
removed, still nothing revolutionary can emerge. For design can always
modify and adjust and move the threshold, each adjustment another
indelible mark, a marking out and a demarcation line. When Latour
concludes that 'designing is the antidote to founding, colonizing
establishing', I must disagree with him, for it is precisely colonising
in ways that incorporate ever-increasing layers, extend to ever more
domains of life, and dwell quietly in the violences of the modified
weight. What new or alternative politics can possibly emerge when every
potential pathway has already been narrowed to a mere parameter? It is
to the implications and potentials for alternative political futures
that I now turn in conclusion.

Design interruptions: Resisting machine learning worlds

In setting the themes that animate this Special Issue on disruption,
Nicole Grove posed the question 'what kind of worlds are in store for us
as algorithms disrupt forms of organisation and advocacy for more
equitable futures?'. 67 I have sought to map out how machine learning
actively incorporates the data from disrupted and fractured forms of
organisation, and why it is that advocacy for alternative political
futures becomes foreclosed in the logics of retroactivity and perennial
trialling. I have suggested that a machine learning political episteme
-- one that eschews rulesbased computational and political orders -- is
profiting from the undoing of postwar international and social
institutions, from the deep neural networks powering the Vote Leave
campaign to the so-called 'digital transformation' of the pandemic NHS.
While, of course, I am not nostalgic for cybernetic worlds of
rules-based computation and the liberal international order,
nevertheless it is the case that notions of democratic life, human
rights, and social ethics also grew amid such rules oriented orders.
Where machine learning political orders are precisely profiting from the
undoing of rights and collective public institutions, there are new
challenges for the politics of resistance.

What happens to the space for resistance amid the power of the machine
learning algorithm? What are the possibilities for reopening the futures
that are condensed and foreclosed in the output of a deep neural
network? Where machine learning algorithms are increasingly learning
from the features of social scenes and the gathering of people in public
space, is collective politics reduced to a being together that is merely
the clustering of attributes? As Judith Butler has put the question,
'what does it mean to act together when the conditions for acting
together are devastated or falling away?'. 68 Such questions are more
urgent and acute because the threats to the rights to protest and
freedoms to assemble are intensified by a machine learning order that
absorbs the attributes of collective action. In her treatise on
political assembly, Butler imagines that the 'gathering signifies in
excess of what is said' and that 'popular assemblies form unexpectedly
and dissolve', exercising a 'plural and performative right to appear'.
69 Yet, this plural and performative excess of the gathering of
vulnerable bodies in public space is precisely under threat from the
retroactive and trialling logics of the machine learning polity.

When the machine learning algorithm becomes the mise-en-scène of the
public square, the means of arranging the scene and extracting the
features, what political claim can be heard that is not already
extracted and scored, and who can make it? [The **task for
resistance**]{.underline}, I suggest, [is to **interrupt the ordering**
of the political scene in order to ask how it **might be
otherwise**]{.underline}. My emphasis on interruption consciously
rejects the vocabularies of disruption that animate the force of
disruptive technologies and 'push on the fracture until it breaks' tech
industry cultures. [To interrupt the scene is to **resist its very
condition of appearance**]{.underline}, [to **locate the breaches** in
algorithmic arrangements and to show how they **could be
otherwise**]{.underline}. As Walter Benjamin notes of Bertolt Brecht's
device of 'interruption' in epic theatre, 'the truly important thing is
to discover the conditions of life', where this discovery 'takes place
through the interruption of happenings'. 70 [To interrupt the scene of a
machine learning political order would be to **confront the plural
branching pathways** that could have yielded a different output and to
**amplify** those branches as political decisions]{.underline}. [In
**every** arrangement of a machine learning model there are the
**traces** of the **rejected alternative**]{.underline}. Brecht's device
of [interruption presents]{.underline} the observer with [the traces of
what **could have been present**]{.underline}, with the actor performing
'[in such a way that the alternative emerges **as clearly as
possible**]{.underline}', [allowing]{.underline} '[**other
possibilities** to be inferred]{.underline}' [even while]{.underline}
she \[[they]{.underline}\] '[represent]{.underline}s [**one** out of the
possible variants]{.underline}'. 71 In this way, the
[interruption]{.underline} of the scene [**works against the grain** of
the algorithm's reduction to **one visible output**]{.underline},
showing the contingency and multiplicity of the one out of many possible
variants. [Here lies a **significant form** of resistance]{.underline};
[to **amplify** the branching points as moments where things **could
have been otherwise**]{.underline}, [where other possibilities **could
be inferred**]{.underline}; [and to **refuse the reduction** of
political difficulty to **one** that is the **output**]{.underline}.

[To resist being governed by a machine learning political order will
necessitate naming the harms]{.underline} -- [**beyond** the conventions
of]{.underline} privacy, data protection, and **[existing bodies of
rights]{.underline}** -- [of the foreclosure of alternative political
futures]{.underline}. Though the machine learning political orders I
have described close off political contestation and unheard claims,
under the figure of the machine learning model there remains a teeming
politics. [When the solution precedes the political
problem]{.underline}, [the adjustment of parameters is also a **real**
and **violent modification** of people's lives]{.underline} -- as
migrants, as benefit claimants, as people gathering in the city square.
It is for this reason that [the]{.underline} deep learning [practice of
modifying]{.underline} '**[weights]{.underline}**' [in the model **must
be rendered heavier** and **more burdensome** than the **lightness** of
an adjustment implies]{.underline}. [The weight in a machine learning
model is **not merely**]{.underline} a **[technical]{.underline}**
weight on a connection in the neural net. [It is the full burden and
heaviness of a **rejected visa application**]{.underline}, [a **past
facial biometric** captured at a protest]{.underline}, [a **refused
welfare claim**]{.underline}, [the extracted features of the
**refugee**]{.underline}. In her compelling account of how colonial
formations endure, Ann Laura Stoler foregrounds the 'enduring fissure'
and the 'durable mark' of imperial duress.72 Stoler's affecting thought
about 'duress' foregrounds the 'hardened, tenacious qualities of
colonial effects' and 'endurance' in the 'capacity to "hold out" and
"last", to endure as a countermand to "duress" and its damaging
qualities'. 73 The weight of the machine learning algorithm could be
freighted with the heaviness and endurance of Stoler's imperial duress.
[**Each adjustment** and **modification** of the model a **squeezing**
and a **tightening** of the conditions of liveability]{.underline} of a
political space, a community. Every indefinite trial a trial in the
fullest sense of something that is borne by vulnerable bodies.

### AT: Reflexivity/Skills

#### Their info reflexivity claims are a [smokescreen]{.underline} for algorithmic control. 

**Tazzioli, 21**---Lecturer in Politics and Technology, Goldsmiths
University of London (Martina, "Technologies of Control and
Infrastructures of Redistribution," e-flux #123, December 2021, dml)

A well-known slogan that emerged from the disability movement during the
1990s goes: "Nothing about us without us." It stresses that no policy
should be adopted without fully involving those who are affected by that
policy. Nowadays, it is a catchphrase used across different fields and
institutional settings, signaling that "[participation]{.underline}"
[has become a **placeholder** for **inclusion**]{.underline},
**[democracy]{.underline}**, [and **horizontal decision-making
processes**]{.underline}. Yet, [what does]{.underline}
"[participation]{.underline}" in a given system [mean when the
**epistemic-political codes**]{.underline}, the ability to maneuver, and
the stakes of the participation [are **set in advance** by the party in
control]{.underline}? So-called "participatory programs," like surveys
and other forms of data acquisition, have been used extensively by
humanitarian agencies since the 1990s, and more recently have shifted
into systems for practicing what I instead call "participatory
confinement." In such systems, [individuals are **nudged** and
**encouraged** to **actively participate** in their own confinement and
governmentality]{.underline}, "**[for their own good]{.underline}**."
Christopher Kelty, a scholar of science studies and anthropology,
rightly claims that [this]{.underline} sort of "participation [is more
often a **formatted procedure** by which autonomous individuals attempt
to reach **calculated consensus**]{.underline}." [Not only are the
**goals** and **forms** of participation often **preestablished** and
**surreptitiously imposed**]{.underline}, [but individuals are also **de
facto** pushed to **corroborate**]{.underline}, **[contribute
to]{.underline}**, [and **improve** mechanisms of **confinement** and
**coercion**]{.underline}. Here, I focus on refugee humanitarianism as a
case study for coming to grips with modes of participatory confinement
as a systematic political technology of governmentality.

Modes of participatory confinement in refugee humanitarianism are
inflected by clear-cut asymmetric relations between asylum seekers on
one side, and humanitarian actors on the other. This initial condition
and its trend towards reform by way of inviting participation is
reminiscent of the diagnosis of prison reform by Michel Foucault in a
lecture he gave in 1976. Furnishing an anticipatory example of
participatory confinement, he writes: "[There is an attempt to **make
prisoners themselves participate** in devising the very programmes for
their punishment]{.underline}, through the prisoners' councils and so
on. This is the idea that [the individual]{.underline}, [**singly** or
**collectively**]{.underline}, [is meant to **accept the punitive
procedure**]{.underline}." Nowadays, [participatory
approaches]{.underline} are center stage on the agendas of international
agencies and NGOs in the context of the so-called "refugee crisis" in
Europe. They [continue to operate with the **same neoliberal logics** of
prior reforms to systems of punishment and control that **performatively
invite** the exploited to **frame the forms** of that
exploitation]{.underline}, [while **actually ceding no
power**]{.underline} to the "participant."

Furthermore, invoking a term from Tiziana Terranova, participatory
confinement in refugee humanitarianism can also be considered a form of
"soft control." Asylum seekers are increasingly asked to answer
questionnaires and provide detailed information to humanitarian actors
about their coping strategies, migratory journeys, the logistics of
border crossing, and their protection needs. These activities are
presented to refugees as an opportunity to improve their individual
situation and, at the same time, the asylum system at large; in
actuality, they just increase the control that the system has over
refugees. In The Undercommons, Fred Moten and Stephano Harney refer to a
similar process as [the]{.underline} "**[invitation to
governmentality]{.underline}**" [which subjects are **repeatedly
exposed** to]{.underline}. Elaborating on this notion, it can be argued
that this "invitation" in the context of humanitarian participatory
programs also [involves pushing subjects to **perform unpaid labor** by
**providing feedback**]{.underline}. [They thus **implicitly consent**
to being sites for the **extraction of knowledge**]{.underline}, which
is [used]{.underline} by NGOs [to **further enforce** modes of control
and governance]{.underline}. Speaking of [an invitation to
governmentality]{.underline} in these terms also [sheds light on the
multiple forms of **interpellation** that individuals are subject
to]{.underline}, [and how they are nudged to participate]{.underline}
"**[for their own good]{.underline}**." That is, [the invitation to
governmentality that individuals are exposed to in different contexts
often turns into]{.underline} a form of **[subtle
coercion]{.underline}**.

**Schneider, 22**---assistant professor of media studies at the
University of Colorado Boulder (Nathan, "Governable Stacks against
Digital Colonialism," tripleC 20 (1): 19-36, 2022, dml)

[Theorists and practitioners of anticolonial resistance have
**persistently stressed** the centrality of **self-governance** in
everyday life as both the **means** and the **end** of their
movements]{.underline}, [**alongside** acts of outright
insurrection]{.underline}. [By self-governance I mean]{.underline} to
evoke other terms like autonomy, autogestión, autogestió, community
control, self-determination, self-management, self-organising,
self-rule, sovereignty, swaraj, and more -- together encompassing [how
groups of people become **impervious** and **intolerable** to those who
want to govern them by governing themselves]{.underline}. [The
aspiration to be]{.underline} "**[ungovernable]{.underline}**" [has
appeared]{.underline} among thinkers ranging from the philosophers
Michel Foucault and Giorgio Agamben (Thaning, Gudmand-Høyer and Raffnsøe
2016) to former Black Panther Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin (Anderson 2020),
each seeking to assert the vital personhood of people caught in
dehumanising systems. Such systems utilise "governmentality" to extend
their power into subjects' lives (Li 2007). Scholars of governance tend
to regard it as something done to -- or at best, for -- most people,
rather than something they do themselves (Levi-Faur 2012).
[Self-governance against colonialism is]{.underline} something else,
[something people do to govern **while becoming
ungovernable**]{.underline}.

To become ungovernable under digital colonialism, how should we be
learning to self-govern?

I pose this question while observing that the platforms most available
for online organising are not well-suited for self-governing; tools for
basic group decision-making are not widespread, and nor are mechanisms
to hold those in authority accountable (Schneider 2021). The design of
social platforms inclines toward enabling the governmentality of
platform owners, aided by their user-administrator proxies, rather than
user governance that could turn against the owners' interests. Campaigns
of digital resistance often employ the same colonial firms they oppose.
[Those confronting digital colonialism today might]{.underline}
therefore [**orient** their struggles]{.underline}, [as **past
anticolonial movements** have]{.underline}, [by **rediscovering** and
**reinventing** the art of self-governance]{.underline}.

[Settler colonialism and digital]{.underline} "[user
experience]{.underline}" [both involve]{.underline} what legal scholar
Sanjukta Paul (2020) calls [the]{.underline} "**[allocation of
coordination rights]{.underline}**". [Regimes dictate who has the right
to **self-organise**]{.underline}, or not, [and under what
conditions]{.underline}. Micro-targeted discrimination singles out
individuals for exposure to exploitative advertising, stifling public
outcry (Benjamin 2019). [Algorithmic decisions]{.underline} about
public-service provision [make it harder for harmed communities to put
**collective pressure** on individual decision makers]{.underline}
(Eubanks 2018). Humanitarian organisations collect data about refugees,
which the refugees themselves cannot access while the organisations use
it for future fundraising (Madianou 2019). Individual users might have
options on a platform to access or delete their own personal data, yet
platform companies alone can develop products from the users' data in
the aggregate (Couldry and Mejias 2019a). Platforms impose the
developers' cultural norms, projecting a false universality that leaves
little space for user communities to practice their own cultures (Kwet
2019; Milan and Treré 2019; Duarte et al. 2019). And at least [as much
as platforms might enable **activist organising**]{.underline}, [they
introduce new varieties of **surveillance** and
**repression**]{.underline} (Tufekci 2017; Canella 2018).

"[Governance is **what we are fighting for**]{.underline}",
[writes]{.underline} Black Lives Matter co-founder Alica
**[Garza]{.underline}** (2020, 273). "[We are fighting for the right to
make decisions for our own lives and to ensure that right for
others]{.underline}". [Her movement's protests have made **whole
sections of cities** ungovernable through daring]{.underline},
[fraught]{.underline}, [fleeting attempts to implement alternatives to
policing]{.underline}. [Progress goes **slowly**]{.underline}, [with
**setbacks** and **blowback**]{.underline}, [until **seemingly all at
once** even those in power **no longer have any choice** but to build on
the fragile experiments from the streets]{.underline}.

What would [community-governed technologies]{.underline} look like, and
how [can]{.underline} they **[resist exploitation]{.underline}**? I
introduce the concept of "governable stacks" as a means of ungovernable
organising under digital colonialism. From here, this article reviews
how anti-colonial leaders and thinkers have thought about
self-governance. It then turns to the perils of recent failures among
resistance movements to self-govern under digital colonialism. The
following two sections present governable stacks in detail as a concept
and as a practice.

2\. The Trouble of Governance

"[Governance is the extension of whiteness on a global
scale]{.underline}", [write]{.underline} Stefano [**Harney**
and]{.underline} Fred **[Moten]{.underline}** (2013, 56). NGOs are the
"laboratories" of governance, which turns democracy into labour. It is a
cheap sort of domination because the subjects do it to themselves:
"Governance arrives to manage self-management, not from above, but from
below" (55). [Harney and Moten reply with a politics of
**refusal**]{.underline} and "being without interests", a call to
imagine what it would mean "[to struggle **against
governance**]{.underline}" (57): "We are [the **general antagonism** to
politics looming outside]{.underline} every attempt to politicise,
**[every imposition of self-governance]{.underline}**" (20).

Harney and Moten's polemic can claim many ancestors. They cite Frantz
Fanon, who stressed the "spontaneity" of popular uprisings, the
ungovernable reaction of the lumpen-proletariat, "the most spontaneous
and the most radically revolutionary forces of a colonized people"
(Fanon 1961/1963, 81). They celebrate the ungovernable villages of
escaped slaves in the Americas, including the maroons of
Saint-Domingue's high hills, whose raids did not wait for Touissant
Louverture's command but made possible the eventual independence of
Haiti (Lebrón Ortiz 2020).

"You know, I love C.L.R. James", says Moten in passing (Harney and Moten
2013, 155). James, the Trinidadian chronicler of Louverture's revolution
and an instigator of others from Tanzania to Detroit, praised
spontaneity as well. His book with Grace Lee Boggs and Pierre Chaulieu,
Facing Reality, describes a "most conscious and finished opposition to
the parliamentary procedure" found among dockworkers. By their account,
"dockers do not like votes"; "they sense the general sentiment and act
on that" (James, Lee and Chaulieu 1958/1974, 121-122). What holds sway
is a worker's je ne sais quoi ability to capture the attention of the
others, regardless of role or position: decision without institution.

[The age of networks has only **deepened the allure** of spontaneity
among radical theorists]{.underline}, [as with]{.underline} Michael
[**Hardt** and]{.underline} Antonio **[Negri's]{.underline}** admiration
for the "**[multitude]{.underline}**" [and]{.underline} the
"**[assembly]{.underline}**" against fixed organisational forms (2017),
or Manuel Castells's (2015) "networks of outrage and hope". [Underground
tracts]{.underline} from [such]{.underline} pseudonymous figures [as the
**Invisible Committee**]{.underline} (2009) and the Vitalist
International (2019) [long for **rebellions** whose disorder is their
vindication]{.underline}, while adrienne maree brown (2017) presents
spontaneous self-organisation in nature as a theory of social change.
[Each seems to profess that organisational forms of revolutions past
**no longer compute**]{.underline} -- [in part because we now have
computers]{.underline}.

An antithesis: over a century ago, Vladimir Lenin (1902/1961) regarded
those "who kneel in prayer to spontaneity" as a "fungus" among
revolutionaries. Where there is spontaneity among the masses, it obtains
power only through an organised and disciplined vanguard party, such as
the one he would lead in Russia. Rosa Luxemburg (1904) recoiled at the
rigidity of Lenin's vanguard, one moulded by the discipline of the
factory, the army, and the bureaucracy. She called for a movement that
would be "supple as well as firm", capacious enough to hold the full
humanity of its participants. Yet a communist regime came to pass in
Germany not through her homegrown movement but through Soviet tanks
rolling into Berlin. Those tanks emanated from Stalin's dictatorship;
Luxemburg was right to worry about a vanguard modelled on industrial
discipline. What she longed for remains so often elusive: a movement
firm enough to gain power yet supple enough to wield it humanely.

Now, stop and go back, and reconsider those apparently kneeling before
spontaneous resistance, against the strictures of governance. Synthesise
the dialectic. **[Fanon]{.underline}** also [warned against
the]{.underline} "**[cult]{.underline}**" [of spontaneity]{.underline}
(1961/1963, 130) [and stressed that the]{.underline} "enlightening of
[consciousness]{.underline}" [necessary for liberation is]{.underline}
"[**only possible** within the **framework** of an
organisation]{.underline}, [and inside]{.underline} the
**[structure]{.underline}** of a people" (142). He held that
[spontaneous energies must find **institutional cohesion**]{.underline}.
[**C.L.R. James** affirmed]{.underline}, in his final interview, "I
believe [you **must** have an **organisation**]{.underline}"
(Fitzpatrick 1989) in the Leninist sense. He celebrated the Paris
Commune as a forerunner of the Russian soviets, regarding that uprising
as "first and foremost a democracy" (Johnson 1946). And in "Every Cook
Can Govern", an essay that took its title from a phrase of Lenin's,
James recommends to workers the ancient Athenian method of ruling by
sortition, selecting authorities from the citizenry by lot. [The
anticolonial organisation]{.underline}, in this light, [must be creative
and accountable]{.underline}, [reaching into the lives of those who are
self-governing and also outward as a model to others]{.underline}. As
Adom Getachew (2019) documents, the independence movements James helped
to inspire sought not just nation states but a new order of global
governance.

Grace Lee Boggs was long a fellow traveller with James in the factions
and divisions of sectarian Marxism, a student and friend of Third World
revolutionaries (Boggs and Boggs 1974; Boggs 1998/2016). She and James
Boggs thought their way into a "politics of personal development" (King
2017) that rejected partisan orthodoxies in favour of a more iterative
"dialectical humanism", in which political visions and the people who
hold them evolve together through struggle. From the systems thinker
Margaret J. Wheatley came Boggs's frequent affirmation of "critical
connections" over "critical mass" (Boggs and Kurashige 2012, 50) -- a
conviction that the germ of seismic change lies in the thick
relationality of how people choose to self-organise day to day. She
drifted from Leninism, but the imperative of self-governance only
deepened.

Later in life, Boggs's attention turned from achieving state communism
to commoning, the work of people continually discovering what they are
seeking to achieve by stewarding shared projects and resources. She
became a mentor to veterans of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street and its
"leaderless" travails. After her passing, Rodrigo Nunes (2021,
Chapter 1) in Brazil envisions post-2011 movement organisation with
naturalistic language like "nebula" and "ecology". He confesses
attempting to recuperate a kind of vanguardism, a "networked Leninism"
-- before concluding with an insistence that above all activists should
"think and act ecologically" (Conclusion).

In Boggs we see the origins of passages about mycelia and butterflies
and trees in the writing of her disciple adrienne maree brown (2017).
brown's "emergent strategy" for activists revels not in conflict with
corporate opponents but in apparitions of friendship in online threads
and tips for weaving consensus processes. Seeking to transcend "protest
politics", Boggs described her mentorship of younger organisers as

projecting and initiating struggles that involve people at the
grassroots in assuming the responsibility for creating new values,
truths, infrastructures, and institutions that are necessary to build
and govern a new society (Boggs and Kurashige 2012, 68).

Fred [Moten]{.underline} acknowledges the Boggses' influence as an
example of unpayable debts (Harney and Moten 2013, 153). What he [and
Harney offer in place of governance]{.underline} is
"**[study]{.underline}**", a term of art that is also resolutely plain,
in reference to [the learning and planning that takes place among groups
of people in spaces that are ungovernable by reigning
institutions]{.underline}. [Like the **maroons of Saint-Domingue** or
the **American South**]{.underline}, [study **surely involves an order
of its own**]{.underline}, [apart from the colonial
university]{.underline}, [a practice of insurgent
self-rule]{.underline}. The maroons of study, for Harney and Moten, are
never-settled communities of criminal exodus. [But their maroons
undertake]{.underline} "**[fugitive planning]{.underline}**". [They
study to plan]{.underline}, [they plan so they can find the space and
time to study]{.underline}. [To do **either**]{.underline}, [and
therefore **both**]{.underline}, [there **must be something** of the
self-governance Harney and Moten **seem to disavow**]{.underline}.

[These anticolonial thinkers see the trouble with governance in the
sense of **governmentality**]{.underline}, [a **back-door aid to
domination**]{.underline}. And [yet they also assert the **otherwise
troublesome** kind of self-governing]{.underline}, [the kind that is
**ungovernable** and **opaque** and **maroon** from the vantage point of
the imperial capitals]{.underline} -- and, now, of the colonial
platforms. The next section recalls how platforms have enabled their
users to feel ungovernable and powerful for a time. But without the
means of self-governing, those sensations have been fleeting.

3\. Virality as a Colonising Strategy

I once entered the office of a labour organiser to find her there, head
in her hands. She was running a campaign in the ever-shifting,
just-in-time, atomised theatre of urban retail. Why so down? The workers
were migrating to Instagram. At least on Facebook, you could corral them
into groups, you could post updates. On Instagram, every message had to
be hilarious or enraging or gorgeous if you wanted it to reach them.
Sometimes the information an organiser needs to share is not any of
those. But isn't it still important?

Without persistent groups or organisations, Instagram's eminent form of
shared experience is the viral image, which circulates an affective
impression of shared experience. To spread, the image must be the kind
of image that would spread, according to the tastes of the poster's
followers and the secret churning of the platform's engineering. An
announcement for next week's union meeting may not qualify. An organiser
trying to strengthen workers' bonds isn't interested in infecting them
like a virus.

The rise of ubiquitous social media rode on waves of protest, from the
Battle of Seattle to the Arab Spring. Individual voices, linked with
hashtags, seemed to herald collective liberation (Papacharissi 2015).
And yet, despite the outpourings of promise and hope and near-term
victories, those digitally mediated uprisings have fallen under the
police of Mohamed Morsi and the bombs of Bashar al-Assad, the famines of
the Yemeni civil war and the warlords of Libya. 'Pirate' political
parties arising out of online protest have tended to collapse upon their
first encounter with power, if they ever get there.

At the Occupy Wall Street encampment in 2011, reporters would arrive and
be transfixed by the media centre -- the nerve centre, the centre of
power because it was media (Schneider 2013, 36). And media was powerful
indeed, as it drew thousands upon thousands of people into what began as
a small, precarious protest. Videos of police attacking activists, in
particular, bred sympathy and participants, and a feeling that the
movement might be on the brink of sparking some kind of revolution. At
least at first. By the following year, the videos didn't work the same
way. As an activist monitoring the analytics data noticed at the time,
"Riot porn is losing its luster for mass online consumption" (Schneider
2012). As the social-media attention waned, so did the movement's
confidence.

The likes of Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, and Xi Jinping discovered how
to outlast digital insurgencies, obscuring outbreaks of dissent under a
deluge of obfuscation. Spontaneity is a commodity online, and empires
can produce it for themselves.

Experience with multitudinous networks has led their early enthusiasts
to call for more self-ordering. Hardt and Negri (2017) clarify their
embrace of leaderless movements by stressing the need for "the
institutionalization of free and democratic forms of life", organised
enough to be "able to take hold of the common" (xx). To Zeynep Tufekci
(2017), the networked "signal" of movements can be self-defeating
without organisational "capacity".

[The **classic strategy** of imperial domination]{.underline} -- divide
et impera, divide and conquer -- [proposes to dominate by training
subjects to feel an **illusion of power** through their conflicts with
one another]{.underline}. On colonial platforms, too, [users direct
their energy **for** and **against** each other]{.underline}, [gaining
**influence** and **affirmation** through their **jousts**
and]{.underline}, [in so doing]{.underline}, [identifying themselves
**ever more deeply** with the **non-transferable reputation** they
obtain]{.underline} on the platforms. [Virality is **fleeting** if it
ever happens]{.underline}, [but the **possibility** is
there]{.underline}, [so we pursue it]{.underline}. Before long we have
recapitulated the final scene of the 1954 McCarthyist blockbuster On the
Waterfront, in which the dockworkers flee from their union's problems
into the arms of the boss, newly able to experience their collective
exploitation as individual liberation.

Stacktivism," tripleC 18 (2): 716-724, 2020, dml) \[emojis in original
article...\]

[We can]{.underline} also [read The Stack as a **pedagogical
framework**]{.underline} within the Bauhaus tradition as a proposal [for
a **general design principle**]{.underline}, as John Thackara has
recently done, updating the Bauhaus foundation course for the age of
global warming\[12\]. [As an **abstract model**]{.underline} describing
the architecture of the Internet, [the stack provides us with a **useful
spatial division** of layers]{.underline} such as protocols, data,
applications and user interfaces. Bratton's notion of The Stack comes
out of the US postmodern literary tradition of cognitive mapping
(Jameson), which seeks to make intelligible (and containable) complex
processes. Bratton combines this approach with decades long attempts to
visualise the vertical integration of technologies drawn in 2D, with
maps of networks that strive to capture relations between the different
players. His aim is [to produce a **general network theory** able to
provide **deeper insights** in the dynamics of power]{.underline}:
blowing up 2D tech engineering plans to a 3D dimension able to modulate
planetary transformation.

Benjamin Bratton also invites us to think tech in relation to
geo-politics and location. At the same time [The Stack can be seen as
**method**]{.underline}, [a **mechanism**]{.underline}. However, the
book is [**consciously vague** about how material infrastructure and
ideology **relate**]{.underline}. In the light of Trump, Putin and Xi
Jinping, Bratton's global engineer seems a tragic, retrograde figure. At
best The Stack works well as a multi-disciplinary guideline of past
globalist techno-social practices that, ironically, have become outdated
since 2016, the year of its publication and the year of Brexit and
Trump. For all its ambition to delineate the geo-political contours of
techno-operations supposedly occurring on a planetary scale, the book
settles with an oddly depoliticised aesthetic imaginary.

[How can we **free up** The Stack from its current confinements and turn
into an **improvised dance**?]{.underline} [Let's define a
**stacktivism**]{.underline}, [an **active** and **reflective reading**
of stacks-on-the-move, that is **not afraid** of the
subject]{.underline} (formerly known as user) [and involves
action]{.underline}, [committed by **confused**]{.underline},
**[selfish]{.underline}**, **[messy players]{.underline}**. With this [I
mean grassroots interventions that **do not take the
current**]{.underline} (Internet or IT infrastructure) [**stack as a
given** and **turn the Will to Totality**]{.underline} of the
engineering class and their financial backers **[against
itself]{.underline}**. In comparison with the hacktivism and (tactical)
media activism, [stacktivism]{.underline} is indeed Hegelian in scope
(Understanding Totality). It is confronting "das Ganze" and can be
considered counter regressive as it takes into account the real-existing
totality of today's interrelated tech-architectures as opposed to the
shrinking paranoid world of the online self that is in constant danger
of collapse under the weight of its own self-image, surveillance,
precarity and depression.

Niels ten Oever, Amsterdam-based Internet governance researcher and
activist [emphasises the importance of **linking contexts** and
**levels**]{.underline}:

"The stack never was and never will be. The stack always was an
abstraction, a story that was told to keep people working in an isolated
manner, ensuring engineers stuck to their own layer. As long as you
worked within your own parameters and delivered what the layer above and
below you expected of you, you would not get into trouble.
[Stacktivism]{.underline}, on the other hand, [works **across** the
stack]{.underline}: [it is a **cross-stack collaboration**]{.underline},
[an attempt to **realign** and **redesign** the interfaces]{.underline}.
[Looking for interconnections and associations that **cannot be drawn
from above**]{.underline}, [that **defy standardization**]{.underline}.
Interconnections that escape abstractions and stereotypes. [They are
established through **dynamic** and **unpredictable
handshakes**]{.underline}: questions, answers, and
re(-)cognition"\[13\].

Stacktivism is ambivalent and struggles with totality, the global scale
and the planetary whatever. [Think **big**]{.underline}, [but act in
**small steps**]{.underline}, that's the motto. We Are Infrastructure.
Stacktivism fights against the comfort of ignorance and tries hard to
overcome the designed lure to drift off, hovering above it all in a
subconscious fashion. While defining what stackitivism could become, it
is good to keep mind that [we're free to use]{.underline} Bratton's [The
Stack as a **theory toolbox** and not interpret it as a **hermetic
belief system**]{.underline}. [Designs can **intermingle**]{.underline}.
In line with Bratton, [stackivism claims to **understand** and **oversee
all levels**]{.underline}, from the politics of code, algorithms and AI
to the behavioural science manipulation of moods, interface design
choices and is alert to 5G electronic smog, phishing emails, fake news
and the other sleazy suggestions of your "friends". How about your bot
sensibility? [This hyperawareness comes at a **high
price**]{.underline}. **[Not everyone is a stacktivist ☹]{.underline}**

[Traditionally]{.underline}, [**direct action** has been put in
**opposition** to the **talk fest**]{.underline}. [When we
**act**]{.underline}, [we **stop talking** and **start
doing**]{.underline}. In the context of hacktivism this means that we no
longer consume but start to code in order to be able to hack into
computer systems [in order to make **real**]{.underline}, [**tangible
changes** in society]{.underline}. [Like **Robin Hood**]{.underline},
[let's define what **stackivism-for-good** could look like]{.underline}.
[How do we build **rhizomatic links** between global
governance]{.underline}, [protocol design]{.underline}, [the
ethics-without-consequences industry]{.underline}, [code writing and
investigative hacking?]{.underline} [Who will be in charge of
**subversive foresight**?]{.underline} [Can we **dream aloud
together**?]{.underline} How can delegate trust to our think tanks that
work in the public interest?

Stacktivism is a sovereign attitude in that it is not begging for a
correct form of representation and could be considered post-democratic
and post-identity, yet remains always all-too-human. Inside Douglas
Rushkoff's Team Human [stacktivists take up the task of **creating
missing links**]{.underline}: [they are the]{.underline} meme sharers,
**[idea connectors]{.underline}**, intercultural fellow travellers,
**[poly-disciplinary networkers]{.underline}**. The social creation of
new protocols remains an act of common decision. We are fighting at the
conceptual forefront of tech. Nobody needs to give us permission. Unlike
the tactical media interventions of the 1990s, stacktivism is -- by
definition-- abstract and conceptual in nature, knowing that code is
power and power is code. How to dismantle invisible power? Do we fight
abstractions with abstractions, design with counter-designs?

According to Internet and civil society researcher Corinne Cath [we
could see stacktivism as a]{.underline} "[**playful human evolution**
of]{.underline} Bratton's concept of [The Stack]{.underline}. [It
**critiques** its modular conception of world into **discrete
layers**]{.underline}. [To **remedy** this flattening]{.underline}, [it
calls for the inclusion of the **inherent messiness** of the
Internet]{.underline}: the entangled basement wires, packets lost in
translation, rugged governance cultures and the idiosyncratic usages of
the humans who rely on it to function flawlessly"\[14\]. Francesca
Musiani (CNRS, Paris) found the lessons of decentralisation telling:

"[Decentralization often becomes]{.underline} a technical, political,
economic and social aim in and of itself, reaching outside the 'hacker'
circles of the early p2p systems. However, this has had side effects.
Decentralization has become [an objective **in** and **of
itself**]{.underline}, [with **little understanding of intent** or
**assessment of actual effects**]{.underline}. I love Phil Agre\'s 2003
observation in this respect when he said: '[Architecture is
politics]{.underline}, [but should not be understood as a **substitute**
for politics]{.underline}'. [Decentralized protocols are **too readily
assumed**]{.underline}, because of their technical qualities, [to bring
about **decentralized**]{.underline} political, social and economic
**[outcomes]{.underline}**. [A **more fine-tuned appreciation** of the
social dimensions of the stack is likely to improve things]{.underline}
in this regard"\[15\].

Media historicism (aka archaeology) has so far failed to develop
critical concepts to understand the current situation, also known as
platform capitalism. There is more to the Internet than the politics of
the senses. Notation systems and perception are so 20th century. [What
matters now is]{.underline} who owns the Internet in terms of data
centres, cables and PR; and this is [**first** and **foremost** a
question of **material analysis**]{.underline}. A comparison with the
Roman road system, as described in Innis's Empire and Communications is
more relevant here\[16\]. Let's, for instance, investigate the relation
between the modernist stack and the fuzzy post-modern cloud buzzword.

How does Bratton's design relate to recent proposals by stacktivists
Francesca Bria and Evgeny Morozov for a European move towards "data
sovereignty"? It's too easy to unmask Bratton as a Californian
techno-solutionist. How much is gained by planting this (now effectively
empty) label on him? To determine, [to think technologically remains an
**utmost urgency** and it is precisely the]{.underline}
"**[stacking]{.underline}**" [of issues]{.underline}, [factors and
contexts that will **bring us further** into the constitutive force of
technical systems]{.underline}. **[The spectacle of clashing characters
should not distract us]{.underline}** (in fact, [the **silo
phantom**]{.underline}, [the silence and separation is]{.underline},
oddly, [our **main problem**]{.underline}, [in this hyperconnected
world]{.underline}).

### AT: Academy Bad

#### The aff's [cooperative re-imagination]{.underline} of communication and value can [redefine the subjectivity of society]{.underline}. The academy is key---if we win a link, it proves that we've identified a [crack in the system]{.underline} from which new relationalities can emerge.

**Hall, 20**---Professor of Education and Technology, De Montfort
University (Richard, "Platform Discontent against the University," *The
digital age and its discontents: Critical reflections in education*,
Chapter 7, 130-132, dml)

[The proletarianization of the University is predicated
upon]{.underline} atomized competition, which utilizes new forces of
production to reshape relations between people, in order to extract
value. A critical element of this is **[enforced
separation]{.underline}** between individuals, and the ability for
individual agency to be repurposed by structural requirements.
[However]{.underline}, in order [to extract maximum value]{.underline},
[capital requires individuals]{.underline} to work in concert, or [to
**collaborate**]{.underline} as producers, distributors and consumers.
[This gives opportunities for **cooperative
re-imagination**]{.underline}. For Marx (1866), the cooperative movement
was a transformational force where it understood its relationship to
labour as the point of social production. Thus, he argued that producer
cooperatives, as opposed to consumer cooperatives, are a manifestation
of class antagonism that can point towards 'the republican and
beneficent system of the association of free and equal producers'
(ibid., emphasis in the original). This analysis of cooperation rests on
forms of self-mediation by human beings of their material activities in
society. In an idealized cooperative state, [activities are **no longer
piecemeal** or **solitary**]{.underline}, [or governed by
capital]{.underline}; rather, [they are governed by **alternative
networks** of solidarity and purpose]{.underline}: 'This is not possible
without the community. Only within the community has each individual the
means of cultivating his gifts in all directions; hence personal freedom
becomes possible only within the community' (Marx & Engels 1998: 86).

A focus on the communal and associational characteristics of cooperation
is critical to Marx's praxis, because in them he sees the individual
developing the capabilities of their species (Marx 2004). As a result,
[a **refocusing** upon cooperative values and principles]{.underline},
grounded in the conceptual framework of the self-in-association, [acts
as a moment of **refusal** of alienated socialization]{.underline}, in
which the producers of society are estranged from both the means and
conditions of production of that society. However, discontent at the
present state of things does not coalesce into a single,
counter-hegemonic position, predicated upon a unified collection of
alternative governing principles for life. [It]{.underline} therefore
[becomes **important** to think about **alternative forms** of knowledge
production and an integration with alternative conceptions of
**mutuality**]{.underline}, [**solidarity** and
**cooperation**]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} those emerging [from
indigenous or marginalized communities]{.underline}.

Indigenous methodologies or modes of being help both to develop a fresh
focus on knowledge and to reframe the idea of movement towards a more
humane social production as a liminal process, engaging the body,
emotions and cognition (Tuhiwai Smith, Tuck & Yang 2018). In this
sensuous, epistemic opening, knowledge is rooted in people, place,
philosophy, values, communities, axiologies and cosmologies, which
generate 'relational accountability' (Wilson 2008: 77). Such
accountability is mutual, respectful and dignified, and acts as a
beginning for refusing the domination of knowledge from the global North
imposed as progressive and rooted in an ideological, evidence-based
epistemological standard. Here, [cooperative techniques for social
reproduction might enable forms of **relational
accountability**]{.underline} between peoples and places. Moreover, in
this process, [they offer the possibility of **liberating material
forces**]{.underline}, [including technology]{.underline}, [and
connecting them to alternative conceptions of the world]{.underline}, in
order [to **widen autonomy** and **freedom**]{.underline}.

For Marx (1866; 1970) [a cooperative revolution in the governance of
technology forms a **crucial strand** in changing the general conditions
of social production]{.underline}, [because it **redefines the
subjectivity of society** towards humanity and **away** from the
commodity and the valorization of capital]{.underline}. If we are to do
this, then [a **shared**]{.underline}, [**associational expression** of
individual lives is **required**]{.underline}, in order [to realize the
**essence** of what it means to be human]{.underline}. Marx's idea was
that [the expression of my life and those of my peers are **immanent**
to each other]{.underline}, [and should be mediated **directly** rather
than through the **market**]{.underline}, private property, the division
of labour and commodity exchange. [This requires an **alternative
conception** of how to integrate the forces of production into our
communal being]{.underline}, [and a **liberatory conception** of how
those forces are **subordinate** to our essence and our social
relations]{.underline} (Bookchin 2005). Beautifully, Marx (1844) argues
that [through such practices]{.underline} '[our products would be like
**so many mirrors**]{.underline}, [out of which our essence
**shone**]{.underline}' [as a]{.underline} '**[free
expression]{.underline}**' [of our lives]{.underline}.

[At issue is how to find **cracks** in the system of
capital]{.underline}, [into which technologies for
**alternative**]{.underline}, [**liberatory conceptions** of society can
be **inserted**]{.underline}. Dunayevskaya (1958) has argued that these
need to be situated inside organizations that are beyond
value-production, or they risk degenerating under competition. As a
result, a re-imagination of the University has to engage with more than
the cooperative possibilities of the collective ecosystems currently
structured to reproduce value. [A re-imagination of the potential for
forces of production to **enable social connection** and **knowledge
sharing**]{.underline}, and to liberate time for autonomous activity
rather than the imposition of commodity production, comes up against
structural contradictions. Thus, a re-imagination of technology as a
means for liberating knowledge for a new society [demands]{.underline} a
new material literacy as [a **radical**]{.underline}, **[pedagogical
project]{.underline}** at the level of society.

This is a transitional project [that critiques the place of technology
as it is **currently instantiated** inside the University]{.underline}.
[It critiques the relationship of the digital University]{.underline},
[and its techniques of governance]{.underline}, to knowledge production
and the generation of social wealth. It also critiques these
relationships and techniques [in terms of their ability to **enable
humanity** to engage with **global economic** and **environmental
crises**]{.underline}. [It critiques the **limitations** in our
collective ability to **produce knowledge** inside the University to
engage with these crises]{.underline}, in part [through the separation
of **polity** and **economy**]{.underline}, [such that the latter
**dominates** the former]{.underline}. It critiques these limitations as
they are reproduced inside organizations conditioned by the State to
generate value through exploitation and expropriation. In this way, [it
moves **beyond** the fetishization of technologies and
techniques]{.underline}, including the ways in which these are
reproduced and enclosed inside institutions like universities (see
Ampuja, Chapter 2, in this volume). [The potential for relational
accountability and]{.underline} the [recomposition]{.underline} of
peoples, places and technologies [offer an **alternative set of
possibilities** for intellectual work beyond the capitalized
University]{.underline}.

the concept of "knowing (at) the [limits]{.mark} of justice," a practice
that "unsettles what has become but [offer]{.mark}s [no guidance for

**[If]{.underline}** the [predominant fantasies of systemic social

techno-utopics of a world in which all of those who are already human
and already subjects ascend into the realm of those whose lives are

technologies to possible fields of political protest or

### AT: Afropessimism

#### The digitization of the carceral state [disproves]{.underline} the historical continuity of anti-Black oppression---it takes [different forms]{.underline}.

**Jefferson, 20**---associate professor of geography and geographic
information science and O'Connell Scholar in the College of Liberal Arts
and Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Brian,
"Introduction: NextGen Nightmare," *Digitize and Punish: Racial
Criminalization in the Digital Age*, Introduction, pg 13-16, dml)

A point of emphasis in the book is that [carceral power is **silently
spreading** through infrastructures]{.underline} of cellular towers,
datacenters, fiber-optic cables, smart sensors, and video cameras.
Carceral functionality is becoming a key attribute of the smart city.
This is not meant to say that the prison-industrial complex is being
wholly supplanted or that it is bound to disintegrate. Even though
incarceration rates have reached their lowest points in decades, [the
history of carceral management is **not** one of a **linear
development**. **Nor** is it a history of a **changeless institution**.
Carceral space has manifested in the form of **extraordinary rendition
sites**, **immigrant detention centers**, and **internment
camps**]{.underline}. This book traces [an **emergent form** of carceral
space that is characterized by **machines**]{.underline} that traverse
human anatomy, public housing facilities, public schools, transportation
systems, telecommunications systems, and street networks in U.S. cities.
The book also emphasizes that the deeper telecommunications and IT firms
entrench themselves in crime control policy, the more likely it is for
these infrastructures to continue to expand.

[The **extension** of carceral management through the]{.underline}
Internet of Things (**[IoT]{.underline}**), or networks of devices that
communicate with each other, [is]{.underline} greatly [influenced by the
movement of **capital**]{.underline}.42 On one hand, the carceral
state's circumscription of black and latinx communities was partly
catalyzed by the flight of industry from cities, which rendered entire
groups deskilled and unemployable. Decades of revelatory research
demonstrates how cities turned to mass criminalization to manage the
enormous economic, political, social, and medical problems arising from
deindustrialization.43 On the other hand, in addition to outbound
industrial capital, [the carceral state's **digital
architecture**]{.underline} owes its existence to inbound information
capital. The infrastructure sector has emerged as one of the most
important sectors in finance, knowledge, and technology industries.44 IT
companies have insinuated themselves in seemingly all facets of urban
life, including government agencies, private businesses, social
networks, transportation systems, workplaces, and infrastructure. These
companies have also nestled their way into criminal justice
administration, which [is **reshaping geographies** of carceral
governance]{.underline}.

A central argument in this book is that [the criminal justice system's
smart infrastructure is creating **new geometries** of carceral space.
On one hand, carceral space is **incredibly centralized**. Extraordinary
rendition sites, detention centers, jails, and prisons]{.underline},
which are designed to monitor, discipline, governmentalize, punish, and
sometimes execute or torture those caught within their grasp, [are a few
examples]{.underline}. IT firms have penetrated these spaces. For
instance, technology corporations sell geographic information systems to
help custodial authorities organize cell arrangements according to
demographic categories, predict inmate movements and behaviors, and
identify potential escape routes (see chapter 2). [Yet, on the other
hand, carceral space is **incredibly decentralized**. Carceral
geographers highlight the **elaborate logistics** required to shuttle
humans, information, and resources across prison facilities and entire
landscapes]{.underline}.45 Architects have characterized rural prison
facilities as urban exostructures, as they provide relief to the city's
overburdened criminal justice apparatus.46 [Technology firms
have]{.underline} also [**infiltrated** this decentralized dimension of
carceral management. Wireless networks]{.underline} of smart cameras,
phones, sensors, and tablets [**extend the reach** of the carceral
system]{.underline}. At the scale of the city, smart cameras and
environmental sensors send alerts to patrol vehicles dispersed
throughout street networks. On regional scales, real-time crime centers
receive data and transmit them throughout states and, increasingly,
between them. Owing to their portability, criminal justice technologies
also circulate on international scales. Today there exists a global
market for public security technology that traverses capitalist,
communist, and socialist nations. On yet a grander scale, electronic
forms of monitoring probationers depend on Global Positioning System
satellites, which extend the reach of carceral technology all the way
into low Earth orbit.

[**Taking the carceral state apart** and **making it less recognizable**
through the lens of smart infrastructure helps **short-circuit
illusions** that it is **neatly bounded** in terms of geography and
functionality. While the **illusion of a monolithic carceral Leviathan**
echoes modern theories of the state that never seem to fade away,
carceral statecraft is an **open**, **dynamic**, and **variegated
sociotechnical process** of quarantining human beings]{.underline}. As
such, [our **understanding** of carceral state power]{.underline},
Katherine Beckett and Naomi Murakawa observe, "[must be as
**capacious**, **complex**, and **adaptive** as the **policies** and
**institutions involved** in it]{.underline}."47 The present study
insists that analysis of this power's sociotechnical substrate is also
necessary to understand carceral conditions in the twenty-first century.

DESIGN OF THE BOOK

Digitize and Punish retells the history of mass criminalization by
[focusing on]{.underline} technology corporations and technology
bureaus. The book's objects of analysis are not criminalized communities
but rather the computer programmers, corporate-bureaucratic
intellectuals, state officials, and technologists who update [the
**tools** that criminalize]{.underline} them. It [tells **untold
stories** of the **contingencies**, **failed projects**, **unintended
consequences**, and **technical breakthroughs** involved in constructing
the digitized carceral state]{.underline}. It illustrates how [these
efforts have simultaneously **augmented** the carceral state and
**created new avenues of subverting it**]{.underline}.

This project employs an intersectional approach to understand the nexus
of carceral power, racism, and IT capital.48 The perspective was notably
captured by [the **Combahee River Collective** and **Kimberlé Williams
Crenshaw**]{.underline}, who [demonstrated the **inadequacies** of
understanding social hierarchy through **one measure**, or **axis of
division**]{.underline}.49 As such, [**structural analysis** of the
relations between **racial difference**, **technological development**,
and **political economic mutation is necessary** to understand the
relevant factors in racial criminalization in the digital age. The
question is **not** if racial criminalization behaves in a **structural
manner** but rather how it **maintains**]{.underline}, if not increases,
[**its structural integrity** from generation to
generation]{.underline}. This book therefore seeks to explain how
information capital exploited the surge of racial criminalization near
the end of the last century and, at the same time, how racial
criminalization was exploited by the rise of information technology.

**Brock, 20** - André Brock Jr., PhD, Associate Professor in the School
of Literature, Media & Communication at the Georgia Institute of
Technology; 2020("Making a Way out of No Way Black Cyberculture and the
Black Technocultural Matrix," in *Distributed Blackness African American
Cybercultures*, NYU Press, 2020, Accessed Online via Michigan Libraries,
bam)

Throughout this book, I have framed Black online identity and Black
digital practice as Black cyberculture, an awkwardly named construct
incorporating cyberspace (itself a dated term) and technoculture. As
mentioned earlier, technoculture can be understood as the relations
between, and politics of, culture and technology. Dinerstein (2006)
argues that "technology is the American mythos" (p. 570). When defined
this way, however, technoculture often tricks upon the racial identity
of whiteness, and white racial ideology and technological beliefs become
the norm. That obviously won't do! [Black technology users are not white
(even if they are Western), so it becomes necessary to interrogate how
Black people make sense of their existence as users and as subjects
within advanced technological artifacts, services, and
platforms]{.underline}. This final chapter is that catechism, [firmly
placing Black folk at the center of information and communication
technology use]{.underline}. I offer this interrogation not as a summary
of the previous chapters but as a provocation for those who are
interested [in centering Blackness as digital practice]{.underline}.

[[Reorienting technoculture to incorporate Blackness invites]{.mark} an
[inquiry into]{.mark} the possibilities of [Blackness as
technology]{.mark}]{.underline}---**[[not Black
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([been there, done that]{.underline})
**[[but Blackness as technology]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[in the same
way that Blackness often stands in for the best of American
entertainment and culture]{.underline}. I am not arguing for minstrelsy
and blackface here, to be clear, even though those representations of
Blackness are as American as apple pie. Nor am I suggesting that
Blackness is a nonserious use of technology; indeed, **[[technology use
for Blacks]{.mark} often [occurs from the margins of society]{.mark},
[where survival, joy, and resistance intertwine uncomfortably]{.mark} in
the everyday]{.underline}**. Chun (2013) contends that
race-as-technology "posits a comparative equality or
substitutability---but not identity---between the two" (p. 8). Chun goes
on to probe how [whiteness incorporates science and technology to build
technologies and institutions of race]{.underline}---a helpful
formulation for antiblackness and technology but not as necessary here.
Instead, I would like to begin from the introduction's discussion of
"technology as text" [to build out from the possibilities of Black
thought into a concept of Black technoculture]{.underline}. From there,
I will discuss Afrofuturism as an analytic for Black technology use and
time and Black technoculture. Finally, I close with a foray into a
libidinal framework of Black technoculture.

Technologies as Cultural Texts

My argument here centers on the digital's networked and distributive
capacity for banal, everyday Black information and computer technology
(ICT) practices, but others have argued similarly for artistic and
technical artifacts (Fouché, 2006; Ebo, 1998; McGahan, 2013; Weheliye,
2002). "Technology as text" has multiple postulations for distributed
Blackness and for Black technoculture:

• code (interface and practices)

• the digitally distributed content generated by and mediated by that
code

• signifyin' and other cultural discourses of Black digital
practitioners

The first two are instrumental and organizational; think of the
possibilities for art and discourse that were introduced by Grandmaster
Flash's innovative technique of scratching records as part of a musical
performance. The last marks the generative relationship between the
first two, revivifying the noncommunicability of Blackness into a
mediation for the production of Black life and thought. From this
perspective, code, digital discourse, and language-as-culture can (and
do) constitute racial identity. Adding technological mediations of
discourse (Herring, 2001) allows one to examine computer-mediated
communication and digital practice as racial identity as well.

[[It is vital]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[to not
incorporate]{.mark} the digital's technocultural
[alienation]{.mark}]{.underline} (drawing on whiteness's Manichaean
separation of mind and body; Dyer, 1997) [[into]{.underline}]{.mark} my
formulation of [[online Blackness]{.underline}]{.mark}. I wrote the
previous sentence long before I read [[Wilderson]{.underline}]{.mark}
(2010), but his words [[advance my claim]{.underline}]{.mark}: "[[As
a]{.mark}n accumulated and [fungible object]{.mark}, rather than an
exploited and alienated subject, [the Black is openly vulnerable
to]{.mark} the whims of the world and so is his or her [cultural
'production]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}" (p. 56). Here **[Wilderson
states that [because Black folk have no legible stature in the
West]{.mark} as political agents, [they have no inalienable
rights]{.mark} to Black cultural production]{.underline}**. [[Thus
Blackness]{.mark} (in online spaces]{.underline} and elsewhere) **[[is
immediately captured by Western culture]{.underline}]{.mark}**, leaving
little possibility for emancipation from that framework[. I
agree]{.underline}: **[[while I recognize]{.mark} possibilities for
[emancipation through radical and decolonizing digital
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[my pressing concern]{.mark} for
Black technoculture [is to]{.mark} make [manifest]{.mark} **the
[vitality and joy of Black uses of ICTs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
**[[While these libidinal impulses may become commodified or surveilled,
they are paraontological]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[that is, the embodied
cognition they express preexists the platforms on which they are
published, visible, and deemed appropriate for consumption]{.underline}.
[The digital mediates culture]{.underline}---[in this case
Blackness]{.underline}, but otherwise typically white Western---**[[in
ways that allow for sociality despite
commodification]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The next section reviews other
researchers' takes on Black technological practice, which I then extend
to specifically examine digital practice.

### AT: Capitalism

#### Collective resubjectivization generates [material liberation]{.underline}.

**Hall, 20**---Professor of Education and Technology, De Montfort
University (Richard, "Platform Discontent against the University," *The
digital age and its discontents: Critical reflections in education*,
Chapter 7, 130-132, dml)

[The proletarianization of the University is predicated
upon]{.underline} atomized competition, which utilizes new forces of
production to reshape relations between people, in order to extract
value. A critical element of this is **[enforced
separation]{.underline}** between individuals, and the ability for
individual agency to be repurposed by structural requirements.
[However]{.underline}, in order [to extract maximum value]{.underline},
[capital requires individuals]{.underline} to work in concert, or [to
**collaborate**]{.underline} as producers, distributors and consumers.
[This gives opportunities for **cooperative
re-imagination**]{.underline}. For Marx (1866), the cooperative movement
was a transformational force where it understood its relationship to
labour as the point of social production. Thus, he argued that producer
cooperatives, as opposed to consumer cooperatives, are a manifestation
of class antagonism that can point towards 'the republican and
beneficent system of the association of free and equal producers'
(ibid., emphasis in the original). This analysis of cooperation rests on
forms of self-mediation by human beings of their material activities in
society. In an idealized cooperative state, [activities are **no longer
piecemeal** or **solitary**]{.underline}, [or governed by
capital]{.underline}; rather, [they are governed by **alternative
networks** of solidarity and purpose]{.underline}: 'This is not possible
without the community. Only within the community has each individual the
means of cultivating his gifts in all directions; hence personal freedom
becomes possible only within the community' (Marx & Engels 1998: 86).

A focus on the communal and associational characteristics of cooperation
is critical to Marx's praxis, because in them he sees the individual
developing the capabilities of their species (Marx 2004). As a result,
[a **refocusing** upon cooperative values and principles]{.underline},
grounded in the conceptual framework of the self-in-association, [acts
as a moment of **refusal** of alienated socialization]{.underline}, in
which the producers of society are estranged from both the means and
conditions of production of that society. However, discontent at the
present state of things does not coalesce into a single,
counter-hegemonic position, predicated upon a unified collection of
alternative governing principles for life. [It]{.underline} therefore
[becomes **important** to think about **alternative forms** of knowledge
production and an integration with alternative conceptions of
**mutuality**]{.underline}, [**solidarity** and
**cooperation**]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} those emerging [from
indigenous or marginalized communities]{.underline}.

Indigenous methodologies or modes of being help both to develop a fresh
focus on knowledge and to reframe the idea of movement towards a more
humane social production as a liminal process, engaging the body,
emotions and cognition (Tuhiwai Smith, Tuck & Yang 2018). In this
sensuous, epistemic opening, knowledge is rooted in people, place,
philosophy, values, communities, axiologies and cosmologies, which
generate 'relational accountability' (Wilson 2008: 77). Such
accountability is mutual, respectful and dignified, and acts as a
beginning for refusing the domination of knowledge from the global North
imposed as progressive and rooted in an ideological, evidence-based
epistemological standard. Here, [cooperative techniques for social
reproduction might enable forms of **relational
accountability**]{.underline} between peoples and places. Moreover, in
this process, [they offer the possibility of **liberating material
forces**]{.underline}, [including technology]{.underline}, [and
connecting them to alternative conceptions of the world]{.underline}, in
order [to **widen autonomy** and **freedom**]{.underline}.

For Marx (1866; 1970) [a cooperative revolution in the governance of
technology forms a **crucial strand** in changing the general conditions
of social production]{.underline}, [because it **redefines the
subjectivity of society** towards humanity and **away** from the
commodity and the valorization of capital]{.underline}. If we are to do
this, then [a **shared**]{.underline}, [**associational expression** of
individual lives is **required**]{.underline}, in order [to realize the
**essence** of what it means to be human]{.underline}. Marx's idea was
that [the expression of my life and those of my peers are **immanent**
to each other]{.underline}, [and should be mediated **directly** rather
than through the **market**]{.underline}, private property, the division
of labour and commodity exchange. [This requires an **alternative
conception** of how to integrate the forces of production into our
communal being]{.underline}, [and a **liberatory conception** of how
those forces are **subordinate** to our essence and our social
relations]{.underline} (Bookchin 2005). Beautifully, Marx (1844) argues
that [through such practices]{.underline} '[our products would be like
**so many mirrors**]{.underline}, [out of which our essence
**shone**]{.underline}' [as a]{.underline} '**[free
expression]{.underline}**' [of our lives]{.underline}.

[At issue is how to find **cracks** in the system of
capital]{.underline}, [into which technologies for
**alternative**]{.underline}, [**liberatory conceptions** of society can
be **inserted**]{.underline}. Dunayevskaya (1958) has argued that these
need to be situated inside organizations that are beyond
value-production, or they risk degenerating under competition. As a
result, a re-imagination of the University has to engage with more than
the cooperative possibilities of the collective ecosystems currently
structured to reproduce value. [A re-imagination of the potential for
forces of production to **enable social connection** and **knowledge
sharing**]{.underline}, and to liberate time for autonomous activity
rather than the imposition of commodity production, comes up against
structural contradictions. Thus, a re-imagination of technology as a
means for liberating knowledge for a new society [demands]{.underline} a
new material literacy as [a **radical**]{.underline}, **[pedagogical
project]{.underline}** at the level of society.

This is a transitional project [that critiques the place of technology
as it is **currently instantiated** inside the University]{.underline}.
[It critiques the relationship of the digital University]{.underline},
[and its techniques of governance]{.underline}, to knowledge production
and the generation of social wealth. It also critiques these
relationships and techniques [in terms of their ability to **enable
humanity** to engage with **global economic** and **environmental
crises**]{.underline}. [It critiques the **limitations** in our
collective ability to **produce knowledge** inside the University to
engage with these crises]{.underline}, in part [through the separation
of **polity** and **economy**]{.underline}, [such that the latter
**dominates** the former]{.underline}. It critiques these limitations as
they are reproduced inside organizations conditioned by the State to
generate value through exploitation and expropriation. In this way, [it
moves **beyond** the fetishization of technologies and
techniques]{.underline}, including the ways in which these are
reproduced and enclosed inside institutions like universities (see
Ampuja, Chapter 2, in this volume). [The potential for relational
accountability and]{.underline} the [recomposition]{.underline} of
peoples, places and technologies [offer an **alternative set of
possibilities** for intellectual work beyond the capitalized
University]{.underline}.

#### [Mastery DA]{.underline}: The notion of a [universal dialectic]{.underline} is a neurotic projection of the will to mastery\-\--it [transforms the alt]{.underline} into genocidal party politics\-\--only the affirmative's rejection of static linearity solves 

**Berardi 15** (Franco Berardi, like Lenin but not depressed, *AND:
Phenomenology of the End*, p. 90-95)

[[Desire for the Absolute is visible in the]{.mark} historical sphere as
a will of total palingenesis]{.underline}, [[purification of the social
community]{.mark} from the traces of the past]{.underline}. [[The
reference]{.mark} to purity [is transparent in the Russian]{.mark}
conception of Revolution]{.underline}, particularly in the [[Leninist
persuasion]{.underline}]{.mark} that the revolutionary political party
is the "incarnation" of the pure idea coming down from German
Philosophy, and must be embodied by a small organization of professional
bearers of the Revolutionary Truth. The Russian exacerbation of the role
of pure subjectivity entered the scene of the world history in 1917.
[The]{.underline} [Soviet Revolution]{.underline}---that Lenin managed
to unleash against the will of many prominent leaders of the Russian
socialist movement, [provoked a catastrophic polarization in the
worldwide social conflict]{.underline}, [and forced the worker's
movement to identify with a totalitarian experiment, based on the
**authoritarian statalization of class struggle**]{.underline}. [[The
Russian revolution provoked an irreversible rupture and a]{.mark}
**permanent [laceration in the body of society]{.mark}** whose effects
persisted worldwide]{.underline} all along the century. [[Lenin forced
the]{.mark} workers of the world to defend the Socialist State of the
Soviets, and to enter [a process of permanent war]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This war lasted until 1989, but [since the beginning the worker class
was doomed to unavoidable defeat]{.underline}. [The messianic
utopianism]{.underline}, widespread in the Russian society of the
nineteenth century [merged with the hyper-voluntaristic project of the
Bolsheviks]{.underline}, so the history of Communist revolution began as
a tragedy in the context of the immolation culture, and since the
beginning was destined to end as a tragedy. [[The violence]{.mark} and
the authoritarianism [that]{.mark} [the Leninist experiment
unleashed]{.mark} in the country [and exported]{.mark} worldwide
brutally changing the prospects of the international movement for
worker's emancipation]{.underline}, were inscribed in the Russian
history of the previous centuries, [and [**still prevail in the Russian
political life**,]{.mark} after the end of the Soviet
dictatorship]{.underline}. Leninist communism may have ruined Russia,
but certainly [Russia has (forever?) ruined Communism as a possible
alternative to Capitalism]{.underline}, [as the Russian subjectivism and
**cult of purity** have dragged the international movement of the
workers into a vision of permanent military mobilization]{.underline}
that was not part of the Marxian imprinting. [The spontaneous goal of
the workers movement is to expand the space of autonomy from capitalist
exploitation]{.underline}. [The idea that the movement is taken in a
dialectical contradiction is an effect of the Hegelian interpretation of
the social process]{.underline}: this idea becomes historical reality
when the Russian palingenetic cult of pureness melts with the Hegelian
tradition. [The fusion of Marxism and Leninism is the origin of the
workers defeat]{.underline}, in my opinion. [Lenin brings into the
worker's political discourse an element of subjectivism and of purity
that did not belong to the experience of autonomous social
movements]{.underline}. The workers movement was aimed to emancipate
spaces of life and of the territory from the capitalist domination, but
[[the Leninist breakthrough transformed the movement into a project of
absolute separation]{.mark} from the existing world, of radical
demolition and of palingenetic purification]{.underline}. In the first
part of the book, Lenin confirms Lassalle's argument: the purification
(epuration, cleansing) is strengthening the party. [[This idea of
ideological cleansing]{.underline}]{.mark} (epuration) [[is the main
thread]{.mark} of the history of the Soviet Communist
Party]{.underline}, particularly in the Stalin age. According to the
words of Lenin: "the worker class is only able to elaborate an economic
unionist consciousness, but is unable to understand the radical
opposition to the system." (Lenin, What has to be done?) [[This
impurity]{.mark} of the worker class has [to be overcome, so that
society can adapt to the purity of the communist
ideal]{.mark}]{.underline}. Only a party which is the bearer of the pure
Logos can be the bearer of the revolutionary project---not the
aggregation of impure social bodies. In her biographical essay on Lenin,
[the French historian]{.underline} of Georgian origins Hélène Carrère
d'Encausse [speaks of two major episodes of clinical depression in the
life of Lenin that are generally ignored by the hagiografic Leninist
tradition]{.underline}. [The book]{.underline} (Lenine, la Revolution et
le pouvoir, 1979) is interesting especially because it [is focusing on
the affective life of the communist leader]{.underline}: the importance
of the relation with the mother, the sister, and particularly of the
wife, Nadeezda Krupskaja, who took care of him in the periods of acute
psychic crisis. The book also speaks of Ines Armand, the lover who
disturbingly entered the life of Lenin, and was later removed,
neutralized, as a potential danger for the political integrity of the
leader. [Depression is the peculiar feature of the psychological
description of Lenin, and depressive crises are coinciding with the most
important political decisions of his life]{.underline}. The first major
crisis, according to Hélène Carrère d'Encausse, occurred in the year
1902, and coincided with the decision of founding the Communist party
and the draft of What has to be done? The second occurred in 1914, when
Lenin takes the decision of breaking with the Second International
before Zimmerwald Congress, and the Communist Schism at the European
scale. The third occurred in Spring 1917 and coincided with the decision
of launching the Soviet insurrection which actually took place in
October. [These decisions]{.underline}, [that]{.underline} marked the
emergence of the Communist identity, and [forced a voluntary
acceleration on the history of class struggle all over Europe and
worldwide]{.underline}, [can be linked in my opinion with the depressive
cycle of Lenin]{.underline}. [[When intelligence is depressive, only
will is the therapy that makes possible ignoring the
abyss]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The abyss is not removed, not resolved, not
avoided or overcome]{.underline}. [It is ignored, but still it is there,
and the decades following the Revolution have actually exposed its
persistence, so that the century sunk down into the abyss]{.underline}.
More than in the political meaning of the decisions of Lenin, here I'm
interested in the relation between Bolshevik voluntarism and the male
inability to deal with depression. By the political point of view, the
Bolshevik breach provoked a general precipitation of the confrontation
between workers and capital in the world: [[workers were pushed]{.mark}
everywhere [towards]{.mark} a [totalizing]{.mark} form of
[opposition]{.mark}, and actually towards civil war]{.underline}. The
social autonomy was obliged to choose between revolutionary terror and
capitulation. And [where the communist parties succeeded in seizing
political power, [this was turned into **violent dictatorship**]{.mark}
**and submission of social life**]{.underline}. This way [[the]{.mark}
Leninist [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} prepared the worldwide
catastrophe that at the end of the century has [[provoked the worst
possible defeat]{.mark} whose effects we'll be experiencing for
decades]{.underline}. [The project of a rebirth of the world beginning
with the palingenetic violence of the revolution is a mythology that has
no historical foundation]{.underline}. History has never known
abolition, palingenesis or rebirth. [[History is always about
stratification]{.mark}, negotiation, coevolution, autonomy or
dependence]{.underline}, identification or extraneousness. [Not about
abolition]{.underline}. **[[Leninism can be considered as an attempt to
deny depression]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [as an assertion of the purity
of will, [as a refusal to accept the finiteness of human
potency]{.mark}]{.underline}: male hysteria that was already at work in
the Dostoevsky's writings.

#### Marxist theorizations of change fail to account for the ontological nature of modern capitalism -- the aff's approach is the only way to create individual value in the world of utility 

**Magrini 11** (James, Professor at the College of DuPage, "Working to
Recover the Essence of Education for the Sake of Teaching and Teacher
Education: Towards a Phenomenological Understanding of the Forgotten,
Ontological Aspects of Learning" p. 4)NCF

It is evident that [there is a serious problem with educational
procedures]{.underline} emerging out of the "bureaucratic/rational
choice model" that is two-fold in nature, [a problem that is in fact
antibiotic, as in a vicious sense of codependence.
Instructors]{.underline} who [are increasingly alienated
from]{.underline} what might serve as legitimate, or [authentic,
curriculum]{.underline} for the preparation of
**[[teachers]{.mark}]{.underline}** entering the field **[[are slaves to
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** governed by pre-determined standards
of achievement. [[These institutions are]{.mark} then [filtering
ill-prepared]{.mark} (alienated) [teachers into a system that is
governed]{.mark} i]{.underline}n much the same way, namely, [[by
standards]{.mark} and **competencies [established by bureaucratic
agencies that are at a remove from authentic educational]{.mark}
purposes and [practices]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Teachers are thus
alienated in a duplicitous sense, both from the curriculum they are now
forced to teach and the students who cannot relate to what is being
taught. Bonnett (2001) echoes the sentiments expressed earlier when
stating that [[the current "predisposition to regard
outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark} of education as definable in advance of
the process of education[" [engenders a deterministic system]{.mark} of
education [that **obscures authentic subject-**hood and we lose sight of
the fact that humans]{.mark} [are "**individual centers of
consciousness**]{.mark} [**capable of relating to the world in ways that
have personal meaning**,]{.mark} for this is essential to human being
against some sort of mechanized and depersonalized being"]{.underline}
(p. 30). In short, there is a loss of ownership on the part of both
educator and student, but beyond this**[, [there is a loss of authentic
subject-hood]{.mark}]{.underline}**; ironically, by means of education,
we are losing sight of what it means to be truly human.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} alienation from the curriculum and
[[authentic subject-hood of which I speak **should not be conceived in
terms of Marxist theory, which tends to focus on ideology**]{.mark}
**and the critique of capitalism and its detrimental effects on schools.
[Rather, I conceive alienation and depersonalization in terms of]{.mark}
what**]{.underline} Heidegger (1979) calls [[the
oblivion]{.underline}]{.mark}, or forgetting[, of Being, which is
grounded in the failure to ask about "the truth of being itself" and
about "the way the essence of human being belongs to the truth of
Being"]{.underline} (p. 246). This condition, which pervades the world
of education, grows from the tradition in Western metaphysics and its
subsequent influence on the rise of science and technology. In short[,
**[education is moving us farther away from essential issues
of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[human dwelling]{.underline}]{.mark}** as
linked with our Being, **[[and the ontological aspects of our
existence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is now to the potential recovery of
this essential, forgotten ontological notion of authentic
Beingin-the-world as related to education that I turn.

#### Stacktivism [socializes]{.underline} technology and reshapes the [foundation]{.underline} of capitalist notions of value.

**Dragona 15**(Daphne, PhD from the Faculty of Communication & Media
Studies of the University of Athens, "From Community Networks to
Off-the-cloud toolkits: Art and DIY networking", CS)

Firstly, all [networks discussed follow a usercentered approach. The
human and non human elements that a network involves are balanced by
always allowing the users to have control of the nodes of the
network]{.underline}; setting them up, controlling them and sustaining
them. [In the era of algorithmic automation and control, its important
to remember]{.underline} what Munster and Lovink wrote, [that the rise
of networks should be made understood as an all too human
behaviour]{.underline} \[77\]. Whereas as Medosch says 'in ubiquitous
computing, [it is usually the devices which get smarter and the people
who remain stupid',]{.underline} in the cases of such initiatives a 'new
Internet of People', following here Nold and van Kranenburg, and can
emerge against the Internet of things \[78, 79\]. Secondly, the
[topologies of DIY networking are exposed and understood by a merging of
the social and the technological.]{.underline} As a user is always
behind a node and in control of a node, it is easier to realize the
edges and nodes, the architecture and potentiality of the network. [This
idea]{.underline} of "becoming the machine" that Pasquinelli mentioned
[can be understood as becoming the node and gaining control of the
network]{.underline}. Thirdly, [all infrastructures]{.underline} of
different scale are based on open software and hardware [leaving open to
the users the possibility for modifying]{.underline} and even
repurposing them for [their own needs;]{.underline} this way not only
the DIY but also the DIWO ethos is encouraged embracing the logic of
thinking, sharing, working together. This in a manifestation of what
Hardt and Negri have stated when they argued that "being with" is no
longer enough"; a "doing with" is necessary \[80\]. [Alternatives based
on collaboration and sociality are introduced to spread and teach people
how not only to modify and use infrastructures but also to make
decisions, possibly based on criteria which are qualitative and
humanistic]{.underline} \[81\]. [Staying out of the market of
centralized systems and platforms, a new system and theory of value is
embraced. Encouraging forms of exchange economy and providing tools and
knowledge freely and openly]{.underline}, [a significant effort is made
for social value to outbalance market value]{.underline}, [for sharing
networks to surpass zones of property]{.underline}. Fourthly, and in
continuation of the above arguments the infrastructures proposed can be
seen as part of the new 'Network Commons' as Armin Medosch puts it.
Although Medosch refers primarily to the community networks, this can
greatly stand for the wider family of offline sharing [networks as they
are systems in terms of infrastructure and content that are meant to be
constructed, possessed and managed by all. Through such platforms, users
are invited "to speak and think, to become informed and to
participate]{.underline}", as Stavrides has put it for the necessity of
the contemporary commons \[82\]. The making of the common in the case of
infrastructures is therefore a process based on potentialities, skills
and affects of the users and [this can be approached as meaningful acts
of commoning]{.underline}.

### AT: Ivory Tower

#### Stacks are as material as you can get.

**Mohorčich 17**(Jospeh, Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University, "POWER
PRAGMATISM", CS)

[A sensible plan for radical transformation,]{.underline} therefore,
[will start with a plan for taking care of basic human needs: an
alternative technology stack for keeping human beings alive so that they
don't die when the standard systems of feeding and caring for them fail
or are removed]{.underline}. Gupta argues that "you don't \[convert to a
new life-support stack\] by pulling the old one down. [You \[convert\]
by building a new one, prototyping it, bootstrapping it from the
resources of the old, proving that it works, and then pulling the
population across."]{.underline}403 As Bratton points out, [stacks are
"intrinsically modular]{.underline}," so each is "also a platform, and
an interface even, for the redesign and replacement of the Stack-we-have
with a Stack-we-want."[404 To think about radical transformation---up to
and including revolution---without thinking about infrastructure is to
neglect that engineering and politics are embedded in each
othe]{.underline}r. Because any plan for political transformation must
start with some kind of life-support plan, it makes sense to start
working on these types of plans and to bring this work explicitly into
the political-theory fold[. Working to diagram and assemble alternative
life-support stacks has the potential to convert cycles of radical
action from self-defeating to self-reinforcing]{.underline}. [As
activists and thinkers are increasingly existing stacks]{.underline},
and to not get enmeshed in questions about who's going to call in sick
to work or argue with Comcast this week[, they are able to think,
agitate, and act in a more engaged manner, which opens space for further
political-material-technical moves that strengthen alternative
stacks]{.underline}, which engenders further agitation and thought,
which restarts the cycle. For example, Bitcoin's role as a functional
component of an alternative financial stack (i[) demonstrates the
technical viability of]{.underline} blockchain-based [experiments to
create alternative stacks for education, personal identification, energy
markets, housing, carbon emission tracking, and so on]{.underline}, and
(ii) [pulls developers,]{.underline} users, and billions of dollars in
wealth [from existing financial stacks into alternative
ones,]{.underline} which creates the material, technical, and social
grist for further developments. To be sure, purchasing baby formula or
pizza with a blockchain currency is not itself a shatteringly radical
move, especially if the supply chains for what you have bought can still
be traced through to structures of degradation, exploitation, and
accumulation. This is why [building alternative stacks for the
production and transport of energy, food, heat, and information that
interleave with alternative financial structures like blockchain
currencies remains a critical and self-reinforcing task]{.underline}.406
[Developing]{.underline} alternative life-support stacks [opens up ways
of rethinking radical separatism.]{.underline}

### AT: Settler Colonialism

#### The development of [imperial technology]{.underline} explains the mechanisms of dispossession [better]{.underline}. 

**Harris, 4**---Department of Geography, University of British Columbia
(Cole, "How Did Colonialism Dispossess? Comments from an Edge of
Empire," Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 94:1,
165-182, dml)

[The emphasis on culture in studies of colonialism tends to **obscure**
other forms of colonial power while making it **impossible to
contextualize** the cultural argument and **assess its salience**.
Rather than focusing on]{.underline} texts, [**systems of
signification**, and **procedures of knowledge
generation**]{.underline}, as the colonial discourse literature is wont
to do, [a **fuller understanding** of colonial powers is achieved by
**explaining colonialism's basic geographical dispossessions** of the
colonized. In so doing, the issue of power is **not prejudged** and the
**particular roles** of different modes and theories of colonial power
come into focus]{.underline}. I explore these propositions by
considering the powers underlying the reserve (reservation) system in
British Columbia, a system that, by allocating a tiny fraction of the
land to native people and opening the rest for development, facilitated
the geographical reorganization of the province. My conclusions are
these: [the **initial ability** to dispossess rested **primarily on
physical power** and the **supporting infrastructure** of the
state]{.underline}; the momentum to dispossess derived from the interest
of capital in profit and of settlers in forging new livelihoods; the
legitimation of and moral justification for dispossession lay in a
cultural discourse that located civilization and savagery and identified
the land uses associated with each; and the management of dispossession
rested with a set of disciplinary technologies of which maps, numbers,
law, and the geography of resettlement itself were the most important.
Although **[no one body of theory explains colonial
power]{.underline}**, several theoretical perspectives yield crucial
insights. Key Words: colonialism, colonial discourse theory,
deterritorialization, colonial land policies, governmentality,
reservations, British Columbia.

[Influenced by]{.underline} Michel Foucault's analysis of the
relationships of power and knowledge (1972), by Edward Said's
examination of Orientalism (1978), by [**textual theory** harnessed to
**colonial discourse analysis**, and by many studies of the **values**
and **ideologies** enmeshed in particular colonial
encounters]{.underline}, most postcolonial [scholars now
identify]{.underline} culture and associated [**procedures of knowledge
generation** as the **dominant power relations** associated with
colonialism. Whereas]{.underline} Frantz **[Fanon]{.underline}** (1963)
[emphasized **violence**---the **power of the gun**]{.underline}---and
Marx, to the extent that he wrote on colonialism, the aggressive reach
of capital, [postcolonial research]{.underline} and writing [situates
the momentum of colonialism in the **culture** of imperialists and
colonists. A **central goal**]{.underline}, therefore, of colonial
discourse theory [is to identify the **assumptions** and
**representations** inherent in colonial culture---in the
**binary**]{.underline} of civilization/savagery, [in the **erasures of
Aboriginal knowledge of time** and **space**, in **assumptions about
race** and **gender**, in the **concept of the land as
empty**]{.underline} (terra nullius), [and so on---and
then]{.underline}, insofar as possible, [to **expose their contemporary
manifestations**. This]{.underline} work [has **focused much scholarly
energy**]{.underline} and has yielded important theoretical and
practical results, [but it is **less clear** that it has **revealed the
principal momentum** and **power relations** inherent in
colonialism]{.underline}.

Originating in literary and cultural studies, colonial discourse theory,
indeed postcolonial [scholarship]{.underline} generally, [privileges the
**investigation of imperial texts**, **enunciations**, and **systems of
signification**]{.underline}. In so doing, it exposes implicit modes of
seeing and of understanding that are held to infuse and validate
colonialism while imparting much of its momentum. If Said offered
broadly inclusive descriptions of colonial culture, and if others, more
recently, have emphasized the variety of colonial voices and the
importance of a local, contextual appreciation of different colonial
cultures (e.g., Thomas 1994), in either case, [culture is treated as a
**primary locus** of colonial power]{.underline}. Moreover, [as elements
of colonial culture are assumed to have outlived formal colonial
regimes, their **identification** becomes an **active political
project**]{.underline}---the decolonization of representation (Hall
2000, 5). [In itself, this is commendable enough, but if studies of
colonial culture are **not contextualized** among other forms of
colonial power, then it is **well nigh impossible to assess the
particular work** and the **relative salience** of colonial culture
itself]{.underline}. A study of travel writing, for example, may yield
an appreciation of the inflected seeing of travelers and of the
complicity of such seeing with colonial projects, while not beginning to
address the relative importance of travelers' seeing and writing in the
whole colonial enterprise. Given its focus, it cannot. At best, it can
yield a nuanced understanding of traveler perceptions and values, and
suggestive ideas about their relationships with colonialism.
Colonialism's complexity may be affirmed, so too, perhaps, the
discursive construction of reality comments tied more closely to theory
than to a situated knowledge of colonial practices and power relations.

In the hands of some of its most able practitioners, postcolonial
scholarship is a potent means of exploring the reworking
(''provincializing'') of European thought at and for the margins of
empire (Chakrabarty 2000, 16). However, [most postcolonial
scholarship]{.underline} is written out of British or American
universities and emanates from the heart of a recently superceded empire
or of a recently ascendant one that hesitates to acknowledge its own
imperial background. American postcolonial scholarship is not
preoccupied with America (Hulme 1995; Thomas 1994 172--73). In the
background of such scholarship are European theorists, particularly
Foucault, Derrida, and Gramsci; in the foreground, European colonial
thought and culture. In these circumstances, as many have pointed out,
it tends to be Eurocentric---or as the Australian anthropologist Patrick
Wolfe puts it, occidocentric (1999, 1). So positioned, it [is well
placed to comment on the **imperial mind** in its **large diversity**,
and even]{.underline}---especially in the hands of scholars like Homi
Bhabha and Dipesh Chakrabarty who grew up in former colonies---[on the
ways in which European thought has been **inflected** and **hybridized**
by its colonial encounters, but **not** on the **diverse**,
**on-the-ground workings** of colonialism in colonized spaces around the
world]{.underline}. A central claim of the distinguished Indian
subaltern historian, Ranajit Guha, is that if British historical writing
on the subcontinent reveals something of Britain and the Raj, it reveals
nothing of India (1997). Somewhat similar criticisms have been made of
much of [the]{.underline} postcolonial [literature]{.underline}: that it
(or parts of it) anticipates a radically restructured European
historiography, that it [allows for **nothing outside the (European)
discourse** of colonialism]{.underline}, that [it is **yet another
exercise in metatheory** and in **European universalism**]{.underline}
(e.g., Slemon 1994; McClintock 1994). As the literary theorist Benita
Parry puts it, the postcolonial emphasis on language and texts tends to
offer ''the World according to the Word'' (1997, 12)---and the word
tends to be European. But [unless it can be shown that colonialism is
**entirely constituted by European colonial culture** (a proposition for
which it is **hard to imagine any convincing evidence** unless the
concept of culture is **understood so broadly** that it **loses any
analytical value**), then studies of colonial discourse, written from
the center, must be a **very partial window** on the workings of
colonialism]{.underline}.

The discipline of geography has responded to postcolonial thought in a
variety of ways (Clayton 2003). Among others, studies of colonialism
itself have come into vogue, most of them written in Britain, a few from
the edges of empire. I am struck by how much the character of these
studies has been influenced by the locations of their authors. Consider,
for example, two recent books by historical geographers: Felix Driver's
Geography Militant: Cultures of Exploration and Empire (2000), and Frank
Tough's ''As Their Natural Resources Fail'': Native Peoples and the
Economic History of Northern Manitoba, 1870--1930 (1996). From opposite
perspectives, they treat a fairly similar period of British colonialism.
Driver analyzes the culture of exploration, particularly the sites and
nature of its production and consumption---as at the Royal Geographical
Society. His is a study of the ways in which the British imperial mind,
both popular and academic, processed explorers' information. Tough's
work is embedded in the materiality of a declining fur trade in the
northern Manitoba bush. It deals with forts and trade routes; with
economies and survival strategies as a twohundred-year-old system of
commercial capital vacated the region; and with native livelihoods found
in a precarious balance between what remained of a hunting, fishing, and
gathering economy and intermittent employment in uncertain industrial
resource economies. Each is an authentic study, yet they have little to
say to each other, and this is basically, I think, because one is
written from London, the heart of an empire, and the other from the
Canadian Shield, one of its many colonial margins. At least, as Derek
Gregory has put it, ''what seemed plausible in the lecture hall of the
Royal Geographical Society in London . . . might well become a half
truth on the ground'' (1998, 21). The distinction, perhaps, is between
studies of imperialism and of colonialism: imperialism ideologically
driven from the center and susceptible to conceptual analysis,
colonialism a set of activities on the periphery that are revealed as
practice (Young 2001, 16--17). Only a few geographers have tried to
bring both the imperial mind and the particularities of local colonial
circumstances into focus (e.g., Clayton 2000 and Lester 2001).

But [if the aim is to understand **colonialism** rather than the
workings of the **imperial mind**, then it would seem **essential** to
investigate the sites where colonialism was **actually practiced**. Its
effects were **displayed** there. The **strategies** and **tactics** on
which it relied were **actualized** there. There, in the **detail of
colonial dispossessions** and **repossessions**, the **relative weight**
of different agents of colonial power may **begin to be
assessed**]{.underline}. If [colonialism]{.underline} is the object of
investigation, then Tough's sparse Canadian Shield is promising terrain.
It [**was not detached** from London]{.underline}, of course, [and may
have been **profoundly influenced by elements of imperial thought** and
**culture**, but the extent of this influence **cannot be ascertained in
London**]{.underline}. Rather, I think, [one needs to **study the
colonial site itself**, **assess the displacements** that took place
there, and **seek to account for them**. To do so is to position studies
of colonialism in the **actuality** and **materiality** of colonial
experience. As that experience comes into focus, its **principal
causes** are to be assessed, among which **may well be**]{.underline}
something like the culture of [**imperialism**. To **proceed the other
way around** is to **impose a form of intellectual imperialism** on the
study of colonialism]{.underline}, a tendency to which the postcolonial
literature inclines.

The experienced materiality of colonialism is grounded, as many have
noted, in dispossessions and repossessions of land. Even Edward Said
(for all his emphasis on literary texts) described the essence of
colonialism this way: ''Underlying social space are territories, land,
geographical domains, the actual geographical underpinnings of the
imperial, and also the cultural contest. To think about distant places,
to colonize them, to populate or depopulate them: all of this occurs on,
about, or because of land. The actual geographical possession of land is
what empire in the final analysis is all about'' (1994, 78). Frantz
Fanon held that colonialism created a world ''divided into
compartments,'' a ''narrow world strewn with prohibitions,'' a ''world
without spaciousness.'' He maintained that a close examination of ''this
system of compartments'' would ''reveal the lines of force it implies.''
Moreover, ''this approach to the colonial world, its ordering and its
geographical layout will allow us to mark out the lines on which a
decolonized society will be reorganized'' (1963, 37--40).

Along the edge of empire that was early-modern British Columbia,
colonialism's''geographical layout'' was primarily expressed in a
reserve (reservation) system that allocated a small portion of the land
to native people and opened the rest for development. Native people were
in the way, their land was coveted, and settlers took it. The line
between the reserves and the rest---between the land set aside for the
people who had lived there from time immemorial and land made available
in various tenures to immigrants--- became the primary line on the map
of British Columbia. Eventually, there were approximately 1,500 small
reserves, slightly more than a third of 1 percent of the land of the
province. Native people had been placed in compartments by an aggressive
settler society that, like others of its kind, was far more interested
in native land than in the surplus value of native labor (Wolfe 1999,
1--3). Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the scale of dispossession.

[At these sites of colonial dispossession, it seems **particularly
fruitful** to ask **by what means** it came about]{.underline}. The
common emphasis in the colonial discourse literature is reversed. [By
**starting not with texts**, **language**, and **strategies of
representation**, but with the **dispossession of colonized peoples** of
their land]{.underline}--- with, as it were, Figures 1 and 2---[the
**relative weight** of different colonial powers is **not prejudged**,
and the question becomes simply: **how was colonial power deployed** to
achieve this geographical effect? Rather than **writing from the
imperial center**, rather than investigating colonial subtexts within a
**particular category of texts**, the analysis turns on the **primary
effect** of a **particular settler colonialism** and on the **gamut of
colonial powers** that facilitated it. So situated, the **distinctive
roles of different components of the colonial arsenal** should begin to
**come into focus**]{.underline} (including maps like Figures 1 and 2).
[The cultural discourse of colonialism should begin to be
**contextualized**, and **some basis should be established** for the
**evaluation of salience**]{.underline}. Moreover, different theoretical
points of attachment should come into focus, and it should be possible
to sketch the work that particular bodies of theory accomplish.

This article is a rather schematic attempt to undertake such an analysis
and, on that basis, to offer some preliminary conclusions. In a recent
book on the reserve system in British Columbia (Harris 2002), I provide
more texture for those who wish it. Yet the very starkness of an article
that surveys an array of colonial powers may serve to emphasize my
argument and encourage the discussion of the relationships among
different forms of colonial power--- and of different ways of theorizing
them---out of which, I think, a more balanced geographical contribution
to the study of colonialism is likely to emerge. I deal with British
Columbia while assuming that my arguments bear, to some fair extent, on
other theaters of settler colonialism.

The Power to Dispassess

The problem of reserves in British Columbia arose with the establishment
of colonies and settlers some 70 years after people of European
background began to frequent its coastal waters. After commercial
capital reached the coast in the 1780s and 1790s, and the interior in
the first decade of the 19th century, trade became the basis of the
relationship between natives and nonnatives. The relationship was
frequently mediated by violence, sexual liaisons of various sorts, and
cross-cultural borrowing, but land was not at issue. Except for the few
acres within their palisaded forts and, in some cases, a little land
beyond for a farm or two, traders did not need it. For their purposes,
it was sufficient to insert a handful of outsiders in ships or forts
into native space.

But a territory had become known to the outside world, and its outline
had been mapped. In French sociologist Bruno Latour's terms, such
''inscriptions'' were transported to distant ''centers of calculation''
(1987, ch. 6). Sketchy information about a distant corner of North
America was processed, thousands of miles from its source, within
complex calculuses of diplomatic ambition, ideology, cultural
stereotypes, and raw geopolitical power (Clayton 2000). Spain
relinquished any claim to sovereignty along the north Pacific coast in
1795. Britain and the United States contended much longer, an intricate
diplomacy at times verging onwar thatwas settled only in 1846 when the
border between British North America and the United States was extended
along the 49th parallel to the Pacific. This agreement, the Oregon
Treaty, was a legal understanding between distant governments
''respecting the sovereignty and government of the territory on the
northwest coast of America.'' It did not mention native people. In the
eyes of the governments involved, the issue of sovereignty was settled.
Three years later, in response to the American settlement of Oregon and
the news of gold in California, the British government established the
proprietary colony of Vancouver Island. Then, in 1858, following a rush
of underemployed miners from California to the Fraser River, it
established the crown colony of British Columbia. As Daniel Clayton puts
it, ''native space was reproduced as an absolute space of British
sovereignty,'' (2000, 236) although initially, in the aftermath of the
Treaty of Waitangi and judicial rulings in New Zealand, officials in the
Colonial Office were uncertain about the extent to which British
sovereignty in these colonies was burdened by native title (Harris 2002,
15--16).

With the creation of these two colonies, land was framed in a new
problematic. Colonies entailed settlers, and settlers required land,
which could be got only by dispossessing native people. A relationship
based on trade was replaced by one based on land. As their land was
taken away, native people had to be put somewhere. A solution with many
precedents in other settler colonies was to put them on reserves.
Dispossession began in the 1850s and continued through the rest of the
century. Physical violence, the imperial state, colonial culture, and
self-interest all underlay it.

Violence. The establishment of colonies on Vancouver Island and the
mainland changed the nature of violence there. It had long accompanied
the fur trades. Coastal trading ships bristled with arms, greed was
rampant on both sides, cross-cultural misunderstandings were frequent,
and killing was the common result (Clayton 2000, ch. 6; Gibson 1992,
163, 170). In the interior, an axiom of the land-based fur trade was
that perceived assaults on the personnel or property of the traders
would be met with quick, spectacular displays of violence---sovereign
power in the Foucaultian sense, though without a validating regime of
rights (Harris 1997, ch. 2). Nor was the gold rush peaceable. Miners
arrived with the latest weaponry (including six-shooters and
spiral-bored rifles) and tactics of Indian fighting worked out in the
American southwest. At the first sign of trouble, they organized
themselves into companies, elected officers, and advanced in
paramilitary formation. But with the creation of settler colonies, a new
level of organization and calculation---the British military---was built
into the equation of violence (Gough 1984). British warships operated
along the coast; a detachment of Royal Engineers was sent out to survey
land and maintain order. Such power was more often displayed than
used---a few quick and very public hangings of suspected murderers after
summary trials on the quarterdeck of one of Her Majesty's warships, or a
few villages shelled and destroyed---spectacles intended to instill
fear. Officials considered such power ''a grand persuasive.'' Some held
that it saved lives by preventing settler--native wars. Frequently, they
judged it sufficient to anchor a warship just off a native village and
ostentatiously prepare the guns.

In the interior, the space beyond the reach of a ship's guns, the
military equation was more balanced. In the 1870s, as settlers were
moving in and preempting land, many natives leaders talked of war.
Settlers feared, perhaps with justification, that a native uprising
could wipe all of them out in a single night. But, as the chiefs knew, a
shortterm victory was one thing; keeping at bay settlers and the armies
that, sooner or later, would back them up was quite another. The results
of wars across the border in which native warriors (some from British
Columbia) had fought federal U.S. troops, was evidence in hand. Those
who counseled war did so out of desperation. One chief put it this way:
''A war with the white man will end in our destruction, but death in war
is not so bad as death by starvation'' (cited in Harris 2002, 206).
Overall, the balance of physical power lay overwhelmingly with the
state.

The imperial state. From the vantage point of London, Vancouver Island
and British Columbia were two remote and relatively inconsequential
colonies. Imperial attention focused, rather, on India and Ireland.
After the advent of free trade in 1846, the role of settler colonies in
the imperial scheme of things had become increasingly murky. Earl Grey,
secretary of state for the colonies when the colony of Vancouver Island
was created, held that colonies returned important image value for a
great power and also that the honor of the crown required it to protect
British settlers overseas (who had chosen to settle within the British
empire) and also to protect native people from settlers who, left to
their own devices, would probably exterminate them (Grey 1853, vol. 1,
letter 1). Yet the coffers of the Lords of the Treasury opened
reluctantly for honor, and British settler colonies around the world
were expected to support themselves. Moreover, the duty of the crown to
protect native people from settlers conflicted with the Colonial
Office's growing willingness to accord responsible government. As
liberal humanitarian sentiments about the essential oneness of human
kind and the opportunity to create a world of civilized, Christian
people faded, responsible government came to dominate protection in
Colonial Office thought (Metcalf 1996; Porter 1999). In settler
colonies, where access to land was the predominant issue, only a hollow
form of responsible government would exclude land policy from colonial
jurisdiction. In effect, by the late 1840s and 1850s, the Colonial
Office had no clear, consistent native policy. As a result, when the
colony of Vancouver Island was created, it was readily inclined to turn
over the management of native people to the Hudson's Bay Company (which,
it thought, had handled them much better than the Americans) and to rely
on the judgment of the fur trader-cum-governor (George Douglas), who
managed both colonies until his retirement in 1864. Thereafter, land
policies were formulated by local settler politicians. The Colonial
Office hardly interfered, and in 1871 when BritishColumbia became a
Canadian province, land policy, now constitutionally a provincial
responsibility within the Canadian confederation, remained in the hands
of these same politicians. The state created a framework for the ordered
development of a settler society, but did not, itself, provide the
momentum for the development of that society or for the dispossessions
and repossessions of land that accompanied it. When power passed to
local politicians, they reflected the values and interests of their
constituents.

Culture. The assumptions about the colonized other analyzed in the
colonial discourse literature were pervasive in early modern British
Columbia. Hardly a white person questioned the distinction between
civilization and savagery or the association of the former with
Europeans and the latter with native people. Nor did they question the
proposition that civilized people knew how to use land properly and that
savages did not. From these assumptions it followed that until Europeans
arrived, most of the land was waste, or, where native people were
obviously using it, that their uses were inadequate. Nor was there room
for alternative understandings of civilized modernity. Rather, thought
about native people focused on a simple binary: civilization and
savagery with little of consequence between. From this it followed that
if native people did not become civilized, and if, in a changing world,
it was no longer possible for them to be savage, then they would die
out, a common prediction in British Columbia well into the 20th century.

These social constructions were assumed, not debated. They pervaded
thought about native people in the Colonial Office, in political,
administrative, legal, and missionary circles in British Columbia, and
in the settler mind. An Indian reserve commissioner, charged with laying
out reserves, said this to a native audience on Vancouver Island in
1876:

Many years ago you were in darkness killing each other and making slaves
was your trade. The Land was of no value to you. The trees were of no
value to you. The Coal was of no value to you. The white man came he
improved the land you can follow his example---he cuts the trees and
pays you to help him. He takes the coal out of the ground and he pays
you to help him---you are improving fast. The Government protects you,
you are rich---You live in peace and have everything you want. ---(cited
in Harris 2002, 108)

At the time, few if any white settlers would have disagreed. There were
arguments about how quickly native people could be assimilated and,
therefore, about how much land should be allocated to them. Some
settlers, biological racists to the core, considered natives utterly
lazy, degenerate, and unredeemable; but a few found much to appreciate
or pity in native lives, were well disposed toward native people nearby,
and now and then supported their pleas for more reserve land. But even
kindness--- tinged by an educated, romantic appreciation of nature and,
therefore, of lives assumed to live close to nature--- was situated
within the assumptions of the civilization/ savage binary. So was
salvage anthropology, which in the influential presence of Franz Boas
reached the coast late in the 19th century, there intent upon recovering
the uncontaminated primitive condition. Boas had little interest in the
native societies around him(which, he thought, were becoming civilized),
except insofar as they supplied informants about earlier, precontact
times.

These values had not been invented in British Columbia. As a
considerable literature has shown (e.g., Seed 1995; Hulme and Jordanova
1990; Buckle 1991; Arneil 1996), some of them were as old as the
European connection with the New World and had surfaced in the first
European theorizing about their rights there by the Spanish theologian
Francisco de Vitoria in the 1530s, or by the Dutch legal theorist Hugo
Grotius a century later. They were powerfully and influentially
elaborated by John Locke (\[1690\] 1947, ch. 5) in his labor theory of
property. Locke held that God's gift of land to Adam and his posterity
acquired value only as labor was expended on it, and that labor
justified individual property rights. Those who did not labor on the
land wandered over what Locke called unassisted nature, land that
yielded little and lay in common. This, he thought, was the condition of
America before European settlers arrived. The land was ''a wild common
of Nature,'' the original condition of the world before labor was
expended on land and benefits accrued therefrom. Hence his famous
dictum: ''In the beginning, all the world was America.'' In all the
early settler colonies, ordinary (frequently illiterate)
settlers---people who had never heard of Vitoria, Grotius, or
Locke---held unsophisticated versions of these views.

By the mid-19th century, [these]{.underline} old and pervasive [ideas
were]{.underline} powerfully [reinforced by]{.underline} an increasingly
strident [racism]{.underline} and the achievements of industrial
production. These years were the high water mark of ''scientific''
racism. The ideas of phrenologists, craniometricians, and polygenesists
were in the air, and after Darwin's The Origin of Species (published in
1859), it could be argued that, even if humans shared a common origin,
there had been ample time for evolution to take different courses and
produce different peoples. The very achievements of industrial society
were the measure, it seemed, of an evolutionary advantage. The lurid
tales of the massacres of English women and children at Morant Bay in
Jamaica, or, later, at Lucknow and Cawnpore during the Indian Mutiny,
confirmed in many minds the absurdity of treating natives as the equal
of whites. Such judgments reached British Columbia. Even **[more
important]{.underline}**, I think, as the historian Michael Adas has
pointed out, [was the **growing technological gulf** between Europe and
the rest of the world and the **tangible measure it provided** of the
**disjunction**]{.underline} between civilization and savagery (Adas
1989). [**European weaponry** and **military discipline** had made
conquest **relatively easy**]{.underline} (Headrick 1981). [Contrasts
between Europeans and others **seemed obvious**: **machine power**
versus **animal** or **human power**, **progress** versus
**stagnation**, **science** versus **superstition**. The **whole
material paraphernalia** of European modernity was a **tangible
yardstick of superiority**, and the **idea of progress**, conceived in
these **material terms**, was **in the air as never
before**]{.underline}. Moreover, as the historian Mark Francis has
shown, [if civilization and progress came to be **equated with
technology**]{.underline} and material wealth, [then a **measurable
standard had been invented** that native people **could not
attain**]{.underline} (Francis 1998). [They could be **mannered**, but
they **could not match European technologies** or **material wealth**.
Nor did they have the Europeans' **growing ability to
dominate**]{.underline} nature, another measure of progress. People who
marked the land lightly and lived within the rhythms of nature were
obviously unprogressive and backward. If civilization were measured in
these terms, then native societies must be savage. For British
Columbians of European background, the conclusion was obvious, and the
rhetoric surrounding civilization, savagery, and unused land awaiting
development was pervasive and uncontested.

and Communication Studies at McGill University, "More widespread than we

During the anti-globalization movement of the early 2000s, [tech
collectives]{.underline} such
as [Riseup](https://riseup.net/) and [Autistici](https://www.autistici.org/) [came
into existence to provide autonomous, non-corporate communication tools
and "How-Tos" for social movements to organize safely and securely with
emerging new media]{.underline}. In South Africa,
the [Right2Know](https://www.r2k.org.za/) campaign was initiated in 2010
in response to the Protection of State Information Bill, which aimed at
weakening the rights of journalists and whistleblowers to access
information. As part of their work, R2K has published [guides for
activists](https://www.r2k.org.za/2020/09/01/digitalsecurity/) to
protect themselves digitally.

To heighten my own digital defense practice, I recently took a virtual
workshop offered by the New York-based [Tech Learning
Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/). This [collective
provides technology education for radical organizers and revolutionary
communities with special attention to underserved groups]{.underline}.
These groups, which design tools and training for activists, are not a
new occurrence. They have an interesting history across varying
political cultures dating back, at the very least, to the national
liberation struggles of the 20th century. Let's take two of these, both
armed struggles.

The first was the work of the section technique (technical branch)
within the Front de Libération Nationale, the movement at the head of
the Algerian struggle against French colonialism. In his essay, "Ici la
voix d'Algérie" ("[This Is the Voice of
Algeria](http://www.campusincamps.ps/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fanon-this-is-the-voice-of-algeria.pdf)"),
Frantz Fanon describes the section technique's secret, mobile shortwave
radio, whose transmitter was mounted on a moving truck that broadcast
revolutionary messages from inside Algeria. [The broadcast included
information on the fighting, the history of the Algerian people,
political and military commentaries, patriotic songs, and religious
sermons encouraging commitment to the country's freedom and
independence]{.underline}. [To listen to the revolutionary broadcast,
most Algerians had to get their hands on radio sets designed by Algerian
radio technicians]{.underline}, who had started opening shops for the
sale of secondhand radio sets. The technicians had innovated in
producing battery-powered radio in a country that, for the most part,
lacked electrification. **[Fanon suggests that the purchase of these
radio sets did not mean "the adoption of a modern technique for getting
news, but the obtaining of access to the only means of entering into
communication with the Revolution, of living with it]{.underline}**."
[In other words, Algerians were not simply listening to the broadcast or
adopting an information technology for narrow instrumental
purposes]{.underline}; [rather, something changed in their disposition
as a result of their participation in the broadcasts as
listeners.]{.underline}

[When French authorities understood the power of the Voice of Algeria as
a force coming from outside the disciplinary mechanism of the colonial
state, they passed a series of laws to prohibit the sale of radio sets
to Algerians in order to restrict their access to the
broadca]{.underline}sts. Further[, as French forces were unable to take
hold of the transmitter---they tried to bomb the truck that carried it,
with no success---the only way to silence this revolutionary voice was
to try to jam the airwaves]{.underline}. [But even with French jamming
attempts, the existence of the revolutionary broadcast was sometimes
more important symbolically than being able to grasp its every word and
sentence]{.underline}. Every evening, "[Algerians would imagine not only
words, but concrete battles," Fanon says, thereby strengthening the
national consciousness]{.underline}. [The Voice of Algeria became a tool
for the revolution not only through its technical branch---that is, its
broadcast content---but also performatively, as the mere technical
possibility of the broadcasts, against all odds and attempts to
suppress, confirmed that the revolution was alive]{.underline}.

The second [example comes from the technical committee that supported
the South African national liberation struggle. From the late 1950s
until the early 1990s, a technical committee developed technical
artifacts and trained freedom fighters and their foreign comrades on how
to use these tools to support the struggle]{.underline}. The technical
committee's approach to science and technology was influenced by major
Cold War events such as the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957. It was not only
state actors, such as the American government, that were influenced by
Sputnik 1, sparking an ambitious scientific and technological research
program that would lead to the creation of the Internet. The launch
would also influence the scientific and technological orientation of a
national liberation movement.

After it was forced into exile, the technical committee and its members
continued to operate in the United Kingdom. [They designed tools for the
people such as "leaflet bombs," harmless leaflet launchers which would
explode in crowded areas and facilitate the mass distribution of
handouts]{.underline}. The first scene from the 2020 film, [Escape from
Pretoria,](https://youtu.be/g6sJ3FOhs8U) is a good representation of how
leaflet bombs worked and how white South Africans and foreigners
especially could use their white privilege for the struggle as they
easily navigated white areas. The committee also created small boxes
containing audio amplifiers connected to tape recorders which would be
left in crowded areas, often in townships, by freedom fighters. Thanks
to a timing device, these boxes would then play a short, five-minute
message once the operative was away.

[Probably the most sophisticated project of the technical committee was
an [encrypted communication
system](https://hackcur.io/operation-vula/) that allowed freedom
fighters to communicate secretly and transnationally between South
Africa, Zambia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Canada in the
late 1980s. Over almost a decade, the technical committee experimented
with newly available technologies of the time such as
telematics]{.underline} (combining computers and telephones), computer
programming, and encryption, while at the same time training freedom
fighters and their comrades to operate such systems. These communication
systems later came to be included in Operation Vula in the mid-1980s, an
operation that aimed to launch a people's war.

[These two examples show how contemporary tech collectives are rooted in
a wider history of technical skills, tools, and groups supporting past
and current struggles]{.underline}. In fact, the practical investment of
national liberation struggles with science, technology, and
communication are practices that might be more widespread than we think.
[Only by digging further into these radical science and technology
traditions across varying political cultures will we have access to a
different set of materials and ideas to think about what revolutionary
science, technology, and communications can]{.underline}
[do]{.underline}.
