[The 2022 Strategic Concept highlights new cybersecurity, **climate
change**, **authoritarian governance** and other **non-military**
threats]{.underline} as well. [Climate change was mentioned only
once]{.underline} in the 2010 Strategic Concept. But [in the 2022
version, it is mentioned 11 times, including the **ambitious statement**
that NATO should "become the **leading international** organization when
it comes to]{.underline} understanding and adapting to [the impact of
climate change on security]{.underline}." [Additional attention
is]{.underline} also **[given to cyberattacks]{.underline}**. The
alliance reaffirmed its longstanding policy that [a]{.underline}
"[single]{.underline} [or cumulative set of malicious **cyber
activities**]{.underline}; [or hostile operations to, from, or **within
space**]{.underline}" [could prompt NATO to **trigger its Article 5**
mutual defense clause]{.underline} --- another measure directed first
and foremost toward Russia and China and intended to deter cyberattacks
causing physical damage, as otherwise the alliance would be skeptical of
triggering Article 5 because of a cyberattack. Finally, [the 2022
Strategic Concept on **several occasions** notes the challenge to the
alliance's **interests and values** posed by **advancing
authoritarianism**]{.underline} --- a threat not acknowledged directly
in 2010.

NATO's updated [Strategic Concept acknowledges non-military threats such
as identifying and mitigating **strategic vulnerabilities** and
dependencies, including with respect to **critical
infrastructure**]{.underline}, [**supply chains** and **health
systems**]{.underline}. [These new threats underscore the increasing
importance of **reliable partners** in geographies **outside the NATO**
alliance such as in Asia, from where the alliance must ensure the
stability and security of supplies of **critical components** and
**resources**.]{.underline}

[Innovative technologies face the dilemma of military leaders who are
uncertain of their possible benefits versus their potential
risks]{.underline}. Yet the pacing gap has kept military leadership from
confronting this dilemma in a timely manner. Tactical Assault Kit can
form the base of a future communication platform for NATO SOF. However,
this [vision for the future will only be feasible if the need for
connectivity among NATO special operations forces is persistently
socialized and eventually accepted]{.underline}. **[NATO Special
Operations Headquarters can function as a key hub of this socialization
process]{.underline}**. As a premier NATO special operations
schoolhouse, [it trains and educates member states special operations
soldiers in areas including communication technology. Such education can
focus on learning the basics of emerging technology and how to employ
those unique technical capabilities]{.underline}. **[By creating a
consensus for a way ahead]{.underline}** and also facilitating basic
courses via their schoolhouse in Belgium, [NATO special operations
forces as a whole might be able to step into the future outfitted with
the best possible means of fighting in an increasingly complex world of
near-peer competitors and hostile networks]{.underline}.

### 2AC \-\-- Unity = Fake

However, the **[cracks are beginning to show with one commentator
suggesting the thinly veiled family photo may not be one of a happy
alliance]{.underline}**. Matthew Karnitschnig, Politico\'s chief
European correspondent who was at the summit, said: "[Look beyond the
staged backslapping, bonhomie and self-congratulation in
Madrid]{.underline}, however, and one can see **[that while the
alliance's unity might be a mile wide, it's also only an inch
deep]{.underline}**, its collective sense of purpose as varied as its 30
members." Much discussion has arisen over the financial commitment seen
by NATO members. In fact, at one point, Mr Trump threatened to pull out
of the alliance as a matter of point, resulting in a quick pledge by
members to increase their spending. **[Germany, France and the UK have
all hinted at increasing defence spending over the next
decade,]{.underline}** with the UK aiming to hit 2.5 percent of GDP
following pressure by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace to increase the
budget. The US is still by far the largest contributor to the alliance,
with around 3.5 percent of its GDP dedicated to defence.

### 2AC \-\-- N/L \-\-- Spending 

#### \$1B in cyber and AI now -- aff is a part of the budget

**Miller 6/29**/22 \[Maggie, cybersecurity reporter for POLITICO; "NATO
establishes program to coordinate rapid response to cyberattacks";

[NATO member countries on Wednesday agreed in Madrid to create a new
program to quickly respond to cyberattacks.]{.underline}

Russian threat: The "virtual rapid response cyber capability" comes
after months of Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine as part of the war and
amid concerns that Moscow may target the United States and other NATO
countries in retaliation for assistance to Ukraine.

The program is voluntary. According to a fact sheet put out by the White
House on Wednesday, the U.S. will offer "robust national capabilities"
to support this program.

There's more: NATO also announced a separate package of cyber assistance
to Ukraine. Neither NATO nor the White House immediately responded to
questions about the scope of the new programs.

New strategy: [In a new strategy document, NATO reaffirmed a 2021
commitment that a cyberattack could (but would not automatically)
trigger Article 5]{.underline} of the North Atlantic Treaty, which would
make it an attack against the alliance as a whole. It also pledged to
work with the private sector to counter threats, formally recognized
threats in cyberspace posed by Russia and China, and promised to update
NATO's command structure to reflect new cyber threats.

More research funds: Officials speaking prior to the strategy's release
on the condition that they not be identified told POLITICO that
**[NATO's new strategy will include over \$1 billion to fund research
into emerging technologies]{.underline}** including quantum computing
and artificial intelligence..

### 2AC\-\--N/L\-\--AI Logistics 

#### AI logistics uncontroversial 

**Franke 21** \[Ulrike, Senior policy fellow at the European Council on
Foreign Relations; "ARTIFICIAL DIVIDE: HOW EUROPE AND AMERICA COULD
CLASH OVER AI"; January 2021; DOA: 7/23/22;
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep29123>; Lowell-ES\]

However, military **[AI includes many non-controversial uses, such as
'sustainment', which encompasses logistics]{.underline}** as well as
support activities such as financial management, personnel services, and
health care. AI helps make these services more efficient and
cost-effective; for example, predictive maintenance helps in monitoring
a system, such as an aircraft, and can do things such as use various
sensory inputs and data analysis to predict when parts of a system will
need to be replaced. Equally, **[AI can help improve
logistics']{.underline}** efficiency by, for instance, ensuring that
supplies are delivered in appropriate quantities and at the right time.
Transatlantic [cooperation in this field is uncontroversial, but
extremely useful -- especially when carried out within
NATO]{.underline}, as this could h**[elp bring allies closer together,
establish joint procedures, and thereby ensure
interoperability.]{.underline}**

### 2AC\-\--N/L\-\--Pressure 

#### US pressure undermines cohesion -- the plan pushes the [fine line]{.underline}

**Schnaufer 21** \[Tad, doctoral candidate in Security Studies at the

**[It may seem that these tensions and fears will only lead to negative
outcomes, but some disunity within an alliance can yield positive
results]{.underline}**. Several articles researching the implications of
free-riding and burdening-sharing in alliances have supported this
notion. In Olson and Zeckhauser's seminal article on burden-sharing,
they wrote, "This fact leads to the paradoxical conclusion that a
decline in the amity, unity, and community of interest among allies need
not necessarily reduce the effectiveness of an alliance..." and "[The
United States, at least, should perhaps not hope for too much unity in
common ventures with other nations. It might prove extremely
expensive]{.underline}." Similarly, Plumper and Neumayer note in
reference to the smaller allies (non-US allies), "Unless the interests
of alliance members are independent, the existence of NATO allows the
smaller allies to free-ride to some extent."

### 2AC\-\--AT: I/L\-\--Forward Defense Fails 

#### Current NATO policy doesn't solve Ukraine -- only the aff does 

**Mengelkamp et al 7/27** \[Lukas Mengelkamp, historian based at the
University of Marburg / Alexander Graef, Researcher at the Institute for
Peace Research and Security Policy / Ulrich Kuhn, nonresident scholar at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; "A CONFIDENCE-BUILDING
DEFENSE FOR NATO"; JUNE 27, 2022;

Accessed 7/23/22; Lowell-ES\]

**[The problem with forward defense, however, is that while it sounds
good, it is not clear what it would mean in practice, or how it would
play out against the many divergences and disagreements between NATO
members.]{.underline}** Instead, [allies should embrace a strategy of
confidence-building defense]{.underline}. To revive this late Cold War
concept, NATO's eastern members would create a highly mobile net of
dispersed artillery, while more powerful European allies would build and
supply heavy weapons depots in those countries, then prepare to rapidly
deploy significant forces in case of a crisis. This approach would
enable European allies to contribute to their own security, lessen
first-strike pressures, and avoid deepening a dangerous new security
dilemma with Russia.

N[o matter how confident allies seem to be about NATO's current unity,
there are a number of key uncertainties that could make forward defense
difficult to implement effectively.]{.underline} If Russia's military
continues to struggle in Ukraine, or if America's commitment to European
security falters again, [NATO would benefit from a more flexible, less
forward strategy.]{.underline}
