JAKARTA, Indonesia --- The [[Chinese military]{.mark} **has become
significantly** [more]{.mark} aggressive and [dangerous]{.mark} over the
past five years, the top [U.S. military]{.mark} officer [said]{.mark}
during a trip to the Indo-Pacific that included a stop Sunday in
Indonesia. Gen. Mark [Milley,]{.mark} chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said the number of [intercepts by]{.mark} **Chinese** [aircraft
and ships]{.mark} in the Pacific region [with U.S]{.mark}. and other
partner forces has [increased significantly]{.mark} over that time, and
the number of [unsafe interactions]{.mark} [has risen]{.mark} by similar
proportions. "[The message is the Chinese]{.mark} military, in the air
and at sea, have become significantly [more]{.mark} and noticeably more
[aggressive]{.mark} in this particular region," said
Milley,]{.underline} who recently asked his staff to compile details
about interactions between China and the U.S. and others in the region.
His comments came as the U.S. redoubles its efforts to strengthen its
relationships with Pacific nations as a counterbalance to China, which
is trying to expand its presence and influence in the region. The Biden
**[[administration considers China its "pacing
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**" and [America's primary]{.mark} long-term
[security challenge]{.mark}. Milley's trip to the region is sharply
focused on the China threat. He will attend a meeting of Indo-Pacific
chiefs of defense this week in Sydney, Australia, where key topics will
be China's escalating military growth and the need to maintain a free,
open and peaceful Pacific[[. U.S. military]{.mark} officials have also
[raised alarms]{.mark} [about]{.mark} the possibility that [China could
invade Taiwan]{.mark},]{.underline} the democratic, self-ruled island
that Beijing views as a breakaway province[. [China]{.underline}]{.mark}
has **[[stepped up]{.underline}]{.mark}** its [[military
provocations]{.underline}]{.mark} against Taiwan as it looks to
intimidate it into unifying with the communist mainland. [U.S. military
[officials]{.mark} have [said Beijing]{.mark} wants to be [ready
to]{.mark} make a [move]{.mark} on the island **[by 2027]{.mark}**. The
U.S. remains Taiwan's chief ally and supplier of defense weapons. U.S.
law requires the government to treat all threats to the island as
matters of "grave concern," but remains [ambiguous on]{.mark} whether
[the U.S.]{.mark} military [would defend Taiwan]{.mark} if it were
attacked by China.]{.underline} [[China's top]{.mark} military
[officer]{.mark}, Gen. Li Zuocheng told Milley in a July 7 call
that]{.underline} [[Beijing had "no room for compromise"]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} issues such as [Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline} He said he told
Milley that the U.S. must "cease U.S.-Taiwan military collusion and
avoid impacting China-U.S. ties and stability in the Taiwan Strait." The
U.S. and others are also worried that a recent security agreement that
Beijing signed in April with the Solomon Islands could lead to the
establishment of a Chinese naval base in the South Pacific. The U.S. and
Australia have told the Solomon Islands that hosting a Chinese military
base would not be tolerated. "This is an area in which China is trying
to do outreach for their own purposes. And again, this is concerning
because China is not doing it just for benign reasons," Milley told
reporters traveling with him. "**[[They're trying to expand their
influence throughout the region.]{.underline}]{.mark}** And that has
potential consequences that are not necessarily favorable to our allies
and partners in the region." Milley's visit to Indonesia is the first by
a U.S. joint chiefs chairman since Adm. Mike Mullen in 2008. But U.S.
leaders have crisscrossed the Asia-Pacific in recent months, including
high-profile visits by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of
State Antony Blinken. The [Biden]{.underline} administration has [[been
taking steps to expand its military and security]{.underline}]{.mark}
relationship with Indo-Pacific nations as part of a campaign to build a
stronger network of alliances in China's backyard **[[and counter
China's growing influence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Milley]{.mark}
declined to provide specific numbers of unsafe Chinese interactions with
U.S. and allied aircraft and ships. But Austin, in a speech in Singapore
last month, [[referred to an "alarming increase]{.mark}" [in]{.mark} the
number of [unsafe intercepts by]{.mark} **[P]{.mark}eople's
[L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy**]{.underline} aircraft and vessels.
[Austin specifically pointed to a February incident where a PLA navy
ship directed a laser at an Australian P-8 maritime patrol aircraft. But
there have been a number of others. A surveillance aircraft controlled
by Canada was recently intercepted by a Chinese fighter in international
airspace]{.underline}. [And U.S. ships are routinely dogged by Chinese
aircraft and vessels during transits, particularly around manmade
islands claimed by Beijing in the South China Sea. Milley said there
have been Chinese intercepts with Japan, Canada, Australia, Philippines
and Vietnam. They all, he said, have seen a "statistically significant"
increase in intercepts, and the number of unsafe incidents has increased
by an "equal proportion." Milley, who will meet with Gen. Andika
Perkasa, chief of the Indonesian National Defence Forces, said Pacific
nations like Indonesia want the U.S. military involved and engaged in
the region.]{.underline} "We want to work with them to develop
interoperability and modernize our militaries collectively," Milley
said, in order to ensure they can "meet whatever challenge that China
poses." He said Indonesia is strategically critical to the region, and
has long been a key U.S. partner. Earlier this year, the U.S approved a
\$13.9 billion sale of advanced fighter jets to Indonesia. And in
Jakarta last December, Blinken signed agreements for enhanced joint
naval exercises between the U.S. and Indonesia. China has condemned U.S.
efforts to expand its outreach in the region, accusing America of trying
to build an "Asian NATO." During a speech in Singapore, Austin rejected
that claim. "We do not seek a new Cold War, an Asian NATO or a region
split into hostile blocs," he said.
