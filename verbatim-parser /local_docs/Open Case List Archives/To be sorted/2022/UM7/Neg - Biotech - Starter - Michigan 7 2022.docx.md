#### Bio-d's [not existential]{.underline} and try-or-die is [wrong]{.underline}. Nature's a [luxury]{.underline}, not a [necessity]{.underline}. 

**Keim, 19**---freelance journalist whose work has appeared in
publications including The Atlantic, WIRED, National Geographic News,
Aeon, Nautilus, Scientific American Mind, The Guardian, Audubon
Magazine, Grist, Mother Jones, Conservation, NOVA, and Anthropocene

A slogan's purpose, of course, isn't to capture nuance. But there are
ways in which [this **[save-it-or-die]{.mark}** framing
**[rankles]{.mark}**]{.underline}, beginning with the fact that, [at
precisely the same time as **so many** wild lives are
**imperiled**]{.underline}, [**billions** of people are enjoying
**historically unprecedented** prosperity and health]{.underline}. That
is not to say that economic well-being automatically flows from
[nature's destruction]{.underline}, or that future well-being requires
it, but simply that it **[has not]{.underline}** yet [**precluded**
human flourishing]{.underline}.

Returning to megafauna and fire, [Earth is **more
fire-prone**]{.underline} than it once was, [but people have
**managed**]{.underline} --- not without suffering, often with
difficulty, but managed all the same. [The [depletion of
**whale**]{.mark}]{.underline} population**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.mark} **terrestrial [megafauna]{.mark}** reduced nutrient
flows]{.underline} from the deep sea and across landscapes [to a
**trickle**]{.underline}, [but the consequences [were **not
catastrophic**]{.mark}]{.underline} for us. Indeed, [the state of
[nature]{.mark}]{.underline} that conservationists hope to protect, and
present in terms of human self-interest, [[has]{.mark} **already
[been]{.mark} radically [transformed]{.mark}** from just a few thousand
years ago]{.underline} --- not just because of the late Pleistocene mass
extinctions, but also because of the dwindling of what and who remains.

Global **[[turtle]{.underline}]{.mark}**
population**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to pick one little-appreciated
example, [have **[collapsed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Not long ago they
existed in densities that, in terms of total per-hectare biomass, often
outweighed that of African savannah herbivores like elephant and
giraffes. Now turtles "are struggling to persist in the modern world,"
as a recent scientific review described their plight. "Their ecological
roles are now greatly diminished," and "The impacts of their lessened
roles are poorly appreciated and inadequately understood."
[**[Perhaps]{.mark}** the loss of all [that]{.mark}]{.underline} habitat
engineering (many turtles dig burrows that are used by other creatures
and contribute to long-term soil enrichment), seed dispersal, and
nutrient cycling has [**[diminished]{.mark}** human [well-being]{.mark}
in **significant** ways]{.underline}, [but [it's a **hard
arg**]{.mark}**ument** to make right now]{.underline}.

[It is **possible**]{.underline}, of course, [[that the
effects]{.underline}]{.mark} of turtle decline --- and amphibian decline
and bat decline and insect decline and megafauna decline, and on and on
--- [[have not]{.mark} yet [been]{.mark} **fully
[realized]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} that human [societies
are running on a]{.mark} biological]{.underline}
"**[[surplus]{.underline}]{.mark}**" banked over hundreds of millions of
years. By this light, just as people will eventually run out of fuels
derived from whole geological epochs' worth of fossilized plankton and
vegetable matter, so might we exhaust soils nourished by organismal
activity or air filtered by forest communities now missing animals who
once planted their seeds.

Alternatively, one could argue that although even a diminished biosphere
was enough to sustain human prosperity, the current 7.7 billion humans
[and]{.underline} 70 billion domesticated animals they exploit for food
[have **[pushed]{.mark}** that]{.underline} sustenance [[to its
**limits**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Taking these [precautionary
approaches]{.underline}, however, [is **not**]{.underline} quite [the
same as **directly equating** human health]{.underline}, security, and
prosperity [with]{.underline} a recent snapshot of nature --- especially
when that version of "nature" is implicitly equated with **[biological
diversity]{.underline}** and abundance, and even as so much of what we
take from the biosphere comes from simplified ecosystems.

[Tree [plantations **still sequester**]{.mark} carbon dioxide and exhale
oxygen [while generating **wood**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Defaunated
wetlands **still filter**]{.mark} water [and **buffer**]{.mark} against
storms]{.underline}. [[Most]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
**[[food]{.underline}]{.mark}** we eat [[comes from]{.underline}]{.mark}
comparatively [[**low-diversity**
**crop**]{.underline}]{.mark}land**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Restoring]{.underline}, say, **[soil biodiversity]{.underline}** to the
plains of central North America, the world's most productive
agricultural landscape, [is more about **reducing chemical use** and
**changing farming techniques** to ensure]{.underline} their [long-term
productivity than returning them to their **former prairie
glory**]{.underline}.

To be sure, these [human-directed systems are often **less
multifunctional** than higher-biodiversity systems]{.underline}.
[Monoculture tree plantations]{.underline} store less carbon than wild
forests, [and defaunated wild forests store **less carbon**]{.underline}
than those with intact animal communities. [But conceiving of engineered
ecosystems in terms of **[resource yield]{.mark}** and a few other
metrics [is]{.mark} **terribly [reductionist]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Arguably]{.underline}, [[the]{.mark} greatest service]{.underline} of
all [is]{.underline} the **[long-term [stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that [intact ecologies]{.underline} provide. Species interactions
[and]{.underline} functional [redundancies]{.underline}
[help]{.underline} ecosystems --- and ultimately [the
biosphere]{.underline} itself --- **[adapt]{.underline}** to
environmental fluctuations, regrouping and supporting complex
arrangements of life even when Earth's climate changes or an asteroid
strikes.

[Yet that]{.underline} particular [[service **isn't one that
maps**]{.mark} **neatly** [onto]{.mark}]{.underline} short-term [[human
interests in **wood**]{.mark} **production**]{.underline}, **[clean
[water]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[or **fisheries**]{.mark}
**yield**]{.underline}. And [to **casually say** those benefits come
from]{.underline} "[nature]{.underline}" **[erodes]{.underline}**, or at
least blurs, [what conservationists want to **protect**]{.underline}:
[forms of nature]{.underline} in which communities and processes [found
in the **absence** of humans]{.underline} remain largely intact, and
where human activity doesn't divert their yields without nourishing more
nonhuman life in return. [To view]{.underline}, say, the pollination of
commodity crops by managed **[honeybees]{.underline}** trucked
cross-country [as an example of nature's bounty would be to **diminish**
nature]{.underline}.

This critique is not intended to downplay the hardships caused by
nature's decline and destruction. The recent Intergovernmental
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)
report, which estimated that one in eight species of plants and animals
is now threatened with extinction, enumerates them well. Nature indeed
"sustains the quality of the air, fresh water and soils on which
humanity depends, distributes fresh water, regulates the climate,
provides pollination and pest control and reduces the impact of natural
hazards," and the impacts of ecological disruption are felt most by
people who possess the least.

Ultimately, though, [[human ingenuity can **substitute**]{.mark} for
many of nature's services]{.underline}. [The [results might be
**unpleasant**]{.mark}]{.underline} in many ways --- I'd much rather
rely on bats and earthworms than pesticides and fertilizers ---
[[but]{.mark} they're **[rarely]{.mark} an [existential]{.mark} threat**
to human societies]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} vast,
[**fertilizer-fueled Gulf of Mexico dead zone** is]{.underline} a
**[horrible]{.underline}**, shameful thing and has inflicted hardship on
many people, [but]{.underline} southeastern U.S. coastal [communities
**have not collapsed** because of it]{.underline}.

**Pinker 18** -- Steven Arthur Pinker is a Canadian-American cognitive
psychologist, Professor at Harvard University. \[Enlightenment Now: The
Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, Viking, Penguin
Group\]//BPS

[[Biological agents]{.mark} are **particularly [ill-suited]{.mark}** [to
terrorists, whose goal]{.mark}]{.underline}, recall,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} not damage but
**[[theater]{.underline}]{.mark}** (chapter 13).58 The biologist Paul
Ewald notes that [natural selection among pathogens **works
against**]{.underline} the terrorist's goal of [sudden and spectacular
devastation]{.underline}. 59 Germs that depend on rapid person-to-person
contagion, like the common-cold virus, are selected to keep their hosts
alive and ambulatory so they can shake hands with and sneeze on as many
people as possible. Germs get greedy and kill their hosts only if they
have some other way of getting from body to body, like mosquitoes (for
malaria), a contaminable water supply (for cholera), or trenches packed
with injured soldiers (for the 1918 Spanish flu). Sexually transmitted
pathogens, like HIV and syphilis, are somewhere in between, needing a
long and symptomless incubation period during which hosts can infect
their partners, after which the germs do their damage. [[**Virulence**
and **contagion**]{.underline}]{.mark} thus **[[trade
off]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [the **evolution of germs** will
**frustrate the terrorist's aspiration** to launch a headline-worthy
epidemic that is]{.underline} both [swift and lethal]{.underline}.
Theoretically, a bioterrorist could try to bend the curve with a
pathogen that is virulent, contagious, and durable enough to survive
outside bodies. But [[breeding]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[a
**fine-tuned germ**]{.mark} would [require **Nazi-like
experiments**]{.mark} **[on living humans]{.mark}** that even
terrorists]{.underline} (to say nothing of teenagers) [are [unlikely to
carry off]{.mark}]{.underline}. It may be more than just luck that [the
world]{.underline} so far [has seen just **one successful bioterror
attack**]{.underline} (the 1984 tainting of salad with salmonella in an
Oregon town by the Rajneeshee religious cult, **[which killed no
one]{.underline}**) and one spree killing (the 2001 anthrax mailings,
which killed five).60 To be sure, advances in synthetic biology, such as
the gene-editing technique CRISPR-Cas9, make it easier to tinker with
organisms, including pathogens. But [[it's difficult to re-engineer a
complex evolved trait by inserting **a gene**]{.mark} **or
two**]{.underline}, since the effects of any gene are intertwined with
the rest of the organism's genome. [Ewald notes, "[**I don't think that
we are close** to understanding how]{.mark} to insert combinations of
genetic variants in any given pathogen that act in concert to generate
high transmissibility and stably high virulence for
humans."]{.underline}61 The biotech expert Robert Carlson adds that "one
of the problems with building any flu virus is that you need to keep
your production system (cells or eggs) alive long enough to make a
useful quantity of something that is trying to kill that production
system. . . . Booting up the resulting virus is still very, very
difficult. . . . I would not dismiss this threat completely, but frankly
I am much more worried about what Mother Nature is throwing at us all
the time."62 And crucially, [[advances in biology work the other way as
well]{.mark}: they]{.underline} also [[make it easier for the good
guys]{.mark} \[public protectors\]]{.underline} (and there are many more
of them) [[to identify pathogens, invent antibiotics]{.mark} that
overcome **a**nti**b**iotic **r**esistance, [and **rapidly
develop**]{.mark} **vaccines**]{.underline}.63 [An example
is]{.underline} the [Ebola]{.underline} vaccine, developed in the waning
days of the 2014--15 emergency, after public health efforts had capped
the toll at twelve thousand deaths rather than the millions that the
media had foreseen. Ebola thus joined a list of other falsely predicted
pandemics such as Lassa fever, hantavirus, SARS, mad cow disease, bird
flu, and swine flu.64 Some of them never had the potential to go
pandemic in the first place because they are contracted from animals or
food rather than in an exponential tree of person-to-person infections.
Others were nipped by medical and public health interventions. Of course
no one knows for sure whether an evil genius will someday overcome the
world's defenses and loose a plague upon the world for fun, vengeance,
or a sacred cause. But [journalistic habits and the Availability and
[Negativity biases **inflate the odds**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is
why I have taken Sir Martin up on his bet. By the time you read this you
may know who has won.65

Challenges to Myth 5 [There are two dimensions to Myth 5. The first is
about the intention of would-be terrorists]{.underline}, [and the
assumption is that terrorists would seek to produce mass casualty
weapons and pursue capabilities on the scale of twentieth century
state-level bioweapons programs.]{.underline} While [[most]{.mark}
leading [bio]{.mark}logical disarmament [and non-prolif]{.mark}eration
[experts believe]{.mark}]{.underline} that the risk of a small-scale
bioterrorism attack is very real and very present, they consider **[[the
risk of]{.mark} sophisticated large-scale [bioterror]{.mark}ism attacks
[to be very small]{.mark}]{.underline}** (65). [[This is **backed up by
historical evidence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The three confirmed
attempts to use biological agents against humans in terrorist
[attacks]{.mark} in the past [were small]{.mark}-scale]{.underline},
[[low casualty events]{.mark} aimed at causing panic, and disruption
rather than]{.underline} [excessive death tolls]{.underline}: (i) the
Rajneesh cult's use of Salmonella on salad bars in local restaurants to
sicken potential voters and make them stay away from the polls during
Oregon elections in 1984; (ii) the 1990--95 attempted use of botulinum
toxin and anthrax by the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo cult; (iii) and the
"anthrax letters" sent to media outlets and members of US Congress in
2001 resulting in at least 22 cases of anthrax, five of which were fatal
(66, 67). [The second dimension to Myth 5 is the implicit assumption
that [producing]{.mark} [a pathogen]{.mark}ic organism [equates
producing a w]{.mark}eapon [of]{.mark} [m]{.mark}ass
[d]{.mark}estruction.]{.underline} [**[It does not]{.underline}**.
[Considerable]{.underline}]{.mark} [knowledge and [resources are]{.mark}
[necessary for]{.mark} the processes of [scaling up, storage, and
developing a]{.mark} suitable [dissemination
method]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [These]{.underline}]{.mark} [processes
[present]{.mark} **[significant]{.mark} technical and [logistical
barriers]{.mark}**[. Drawing from her in-depth study]{.mark} of the
Iraqi, Soviet, and US bioweapons programs]{.underline} (3, 4), Ben
Ouagrham-[[Gormley explains: Scaling up]{.mark} fragile
[microorganisms]{.mark}]{.underline} that are sensitive to environmental
conditions and susceptible to change --- and viruses are more sensitive
than bacteria --- [[has been one of the stiffest challenges]{.mark} for
past bioweapons programs to overcome, [even]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
appropriate [expertise]{.mark} at hand.]{.underline} [Scaling-up
requires a gradual approach]{.underline}, moving from laboratory sample,
to a larger laboratory quantity, to pilot-scale production, and then to
even larger-scale production. During each stage, the production
parameters need to be tested and often modified to maintain the lethal
qualities of the agent; the entire scaling-up process can take several
years (68). [The [dissemination]{.mark} of biological agents [also
poses]{.mark} difficult technical [challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Whereas persistent chemical agents such as sulfur mustard and VX nerve
gas are readily absorbed through the intact skin, no bacteria and
viruses can enter the body via that route unless the skin has already
been broken. Biological agents must either be ingested or inhaled to
cause infection. [To expose large numbers of people]{.underline} through
the gastrointestinal tract, [possible means of delivery are
contamination of food and drinking water, yet neither of these scenarios
would be easy to accomplish.]{.underline} [Large urban reservoirs are
usually unguarded, but unless terrorists added massive quantities of
biological agent, the dilution effect would be so great that no healthy
person drinking the water would receive an infectious dose]{.underline}
(66). Moreover, [modern sanitary techniques such as chlorination and
filtration are designed to kill pathogens from natural sources and would
probably be equally effective against a deliberately released
agent.]{.underline} [Bacterial contamination of the food supply is also
unlikely to inflict mass casualties.]{.underline} Cooking, boiling,
pasteurization, and other routine safety precautions are generally
sufficient to kill pathogenic bacteria. The most likely way to inflict
mass casualties with a biological agent is by disseminating it as a
respirable aerosol: an invisible cloud of infectious droplets or
particles so tiny that they remain suspended in the air for long periods
and can be inhaled by large numbers of people. A high-concentration
aerosol of B. anthracis or some other pathogen, released into the air in
a densely populated urban area, could potentially infect thousands of
victims simultaneously. After an incubation period of a few days,
depending on the type of agent and the inhaled dose, the exposed
population would experience an outbreak of an incapacitating or fatal
illness. [Although [aerosol delivery]{.mark} is potentially the most
lethal way of delivering a biological attack, **it [involves major
technical hurdles that most terrorists would be unlikely to
overcome]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To infect through the lungs, infectious
particles must be microscopic in size -- between 1 and 5 μm in diameter.
[Terrorists would]{.underline} therefore [have to develop or acquire a
sophisticated delivery system capable of generating an aerosol
cloud]{.underline} with the necessary particle size range and a high
enough agent concentration to cover a broad area. Overall, an important
trade-off exists between ease of production and effectiveness of
dissemination. The easiest way to produce microbial agents is in a
liquid form, yet when such a "slurry" is sprayed into the air, it forms
heavy droplets that fall to the ground so that only a small percentage
of the agent is aerosolized. In contrast, if the bacteria are first
dried to a solid cake and then milled into a fine powder, they become
far easier to aerosolize, yet the drying and milling process is
technically difficult. The Aum Shinrikyo cult struggled with
dissemination (67, 69, 70). In one of its anthrax dissemination
attempts, it sprayed unknown, but probably very large, quantities of a
liquid aerosol (most likely crude culture, unprocessed in any way) of B.
anthracis from the roof of the Aum's headquarters building in Tokyo. For
the dissemination, the Aum set up two sprayers on the roof of the
eight-story building, each within a large round cooling tower. Pipes
were extended from the cooling towers to tanks below, which were filled
with a liquid suspension of B. anthracis. The device worked poorly,
producing large droplets rather than the very fine aerosol needed for
effective transmission of anthrax. It also appears the spore
concentration was very low (at least five orders of magnitude below that
necessary for a highly infectious wet aerosol). In another dissemination
attempt, targeting the area around the Kanagawa prefectural office and
the Imperial Palace, the Aum equipped vehicles with spraying devices,
but according to prosecutors' statements, the nozzle of the sprayer
clogged and the operation failed. Despite its 200 m2 laboratory
containing, amongst other equipment, a glove box, incubator, centrifuge,
drier, DNA/RNA synthesizer, electron microscope, two fermenters each
having about a 2,000 litre capacity, and an extensive scientific
library, and despite its repeated attempts at dissemination, the Aum was
unsuccessful in causing any disease, and in retrospect it is clear that
the cult did not even make the first substantive step toward an
effective bioweapon. [If, despite the odds, aerosolization was achieved,
the [effective delivery]{.mark} of biological agents in the open air
[is]{.mark} highly [dependent on atmospheric]{.mark} and wind
[conditions, creating additional uncertainties]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Only under highly stable atmospheric conditions would the aerosol cloud
remain close to the ground where it can be inhaled, rather than being
rapidly dispersed]{.underline}. Moreover, most [[microorganisms are
**sensitive to
u**]{.underline}]{.mark}ltra**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**iolet
[[radiation and cannot survive]{.mark}]{.underline} more than 30 min
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} bright [[sunlight]{.underline},]{.mark}
limiting their use to night-time attacks. One major exception is
anthrax, which can be induced to form spores with tough outer coats that
enable them to survive for several hours in sunlight. Terrorists could,
of course, stage a biological attack inside an enclosed space such as a
building, a subway station, a shopping mall, or a sports arena. Such an
attack, if it involved a respiratory aerosol, might infect thousands of
people, but even here the technical hurdles would by no means be
trivial. [Finally, even if a biological weapon had been disseminated
successfully, the outcome of an attack would be affected by factors like
the health of the people who are exposed to the agent]{.underline}, [and
the speed and manner with which public health authorities and medical
professionals detected and were able to respond to the resulting
outbreak.]{.underline} [[A prompt response with]{.mark} effective
medical [countermeasures]{.mark}, such as antibodies and
vaccination]{.underline}, [**[can significantly blunt the impact of an
attack]{.underline}**. [Simple, proven ways]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
curtail epidemics, such as wearing face masks, hand washing, and
avoiding hospitals where transmission rates might soar, [can]{.mark}
also [prove effective in stemming]{.mark} [the spread]{.mark} of a
disease]{.underline}. Indeed, this aspect of a bioterrorism attack is
often underplayed in scenarios like Tara O'Toole's "Dark Winter" and
"Atlantic Storm," where the rates of contagion used are often
significantly higher than those in historical cases of natural outbreaks
(71).

Second, with new technologies there is the potential for such tools to

technologies bring new challenges. CRISPR, gene editing
technology]{.underline} is currently seen as a particular source of
promise and peril, [which purportedly enables "even largely untrained

into a decontamination chamber]{.underline}, which showers a mix of
chemicals over their suits to decontaminate anything that may be on the
surface. From the chemical shower, they go through an inner changing
room, where they take off the suit and everything worn beneath it. The
clothing worn in the lab under the spacesuit is treated as a potentially
contaminated material, and thoroughly decontaminated before being
laundered. Next, lab workers must take a personal shower before entering
an outer changing area, where they can then dress into street clothes.

### AT: Food Shortages

#### Russia's war guarantees price spikes and fertilizer shortages -- makes their impact inevitable. 

**Lu \'3/24** \[Christina, 3/24/2022, \"Russia's Invasion Unleashes
'Perfect Storm' in Global Agriculture,\"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/24/russia-war-ukraine-food-crisis-wheat-fertilizer/\]

[[Russia's invasion of Ukraine threatens to spark a global food
crisis,]{.mark} as]{.underline} simultaneous disruptions [to harvests
and global fertilizer production are driving up]{.underline} food
[prices]{.underline} and sending economic shock waves throughout the
world.

After a month of war, economists and aid agencies say [the world is
facing merging crises that could rapidly spiral into a global food
emergency]{.underline}. [[The conflict]{.mark} has already
[slashed]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian and Ukrainian [[exports of crucial
commodities]{.underline}]{.mark} such as wheat, sunflower oil, and corn,
a disturbance that has rippled across import-reliant countries in the
Middle East and North Africa. At the same time, [[the ongoing energy
crunch has]{.mark} drastically [increased fertilizer prices and
transportation costs]{.mark}, squeezing the key inputs]{.underline} for
global agricultural production.

[[These disruptions have converged]{.mark} in a **"perfect
storm**]{.underline}," said Ertharin Cousin, a distinguished fellow at
the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and former executive director of
the World Food Program. "[That could result [in]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
**cataclysmic [spike]{.mark}** [in food prices]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Together, Russia and Ukraine account for roughly 30 percent of global
wheat exports, while Russia is the world's top fertilizer exporter. Both
fertilizer and food prices have already climbed to record levels as the
war impedes shipments and Western sanctions hit Russia. In the early
weeks of the conflict, Kyiv also banned exports of wheat and other key
food staples, while Moscow urged its fertilizer producers to temporarily
suspend exports.

In the coming months, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture
Organization estimates that food prices could surge by as much as 20
percent, a significant spike that could exacerbate global food
insecurity. Nearly 283 million people in 81 countries currently face
acute food insecurity or are at high risk, according to the World Food
Program, with 45 million on the brink of famine.

[Russia's invasion could be a "tipping point" into a world hunger
crisis]{.underline}, Cousin said: "The entire global community will be
hard hit by this."

Rising food prices could also fuel political instability in
import-reliant countries. Food prices and political unrest have
historically been correlated with one another: A decade ago,
skyrocketing grain costs---which drove bread prices up by 37 percent in
Egypt---contributed to the Arab Spring. Earlier in 2008, spiraling
prices spurred global riots and protests.

"People will react when they're hungry ... when the cost of food goes so
high that they can't afford the rent," said Catherine Bertini, a
distinguished fellow at the Chicago Council and also a former executive
director of the World Food Program.

Surging prices have already sparked unrest in countries like Sudan,
which imports more than 80 percent of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine.
As bread prices rose, thousands of Sudanese demonstrators faced tear gas
and bullets to protest. In recent weeks, protests have also rocked Iraq
and Greece, where hundreds of farmers demonstrated against soaring
fertilizer prices.

If these economic shocks continue, the instability could spread to other
regions around the world, said Michael Tanchum, an energy expert at the
European Council on Foreign Relations and the Middle East Institute.
"This time around, it won't be just an Arab Spring, it won't be just
North Africa, if measures aren't taken," Tanchum said.

Since [global food [markets were already strained by the]{.mark}
COVID-19 [pandemic]{.mark}, economists say the war's economic fallout
has been particularly painful]{.underline}---and especially so for
nations that are heavily dependent on Russia and Ukraine's supply.
Almost 50 countries rely on Russia and Ukraine for at least 30 percent
of their wheat imports, and 26 depend on them for more than half of
their imports.

"This is compounding an already bad situation," said Chris Barrett, an
agricultural economist at Cornell University. "The real worry right now
is that the perfect storm comes as we still are not out of the woods
from all of the massive economic displacement caused by the pandemic."

[[The ongoing energy crunch]{.mark} has only [intensified]{.mark} these
[pressures as]{.mark} skyrocketing natural [gas prices drive up the
costs of fertilizer]{.mark} production]{.underline}. Natural gas is
required to make both ammonia and urea, key components in nitrogen-based
fertilizers. To cope with these increased costs, some producers have
resorted to slashing production. In March, fertilizer giant Yara
International announced that it would have to operate at about half
capacity in Europe to accommodate rising prices and planned maintenance.

A shock of "this magnitude has not been experienced before," said Svein
Tore Holsether, the CEO of Yara, who noted that roughly 80 percent of
the cost of making nitrogen-based fertilizer comes from energy. "What
we're experiencing now are complete shutdowns of parts of the value
chain."

This disruption has strained countries like Brazil, which relies on
Russia for over one-fifth of its fertilizer imports. Faced with a
shrinking supply, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and
Uruguay pleaded to exclude fertilizer from Western sanctions on Russia
in March. "Brazil depends on fertilizers," Brazilian President Jair
Bolsonaro told reporters. "It's a sacred question for us."

As the cutbacks and shortages bleed into the next planting season,
[experts warn that its impacts will be felt for months to come---and
across a wide range of crops]{.underline}.

[[This fertilizer crunch "is going to impact every production in the
world]{.mark},"]{.underline} said David Laborde, a senior research
fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. "It's not
just wheat."

Aid agencies are now scrambling to secure sufficient funding to support
the world's most at-risk populations. Meeting the global need, however,
may be challenging: In March, the World Food Program announced that it
would need to raise an additional \$71 million per month to purchase
enough food. But as its resources are stretched by the war, the agency
said, it has also been forced to reduce rations for refugees in the
Middle East and Africa.

"We have no choice but to take food from the hungry to feed the
starving," David Beasley, the executive director of the World Food
Program, said in a statement.

["The]{.underline} [Russian attack on Ukraine was an attack on food
insecure people everywhere in the w]{.underline}orld," said Barrett, the
agricultural economist. In the worst-case scenario, he said, "[[we are
going to see tens of millions]{.mark} of people suddenly [facing
famine."]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Ukraine guarantees global food shortages.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/opinion/what-the-war-in-ukraine-means-for-the-worlds-food-supply.html\]

As we watch Ukrainian refugees arrive by car and foot in Poland, it's
hard not to recall World War II, when the region was ravaged by
fighting, famine spread and millions of Ukrainians died of starvation.

We're nowhere near that point; this time, however, [[food disruptions
won't remain an insular crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. [What is happening
in [Ukraine]{.mark} now already [is]{.mark} radiating outward and
[threatening food availability in]{.mark} less prosperous [nations
that]{.mark} have come to [depend on exports]{.mark} of
grains]{.underline} and other food products [[from Ukraine and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The Black Sea]{.mark} region today is [a vital hub of]{.mark} global
[ag]{.mark}ricultural [production and trade]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
Ukraine is one of the world's breadbaskets. After the breakup of the
Soviet Union, Ukraine and Russia were net grain importers. Now [the two
countries account for 29 percent of global exports of
wheat]{.underline}. They also contribute [19 percent of global corn and
80 percent of global sunflower oil]{.underline} exports.

After only days of fighting, global commodity markets have been roiled.
Shipping in the Sea of Azov was brought to a standstill last week. Wheat
futures jumped 12 percent on the Chicago Board of Trade. This increase
topped already inflated prices.

[[Staple grains supply the bulk of the diet for the world's
poorest.]{.mark} Higher prices threaten to place a significant strain on
poor countries]{.underline} like Bangladesh, Sudan and Pakistan,
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2020 [[received]{.mark} roughly
[half]{.mark}]{.underline} or more [[of their wheat from Russia or
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as Egypt and Turkey, which
imported the great majority of their wheat from those combatants.
Nations in the Middle East and North Africa saw food prices spike in
2010 when Ukraine restricted its exports of wheat, squeezing what had
been consistent supplies of food to those countries and contributing to
political instability throughout the region.

[Pandemic-related [supply chain disruptions have already inflated prices
for food]{.mark} and other basic staples]{.underline}. Many low-income
food-importing countries have also seen an increase in malnourishment
rates.

To make matters worse, [[Russia and Belarus]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
staging ground for the invasion and close ally of Russia[,
[are]{.underline}]{.mark} [also [major exporters of
fertilizer]{.mark}]{.underline}, with Russia leading the world; prices,
which were at historically high levels before the war, have spiked.
Fertilizer scarcity jeopardizes global crop production at a time when
some or all of the 13 percent of global corn and 12 percent of global
wheat exports from Ukraine could be lost.

The United Nations' World Food Program warned in November that the world
is facing "catastrophic hunger" for hundreds of millions of people as
the humanitarian organization struggles financially to provide help to
troubled nations. This is especially true in Afghanistan, where famine
looms for millions.

"[[Fuel costs are up, food prices are soaring, fertilizer is more
expensive]{.mark}, and all of this feeds into new crises]{.underline},"
the program's executive director, David Beasley, said at the time.

Now [Russia's invasion of Ukraine has significantly exacerbated those
problems, threatening the security of countries already struggling to
feed their populations]{.underline}.

## AT: Leadership Advantage 

### 1NC - NATO Bad

#### NATO is ineffective and risks a European war with Russia

**Jenkins 2018** - Guardian columnist\
Simon, \"Donald Trump is right. Nato is a costly white elephant,\" Jun
12,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/12/donald-trump-nato-costly-white-elephant-russia

Donald Trump is a pig, a liar, a woman-hater, a racist, a monster of
bombast -- and did I mention a disrupter and total bastard as well? Does
that feel better? Comment on the current US president seems to require a
wallow in the pit of competitive contempt. But it just plays his game.

I regard Trump as an aberration, a temporary trauma afflicting US
politics. He honours the thesis of the historian Arthur Schlesinger,
that America's constitution often drives the republic to the abyss, only
to drag it back again. But even monsters can ask the occasional good
question. Thus Trump this week on Nato, a body so mired in platitude and
waffle it has lost sight of its true purpose. Trump wants to know what
Europe really regards as its defence policy, for he thinks it takes
America for a ride. Nato was founded in 1949 in response to Stalin's
blockade of Berlin. It was meant to "keep the Soviet Union out, the
Americans in, and the Germans down". Since then, it has welcomed the
American nuclear shield, at vast cost to America. Otherwise, its only
military achievements have been the breakup of Yugoslavia and the loss
of a squalid 17-year war in Afghanistan. Neither has anything to do with
the North Atlantic. Nothing better symbolised this than Theresa May's
bizarre gift to Trump this week of 450 British troops for Kabul.

It is astonishing that, three decades after 1989, Europe is almost back
to a cold war with Moscow. As winner of the last war, Nato was primarily
responsible for lowering tension and making peace. Instead it revelled
in victory. If Europe wants to hire an America nuclear shield, it should
deal with America over how to pay for it. But [[the current tit-for-tat
hostilities with Russia are playing with fire]{.mark}, and
counterproductive.]{.underline} [[Europe's land forces are so weak they
would be wiped out by Russia in a matter of days]{.mark}.]{.underline}
So is Europe really expecting Washington to order a nuclear barrage
against Russian "grey area" incursions into the Baltics, let alone a
conflict with Orbán's Hungary or Erdoğan's Turkey -- both Nato members?

This is not realistic, any more than was American intervention during
Russia's incursion in Ukraine or Georgia. That is why Orbán and Erdoğan
are wisely cosying up to Putin[. [Nato is adrift of
realpolitik.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Trump is effectively telling Europe that its [[Nato is as outdated as
the Congress of Vienna]{.mark} by the time of Bismarck.]{.underline} He
is wrong to rabbit on about spending 2% or 4% of GDP on weapons. This
helps no one but the defence industries -- spending should meet
plausible threat, not some vague budget target. But [[no more helpful is
Europe's belligerent posturing towards Moscow,]{.mark} such as Britain's
reaction to the mysterious Wiltshire poisonings]{.underline}.
Entrenching Putin behind a siege economy is not a defence policy.

[[Better to go down the route of detente, recognise Russia's sphere of
influence and be just a little nicer to Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Whatever Trump's motives for advocating this, he is surely right. [[A
sensible Nato would have a firefighting force to handle]{.mark}
separatist and frontier squabbles such as [Kosovo, not a main force
conflict with Russi]{.mark}a.]{.underline}

#### NATO is useless and causes a moral hazard -- best for the US to exit

**Whiton 2018** - Senior Fellow @ the Center for the National Interest\
Christian, \"NATO Is Obsolete,\" Jul 6,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/nato-obsolete-25167?page=0%2C1

After the alliance was established in 1949, its first secretary general,
Lord Hastings Ismay, summed up its purpose concisely: "to keep the
Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down." The unofficial
mission matched the time well: Western Europe's postwar future was
clouded by the prospect of a Soviet invasion, American insularity, or
German militarism---all possible given the preceding decades of history.

Nearly seventy years later, none of these concerns still exist.
Furthermore, NATO\'s opposing alliance during the Cold War, the Warsaw
Pact, quit the Soviet Bloc in 1989, and the Soviet Union itself passed
into history in 1991---twenty-seven years ago.

Despite endless searches for a new mission to justify its massive burden
on U.S. taxpayers, [[NATO has failed to be of much
use]{.underline}]{.mark} since then. As its boosters like to remind us,
after 9/11, the alliance invoked its Article 5 mutual-defense provision
on our behalf. But action from America's allies did not follow the
grandiose gesture---the NATO mission in Afghanistan relied mostly on
U.S. forces and effectively failed.

Today[, [the alliance's bureaucrats]{.mark} and some member states
[spotlight a threat from Russia as a reason for keeping the organization
alive]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with a laundry list of "train and
equip" missions.

[[Yet NATO members\' defense budgets don\'t reflect a real sense of
danger from Russia]{.mark} or anyone else]{.underline}. Among the
twenty-nine members, only [the United States is really serious about its
Article 3 obligations to defend itself, spending approximately \$700
billion or 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense]{.underline}. No other NATO
member comes close to this proportion, and the vast majority fail even
to meet the modest, self-imposed requirement to devote at least 2
percent of GDP to defense.

Britain and Poland are rare members that meet the 2 percent requirement.
One of the worst free-riders is Canada, which spends just 1 percent of
its GDP on security, amounting to \$20 billion. Furthermore, Germany
spends a similarly pathetic 1.2 percent.

Compare that to non-NATO members facing real threats, some of which
spend 5-10 percent of their GDPs on defense. These include Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates, who must contend with Iran and spend
nearly a combined \$100 billion. Israel, which faces the same enemy,
adds \$15 billion to the equation.

Despite protestations of poverty at a time when their economies have
never been larger, [[NATO members are more than willing to rack up
additional liabilities, knowing America has their
back]{.underline}]{.mark}. Last year, the alliance welcomed Montenegro.
[It is now poised to admit]{.underline} the Former Yugoslav Republic of
[Macedonia, which would mean the United States is pledged to defend a
nation that devotes just \$120 million per year to its own
defense,]{.underline} not quite as much as the Cincinnati Police
Department.

But the reality is [[there is no truly capable Russian foe seriously
threatening the West]{.mark}. Russia has one million uniformed personnel
in its military]{.underline}, the world's second-largest behind America,
but the European Union could easily afford to match that with its
combined \$17 trillion economy---ten times larger than Russia's.
However, it needn't bother as Moscow spends just \$61 billion on its
overwrought military, which doubles as an employment program.

Russia's Vladimir Putin has gotten the most from Russia's military,
occupying parts of Georgia and Ukraine and gaining influence in Syria by
backing the Assad regime. Still, his success in all three cases rested
heavily on surprises that Moscow seems unlikely to be able to repeat
against prepared and adequately funded European militaries.

Yer we should expect to hear none of this nuance at the NATO summit, as
poohbahs of the dying old European political order gather to tut-tut
President Trump in the alliance's fancy new \$1.4 billion headquarters,
funded predominantly by American taxpayers.

To get out of this abusive relationship[, [Trump should begin the
process of limiting America\'s role in NATO]{.underline}.]{.mark} A good
model is that of Sweden, which cooperates with NATO on some matters and
not on others. Such an approach could allow joint training, but end the
practice of having over-burdened U.S. taxpayers foot the bill for
wealthy Europeans\' security. As part of this plan, [Trump could
mothball U.S. bases in Europe and shift most resources spent there and
in the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific region, where China and Iran pose
real threats to America---and against which NATO is
irrelevant]{.underline}.

[[Europe is prosperous and treats America like a patsy. Let it stand on
its own]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### 1NC/2AC -- AT: War

#### Diplomacy, internationalism, globalization, and deterrence mean no chance of war. 

**Thorton \'22** - Senior Fellow at the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale
Law School \[Susan, March/April, \"A Rival of America's Making? The
Debate Over Washington's China Strategy,\"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-02-11/china-strategy-rival-americas-making\]

John Mearsheimer's article engenders a sense of foreboding and doom.
"Engagement may have been the worst strategic blunder any country has
made in recent history," he writes. As a result, "China and the United
States are locked in what can only be called a new cold war. . . . And
this cold war is more likely to turn hot."

I cannot agree that [the U.S. policy of engaging China]{.underline} was
a major strategic blunder. During the Cold War, that policy [succeeded
at convincing China to stop sponsoring communist revolutions in East
Asia]{.underline} and helped counter the Soviet Union. After the Cold
War ended, engagement enabled massive economic growth in China that
lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty---a significant
reason that the share of people worldwide living in extreme poverty, by
the World Bank's definition, fell from 36 percent in 1990 to 12 percent
in 2015. Surely, this counts as a major human achievement.

[What would be a strategic blunder]{.underline}, however, [is whatever
series of missteps might lead to a military conflict between China and
the United States]{.underline}. Mearsheimer argues that structural
factors are inexorably leading to such a conflict. But his [realist view
of the situation disregards modern international realities.]{.underline}

[[There are]{.mark} a number of formidable [restraints in place to keep
the peace]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The United States has worked
hard over the decades to build these barriers---often as part of the
very engagement strategy that Mearsheimer criticizes. [These bulwarks
have helped preserve peace [and promote prosperity]{.mark} for the last
70 years, and **[they are still strong enough to prevent a U.S.-Chinese
conflict]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Although [accidents]{.mark} or
incidents connected to military brinkmanship [may
occu]{.mark}]{.underline}[r, [they would]{.underline}]{.mark} [almost
certainly [not lead to]{.mark} a wider
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} That would require something
exceedingly unlikely: the simultaneous failure of every restraint.

First, [[bilateral diplomacy would have to break down]{.mark}.
Engagement is the opposite of estrangement]{.underline}, which describes
the absence of U.S.-Chinese relations from 1949 to 1972. [The purpose of
[engagement is to forestall misperceptions, provide reassurance, and
prevent conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is true that diplomacy and
communication between China and the United States have been anemic for
the past five years. And it is difficult to discern authoritative policy
amid the current cacophony of diplomatic posturing on Twitter and
elsewhere, creating an environment ripe for confusion and overreaction.
But [these deficiencies are not structural; they can be
remedied]{.underline}. If top-level leaders in both countries
consistently communicate and work to reduce public posturing, as they
should, then [the diplomatic barriers to war can be
reinforced.]{.underline}

[For a war to break out, [the international system would]{.mark} also
[have to fail. China and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [are
connected to a]{.mark} globa[l network of]{.mark} countries and
[institutions that have a stake]{.mark}]{.underline}---in some cases, an
existential stake---[[in preventing conflict]{.mark} between these two
countries]{.underline}. Almost every government and institution on the
globe would be grievously damaged by a U.S.-Chinese war, and so they all
would try to prevent an imminent conflict through diplomatic pressure,
mediation, or acts of resistance, such as denying overflight and basing
rights. Critics may be quick to deny the influence of others in heading
off a major-power clash. But in the current international system, there
is no way for either side to emerge victorious, and those outside China
and the United States would see this most clearly.

Then [there is the restraint created by globalization]{.underline}.
Mearsheimer argues that it was a catastrophic mistake for the United
States to help China grow wealthy, as its resulting strength will
inevitably lead it to challenge the United States. But it is also
plausible that [[the]{.mark} inextricably [integrated nature of
the]{.mark} global [economy,]{.mark} and specifically of the Chinese and
U.S. economies, [makes any war unwinnable]{.mark} and thus acts as a
deterrent to conflict]{.underline}. It is true, as critics will point
out, that economic dependencies failed to prevent World War I. But [the
economic relations of the early twentieth century were nothing like the
complex entanglements of today's international economic
system]{.underline}. [[In the case of China and the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [they create a situation of **mutual
assured economic destruction**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Another restraint is public opinion, at least on the U.S. side.
Politicians in the United States respond to various incentives, but they
cannot ignore the sentiments of their voters. And after a 20-year fight
against terrorism, the American public is decidedly wary of protracted
and costly overseas conflicts. If U.S. policymakers appeared poised for
a conflict with China, one would also expect that the press, having
learned its lesson from the war in Iraq, would perform its watchdog
function, question the official narratives, and activate public concern.

[[All these barriers should work to prevent a conflict. But if
they]{.mark} somehow [didn't, there is a]{.mark} final
[fail-safe]{.mark} that is even harder to imagine not working:
[**military deterrence**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Taiwan is the most likely
issue over which a U.S.-Chinese war could break out. But the quantity
and quality of the weaponry on both sides translates to certain
catastrophic losses for all, which should provide a sufficient deterrent
to war. And [because the devastation of a conflict over Taiwan would
spiral out of control quickly, one cannot rule out the use of nuclear
weapons. Strange as it may sound, that is good news]{.underline}: just
as the nuclear age prevented direct military conflict between the Soviet
Union and the United States for more than 40 years, so it should between
China and the United States, [[both]{.mark} of which [are
nuclear-armed]{.mark} powers [with survivable second-strike
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although China has many fewer
missiles and warheads than the United States---something China is
working on remedying---the doctrine of mutually assured destruction
still operates. **[[The balance of terror holds]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Looking through this list of potential failures, one might find cause
for pessimism, given that each restraint has seen its share of erosion
in recent years. But [China and the United States are not prisoners of
history. [The two countries will find that they cannot escape one
another]{.mark}]{.underline}, and eventually, [[they will]{.mark} have
to [seek accommodation]{.mark}]{.underline}. This may now seem a distant
vision, but it [is a far more likely outcome,]{.underline} given the
countervailing currents, [than an **apocalyptic war.**]{.underline}

Among them are seven of the 15 most populous countries in the world
(India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, and
Vietnam) and five countries with which China has fought wars within the
past 80 years (India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and Vietnam[). None of
China's neighbors is culturally Chinese or ideologically aligned with
the C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty.
All may cooperate with China at various times and to varying degrees for
strategic or economic reasons, but [all seek to hedge against Chinese
domination]{.underline}, often [by cultivating relations with the United
States.]{.underline} As Chinese behavior has become more assertive[,
this counterbalancing behavior is growing more evident.]{.underline}
India has compromised its traditional strategic autonomy in order to
participate in joint military exercises with Australia, Japan, and the
United States as part of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, known as
the [Quad. Japan has taken the unprecedented step of officially
declaring stability in the Taiwan Strait to be a national interest. And
Australia has reaffirmed its U.S. alliance]{.underline} by accepting
help in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines under the 2021 AUKUS
agreement[. China is unlikely to achieve anything like hegemony
over]{.underline} any but the smallest of its [neighbors.]{.underline}

Geography helps explain another Chinese weakness: its lack of allies
other than North Korea. There are countries that are nearby enough to
receive substantial help from China in the case of a military conflict,
but they all fear China more than they fear any other state. The lack of
allies is more a liability than an asset, for it deprives China of ways
to multiply the pressure it can put on uncooperative neighbors and of
the ability to position sizable military forces around the world. To be
sure, none of the United States' 60-some allies and partners has
interests identical to Washington's. None can be counted on to follow
every component of U.S. strategy toward China. [But U.S. alliances and
partnerships still complicate China's military calculations, increase
the pressure on Beijing to comply with the international norms preferred
by other states, and expand the alternatives available to countries
considering whether to accept Chinese investments]{.underline}.

Nor is the structural distribution of international power favorable to
Chinese global dominance. Barring catastrophic mismanagement by other
states, China will continue to face five powerful rivals---India, Japan,
Russia, the United States, and the European Union---in a multipolar
system that is not going to disappear. A unipolar moment, if one ever
really existed, cannot be re-created, not by the United States and
certainly not by China.

THREAT PERCEPTION

The challenge the United States faces from China is bad enough without
exaggerating it. As realism would predict, Beijing is dissatisfied with
the status quo: it is closely hemmed in by Washington's allies,
partners, and military forces; its supply lines are vulnerable to U.S.
interdiction; and its society is influenced by American culture. [China
wants to push the United States away from its shores and weaken its
alliances]{.underline}, and this means a real chance of conflict,
[especially over Taiwan.]{.underline} I agree with Mearsheimer that [if
such a war occurred, it would probably **be a limited
war,**]{.underline} albeit highly destructive and tragic. I also agree
that it would have the potential---not a great one, but more than
zero---to escalate to a nuclear exchange.

But [Mearsheimer is wrong to describe China's determination to gain
control over Taiwan as either "emotional" or
"expansionist,"]{.underline} because these descriptors make China sound
irrationally aggressive. Mearsheimer's own theory of [realism better
explains why Beijing will not lose its appetite for Taiwan, given the
long-standing legal basis of its sovereignty claim and the island's
strategic, economic, and technological importance to Chinese
security]{.underline}. Also consistent with realism is China's
preference for avoiding a premature strike on Taiwan and instead
deterring Taiwanese independence as long as it takes to achieve what
Beijing calls "peaceful reunification." But deterring Taiwanese
independence has meant that China has had to build up military assets
capable of threatening the aircraft carriers and forward air and naval
bases that the United States has long relied on to stave off any attempt
to take Taiwan by force. The result: a U.S.-Chinese arms race that
raises the risk of war through miscalculation.

And [Mearsheimer is wrong to describe Beijing's goal as global
dominance.]{.underline} In a multipolar world, [China will seek to shape
global institutions to its advantage]{.underline}, just as major powers
have always done. [But it has no proposal for an alternative,
Beijing-dominated set of institutions. It remains strongly committed to
the global free-trade regime]{.underline}, as well as to the UN and that
organization's alphabet soup of agencies. It participates actively in
the UN human rights system in order to help its allies and frustrate its
rivals. Its Belt and Road Initiative operates alongside, rather than in
place of, long-standing Western-funded development programs. [China
seeks influence, but it has little prospect of dominance as long as
other powers also stay active in these institutions]{.underline}.

[Overestimating the China threat is just as dangerous as underestimating
it]{.underline}. **[Hyping the hazard makes it harder to
manage,]{.underline}** by creating panic among both the American public
and Chinese policymakers. Whether or not engagement was the mistake that
Mearsheimer claims, whether or not there was ever an option to constrain
China's growth as he believes, we are where we are. I agree with
Mearsheimer that what the United States must do now is manage the
situation---which should mean not exacerbating what is already, on cold
realist grounds, a serious challenge.

### AT: Taiwan war

#### The 1AC is neocon rhetoric aimed at making a mountain out of a molehill. China won't attack Taiwan. 

**Cohen \'21** \[Michael, 11/19/2021, \"**[[No, Neocons, China Is Not
About to Invade Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\"
https://newrepublic.com/article/164485/why-china-will-not-invade-taiwan\]

[[One]{.mark} big [reason is that Taiwan is about as inhospitable an
environment as can be imagined for an amphibious
invasion]{.mark}.]{.underline} Ian Easton, a defense expert who has
written extensively about Taiwan defense strategy, wrote earlier this
year that the country's "coastal terrain ... is a defender's dream come
true. Taiwan has only 14 small invasion beaches, and they are bordered
by cliffs and urban jungles." Easton also notes that "many of Taiwan's
outer islands bristle with missiles, rockets, and artillery guns. Their
granite hills have been honeycombed with tunnels and bunker systems."

A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would look more like the World War II
Marine assaults on the rough and unforgiving terrain of Pacific islands
than it would D-Day (which was no walk in the park, either) but against
an exponentially more competent and technologically advanced military.
[Even if somehow China were successful in invading Taiwan and occupying
the island, it [would then find itself in the position of having to
pacify and potentially rebuild an advanced nation of 23 million]{.mark}
people]{.underline} (two million of whom are members of the nation's
military reserves).

Putting aside the virtually insurmountable military obstacles, there's
the larger issue of how the U.S. and other nations in the region would
respond (in recent weeks, Japanese leaders have made clear their
determination to help Taiwan in the wake of Chinese invasion). The U.S.
could play a decisive role, even without boots on the ground in Taiwan.
For example, American naval and air forces could wreak havoc on Chinese
supply lines.

As Rachel Esplin Odell and Eric Heginbotham wrote recently in Foreign
Affairs (in response to Skylar Mastro): "To seize control of the island,
China would need to keep its fleet off Taiwan's coast for weeks,
creating easy targets for antiship cruise missiles launched from Taiwan
or from U.S. bombers, fighter aircraft, and submarines."

Ultimately, no one knows what the U.S. would do in response to a Chinese
attack. In recent months, President Biden has twice publicly stated that
the U.S. will defend Taiwan, which rhetorically goes so beyond the
long-held policy of "strategic ambiguity" that the White House has been
forced to walk back his comments. But even if Biden got too far out on
his skis, his misstatements create even further confusion for China
about U.S. intentions.

Those who are argue that China could invade Taiwan are assuming that
Beijing would willingly initiate a conflict that could lead,
potentially, to the involvement of the world's strongest military,
backed by thousands of nuclear weapons. Such assumptions throw the
entire notion of deterrence on its head.

Lastly, there are the political and financial costs[. If China were to
attack Taiwan, [it would require the mobilization of millions of its
citizens and billions, or even trillions,]{.mark} in spending simply to
prepare for war]{.underline}. [[Success would bring with it an even
larger price tag for rebuilding Taiwan and integrating the island into
Chi]{.underline}na.]{.mark} Anything other than complete military
success and acquiescence by the international community would reap an
ill wind for Chinese leaders. Economic isolation; interruption of trade
ties that have been essential to China's economic growth over the past
two decades; and a generation, if not more, of mistrust and hostility
from the U.S., China's Asian neighbors, and likely the international
community would almost certainly be the result.

A Chinese invasion of Taiwan that was anything but a success would
likely leave the nation politically isolated, economically damaged, and
reputationally crippled. And ironically, a failed attack could lead to a
Taiwanese declaration of independence---one that China would be
incapable of stopping. All that, at a time when the Chinese economy is
facing a collection of economic headwinds---from an energy crunch and a
growing real estate crisis to slowing economic growth.

There are other force options available to China's leaders. The
aforementioned Pentagon report notes the potential for an "Air and
Maritime Blockade," "Limited Force or Coercive Options," and an "Air and
Missile Campaign." But all of these bring with them similar negative
political and economic consequences. China could also ramp up the
military provocations that have been increasing since 2020, moves that
have included Chinese aircraft repeatedly violating Taiwan's Air Defense
Identification Zone and have refuted the existence of a so-called
"median line" in the Taiwan Strait. But these moves should be seen in
more straightforward terms: an effort to deter Taiwan from taking
further steps toward declaring independence.

[[Those warning of a Chinese invasion would be wise to consider
Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jingping'[s most [recent statements]{.mark}
about Taiwan]{.underline}. In Beijing's readout of the meeting this week
between Biden and Xi, it states, [in regard to Taiwan, "We [have
patience and will strive for the prospect of peaceful
reunification]{.mark} with utmost sincerity and efforts."]{.underline}

At the same time, the statement makes clear, "Should the separatist
forces for Taiwan independence provoke us, force our hands, or even
cross the red line, we will be compelled to take resolute measures."

As M. Taylor Fravel, a professor of political science and director of
the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, notes, this is consistent with Beijing's long-standing
political-military strategy for Taiwan. "[In the simplest terms," says
Fravel, [China "seeks to deter Taiwan from declaring
independence]{.mark} (and perhaps the U.S. from supporting
it),]{.underline} and use military threats toward this end, but not
compel unification by force. Military power and interdependence are part
of the equation, but they are not the core of the policy that China is
now pursuing." In Fravel's view, not only are the costs of invading
Taiwan high, it's not Beijing's "preferred approach for achieving
unification." After all, Fravel notes, "the people of Taiwan are
described as 'compatriots' and not enemies."

The U.S. can play a useful role in maintaining the ambiguous status quo.
Since 1979, the U.S. has adhered to a "one China" policy, which views
Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China. The U.S. would do
well to make clear that this policy remains in place, while at the same
time maintaining its position of "strategic ambiguity" and discouraging
any provocative moves by Taiwan toward independence.

But above all, [[the Biden administration needs to ignore the alarmist
rhetoric of those warning that a Chinese invasion is imminent or even
reading]{.mark} too much [into]{.mark} China's
[provocations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even if it wanted to, **[[China is
not about to invade Taiwan.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### \*\*Heg Bad\*\*

### 1NC -- Collapse Peaceful 

#### Hegemonic decline will be peaceful

**MacDonald 2018** - Associate Professor of Political Science @
Wellesley College\
Paul K and Joseph M. Parent, *Twilight of the Titans: Great Power
Decline and Retrenchment*, Cornell U Press, p. 2-3

In this book, we argue that the conventional wisdom is wrong.
Specifically, we make three main arguments. First[, relative decline
causes prompt, proportionate retrenchment because states seek strategic
solvency.]{.underline} The international system is a competitive place,
and great powers did not get to the top by being imprudent, irrational,
or irresponsible. When their fortunes ebb, states tend to retain the
virtues that made them great. In the face of decline, great powers have
a good sense of their relative capability and tend not to give away more
than they must. [Expanding or maintaining grand strategic ambitions
during decline incurs unsustainable burdens and incites unwinnable
fights, so the faster states fall, the more they retrench]{.underline}.
Great powers may choose to retrench in other circumstances as well, but
they have an overriding incentive to do so when confronted by relative
decline.

Second, the depth of relative decline shapes not only how much a state
retrenches, but also which policies it adopts. The world is complex and
cutthroat; leaders cannot glibly pull a policy off the shelf and expect
desired outcomes. Because international politics is a self-help system,
great powers prefer policies that rely less on the actions of allies and
adversaries. For lack of a better term, we refer to these as domestic
policies, which include reducing spending, restructuring forces, and
reforming institutions---all to reallocate resources for more efficient
uses. But international policies may also help, and they include
redeploying forces, defusing flashpoints, and redistributing
burdens---all to avoid costly confl icts and reinforce core
strongpoints. [The faster and deeper states fall, the more they are
willing to rely on others to cushion their fall. Retrenchment is not a
weapon but an arsenal that can be used in different amounts and
combinations depending on conditions and the enemies faced]{.underline}.

Third, after depth, structural conditions are the most important factors
shaping how great powers respond to relative decline. Four conditions
catalyze the incentives for declining states to retrench. One is the
declining state's rank. States in the top rungs of the great power
hierarchy have more resources and margin for error than those lower
down, so there is less urgency for them to retrench. Another is the
availability of allies. [Where states can shift burdens to capable
regional powers with similar preferences, retrenchment is less risky and
diffi cult.]{.underline} Yet another is the interdependence of
commitments. When states perceive commitments in one place as tightly
linked to commitments elsewhere, pulling back becomes harder and less
likely. The last catalyst is the calculus of conquest. If aggression
pays, then retrenchment does not, and great powers will be loath to do
it. The world is not just complex and cutthroat, it is also dynamic. No
set of conditions is everlasting, and leaders must change with the
times.

Empirically, this work aims to add value by being the fi rst to study
systematically all modern shifts in the great power pecking order. We fi
nd sixteen cases of relative decline since 1870, when reliable data for
the great powers become available, and compare them to their
non-declining counterparts across a variety of measures. To preview the
fi ndings, retrenchment is by far the most common response to relative
decline, and declining powers behave differently from non-declining
powers. States in decline are more likely to cut the size of their
military forces and budgets and in extreme cases are more likely to form
alliances. This does not, however, make them ripe for exploitation;
declining states perform comparatively well in militarized disputes. Our
headline finding, however, is that states [that retrench recover their
prior rank with some regularity, but those that fail to retrench never
do]{.underline}. These results challenge theories of grand strategy and
war, offer guidance to policymakers, and indicate overlooked paths to
peace.

### \--xt Cognitive Dissonance

#### Decline will be slow and peaceful -- all of their impact claims are rooted in cognitive dissonance

**Fettweis 2018** - Associate Professor of Political Science at Tulane
University\
Christopher J, *Psychology of a Superpower: Security and Dominance in
U.S. Foreign Policy,* Columbia University Press, p.172-173

Not all declines have gone so smoothly for the people who experienced
them, of course. Sudden and sharp collapses, whether accompanied by
marauding Goths and Vandals or not, are usually unpleasant experiences.
The Soviet empire collapsed all at once, as did those of the Habsburgs
and Ottomans, which led to instability, economic stagnation, and
violence. [No such rapid collapse is likely in the United States\'
future]{.underline}, however. Even the most inveterate pessimists do not
envision a sudden reversal of fortunes and end of the unipolar system.
[All declinists predict a gradual]{.underline}, if inevitable, [relative
weakening, largely as the result of rising wealth and power
elsewhere]{.underline}.38 The American experience is much more likely to
resemble the gradual, graceful decline of Spain or Great Britain than
the catastrophic collapse of Rome or the Soviets. And some scholars have
even proposed that [Chinese leadership would be accompanied by a greater
degree of international stability]{.underline}, given Beijing\'s general
disinterest in promoting revolutionary democratic change.39

[The end of unipolarity will have positive aspects as well]{.underline}.
[Perception is likely to improve in Washington]{.underline}, for one
thing, at least in certain areas. Researchers have found that the kind
of overconfident self-assessments that impoverish the decision making of
unipolar powers can be diminished if power is reduced.40 Once [their
dominance ends, over time the U.S. public might come to perceive the
world in a more accurate way and craft better policies to deal with
it]{.underline}. Or at least one can hope.

[The unipolar order will end slowly, quietly,]{.underline} even
imperceptibly, striking a blow to the U.S. ego, perhaps, but not its
interest. When modern great powers fade, they tend to do it in ways that
leave the people no worse off-and sometimes far better-than they were at
the height of empire. [To the extent that unipolarity contributes to
pathological misperceptions,]{.underline} its end, whenever it arrives,
[may well improve the strategic thinking in the United
States.]{.underline}

Most people devote little time to the finer points of grand strategy,
however, and images of decline can create quite negative emotions.
Accusations that Washington is allowing the United States to become less
great somehow are powerful political tools. Individuals live vicariously
through the exploits of their nation. When their country loses, they too
are losers; when something good happens, they bask in reflected glory.
[The benefits of unipolarity are not merely-or even mostlyconfined to
tangible increases in security.]{.underline} [There is little evidence
to support the belief, no matter how widely held, that the United States
is safer in a world it dominates]{.underline}. A large part of the
reason why so many [Americans reflexively support their status is
emotional and somewhat irrational: They simply enjoy being the
best]{.underline}, the greatest, the numberone country in the world.
They like to feel like winners.

### \--xt Decline Peaceful

#### Hegemonic decline will be peaceful

Christopher, \"Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace,\" Security
Studies, 26:3, 423-451, DOI: 10.1080/09636412.2017.1306394

[Why has armed conflict declined to historically low
levels]{.underline}? What accounts for the post-Cold War peace, and how
long is it likely to last? Surely no questions are more important for
either the theory or practice of international relations, and few are
harder to answer. Only by understanding the causes of the New Peace can
we extrapolate its likely future, however, and plan accordingly. Of the
many possible independent variables, [none is more controversial than
the suggestion that hegemonic stability is at work. The possibility that
the United States]{.underline}, wittingly or not, [has essentially
established a global Pax Americana is generally overlooked by the major
scholarly works on the subject]{.underline}. This stands in stark
contrast to the policy world, where the [many positive aspects of
unipolarity and/or US hegemony are articles of faith, rarely discussed
and never seriously questioned]{.underline}. Scholar and public
intellectual Michael Lind spoke for many when he wrote, "in my
experience, most members of the U.S. foreign policy elite sincerely
believe that the alternative to perpetual U.S. world domination is chaos
and war." 4 One of those is certainly Robert Kagan, who noted, "Pinker
traces the beginning of a long-term decline in deaths from war to 1945,
which just happens to be birthdate of the American world order. The
coincidence eludes him, but it need not elude us."5

This paper examines the theoretical, empirical, and psychological
foundations of that widespread belief. The first section discusses the
New Peace and its potential explanations; the second explains the
difference between unipolarity and hegemony, and examines the logic of
the hegemonic-stability argument; the third turns to the evidence,
comparing both US power and grand strategy to conflict levels; the
fourth examines the political psychology of hegemony and reviews some
major findings that provide insight into how international order can be
misperceived. Insights from that field are crucial in any discussion of
the relationship between US power and global stability, which is built
far more on belief and perception than evidence.

[The New Peace does not appear to be the result of unipolarity or US
hegemony]{.underline}. [While that conclusion might not sit well with
many US analysts, the news is not all bad, for if the current generation
of declinists is right and unipolarity's days are numbered, the odds are
good that the world will not descend into the atavistic chaos that
haunts the neoconservative imagination.]{.underline} [The United States
can adjust its grand strategy without fear in the Trump years, perhaps
even letting the "unipolar moment" expire,]{.underline} because the New
Peace may well be unrelated to its dominance.6

### 1NC-- Decline Inevitable 

#### The failure of US leadership and Trumpism makes hegemonic decline inevitable

**Posen 2018** - Ford International Prof of Political Science and
Director of the Security Studies @ MIT\
Barry, \"The Rise of Illiberal Hegemony: Trump\'s Surprising Grand
Strategy,\" 97 Foreign Aff. 20 (2018)

Hegemony is always difficult to achieve, because most states jealously
guard their sovereignty and resist being told what to do. But since the
end of the Cold War, the [U.S. foreign policy elite has reached the
consensus that liberal hegemony is different]{.underline}. [This type of
dominance]{.underline}, they argue, is, [with the right combination of
hard and soft]{.underline} power, both achievable and sustainable[.
International security and economic institutions, free trade, human
rights, and the spread of democracy are not only values in their own
right]{.underline}, the logic goes; they also serve to lure others to
the cause. If realized, these goals would do more than legitimate the
project of a U.S.-led liberal world order; [they would produce a world
so consonant with U.S. values and interests that the United States would
not even need to work that hard to ensure its security]{.underline}.

[Trump has abandoned this well-worn path]{.underline}. [He has
denigrated international economic institutions]{.underline}, such as the
World Trade Organization, which make nice scapegoats for the disruptive
economic changes that have energized his political base. [He has
abandoned the Paris climate agreement]{.underline}, partly because he
says it disadvantages the United States economically. [Not confident
that Washington can sufficiently dominate international
institutions]{.underline} to ensure its interests, [the president has
withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,]{.underline} [launched a
combative renegotiation of the North American Free Trade
Agreement]{.underline}, [and let the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership wither on the vine.]{.underline} In lieu of such agreements,
Trump has declared a preference for bilateral trade arrangements, which
he contends are easier to audit and enforce.

[Pointing out that recent U.S. efforts to build democracy abroad have
been costly and unsuccessful, Trump has also jettisoned democracy
promotion]{.underline} as a foreign policy goal, aside from some stray
tweets in support of anti-regime protesters in Iran. [So far as one can
tell, he cares not one whit about the liberal transformation of other
societies]{.underline}. In Afghanistan, for example, his strategy counts
not on perfecting the Afghan government but on bludgeoning the Taliban
into negotiating (leaving vague what exactly the Taliban would
negotiate). More generally, [Trump has]{.underline} often
[praised]{.underline} foreign [dictators]{.underline}, from Vladimir
Putin of Russia to Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. His plans for
more restrictive immigration and refugee policies[,]{.underline}
motivated in part by fears about terrorism, have skated uncomfortably
close to outright bigotry. [His grand strategy is primacy without a
purpose]{.underline}.

[Such lack of concern for the kinder, gentler part of the American
hegemonic project infuriates its latter-day defenders]{.underline}.
Commenting on the absence of liberal elements in Trump\'s National
Security Strategy, Susan Rice, who was national security adviser in the
Obama administration, wrote in December, [\"These omissions undercut
global perceptions of American leadership;]{.underline} worse, [they
hinder our ability to rally the world to our cause when we blithely
dismiss the aspirations of others]{.underline}.\"

But whether that view is correct or not should be a matter of debate,
not a matter of faith. [States have long sought to legitimate their
foreign policies, because even grudging cooperation from others is less
costly than mild resistance]{.underline}. But in the case of the United
States, [the liberal gloss does not appear to have made hegemony all
that easy to achieve or sustain. For nearly 30 years, the United States
tested the hypothesis that the liberal character of its hegemonic
project made it uniquely achievable. The results suggest that the
experiment failed]{.underline}.

[Neither China nor Russia has become a democracy]{.underline}, nor do
they show any sign of moving in that direction. [Both are building the
military power necessary to compete with the United States]{.underline},
and both have neglected to sign up for the U.S.-led liberal world order.
[At great cost, Washington has failed to build stable democratic
governments in Afghanistan and Iraq]{.underline}. Within NATO, a
supposed guardian of democracy, Hungary, Poland, and Turkey are turning
increasingly authoritarian. The European Union, the principal liberal
institutional progeny of the U.S. victory in the Cold War, has suffered
the loss of the United Kingdom, and other member states flaunt its
rules, as Poland has done regarding its standards on the independence of
the judiciary. [A new wave of identity politics-nationalist, sectarian,
racist, or otherwise-has swept not only the developing world but also
the developed world]{.underline}, including the United States[.
Internationally and domestically, liberal hegemony has failed to
deliver]{.underline}.

### \--AT: Plan stops decline

#### Their impacts are fear-mongering, no risk of decline

**Fettweis 2018** - Associate Professor of Political Science at Tulane
University\
Christopher J, *Psychology of a Superpower: Security and Dominance in
U.S. Foreign Policy,* Columbia University Press, p. 168-170

A few things can be said with certainty, however. First, the main engine
of U.S. decline-the rise of challengers-has not occurred. Whether
because of high costs, [the essential benevolence of U.S.
unipolarity,]{.underline} or some other factor, [the world has not
witnessed widespread balancing]{.underline} behavior over the last
twenty-five years. States have generally tolerated unprecedented
disparities in material power without much reaction at all. No new
coalitions have formed to counter U.S. capabilities, which would be
symptomatic of \"external balancing,\" and few states are building up
their militaries, or \"internally\" balancing the United States.24 The
only major exception to this rule is China, but its commitment to
balance is less clear than is sometimes portrayed. [Beijing has
consistently chosen to devote a very small percentage of its GDP toward
defense-at or near 2 percent-a rate that is not growing.]{.underline}25
Increasing Chinese defense expenditures are a reflection of its growing
economy, in other words, but not necessarily an increased imperative to
balance the United States. Although the real level of Chinese spending
is hotly debated, the Peoples\' Republic could certainly devote more to
its defense if it felt the need.

Second, [perceptions of decline thrive during periods of
uncertainty]{.underline}, especially those following foreign-policy
disasters. It is no coincidence that Paul Kennedy wrote Rise and Fall of
the Great Powers in the United States in the 1970s or that Otto Spengler
wrote about the decline of the West from the perspective of Germany in
the early 192os.26 [The mixed bag of negative emotions that follow
foreign-policy catastrophe-anger, guilt, shame, doubt,
insecurity-contributes to an overall sense of pessimism about the future
and about foreign policy in general.]{.underline} Disasters always seem
to portend even greater ones to come. Status is fueled by perception as
much as reality, and when pessimism reigns, decline seems imminent.

Third, [the United States is structurally and culturally predisposed to
suffer from status insecurity.]{.underline} While all states worry to
some degree about their relative power, those at the top tend to worry
even more. Psychologists have long known [that people are motivated more
strongly by the specter of loss than the potential for
gain]{.underline}, and no state has more to lose than the unipole.27
People are naturally insecure about what they value most, and the
hypercompetitive United States values its status.28 As a result, it is
predisposed to worry about losing that status and thereby puts more
stock in the arguments of declinists than might otherwise be warranted.
Michael Cox has observed that \"the United States is a very special kind
of polity preoccupied by status and consumed by inner doubt.\"29 That
specialness leads us to fear more than necessary and to obsess over our
ranking.

Fourth, [proponents of decline tend to confuse concepts. One can argue
that unipolarity is coming to an end or that the United States is in
hegemonic decline]{.underline}, but the two are not the same. For the
former to be true, the power of the United States would have to be
waning in relation to potential challengers. For the latter, the
influence of the United States would have to be declining. It is the
unipolarity-versus-hegemony distinction once again, and, as usual, the
two are not kept separate in much of the writing about systemic
durability. [Previous iterations of declinism consistently conflated the
aggregate power of the United States with its ability to bring about its
preferred outcomes]{.underline}. The former is much easier to measure,
and definitive statements can be made as a result. Today, the only
empirical dimension along which the U.S. advantage may be slipping is in
aggregate economic power, which is always expressed in terms of gross
domestic product. One measurethe growth in China\'s GDP-has provided the
lion\'s share of the ammunition for those predicting the end of
unipolarity. In nearly all other measures of raw and symbolic power,
unipolarity shows little sign of waning.

costs.]{.underline} [The liberal state is likely to end up fighting
endless wars]{.underline}, [which will increase]{.underline} rather than
reduce [the level of conflict in international politics and thus
aggravate the problems of proliferation and terrorism]{.underline}.
Moreover, the state\'s militaristic behavior is almost certain to end up
threatening its own liberal values. [Liberalism abroad leads to
illiberalism at home.]{.underline} Finally, [even if the liberal state
were to achieve its aims-spreading democracy near and far, fostering
economic intercourse, and creating international institutions-they would
not produce peace]{.underline}.

The key to understanding liberalism\'s limits is to recognize its
relationship with nationalism and realism. This book is ultimately all
about these three isms and how they interact to affect international
politics. Nationalism is an enormously powerful political ideology. It
revolves around the division of the world into a wide variety of
nations, which are formidable social units, each with a distinct
culture. Virtually every nation would prefer to have its own state,
although not all can. Still, we live in a world populated almost
exclusively by nation-states, which means that liberalism must coexist
with nationalism. Liberal states are also nation-states. [There is no
question that liberalism and nationalism can coexist, but when they
clash, nationalism almost always wins]{.underline}.

#### Specifically we'll go to war with Russia and China because of entrapment

commitments and the risks of entrapment" in *US Grand Strategy in the
21^st^ Century: The Case for Restraint*, Routledge Press, p. 32

The preceding discussion (summarized in Table 2.1) has large
implications for the United States. During the Cold War, bipolarity
constrained the importance of allies, limiting the risk of entrapment.
Moreover, the prospect of nuclear war discouraged risky behavior by the
superpowers and their allies. Today, however, [the risk of entrapment
born of moral hazard and states\' search for security is larger and
possibly increasing]{.underline}. [As long as the US continues to make
commitments overseas and fear the emergence of a peer competitor,
American partners will be tempted to act in risky ways, expecting that
Washington will feel compelled to come to their rescue]{.underline}
should they get into trouble.

Insofar as the United States opposes Chinese or Russian aggression,
[smaller states will be tempted to provoke China or Russia to garner
growing American support. If the United States is opposed to the
emergence of great power peer competitors]{.underline}, then it may well
opt to come to the aid of smaller states threatened by those potential
competitors. Th[is also means that countries that have limited or no
explicit security commitments from the United States may try to profit
from the insurance policy offered by the United States by provoking
conflicts and expecting the United States]{.underline} - whose interests
are clear - [to ride to their defense.]{.underline} In the next section,
we take a preliminary look at some evidence to test these claims. We
focus on events in East and Southeast Asia over the last few years. Some
have characterized Chinese aggression in recent years as reactionary.
That is, [China has felt compelled to respond to perceived provocations
from smaller Asian nations such as the Philippines and
Vietnam.]{.underline} Even though the US does not have formal security
commitments to either country, [Washington subsequently feels compelled
to signal to these countries that it will stand up to Chinese
aggressio]{.underline}n.

### 2NC -- Mearsheimer

#### Multipolarity is inevitable -- nothing will stop the relative decline of US leadership and the rise of other powers; this is only something to fear if the US tries to maintain its status as the unipolar leader because it necessitates a confrontation with those rising powers

[If the United States had not been deeply involved in the developing
world]{.underline}, might the Soviet Union have invaded a host of minor
powers and turned them into puppet states? Perhaps the Soviets might
have attacked a few smaller countries, but the result would not have
been a steady string of communist victories. On the contrary, [the
Soviets would have ended up in one quagmire after another]{.underline}.
Just look at what happened when the Soviet military moved into
Afghanistan in 1979. They were stuck for ten years and ultimately
suffered a humiliating defeat. U[.S. interests would have been well
served if the Soviets had had more Afghanistans, just as Moscow would
have been well served if the United States had had more
Vietnams.]{.underline} Baiting and bleeding the other side was a smart
strategy for both superpowers.

Yet [it is still difficult for]{.underline} American [policymakers to
think along these lines. Most]{.underline} of them [fail to appreciate
the power of nationalism and]{.underline} instead [overestimate
universal ideologies like]{.underline} communism and
[liberalism.]{.underline} Nevertheless, the historical record shows that
the best strategy for a great power dealing with minor powers is to
avoid getting involved in their domestic politics-and certainly not to
invade and occupy them unless it is absolutely necessary. [Aggressive
intervention is what great powers should try to draw their rivals into
doing]{.underline}. [U.S. policymakers should keep this lesson in mind
if the Sino-American security competition continues to heat
up]{.underline}. A proper understanding of the relationship between
liberalism, nationalism, and realism suggests that even the mightiest
powers on the planetincluding the United States-should pursue a foreign
policy of restraint. Any country that fails to understand that basic
message and tries instead to shape the world in its own image is likely
to face unending trouble.

Where Is the United States Headed?

The American foreign policy establishment would surely resist any move
to abandon the pursuit ofliberal hegemony and adopt a foreign policy
based on realism. Both the Democratic and Republican parties are deeply
wedded to promoting liberalism abroad, even though that policy has been
a failure at almost every turn.18 Although the American public tends to
favor restraint, the governing elites pay little attention to public
opinion-until they have to-when formulating foreign policy.

Nevertheless, there is good reason to think this situation is about to
change, for reasons beyond the control of the foreign policy
establishment. [It appears that the structure of the international
system is moving toward multipolarity,]{.underline} because of China\'s
striking rise and the resurrection of Russian power. [This development
is likely to bring realism back to the fore in Washington, since it is
impossible to pursue liberal hegemony when there are other great powers
in the international system]{.underline}. American policymakers have not
had to concern themselves with the global balance of power since the
Cold War ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, [but the unipolar system
seems to have been short-lived,]{.underline} which means that the United
States will once again have to worry about other great powers. Indeed,
the Trump administration has made it clear, to quote Secretary of
Defense James Mattis, that \"great power competition between nations is
a reality once again,\" and \"great power competition, not terrorism, is
now the primary focus of U.S. national security strategy. \"19

[In a world of three great powers, especially when one of them has
China\'s potential military might, there is sure to be security
competition and maybe even war.]{.underline} 20 [The United States will
have little choice but to adopt a realist foreign policy,]{.underline}
simply because it must prevent China from becoming a regional hegemon in
Asia. That task will not be easy if China continues to grow economically
and militarily. Still, liberalism will most likely continue to influence
U.S. policy abroad in small ways, as the impulse to spread democracy is
by now hardwired into the foreign policy establishment\'s DNA. Although
great-power competition will prevent Washington from fully embracing
liberal hegemony, the temptation to pursue liberal policies abroad will
be ever present.

In addition to this lingering tendency to adopt liberal strategies on
the margins of a largely realist foreign [policy, there is also the
danger that U.S. policymakers will not fully grasp that nationalism
limits their ability to intervene in other countries just as much as it
limits their adversaries\' ability to conquer other states.]{.underline}
They failed to understand the effects of nationalism both during the
Cold War and in the post-Cold War world, and there is no assurance they
will get it in the future. Even with the return of realism and the
demise ofliberal hegemony, it will still be imperative to sound the
tocsins about the dangers of a liberal foreign policy and the importance
of understanding how nationalism limits great powers\' ability to act.

### 2NC -- US- China War

#### Retrenchment is necessary to prevent a US-Sino war

**MacDonald 2018** - Associate Professor of Political Science @
Wellesley College\
Paul K and Joseph M. Parent, *Twilight of the Titans: Great Power
Decline and Retrenchment*, Cornell U Press, p. 199-200

International relations thinkers are rightly obsessed with rise and
fall, war and peace. To date, most of them have looked at the historical
record and not seen much cause for optimism. As new powers rise and old
powers fall, the prospects for peace diminish because aggression pays
and domestic politics is rife with dysfunction. Long placid periods are
punctuated by thunderous bursts of war and change. Fear, honor, and
greed come to the fore, and the tragedy of great powers politics repeats
once more.

In this book, we developed a dissenting view. Starting from standard
assumptions, we reasoned that the world is harsh enough to discipline
domestic faction but not so harsh as to regularly demand aggression.
Leaders have an array of policy tools to react in their own ways to
shifting conditions, and states can seize control of their fates[.
Decline encourages retrenchment, but this is no bad thing and seldom a
belligerent one. Past policymakers have done an admirable job keeping
their ships of state from running aground]{.underline}, and today's
policymakers have [better ships, better gauges, and better
weather.]{.underline}

[There is no sense in exacerbating decline by indulging delusions of
everlasting grandeur]{.underline}, coddling ossified institutions, and
living in the past. [The United States has been the world's largest
economy for over a century.]{.underline} It has seen off numerous
challengers before and can do so again. But [the best chances for
success are to keep one's perspective, patience, and prudence
intact]{.underline}. The United States is declining, but not much, and
China is preoccupied by its own rise. This is no reason for preventive
war or gratuitous malice. The odds are good for peace and prosperity,
but there are non-negligible risks that domestic politics or unexpected
crises could derail events. [If the United States gives the mistaken
impression that it is seeking to contain a rising China, whether through
a rapid military buildup or intransigent diplomacy, this would empower
hardline factions, stoke fears of falling dominos, and raise the stakes
of minor crises]{.underline}. [It is the American rejection of
retrenchment, and the alarm this inspires in China, that could make war
appear inevitable]{.underline}.

#### Attempting to maintain heg makes war with China inevitable

**Edelstein 2018** -- Prof in the Edmund Walsh School of Foreign Service
and the Dept. of Government @ Georgetown\
David M and Joshua R. Itzkowitz Shifrinson, "It's a trap! Security
commitments and the risks of

Since its 2010-2011 announcement, the pivot has inserted the United
States into a host of Asian political and military disputes with China
involving ownership of contested maritime space and islands in the South
and East China Seas. Though there may be economic resources beneath the
surface around some of these locales, neither the United States nor its
allies have an intrinsic interest in ownership of contested areas.
Instead, the contested maritime domains are worrisome to US allies for
what they suggest about China\'s territorial ambitions. They are
therefore important to the United States for the signal American actions
send to allies over American credibility. Thus[, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has moved to back its allies in their disputes
with the P.R.C. by rhetorically portraying China as the principal
aggressor,]{.underline} [clarifying that US commitments to the allies
would cover the maritime areas under dispute,]{.underline} and - above
all - has dispatched its own military forces to enforce what the US and
its allies define as the \"status quo\" in contravention of China\'s own
interests (Russell 2014; White House 2014; US Pacific Command
2015;Valencia 2016; LaGrone 2015; Panda 2016).Whatever the legitimacy of
these actions, their effect is to create a self-perpetuating cycle: [the
more the United States stands by its allies in opposing potential
Chinese ambitions,]{.underline} the nominally more credible the American
resolve to defend its allies, [the more the allies are inclined to act
aggressively toward China, and the greater the likelihood of a direct
USChinese confrontation]{.underline}. In other words, treating American
support for its allies as a litmus test of the alliances themselves
requires the United States to take steps on behalf of its allies that
risk conflict with China. This is entrapment of the purest sort. [The
United States could readily provide security to its friends in East
Asia, maintain Asia\'s political status quo, or more generally limit the
rise of China without involving itself in Asian maritime
disputes]{.underline}. To the extent that the United States simply wants
to preserve East Asian stability, it could negotiate directly with the
P.R.C. to settle conflicts of interest on a bilateral basis. To the
extent that the United States wants to prevent China from becoming an
Asian hegemon or engaging in military action beyond its borders, it
could simply surge forces to the region as crises develop or build up
the military forces of its clients (Itzkowitz Shifrinson and Lalwani
2014; Glaser 2015; Mirski 2013). That these options are treated as
insufficient suggests entrapment at play. Even if protecting Japan,
South Korea, and other regional partners is in the United States\'
interest, only entrapment explains the timing and form of the American
response.3

The second driver of entrapment comes from the response by East Asian
countries themselves. It will be some time before we have detailed
evidence on what was said to whom that convinced the Obama
administration to pivot to East Asia. Nevertheless, the East Asian
response since 2010-2011 suggests that moral hazard is increasing risks
for the United States. One of the most striking trends in East Asia
since the pivot is the renewed assertiveness of East Asian states in
dealing with China Gohnston 2013; Associated Press 2015). This trend
includes independent action by the Japanese, Filipino, Vietnamese, and
other military forces to take a forward-leaning stance on maritime
disputes that, at minimum, helps to justify a Chinese response.Japan,
Korea, and others lobbied for the pivot for the express purpose of
having the United States help them manage the rise of China - the
implication being that, without an active American role, they would
either bandwagon with China or engage in increasingly aggressive
policies with a large risk of war.

As things stand, East Asia is already witness to an arms race and
militarized interstate disputes: Japan is taking increasing military
measures to confront Chinese incursions into the disputed Senkakus,
including regularly confronting Chinese aircraft flying over the
disputed region (Gady 2015; Reuters 2016a; Kazianis 2016; Reynolds
2015); Vietnam and the Philippines have grown increasingly willing to
confront China in the South China Sea while deepening military ties with
other countries challenged by China (Torode 2015;Vietnam Right Now 2015;
Bowcott 2015; Reuters 2016b); and even Australia - which has no maritime
disputes with China - has taken to militarily challenging Chinese
maritime claims (Defense News 2015; News.com.au 2015). Independently,
none of these countries (except perhaps Japan) has the wherewithal to
defeat China. These actions are almost certainly born of the expectation
that the United States will come to their aid if a dispute escalates to
war. 4 Thus, unless the pivot has had no effect on allied behavior, then
its main influence has been to (1) avoid bandwagoning, but (2) allow the
very assertiveness the United States nominally sought to avoid in the
first place! To put the issue differently, the claims employed by Asian
allies and partners to push what became the pivot strongly suggest that
it encouraged their over-assertiveness[. This is moral hazard: take away
the United States\' post-pivot policy, and the East Asian allies would
almost certainly not be tilting with China to the same
extent]{.underline}. Some [smaller allies,]{.underline} in fact, [might
bandwagon altogeth]{.underline}er. If so, this suggests the extent to
which entrapment dynamics are at play.

In sum, [entrapment is alive and well in terms of both the arguments
employed]{.underline} and the policies adopted by the United States and
its allies since the late 2000s. [No war has occurred, but crises are
ongoing, and the intensity of American backing for its East Asian
clients is growing]{.underline}. **[This is a recipe for
miscalculation]{.underline}**. As American forces continue to move into
the region, as American diplomacy continues to take an anti-China
flavor, and as allies simultaneously spur and build upon these trends,
the United States is approaching active involvement in the wrong
conflicts, at the wrong time, and in the wrong place.The United States
has an interest in maintainingJapan and other major states as
independent actors friendly to the United States, noting their
particular island disputes with China. Entrapment is alive and well as
the United States mistakes the latter for the former. And, importantly,
even if the United States decides at some point that conflict with China
is necessary to protect its national interests, the US could still be
entrapped by its allies into fighting that conflict at an unwelcome time
with unattractive goals and using extraordinary means. In short, the US
need not be drawn into a wholly unwelcome war for entrapment to
nonetheless occur.

## Advantage CPs

### CP -- US Biotech lead

#### The Department of State, Department of Defense, and Department of Commerce should collaborate on biotechnology policy. 

#### It solves. 

**Carlson \'21** -- affiliate professor in the Paul G Allen School of
Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington and
earned a doctorate in physics from Princeton \[Rob, Chad Sbragia, and
Kate Sixt, Sep 14, \"BEYOND BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE: MAINTAINING THE U.S.
BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANTAGE,\"
<https://warontherocks.com/2021/09/beyond-biological-defense-maintaining-the-u-s-biotechnology-advantage/>\]

Recommendations

As early as 1958, the Department of Commerce was tracking the economic
contribution of semiconductors, even though they made up less than 0.1
percent of the gross domestic product. Yet, today, the U.S. government
has made no equivalent effort to track the much more significant role of
biotechnology.

This illiteracy is a national security issue. American and Chinese
bioeconomies are in competition, and Beijing asserts that it is
investing with the intent to take, and to then maintain, the lead. To
sustain America's advantage, the U.S. Department of Defense should
better understand its reliance on biotechnology and increase investment
in it accordingly. The Pentagon's recent investment in the BioIndustrial
Manufacturing and Design Ecosystem is a notable step in the right
direction. However, the seven-year budget for this project is
approximately the cost of a single F-35A. For an investment that could
impact the entire defense supply chain, this is inadequate.

[We recommend the following plan of action for the Department of Defense
to take its place alongside the Departments of Commerce and State in the
broader interagency effort to secure America's biotechnology
advantage]{.underline}.

First[, in close coordination with the Department of Commerce, the
Department of Defense should make a systematic effort to better
understand the role of biotechnology in the economy, supply chains, and
manufacturing. This,]{.underline} in turn, **[should
inform]{.underline}** additional oversight and [regulatory
controls.]{.underline}

[The responsibility to understand,]{.underline} prepare for, [and
respond to biotechnology threats is balkanized, spread across at least
nine departments and agencies]{.underline}. Vulnerabilities in the
bioeconomy will affect the Department of Defense in terms of readiness,
soldier health, and the ability to fulfill missions. [Addressing those
vulnerabilities begins with a sustained, comprehensive effort to
understand the role of biotechnology in industry today]{.underline}, as
well as how that industry contributes to defense supply chains, and how
military acquisition policy shapes biotechnology. To that end, [the
Pentagon should work with the Department of Commerce to create domestic
reporting codes for biotechnology revenues and employment for the
quarterly and annual economic census,]{.underline} and further
incorporate those codes into the North American Industrial
Classification System[. Institutionalizing the gathering of these data
is the first step toward sustainable policymaking and rational
spending.]{.underline}

[The Department of Commerce should then consider adding import/export
controls on biotechnology]{.underline}, while avoiding overly broad
restrictions that suffocate innovation[. Protecting foundational
technologies using the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act
and Export Control Reform Act will be critical for securing
biotechnology]{.underline}. However, biotechnology competition is not
exclusive to commercial activities. The Pentagon should assess critical
vulnerabilities and dependencies to assist the other agencies in
bringing China's foreign biotechnology access in line with standards in
other major markets.

[The Department of Defense has been asked to document and secure supply
chains critical to defense applications and to the overall U.S. economy.
This should also apply to biotechnology]{.underline}. Current Pentagon
efforts to expand domestic biological manufacturing capabilities are an
important start, but a broader effort is needed. [An empowered deputy
national security adviser could help oversee the relationship between
the Pentagon and the National Economic Council to promote and secure the
military's broader technology needs.]{.underline}

Second, the [Department of Defense should better study the
accomplishments and intent of China,]{.underline} especially the Chinese
military, [in developing biotechnology as a strategic
technology.]{.underline}

[Once the Department of Defense better understands critical U.S.
biotechnology dependencies on China, it can begin the work of reducing
them. This requires an interagency examination to identify cross-cutting
resources, develop mitigation strategies, formulate best practices to
bolster innovation, and expand outreach to allies and partners to reduce
systemic gaps China could exploit.]{.underline} Partnership with
industry and allies will allow the U.S. government to understand and
counter Beijing's efforts to distort commercial activity in its favor.

To this end, the Department of Defense should mirror the National
Security Council's effort by creating an emerging technology portfolio
within Office of the Under Secretary of Defense-Policy. While other
technology offices in the Department of Defense are internally focused,
an entity in this office that concentrates externally on foundational
technology competition is required. Such an office may be able to
address uncertainties in assessments of Chinese biotechnology revenues
and capabilities.

Finally, [in coordination with the Department of State, the Department
of Defense should identify opportunities for dialogue with the People's
Liberation Army about biotechnology-related security
issues]{.underline}.

[It is time to include biotechnology in the dialogue mechanisms that
compose bilateral U.S. defense relations with the People's Liberation
Army]{.underline}. This [dialogue should prioritize the ethics of
biotechnology in the context of future conflicts, the escalatory risks
this technology creates, and the possibility of cooperation where the
interests of the two nations intersect.]{.underline} Both sides should
work toward a common understanding related to ethics, policies, and
standards when operationalizing biotechnology. This will help avoid
miscalculation and promote strategic stability.

Unlike the U.S. government, Chinese leadership has a carefully
considered position on the importance of biosafety and "biological
problems" in national security. While these problems are understood to
encompass traditional weapons concerns, they also extend to the health
of the entire natural world in the context of ever-expanding
applications of biotechnology. This position might provide an
opportunity for constructive engagement at a time when tensions are
rising.

#### The United States federal government should fund an international summit on scientific norms related to biotechnology. 

#### Scientists are better than politicians at developing norms.

SELF-GOVERNMENT

For all its unprecedented power, CRISPR is of a piece with other
research breakthroughs in synthetic biology. It has both enormous
potential to transform societies for the better and possible malign
uses. Dealing with the latter will require crafting highly specific
rules so that regulators don't end up sweeping all CRISPR research into
a costly new regulatory net with little or no benefit to society. And
even the best-designed regulation cannot eliminate the possibility that
researchers will accidentally discover a dangerous new application of a
new technology. [Before regulators consider additional rules, CRISPR
researchers will have to comply with existing scientific norms and
regulations, perhaps the field's biggest short-term
challenge.]{.underline}

[The modern scientific community is both cooperative and
competitive.]{.underline} Even so, [scientific establishments have shown
themselves capable of self-governance **when public safety and
confidence are at stake**]{.underline}. [The standards developed by
recognized authorities are encouraging]{.underline}: for example, in the
first decade of this century, [in response to new laboratory practices
involving the use of human stem cells in nonhuman animals, national
science academies came up with a set of guidelines]{.underline}. The
guidelines are voluntary, but they delineate in a well-informed way what
is and what is not ethically acceptable, and they have been widely
embraced by scientists, the editors of prominent scientific journals,
and regulators.

[The most effective standards for gene-editing research will come from
the scientific community itself, through international summits of
science academies and a continual process of intellectual
exchange]{.underline}. Those are the forums that can respond best to
often unpredictable developments in the science and react sensitively to
public opinion. Prudent self-governance among scientists may not produce
headlines, but it is the process most likely to enable CRISPR and the
next generation of research breakthroughs to reach their full potential.

Governance for Biosecurity and Synthetic Biology,\" in *Emerging Threats

3.4 Conclusions and Recommendations

[The regulatory landscape for biosecurity and synthetic biology can best
be described as a 'patchwork']{.underline} of international conventions,
national laws, regulations, guidelines, etc. In many instances, these
were designed to address other (state biowarfare programs) or earlier
(biosafety) concerns.

[While synthetic biology appears to be broadly]{.underline} (if
indirectly) [covered by existing top-down governance
measures]{.underline} (e.g. GMO laws), [several characteristics of the
science, including convergence, democratization and intangibility, point
to possible regulatory gaps]{.underline}. How governments address these
novelties depends upon their regulatory cultures and perceptions of
risk.

To date, [the regulatory response, while varied]{.underline} (ranging
from more precautionary to more laissez-faire), [suggests a preference
for evolutionary rather that revolutionary regulatory
change]{.underline}. Like the regulatory response to GMOs, there is a
tendency for governments to adapt existing regulations to new
technologies.

[Whether new conventions, laws or regulations are]{.underline} (or are
not) [needed to address synthetic biology's novelties is open to
question.]{.underline} At the very least[, there is a need to monitor
advances in the field and to consider how top-down governance approaches
could be improved.]{.underline} The following recommendations aim to
advance this discussion:

**[The BWC]{.underline}**, the premier international forum that
addresses biological threats, [should play a leading role in monitoring
security-relevant advances in synthetic biology.]{.underline} Proposals
to establish a BWC scientific advisory body and to introduce a S&T
reporting requirement into the CBM mechanism should be encouraged.

In view of the growing convergence between biology, chemistry,
engineering and computing, inter-convention [dialogue is needed between
the BWC and CWC]{.underline}, among others[, to ensure the full scope of
synthetic biology's risks are taken into consideration and that there is
agreement on how to address these risks in the event of deliberate
misuse by state or non-state actors]{.underline}.

Given that many security concerns about synthetic biology relate to its
informational (e.g. digital sequence information) rather than physical
(e.g. DNA sequencers) [dimensions, it is necessary to develop improved
methods of regulating intangible technology transfers. It is no longer
sufficient to rely exclusively on material controls and list-based
approaches to regulation]{.underline}.

Synthetic biology is contributing to the democratization of genetic
engineering. It is therefore essential to enlist the support of
non-governmental organizations and actors, including technology
developers, industry and users, in the regulatory response. The value of
complementing top-down governance measures with bottom-up governance
measures, drawing on limited forms of self-regulation or self-policing,
will only increase as the tools of modern biology become more
accessible.

[There is no one-size-fits-all approach to synthetic biology's
governance]{.underline}. [Finding the appropriate 'mix' of top-down and
bottom-up regulatory measures will require foresight, broad dialogue,
and a willingness on the part of governments to look to new, hybrid
forms of risk regulation]{.underline}.
