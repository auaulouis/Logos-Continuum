Many [**S**tate **P**artnership **P**rogram]{.underline} stakeholders,
including State Partnership Program Coordinators, Bilateral Affairs
Officers, and combatant command officials, cited benefits to the
program, but the program [lacks a **comprehensive oversight framework**
that includes clear program **goals**]{.underline},
**[objectives]{.underline}**, [and metrics to measure
**progress**]{.underline} against those goals, which limits the
Department of Defense's (DOD) and Congress' ability to assess whether
the program is an effective and efficient use of resources. The benefits
described by all stakeholders focused on the program's contributions to
meeting their specific missions, such as building security
relationships, providing experience to guardsmen, and supporting
combatant commands' missions. [Goals]{.underline},
[objectives]{.underline}, [and metrics]{.underline} to measure progress
[are necessary for management oversight]{.underline}, [and National
Guard Bureau]{.underline} officials told GAO that they [recognize the
need to **update** the program]{.underline}'s goals and develop metrics
and have initiated efforts in these areas. Officials expect completion
of these efforts in summer 2012. Until program goals and metrics are
implemented, [DOD cannot **fully assess** or **adequately oversee** the
program]{.underline}.

[S]{.underline}tate [P]{.underline}artnership [P]{.underline}rogram
[**activity data** are **incomplete** as well as inconsistent and
**funding data** are **incomplete**]{.underline} for fiscal years 2007
through 2011; therefore GAO cannot provide complete information on the
types and frequency of activities or total funding amounts for those
years. GAO found that the multiple [data systems]{.underline} used to
track program activities [and funding are **not
interoperable**]{.underline} and users apply varying methods and
definitions to guide data inputs. The [terminology used to identify
activity types is **inconsistent** across the combatant commands and the
National Guard Bureau]{.underline}. Further, funding data from the
National Guard Bureau and the combatant commands were incomplete, and
while the National Guard Bureau provided its total spending on the
program since 2007, it could not provide information on the cost of
individual activities. Although the National Guard Bureau has initiated
efforts to improve the accuracy of its own State Partnership Program
data, without common agreement with the combatant commands on what types
of data need to be tracked and how to define activities, the data cannot
be easily reconciled across databases.

The [most **prominent challenge**]{.underline} cited by State
Partnership Program stakeholders [involved how to fund activities that
include U.S. and **foreign partner**]{.underline} **[civilian
participants]{.underline}**. Activities involving civilians, for
example, have included subjectmatter expert exchanges on military
support to civil authorities and maritime border security. Although DOD
guidance does not prohibit civilian involvement in activities, many
[stakeholders have the **impression** that the U.S. military is **not
permitted** to engage civilians]{.underline} in State Partnership
Program activities and some [states]{.underline} may have [chosen not to
conduct any events with civilians due to the perception that it may
**violate DOD guidance**]{.underline}. DOD and the National Guard Bureau
are working on developing additional guidance and training in this area.
Until these efforts are completed, [**confusion** may **continue to
exist** and **hinder** the program's **full potential** to fulfill
National Guard and combatant command missions]{.underline}.

Some [critics]{.underline} come from Congress, who [**raised concerns**
over SPP's effectiveness]{.underline}, [conformity to federal
law]{.underline}, [nesting with TSCPs, and **encroachment** upon or
conflicts with DoS and USAID interests, responsibilities, and
programs]{.underline}.48 In a 2011 Congressional Research Service (CRS)
report, congressional researchers noted that **[the program
suffers]{.underline}** [from written assessments "limited in scope" and
focused on "outputs... rather than outcomes"]{.underline}49 The report
also noted that "the SPP has no dedicated statute authority"50 of its
own and uses several different statues within United States Code
(U.S.C.) to authorize SPP activities. These statues range from Title 10
U.S.C. (Armed Forces), to Title 32 U.S.C. (National Guard), to Title 22
U.S.C. (Foreign Relations and Intercourse).51 The 2011 CRS report
provided several options for Congress to consider: (1) consider a
Directive Type Memorandum regarding SPP funding, (2) direct periodic
evaluations, (3) require centralized approval of SPP activities, and (4)
codify the SPP in law. 52 Still, the report acknowledged SPP's ability
to build enduring relationships; capitalize upon unique civilian skill
sets of National Guard Soldiers and Airmen and the dual state and
federal status of the National Guard; remain engaged with high and low
priority nations; and develop unique relationships between states and
foreign countries.53 Despite the issues outlined in the CRS's report, a
15 subsequent U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) report characterized
the SPP as "a force enabler for the combatant commands". 54 [In May
2012, the GAO conducted an investigation into SPP and **found several
problems**]{.underline}. [They identified]{.underline} a lack of
comprehensive oversight that clearly defined and outlined the program's
goals, objectives, and measures of performance. There was insufficient
data available for an assessment, to include management of funding from
2007-2011, multiple data management systems, inconsistent program
terminology between the GCCs and National Guard Bureau (NGB), and
[challenges with funding civilian participation in the
program]{.underline}.55 The GAO, therefore, found that neither Congress
nor the DoD can quantitatively assess the effectiveness and efficiency
of the program.56 Thus, the GAO made the following recommendations to
the DoD in May 2012: develop an oversight process to measure program
effectiveness and standardize data management; develop specific guidance
for funding civilian participation in the program; and develop
additional training for SPP Coordinators and Bi-Lateral Affairs
Officers.57 In an effort to address the Congressional concerns, NGB
began implementing a more formal process for assessing the program's
goals, and tracking program funding in accordance with the
recommendations in the GAO's report. NGB has also initiated a more
comprehensive and formal training process for Bi-Lateral Affairs
Officers and SPP Coordinators, 58 but the ability to quantitatively
assess the program has yet to be Reached.

Historically, the SPP has faced issues stemming from the way in which
the program is funded and how funding interacts with program management
and manning. This section will detail the intricacies of SPP funding and
how it creates challenges in meeting national security cooperation
objectives. The [[SPP]{.mark} is managed by the NGB]{.underline}, and
[the]{.underline} stable-[state program management personnel are sourced
from the NG]{.underline}. However, [[engagements]{.mark} with Partner
Nations are [funded through]{.mark}]{.underline} COCOM
[[O]{.mark}perations [and]{.mark} [M]{.mark}aintenance]{.underline} (OM)
[funds]{.underline}. Significantly, the NG personnel must be on active
duty (Title 10) orders when they participate in engagements overseas.
Thus, a problem in funding is created when moving personnel from Title
32 to Title 10 status, as the care and feeding of these personnel is not
captured within OM funds, nor is it accounted for in authorizations
under traditional NGB funding streams. Furthermore, engagements are
designed to meet specific objectives, which are associated with
different authorities. Therefore, any "activity that relies on multiple
security cooperation authorities must comply with all legal and policy
requirements for each authority relied on, and use the appropriate
funding for each authority."55 The intricacies of complex engagements
spanning multiple objectives complicate planning and manning the
activities appropriately in order to utilize the best personnel
available to optimize each engagement.

Much of the management of State Partnership Program
([[SPP]{.underline}]{.mark}) activities [[is handled
by]{.underline}]{.mark} SPP coordinators assigned to each state's
[[National Guard headquarters]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** by [[military officers]{.mark} assigned
full-time to the U.S. Embassy accredited to the partner
nation]{.underline} ‒ normally from the state National Guard involved in
the partnership ‒ [[whose duty description includes]{.mark} coordinating
SPP and often [other]{.mark}]{.underline} Department of Defense
(**[[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[security cooperation
activities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The combatant commands (CCMDs) manage
the latter group, providing for their pay and performance evaluations.
These officers serve in a Title 10 status, typically hold the rank of
captain through lieutenant colonel, but have different titles and tours
of duty depending on the CCMD to which they are assigned. For example,
officers serving in embassies within the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM)
area of responsibility (AOR) are known as bilateral affairs officers
(BAOs) and serve two-year tours, which can be extended. Those in the
U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) AOR are known as traditional
combatant commander's activities (TCAs) coordinators and are usually on
six-month temporary duty assignments, which can be extended. In nations
without a BAO, TCA, or similar officer, the state's SPP coordinator
travels to the partner nation to coordinate SPP activities. The National
Guard Bureau (NGB) would prefer to have a BAO, TCA, or similar officer
stationed at the U.S. Embassy for each of the 73 partnerships, and it is
currently working on a plan to fund this.

"Shifting State Partnership Program Resources to the Asia-Pacific
Region," US Army War College,
https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA589403.pdf)//BB

The primary deterrent to SPP expansion within the Asia-Pacific region,
as well as within other geographic regions, is lack of adequate funding.
NGB currently receives a congressional funding allocation of
\$13,000,000 total for all 65 state partnerships.73 This essentially
equates to \$200,000 per partnership annually. Additionally, [each new
partnership costs approximately \$830,000 initially.]{.underline}74
Based upon an expectation that congressional funding will remain at the
current level for the next ten years, NGB currently forecasts expansion
of the program at the rate of two countries per year over the course of
the next ten years.75 Regrettably, this forecasted growth rate does not
immediately take full advantage of the maximum partnering capacity of
the National Guard. NGB estimates full partnering capacity of all 54
states and territories to be 85 partnerships.76 At the forecasted growth
rate of two partnerships per year, it will take a full decade for the
U.S. to maximize the full potential of the SPP. [In order to take full
advantage of the states' maximum partnering capacity]{.underline}, DoD
should immediately expand the program by 20 additional partnerships.
**[Congress would need to increase the funding for the
SPP]{.underline}** from its current allocation of \$13,000,000 to
\$26,600,000 initially in order **[to fund]{.underline}** the initial
**[partnership start-up costs]{.underline}**, followed by an increase in
annual funding of \$4,000,000 thereafter for a total yearly funding of

### 2AC\-\--INB\-\--Soft Power Defense

#### Soft-power is either resilient or everything else that Trump has done thumps.

**Brands 2018** - Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor at the
Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs at Johns Hopkins
University\'s School of Advanced International Studies (Hal, \"Not Even
Trump Can Obliterate America\'s Soft Power,\" Jan 18,
https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-18/not-even-trump-can-obliterate-america-s-soft-power)

Third, [[Trump]{.mark} has [weakened American soft power]{.mark} through
his own behavior]{.underline}. He is hardly the only president to say
loathsome things, but he is unique in displaying his unattractive
qualities so openly, so unembarrassedly, so repeatedly. [[The
president's use of racist and xenophobic appeals]{.underline}]{.mark},
his disdain for democratic norms, his generally crass style of rhetoric
and action --- [all these characteristics [have been dragging down
global respect for America]{.mark} since the moment he took
office]{.underline}. The outraged global reaction to the "shithole
countries" incident was sadly familiar --- it mimicked the criticism the
president earned through his refusal to condemn white supremacists after
the violence last summer in Charlottesville, Virginia, as well as
several other episodes. There is no ambiguity about the effect this is
having. As early as June 2017, America's global favorability in the Pew
poll of global attitudes and trends had dropped from 64 percent at the
end of Barack Obama's presidency to 49 percent under Trump. Large
majorities of global respondents described the American president as
"intolerant," "arrogant" and "dangerous." Even Xi Jinping and Vladimir
Putin --- ambitious dictators of revisionist countries --- had higher
personal favorability ratings than Trump. As Trump's own defense
secretary, James Mattis, has remarked, the U.S. needs to "get the power
of inspiration back." That's not going to happen as long as Trump is
president. [The real question is how long it will take American soft
power to recover once he departs]{.underline}. The good news is that
U[.[S. soft power has traditionally been quite resilient --- it has
survived globally unpopular presidents before]{.underline}]{.mark}[. The
reason for this,]{.underline} as the Harvard scholar Joseph Nye points
out, [is that over the long term U.S. soft power derives less from the
image of any individual than from the broader attractiveness of
America's society, culture and political values]{.underline}. The bad
news, however, is that [[Trump can]{.mark} nonetheless [do damage that
will not be so easy to repair]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Nicholas Burns
and Ryan Crocker, two of America's most distinguished diplomats, have
noted, the brain drain affecting the State Department today will have a
lasting effect on America's ability to exert non-military power
effectively, because the department is losing so many individuals with
experience that takes years or even decades to develop. (The fact that
applications for entry-level spots in the Foreign Service are also down
will make replacing that expertise all the harder.) More problematic
still, even if Trump does not succeed in making the U.S. a less
tolerant, less democratic, less attractive society, he may affect global
views of America even after he leaves office. Once Trump is gone, most
governments and populations around the world will probably breathe a
sigh of relief. But they won't forget that Americans elected such an
individual as its president, and they will surely wonder what that says
about the judgment and the character of the nation that has long claimed
to be the "last, best hope of mankind." [Most of the countries the U.S.
has traditionally worked with will be eager for their relationships with
the superpower to get back to normal. Yet they will have seen what the
U.S. electoral system is capable of producing, and so [it will be a long
time before the world]{.mark} ever [looks at America]{.mark} quite [the
same way again]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### Soft power is [irrelevant]{.underline} to leadership.

**Fedirka 2017** - Senior Analyst @ Geopolitical Futures (Allison,
\"Hard Power is Still King,\" Jul 20,
https://geopoliticalfutures.com/hard-power-still-king/)

Soft Power Doesn't Make Great Powers Nevertheless[, many remain fixated
on soft power. Just this week, [a]{.mark}]{.underline} U.K.-based
consultancy [[firm]{.underline}]{.mark} called Portland, in cooperation
with the USC Center on Public Diplomacy, [[published a report ranking
the]{.mark} world's [top 30 countries by soft power]{.mark}. [The
ranking is based on the composite score of soft power]{.mark}
[elements]{.mark}: culture, digital footprint, government, engagement,
education and business/enterprise.]{.underline} The first thing that
stands out is that [[European countries dominate the list,]{.mark} and
these countries outrank others that are geopolitical
heavyweights]{.underline}. [Ireland outranks Russia, and Greece is above
China]{.underline}. In fact, Russia, China and Turkey are all in the
bottom six of this top-30 ranking. That two small European countries are
considered more powerful than three much larger countries -- countries
that are major geopolitical centers of gravity -- should automatically
raise questions about the credibility of soft power. A second
observation is that [most of the countries at the top of the soft power
ranking -- France, the U.K., [the U.S]{.mark}. and Germany -- [are also
among the world leaders in hard pow]{.mark}]{.underline}[er]{.mark}[.
[The U.S. has]{.mark} regularly [demonstrated]{.mark} that through hard
power measures such as sanctions or military activity[, it can coerce
other countries to change their behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. Germany
is the economic powerhouse of the European Union and has threatened
economic measures against smaller EU countries, especially Greece, to
coerce them into supporting EU regulations. France's cultural influence
-- a component of soft power -- does have global reach, but the
foundation for this cultural influence was colonization, a product of
hard power. [[Soft power]{.mark} reads well on paper, but its
[dependence on persuasion makes it]{.mark} largely
[inconsequential]{.mark} in the world of geopolitics, whereas hard power
dictates reality and the course of events]{.underline}.

#### Too many alt causes to soft power *[swamp]{.underline}* their internal links. 

**Betley 2017** - studied philosophy, politics, and economics at St.
Olaf College (Alexander M, \"The decline of American soft power - will
it persist after Trump?,\" Oct 6,
https://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2017/10/decline-american-soft-power-will-it-persist-after-trump)

Turmoil, disengagement But today, as noted by Mattis, [the [turmoil
associated with domestic political discord]{.mark}, as well as a
disengagement with the international community on key issues, [puts U.S.
soft power severely at ris]{.mark}]{.underline}[k]{.mark}. Domestically,
[[the]{.mark} president's [DACA debacle, as well as his failure
to]{.mark} unequivocally [denounce]{.mark} the violence instigated and
perpetrated by [neo-Nazis]{.mark}]{.underline} and white supremacists in
Charlottesville[, [have left much of the world
reeling]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the instance of
Charlottesville, where President Donald Trump resorted to proclaiming
that there was "blame on both sides," it took a foreign leader, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel, to rightfully condemn the events as
"horrifying," "racist," and "evil." Though Global Trumpism (to use Mark
Blyth's aptly entitled phrase) seems to be sweeping the Western world,
basic liberal democratic values remain a fundamental linchpin of global
order. [[Trump's antics,]{.mark} glaringly hypocritical to professed
American values[, repel foreign actors and damage our image
abroad]{.mark}]{.underline} --- ultimately undermining our soft power.
Additionally, [[blunders over]{.mark} the support of [NATO]{.mark},
withdrawal from the [Paris]{.mark} Climate Accord, [and]{.mark}
bellicose [threats]{.mark}]{.underline} of meeting the North Korean
challenge with "fire and fury like the world has never seen" further
[[weaken our international standing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Paris has
been, more than anything, an acknowledgment of the grave threat climate
change poses to human society. Though the accord doesn't contain binding
agreements upon signatory states, the concerted will of the
international community to hold strong to Paris leaves the United States
isolated from international political consensus on perhaps the most
sensitive issue of our time. Taking a serious toll Recent polling data
from the Pew Research Center suggests these occurrences are having a
serious toll on our power of attraction. Whereas only 25 to 30 percent
of Europeans polled during Barack Obama\'s administration felt the U.S.
was "on the decline," recent surveys taken during the Trump
administration show this number has spiked to 52 percent. [Fewer
countries than ever before view the United States as the world's leading
economic power]{.underline} (many replacing it with China). Nearly [75
percent of the world has given Trump a vote of no confidence in his
ability "to do the right thing regarding world affairs."]{.underline}
This is in stark contradistinction to Obama's time in office, where at
any given moment the world population believed he would "do the right
thing regarding world affairs" over 75 percent of the time. These trends
and numbers, however, only confirm what many of us had already feared
--- President Trump's unwillingness or inability to protect and advance
fundamental U.S. interests due to the political necessity of maintaining
his base at home. And although Mattis and Nye are both optimistic of the
United States\' ability to retain or recover many of her soft power
resources in the future, such assurances in an age of pressing political
challenges and revisionist international powers are surely no guarantee.
Rather, it is much more likely this cascade begun by the Trump
administration, indicative of the deeper and systemic pathologies of
American political institutions, will persist far beyond a single
presidency. As the ancient Greek historian, Thucydides, once warned, the
delusional self-aggrandizement and egoism of a declining power
accelerates its demise. Cleon-like, [[Trump is]{.underline}]{.mark}
accelerating ours, [[ushering in the]{.mark} tragic and untimely
[decline of American soft power]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Soft power fails. 

Jim **Lacey 13** --- Jim Lacey, Professor of Strategic Studies at the
Marine Corps War College, holds a Ph.D. in Military History from Leeds
University, 2013 ("Soft Power, Smart Power," National Review Online,
April 22^nd^, Available Online at
http://www.nationalreview.com/article/346131/soft-power-smart-power,
Accessed 05-27-2013)

During World War II, Stalin's advisers encouraged him to seek the favor
of the pope. He famously replied: "How many divisions does the pope
have?" Decades later, the Soviets came to realize that papal power was
not something to cavalierly disregard. Many, in fact, claim that Pope
John Paul II's moral authority was decisive in breaking the Soviet hold
on Poland and propelling the Evil Empire toward its final demise. It
was, therefore, a true example of the clout of "soft power." Of course,
one can maintain that view only by discounting the massive U.S. and NATO
military forces that kept Soviet hard power in check for decades. A few
years back, a number of policymakers, jumping on a popular academic
trend given its greatest voice by Joseph Nye, began espousing a theory
of soft power. In this new and shiny vision, America could wield its
greatest global influence through the power of its example. The world
would just look at how good we were, and how great it was to be an
American, and clamor to follow us. Somehow these visionaries neglected
to notice that Europe's almost total unilateral disarmament had failed
to translate into influence on the global stage. Rather, it had done the
opposite. In a remarkably short time, European opinions on any matter of
consequence ceased to matter. Worse, a large segment of the world took a
good look at the American example and was repelled. Some of these people
launched the 9/11 attack. At some point, it became clear that those
holding a world vision that included returning to eighth-century
barbarism were not finding our example attractive. Our deep-thinking
strategists realized they needed a new answer. What they came up with
was even more seductive than soft power. In the future, America would
prosper through the employment of "smart power." One wonders if our
policymakers had been willfully employing "dumb power" for the previous
two centuries. In any case, smart-power advocates claimed that a new
policy nirvana was attainable, if only we could find the right mix of
soft and hard power. Well, [[soft power]{.mark} and smart power were
[]{.mark}fascinating intellectual exercises that **[led
nowhere]{.mark}**. [**Iran** is still building nuclear weapons,
**No**]{.mark}**rth [Ko]{.mark}rea** is [threatening]{.mark} to nuke
[U.S. cities, and **China**]{.mark} is [becoming]{.mark} militarily
[more aggressive]{.mark}. It turns out that power is what it has always
been --- the ability to influence and control others --- and deploying
it requires, as it always has, **hard instruments**. [Without superior
military power and]{.mark} the [economic strength]{.mark} that underpins
it, [the U.S. would have no]{.mark} more [ability to influence global
events]{.mark} than **Costa Rica**]{.underline}. When President Obama
made the strategic decision to pivot toward Asia, he did not follow up
by sending dance troupes to China, or opening more cultural centers
across the Pacific's great expanse. Rather, he ordered the U.S. military
to begin shifting assets into the region, so as to show the seriousness
of our intent. If North Korea is dissuaded from the ultimate act of
stupidity, it will have a lot more to do with our maintenance of ready
military forces in the region than with any desire the North Korean
regime has for a continuing flow of Hollywood movies. [By now [**every
serious strategist and policymaker** understands]{.mark} that [if the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is going to
continue influencing global events it requires **hard
power**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- a military --- [second to
none]{.underline}. That is what makes a new report from the
well-respected Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
troubling. According to SIPRI, in 2012, China's real military spending
increased by nearly 8 percent, while Russia's increased by a whopping 16
percent. Worse, SIPRI expects both nations to increase spending by even
greater percentages this year. The United States, on the other hand,
decreased real spending by 6 percent last year, with much larger cuts on
the way. After a decade of war, much of our military equipment is simply
worn out and in need of immediate replacement. Moreover, technology's
rapid advance continues, threatening much of our current weapons
inventory with obsolescence. [As much as the]{.underline} utopians
([soft-power believers]{.underline}) [want to deny it, American power is
weakening even as the world becomes progressively less stable and more
dangerous]{.underline}. In a world where too many states are led by men
who still believe Mao's dictum that "Power comes from the barrel of a
gun," weakness is dangerous. Weakness is also a choice. The United
States, despite our current economic woes, can easily afford the cost of
recapitalizing and maintaining our military. We are not even close to
spending levels that would lead one to worry about "imperial
overstretch." Rather, our long-term security is being eaten up so as to
fund "entitlement overstretch." I suppose that one day, [if left
unchecked, the welfare state will absorb so much spending that the only
military we can afford will be a shadow of what has protected us for the
past seven decades. Soft power will then]{.underline} cease to be one
option among many and, instead, [become our only choice. [We will become
**as relevant** ]{.mark}**to the rest of the world [as
Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I wonder how many people realize just how
different their daily lives will become if that day arrives. [For a long
time, American hard power has cast a protective shield around the
liberal world order. It will not be pretty when that is
gone]{.underline}.

There is [[no]{.mark} scientific [basis]{.mark} to suggest that
[climate]{.mark} **breakdown will**]{.underline} "[annihilate
intelligent **life**]{.underline}" (by which I assume the report authors
[[mean]{.mark} [**human** **extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}) by 2050.
However, climate breakdown does pose a grave threat to civilization as
we know it, and the potential for mass suffering on a scale perhaps
never before encountered by humankind. This should be enough reason for
action without any need for exaggeration or misrepresentation! A
"Hothouse Earth" scenario plays out that sees Earth's temperatures
doomed to rise by a further 1°C (1.8°F) even if we stopped emissions
immediately. Peter Kalmus, Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory
This word choice perhaps reveals a bias on the part of the author of the
article. A temperature can't be doomed. And while I certainly do not
encourage false optimism, [assuming]{.underline} that [humanity is

et al (2017) although the report does not include a citation of the
paper as the source of that statement. The way it is written here (and
in the report) is misleading because it gives the impression that
everyone dies in those conditions. That is not actually how Mora et al
define "deadly heat" -- they merely looked for heatwaves when somebody
died (not everybody) and then used that as the definition of a "deadly"
heatwave. North America suffers extreme weather events including
wildfires, drought, and heatwaves. Monsoons in China fail, the great
rivers of Asia virtually dry up, and rainfall in central America falls
by half. Andrew King, Research fellow, University of Melbourne:

Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory: The deadly heat projections
(this, and the one from the previous paragraph) come from Mora et al
(2017)1. It should be clarified that "deadly heat" here means heat and
humidity beyond a two-dimension threshold where at least one person in
the region subject to that heat and humidity dies (i.e., not everyone
instantly dies). That said, in my opinion, the projections in Mora et al
are conservative and the methods of Mora et al are sound. I did not
check the claims in this report against Mora et al but I have no reason
to think they are in error. 1- Mora et al (2017) Global risk of deadly
heat, Nature Climate Change The knock-on consequences affect national
security, as the scale of the challenges involved, such as pandemic
disease outbreaks, are overwhelming. Armed conflicts over resources may
become a reality, and have the potential to escalate into nuclear war.
In the worst case scenario, a scale of destruction the authors say is
beyond their capacity to model, there is a 'high likelihood of human
civilization coming to an end'. Willem Huiskamp, Postdoctoral research
fellow, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research: This is a highly
questionable conclusion. The reference provided in the report is for the
"Global Catastrophic Risks 2018" report from the "Global Challenges
Foundation" and not peer-reviewed literature. (It is worth noting that
this latter report also provides no peer-reviewed evidence to support
this claim). Furthermore, if it is apparently beyond our capability to
model these impacts, how can they assign a 'high likelihood' to this
outcome? While it is true that warming of this magnitude would be
catastrophic, making claims such as this without evidence serves only to
undermine the trust the public will have in the science. Daniel Swain,

The answer to my question trickled in slowly over a number of years.
[Evidence began to emerge that **[scientists]{.mark}**
**[acknowledge]{.mark}d** a large [**gap** between]{.mark} the
**actual** **[observed]{.mark}** real-world temperature
datasets]{.underline} (from satellites) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} those
temperature [[predictions]{.mark} [from]{.mark} **computer climate
[models]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While these differences may not prove
the allegations against the Climategate scientists, they do confirm one
thing: the computer climate models exaggerate the future warming rate
due to their high sensitivity to carbon dioxide emissions. As a result,
the models continue to show an excessive and unreal warming rate for
future decades. Despite plenty of evidence, the [[IPCC continues to
use]{.mark} these **[faulty]{.mark} model [predictions]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} inform the **public** and **policymakers** about future
changes in temperature. A steady stream of scientific studies has
documented the **evidence for lack of dangerous
warming**]{.underline}---IPCC's level of warming based on fifth- and
sixth-generation (CMIP5 and CMIP6) models and the apparent absence of
climate-induced ecological collapse. [In 2020 alone, [over 400]{.mark}
peer**-reviewed scientific [papers]{.mark}** [took up]{.mark} a
[**skeptical position** on **climate**
**alarmism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These papers]{.underline}---and
hundreds from previous years---[address various issues related to
climate change]{.underline}, including problems with climate change
observation, climate reconstructions, lack of anthropogenic/CO2 signal
in sea-level rise, natural mechanisms that drive climate change (solar
influence on climate, ocean circulations, cloud climate influence, ice
sheet melting in high geothermal heat flux areas), hydrological trends
that do not follow modeled expectations, the fact that corals thrive in
warm, high-CO2 environments, elevated CO2 and higher crop yields, no
increasing trends in intense hurricanes and drought frequency, the myth
of mass extinctions due to global cooling, etc. [[Academia]{.mark} is
[filled with]{.mark} scientific [literature]{.mark} [that
**contradicts**]{.mark} the [position of]{.mark} those who believe
[climate change is **unprecedented**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Also, during
the course of the last decade, it became apparent that most of Al Gore's
claims in his 2006 documentary were false. Contrary to his claims, polar
bear populations remained steady, the Arctic did not become ice free
during the summer of 2014, and storms did not get stronger due to global
warming. In simple words, Gore misled the world and promoted falsehood
as science, and he continues to do so while profiting from a renewable
industry that is sold as the cure for global warming. Yet, he himself
generates carbon dioxide emissions many times higher than an average
family's. So, [not only are the predictions of models
wrong]{.underline}, [but also the interpretations of]{.underline}
climate data and the propaganda of a [climate doomsday were also
wrong]{.underline}. Today, we know the modern [[warming]{.mark}
[rate]{.mark} is [not **unprecedented**]{.mark}. [Warming]{.mark} of
such magnitude has **[happened]{.mark} [twice]{.mark}** [within]{.mark}
the [past **2000** **years**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Further, ice at both
poles is at historic highs, even compared with the Little Ice Age of the
17th century. Besides, there has been no increase in extreme weather
events due to climate change and the loss of lives due to environmental
disasters has drastically reduced during the last 100 years. So, I am a
climate realist. I acknowledge that there has been a gradual increase in
global average temperature since the end of the Little Ice Age in the
17th century. I acknowledge that climate change can happen in both
ways---warming and cooling. I do understand that anthropogenic CO2
emissions and other greenhouse gases could have positively contributed
to the warming from mid-20th century onwards. I also acknowledge that
warming and the increased atmospheric carbon dioxide that has
contributed to it have actually helped society. The current atmospheric
carbon dioxide concentration, nearly 50 percent higher than in the 17th
century, and the warming---which has occurred chiefly in winter, in
higher latitudes and altitudes, and at night, thus raising cold
temperatures but with little effect on hot temperatures---have actually
resulted in optimal conditions for global plant growth, thus aiding in
the flourishing of the agricultural sector. The Bengal tiger populations
have bounced back, and polar bear populations are steady, thanks to
conservation efforts. Forest area in Europe is increasing every year,
and countries are planting tree saplings at a record rate. Life
expectancy has reached all-time highs in many countries, and more people
are constantly pulled out of extreme poverty every year (although
business lockdowns to fight COVID-19 threaten to reverse that trend).
Access to freshwater has improved and human productivity has increased
drastically. So, [there is [no actual **climate
emergency**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, what we have are celebrities,
activists, un-elected political bodies like the UN, and even some
climate scientists religiously promoting a popular doomsday belief. [The
[models]{.mark}]{.underline} do not know the future, and neither do the
Climategate scientists. But an [[exaggerated]{.mark} view of
**[future]{.mark}** warming provides the ideal background for
anti-carbon-based fuels policies that will undermine the **economic
well-being** of every society in the world.]{.underline} We must not
allow that.

#### Their models are [bad]{.underline} and [offend]{.underline} consensus

**Piper 19** \-- Kelsey Piper, citing John Halstead climate change
mitigation researcher at the Founders Pledge. \[Is climate change an
\"existential threat\" --- or just a catastrophic one? 6-28-2019,
https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/13/18660548/climate-change-human-civilization-existential-risk\]

I also talked to some researchers who study existential risks, like John
[[Halstead]{.underline}]{.mark}, who studies climate change mitigation
at the philanthropic advising group Founders Pledge, and who
[[has]{.mark} **a detailed online [analysis]{.mark}** [of
**all**]{.mark} **the (strikingly few) [climate]{.mark} change
[papers]{.mark}** [that address **ex**]{.mark}**istential
[risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} (his analysis has not been peer-reviewed
yet).

Halstead looks into the models of potential temperature increases that
Breakthrough's report highlights. The models show a surprisingly
**[large [chance of extreme]{.mark} degrees of
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Halstead points out that in many
papers, this [[is]{.mark} the [result of]{.mark} **the
[simplistic]{.mark} form** of **statistical [modeling]{.mark}**
used]{.underline}. Other papers have made a convincing case that
[**[this]{.mark} form of statistical [modeling]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}
**an [irresponsible]{.mark} way** to reason about climate
change]{.underline}, and that [**the dire [projections]{.mark}** [rest
on **a**]{.mark} **statistical [method]{.mark}** [that is]{.mark}
**widely [understood]{.mark}** [to be]{.mark} **a [bad]{.mark}
approach** for that question]{.underline}.

Further, "the carbon effects don't seem to pose an existential risk," he
told me. "People use 10 degrees as an illustrative example" --- of a
nightmare scenario where climate change goes much, much worse than
expected in every respect --- "and looking at it, [**even [10
degrees]{.mark}** [would not]{.mark} **really cause the
[collapse]{.mark}** of industrial [civilization]{.mark},"]{.underline}
though the effects would still be pretty horrifying. (On the question of
whether an increase of 10 degrees would be survivable, there is much
debate.)

Does it matter if climate change is an existential risk or just a really
bad one?

That last distinction Halstead draws --- of climate change as being
awful but not quite an existential threat --- is a controversial one.

That's where a difference in worldviews looms large: Existential risk
researchers are extremely concerned with the difference between the
annihilation of humanity and mass casualties that humanity can survive.
To everyone else, those two outcomes seem pretty similar.

To academics in philosophy and public policy who study the future of
humankind, an existential risk is a very specific thing: a disaster that
destroys all future human potential and ensures that no generations of
humans will ever leave Earth and explore our universe. The death of 7
billion people is, of course, an unimaginable tragedy. But researchers
who study existential risks argue that the annihilation of humanity is
actually much, much worse than that. Not only do we lose existing
people, but we lose all the people who could otherwise have had the
chance to exist.

In this worldview, [**7 billion humans dying** is **not just seven
times** as bad as 1 billion humans dying --- it's **much
worse**]{.underline}. This style of thinking seems plausible enough when
you think about past tragedies; the Black Death, which killed at least a
tenth of all humans alive at the time, was not one-tenth as bad as a
hypothetical plague that wiped us all out.

Most people don't think about existential risks much. **[Many [analyses
of climate]{.mark} change]{.underline}** --- including the report Vice
based its article on --- [[treat]{.mark} the [deaths of **a
billion**]{.mark} **people** [and]{.mark} **the [extinction]{.mark} of
humanity** as **pretty similar outcomes,
[interchangeably]{.mark}**]{.underline} using descriptions of
catastrophes that would kill hundreds of millions and catastrophes
that'd kill us all. And the existential risk conversation can come
across as tone-deaf and off-puttingly academic, as if it's no big deal
if merely hundreds of millions of people will die due to climate change.

Obviously, and this needs to be stressed, climate change is a big deal
either way. But there are differences between catastrophe and
extinction. If the models tell us that all humans are going to die, then
extreme solutions --- which might save us, or might have unprecedented,
catastrophic negative consequences --- might be worth trying. Think of
plans to release aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight and
cool the planet back down in the manner that volcanic explosions do.
It'd be an enormous endeavor with significant potential downsides (we
don't even yet know all the risks it might pose), but if the alternative
is extinction then those risks would be worth taking.

But if the models tell us that [[climate]{.mark} change [is]{.mark}
**devastating but [survivable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as [[most models
show]{.underline}]{.mark}, then those last-ditch solutions should
perhaps stay in the toolkit for now.

Then there's the morale argument. Defenders of overstating the risks of
climate change point out that, well, understating them isn't working.
The IPCC may have chosen to maintain optimism about containing warming
to 2 degrees Celsius in the hopes that it'd spur people to action, but
if so, it hasn't really worked. Maybe alarmism will achieve what
optimism couldn't.

That's how Spratt sees it. "Alarmism?" he said to me. "Should we be
alarmed about where we're going? Of course we should be."

Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg has taken an arguably alarmist bent in
her advocacy for climate solutions in the EU, saying, "Our house is on
fire. I don't want your hope. \... I want you to panic." She's gotten
strong reactions from politicians, suggesting that at least sometimes a
relentless focus on the severity of the emergency can get results.

So where does this all leave us? It's worthwhile to look into the
worst-case scenarios, and even to highlight and emphasize them. But
[[it's important to]{.mark} **accurately [represent]{.mark}**
[current]{.mark} climate [consensus]{.mark}]{.underline} along the way.
It's hard to see how we solve a problem we have widespread
misapprehensions about in either direction, and when a warning is
overstated or inaccurate, it may sow more confusion than inspiration.

[Climate change **won't kill us all**]{.underline}. That matters. Yet
it's one of the biggest challenges ahead of us, and the results of our
failure to act will be devastating. That message --- the most accurate
message we've got --- will have to stand on its own.

#### Nuclear war with Russia

**Spiro \'99** (Peter J. Spiro, Associate Professor at Hofstra Law
School, 1999, Lexis//GH-Aspomer)

Zschernig has been questioned even by those who otherwise propound
federal exclusivity. n87 But the decision seems both explained and
justified (at least at the time) by its Cold War context. [In the
tinderbox world of superpower competition, the potential consequences of
giving offense were obviously profound]{.underline}. [One could not
expect the Soviets]{.underline} necessarily [to understand that when a
state official spoke, **it was not for the nation**]{.underline}; or at
least [one would not want to risk error]{.underline} in assessing that
perception. At the very least, **[there was the specter of *state
action* upsetting the elaborately choreographed relationship between
East and West]{.underline}** Blocs; at worst, **[one
could plausibly draw a scenario in which offense caused by state
action lit the fuse to World War III]{.underline}**. Nor against this
backdrop could one rely on the political branches to beat back state
action before the damage was done; n88 the context, in other words,
supported the strict application of a dormant federal power. n89
\[\*1243\] Zschernig found parallels in two other contexts at the
juncture of state activity and foreign relations. In applying the
dormant foreign Commerce Clause to strike down a state tax on
foreign-owned cargo containers, the Court in Japan Line emphasized the
\"paramount\" requirement that the federal government \"speak with one
voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments.\"
n90 The Court stressed the danger that a state tax on international
instrumentalities could provoke the retaliation of foreign nations,
which \"retaliation of necessity would be directed at American
transportation equipment in general, not just that of the taxing state,
so that the Nation as a whole would suffer.\" n91 As in Zschernig, the
Japan Line Court nullified the state measure notwithstanding the absence
of an affirmative federal policy (either through treaty or statute) on
the issue. California, the Court concluded, \"may not tell this Nation
or Japan how to run their foreign policies\" in \"an area where a
uniform federal rule is essential\... Even a slight overlapping of tax -
a problem that might be deemed de minimis in a domestic context -
assumes importance when sensitive matters of foreign relations and
national sovereignty are concerned.\" n92 Perhaps even more clearly than
the dormant foreign affairs power, this sort of severe application of
the dormant foreign Commerce Clause would have seemed defensible,
especially insofar as it built upon a well-settled dormant power in the
domestic commerce context. n93 Japan Line was handed down against an
international economic backdrop not far removed from the corresponding
national security context, where before theentrenchment of today\'s free
trade regimes the specter of trade wars loomed in economic relations
even between friendly states. \[\*1244\] Finally, one can also integrate
into the rule of federal exclusivity the designation of customary
international law as part of federal common law. Under the regime of
Swift v. Tyson, n94 the federal courts were free to apply general common
law, including customary international law, without regard to the common
law interpretations of state courts; there was no need specially to
justify the application of customary international law in the absence of
controlling state or federal statutory or constitutional law. n95 That
changed with Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, n96 which denied the federal
courts the power to create common law \"except in matters governed by
the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress.\" n97 The presumption
thereafter was that federal common lawmaking had to be grounded in some
particular federal interest. n98 It was only with the Supreme Court\'s
1964 decision in Sabbatino that the application of customary
international law as federal common law was found acceptable under Erie.
n99 That holding can be justified on the same basis as the dormant
\[\*1245\] foreign affairs power. Inappropriate interpretation of or
noncompliance with customary international law could cause offense to
foreign nations, which might respond with action against the nation as a
whole. The Court did not clearly articulate its holding in such terms,
adverting only to unspecified \"potential dangers\" n100 were Erie
extended to legal problems affecting international relations, and noting
\"a concern for uniformity in this country\'s dealings with foreign
nations.\" n101 The decision did, however, cite commentary that
advocated federal court interpretation of customary international law,
\"lest the provincialism of state courts lead to impolitic judicial
decisions offensive to the sensibilities of foreign nations.\" n102 As
with the dormant foreign affairs power cases, the rule against state
court interpretation of customary international law would seem to have
been justified, especially in a Cold War context. To take the facts of
Sabbatino itself, the federal government couldn\'t have state courts
misapplying the act of state doctrine n103 to deny the effectiveness of
Cuban (and other Communist Bloc) nationalizations; the risk of upsetting
the superpower balance would have been too great to trust the
responsibility of applying or interpreting the relevant standards to
nonfederal actors. n104 And that perhaps explains why \[\*1246\] the
inclusion of customary international law in the category of federal
common law has, until recently, been accepted as uncontroversial. n105
And so these three different strands of the exclusivity principle - the
dormant foreign affairs power, the dormant foreign commerce power, and
the inclusion of customary international law as a part of federal common
law - all seemed sustainable in a world that would not differentiate
between the component unit and the whole. However important they would
otherwise be, federalism values could not be vindicated in the face of a
plausible and substantial risk that unconstrained state action would
result in dramatic harm to the nation as a whole. C. [The Case for
Maintaining Federal Exclusivity ]{.underline}If one assumed a world in
which nations were still held responsible for the acts of their
component units, one could support a fairly strong case for confirming
the holdings of Zschernig, Japan Line, and Sabbatino, and the precept
that the [states should be denied the tools
to **interfere** with national foreign relations]{.underline}. n106
Constitutional pedigree aside, the functional \[\*1247\] underpinnings
of the exclusivity principle are powerful. It is not just that
individual states will take action that will harm other states, though
that fact highlights the problems of state-level action from a
democratic process perspective. It is that such [decisions will be
consistently distorted in the face of significant externalities;
state-level actors, because they do not shoulder the consequences of
their actions, will not take into account those consequences in the
decision-making balance]{.underline}. [These externalities will also
tend to create **information deficiencies**; **because the states will
not shoulder the consequences of their conduct, they have less incentive
to understand what those consequences will be**.]{.underline} Indeed, a
standard lament of [state-level foreign policy]{.underline} activity is
that it [is based on insufficient expertise]{.underline}. n107 Assuming
continued externalities, the case against state-level action remains
strong. The magnitude of state and local international activity has
grown dramatically in recent years, so that one might expect a growing
risk of unwelcome resulting entanglements; though much of this activity
is benign, some provokes the traditional concerns of the exclusivity
principle. [The]{.underline} persistent [potential
for]{.underline} [subfederal action to **disrupt national foreign
relations** is demonstrated by the recent diplomatic controversy and
constitutional litigation concerning state ]{.underline}and
local [sanctions against companies doing business in Burma]{.underline}.
n108 Though they enjoy the formal power to suppress it, the political
branches of the federal government remain less well positioned to police
this activity than the courts. The changing construction of
international society aside, n109 perhaps the best argument for
softening the rule of federal exclusivity highlights the end of the Cold
War and the diminished ultimate dangers of foreign retaliation. In
recent years there has been a marked blurring of the distinction between
foreign and domestic affairs; so fast has the line eroded - hastened by
the communications revolution, the greater ease of travel, and the
growing priority of trade over traditional national security issues -
that globalization has become almost an instant cliche. The
international arena is now very much of local interest, as reflected in
the dramatically \[\*1248\] heightened profile of state and local
governments on the world scene. This is particularly pronounced in
matters relating to trade and investment. One in six private-sector jobs
in the United States is now linked to the global economy. n110 The
number of Americans working for foreign companies in the United States
now stands at five million; foreign direct investment in the United
States has quadrupled since 1981. n111 [Subfederal
jurisdictions]{.underline} now see international trade and foreign
investment as critical to their economic well-being. They [compete
ferociously for foreign investment with tax breaks and other
incentives]{.underline}. n112 [Most states now maintain at least one
trade office abroad;]{.underline} n113 many have concluded trade-related
agreements with foreign entities; n114 and the foreign trade mission has
become a standard responsibility for governors and large-city mayors.
Most of these trade and investment-related activities are
unobjectionable, from both policy and constitutional perspectives. n115
\[\*1249\] [The growing importance of the world to the states has also
made the states more important to the world. If they stood as
independent nations, seven American states would be counted among the
top twenty-five countries in terms of gross domestic
product]{.underline}; even Vermont, with the smallest economy among the
states, would outrank almost 100 nations. n116 It is thus not surprising
that foreign authorities, themselves critically interested in global
commerce, court state-level officials to attract investment from and
promote exports within the subfederal jurisdictions.
Moreover, [state]{.underline} and
local [governments]{.underline} directly [control
vast]{.underline} procurement [budgets]{.underline}; the annual
expenditures of state and local governments exceeds one trillion
dollars. n117 [Subfederal]{.underline} governments now [have
international economic clout. The problem is that this clout can
and will occasionally be deployed in ways that **offend** foreign
nations.]{.underline}

[militarily]{.mark}, or otherwise]{.underline}---[[against the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[**as a
whole**.]{.underline}]{.mark}108 For the Framers, this was no
hypothetical danger. Their experience under the Articles of
Confederation underscored the very real threats and concrete retaliatory
conduct, including war, that state disregard of national treaty
obligations had provoked. Since 1789, the Supreme Court has consistently
echoed the same concerns. In 1832, in Brown v. Maryland,109 the Court
struck down a Maryland law that required licenses for certain imports,
emphasizing that the state law at issue could spark disputes with other
nations. \"What answer,\" Chief Justice Marshall asked, \"would the
United States give to the complaints and just reproaches to which such
an extraordi¬nary circumstance would expose them? No apology could be
received, or even offered.\"110 It is one thing, the Court has
suggested, for a state to expose itself to the risks of conflict with a
foreign power, but it is quite another to arrogate to itself the power
to expose its fellow states to those risks. Hence, in the same vein, the
Court in 1875 struck down a California law that in effect regulated
immi¬gration, and by implication, commerce with foreign nations. The
injured nation could not direct a claim for redress to California, the
Court observed, because California could: hold no exterior relations
with other nations. It \[the foreign claim\] would be made upon the
government of the United States. If that government should get into a
difficulty which would lead to war, or to suspension of intercourse,
would California alone suffer, or all the Union?111 A century later, in
1979, California imposed an ad valorem property tax on foreign-owned
cargo containers. The Court again invalidated the state law, mind¬ful
that the \"risk of retaliation by Japan \... \[was\] acute, and such
retaliation of necessity would be felt by the Nation as a whole.\"112
The Court\'s concerns in this regard are now embodied in the so-called
\"one voice\" doctrine---a putative requirement, inferred from the
Constitution\'s text and structure, that the nation speak with one voice
in the realm of foreign affairs. [The [one-voice
doctrine]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[reflects a **reasonable**]{.mark}
**national [interest]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[in bolstering the
**efficacy** of **American foreign [policy]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} The
national interest]{.underline} sometimes [[benefits
from]{.underline}]{.mark} at least [the appearance of national [unity
and]{.mark} popular [support.]{.mark} Open [conflict between the
fed]{.mark}eral [and state]{.mark} government[s]{.mark} [on
**key**]{.mark} **foreign policy [questions]{.mark}**]{.underline} can
**[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** [national foreign policy
[objectives.]{.mark}]{.underline} Of course, sometimes the foreign
policy of the federal government is less than clear. Yet [the federal
government's silence]{.underline} with respect to a particular issue of
foreign policy [does not]{.underline} neces¬sarily [imply an absence of
a federal policy. Still less does it indicate that the states should
feel free to enter the field. [Federal silence]{.mark}, inaction,
[or]{.mark} [ambiguity]{.mark} [may be calculated.]{.mark} Sometimes the
best policy is]{.underline} to do and say nothing, or deliberately to
attempt, with nuance[, to leave national policy unclear.]{.underline}113
But the question is whether the doctrine has been expanded beyond the
limit of its logic.114

From a defensive realist perspective[, longer **[partnerships]{.mark}

variable: the number of military partnerships a state is engaged

in can threaten its opposing powers, who may feel the need to engage in
partnerships of their own to maintain a balance of alliances and power.

[Suspicious about the military content and [**wary of antagonizing
China,** Nepal rejects a U.S]{.mark}. disaster mitigation
[program]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fearing that [the U.S. State Partnership
Program ([SPP) is a trap to]{.mark} involve Nepal in an anti-China
military alliance, the Sher Bahadur Deuba government has rejected the
program.]{.underline} The Deuba government -- like predecessor
governments in 2015, 2017 and 2019 -- was initially impressed with the
SPP for its disaster mitigation content, but it had to reject the
partnership in the end, because the mood in Nepal is unambiguously
against foreign programs that smack of a military alliance. Nepali
governments have generally not wanted any transnational agreements that
could jeopardize their delicately balanced relationship between India
and the United States on the on hand and China on the other. [Flush with
success in convincing the Deuba government to get the Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact ratified by the Nepali parliament in
February, the U.S. moved to bolster the military dimension to Nepal-U.S.
relations by pushing ahead with a pending request from Nepal to join the
SPP.]{.underline} The SPP is a bilateral program that is outwardly
peaceful in intent. But it is perceived to have deep-set military
objectives with consequences not only for Nepal's internal security, but
also for relations with its two big neighbors, China and India[. Critics
in Nepal say **that [joining]{.mark} the [SPP would be tantamount to
signing]{.mark} onto to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy ([IPS]{.mark}**).
The impact on Sino-Nepal relations would be catastrophic if the SPP
leads to stronger Nepal-U.S. military ties.]{.underline} At the same
time, [India might not be thrilled either.]{.underline} Under the SPP,
the Indian Army's exclusive and unique relationship with the Nepali Army
would be diluted, a prospect the conservative Indian top brass cannot
reconcile with. Critics say that while disaster mitigation is fine, the
rub lies elsewhere: The SPP is administered by the National Guard
Bureau, guided by State Department foreign policy goals, and executed by
each U.S. state's senior military officer (the state adjutant general)
in support of the Department of Defense policy goals. "[Through SPP, the
National Guard conducts military-to-military engagements in support of
defense security goals but also leverages whole-of-society relationships
and capabilities to facilitate broader interagency and corollary
engagements spanning military, government, economic and social spheres,"
the U.S. National Guard website says. In other words, [the
**SPP**]{.mark} is [a multi-purpose vehicle to **advance**]{.mark}
wide-ranging **[U.S. political and strategic objectives under]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} overall [cloak of humanitarian
engagement]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Worried about Nepal coming under more
pressure from the United States, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi
called on Nepal's home minister, ostensibly to get confirmation of
Nepal's continued adherence to the "One China" policy. But sources said
that [the SPP was the envoy's main concern. Nepal's condemnation of
Russia for its aggression in Ukraine had made Beijing suspicious about
growing links between the Deuba and the Biden regimes.]{.underline}

We held in New York that Congress cannot compel the States to enact or
enforce a federal regulatory program. Today we hold that Congress cannot
circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the States\' officers
directly. The Federal Government may neither issue directives requiring
the States to address particular problems, nor command the States\'
officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or
enforce a federal regulatory program. It matters not whether
policymaking is involved, and no case-by-case weighing of the burdens or
benefits is necessary; such commands are fundamentally incompatible with
our constitutional system of dual sovereignty.n65 The concerns
articulated in New York and echoed again in Printz addressed the erosion
of the lines of political accountability that could result from federal
commandeering.n66 [[Federal]{.mark} [authority]{.mark} [to **compel
