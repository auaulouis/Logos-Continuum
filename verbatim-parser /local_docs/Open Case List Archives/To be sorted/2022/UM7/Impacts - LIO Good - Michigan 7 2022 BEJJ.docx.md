### 2AC -- No China Rise

#### Biden is actively containing China -- Indo-Pacific Strategy proves 

**Swaine, 22** -- (Michael D. Swaine- , Director of QI's East Asia
program; Director of Studies at the Quincy Institute, \"Biden pursues
China-containment in new Indo-Pacific strategy\", 7-25-2022, Responsible
Statecraft,

Even as the Ukraine crisis continues to escalate, the security situation
in Asia remains far from calm. [However, the Biden administration's
recently-released Indo-Pacific Strategy is both disappointing and
dangerous in the manner in which it doubles down on containing
China]{.underline}. By doing so, [the United States is enhancing the
risk of great power war and missing a major opportunity to engender
economic prosperity and tackle the existential threat of climate
change]{.underline}. [The depiction of the relationship with Beijing
presented]{.underline} in the two documents that spell out the [strategy
is almost entirely negative and zero-sum in nature.]{.underline} When
China is mentioned directly, it is described as using all dimensions of
its power to engage in "coercion and aggression" across the globe. It is
cast as pursuing "a sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and seeks to
become the world's most influential power." Beijing is supposedly
committed to undermining international law and "transforming the rules
and norms that have benefitted the Indo-Pacific and the world." The
broad-brush, unqualified message conveyed is very clear: [China presents
a dire threat]{.underline} to the Indo-Pacific region and the world
[that must be countered on all fronts by the U.S and its allies and
partners]{.underline}. The Indo-Pacific Strategy makes no attempt to
provide a vision or program for how an authoritarian China can coexist
peacefully and productively with the U.S. over the long term, other than
as a subordinate or compliant power. The document merely states that the
[U.S. objective "is not to change China but to shape the strategic
environment in which it operates, building a balance of influence in the
world that is maximally favorable to the United States, our allies and
partners, and the interests and values we share."]{.underline}

#### China will not be able to maintain the Chinese led order- China doesn't have its own statist approach and no country will follow on

and United States foreign policy, and the Albert G. Milbank Professor of
Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University. He is known

[Even if we were to assume]{.underline} [that China, as the leading
non-Western state, wanted to undermine and replace the existing liberal
international order, the constraints on doing so are
overwhelming]{.underline}. Presumably, an alternative order would be
less open and less rule-based. [Historically, such orders have been
organized into various illiberal political formations: regional
groupings, imperial zones, spheres of influence, and closed autarkic
blocs]{.underline}. How might China and other rising states build a
comprehensive alternative to the existing order? As a start, [China
would need to be able to come forward with some alternative set of rules
and institutions, presumably reflecting an alternative model of
political and economic organization. This might be a so-called "Beijing
Consensus," an international order that accommodated (and even promoted)
illiberal and authoritarian polities and statist economic relations.
China does have its own statist approach, but it is not clear how this
approach might work as a wider model of global order.]{.underline}
First, China's mercantilist strategy seems to work best when the rest of
the world is relatively open and liberal in orientation. A closed world
in which great powers carve out spheres of influence cuts off China from
markets and investment opportunities[. If all the countries of the world
adopted the Chinese model, this would restrict China's market space and
leadership opportunities.]{.underline} Second, [a Chinese-led illiberal
international order would require some buy-in by other states, and this
is also problematic. China is the largest and leading non-Western
developing country, but it is the only rising state that is genuinely
illiberal and authoritarian.]{.underline} It is not clear that [Brazil,
India, South Africa, or even Turkey is eager to embrace and operate
within a Beijing consensus.]{.underline} If China were to try to
promulgate a Sino-centered order---a [hegemonic/imperial order that did
not immediately rest on the consent and cooperation of other states---it
would face very steep costs]{.underline}. [If these potential partner
states did not experience substantial material benefits from
participating in the Chinese-led order, China would need to spend
resources to entice and bully these states into
cooperation.]{.underline} This would be a very huge task for a
developing country with mid-range per capita income. Over the longer
term, the success of a Chinese-centered order would depend on its
ability to "outcompete" liberal internationalism. But the less the rival
order is open and negotiated, and the less that China---as a rival
hegemon ---is willing to exercise restraint and provide public goods,
the greater the difficulty it will have in establishing a viable and
legitimate alternative.

#### US military power solves nuclear war- America international Led Order key 

**Jones 18** -- (Seth Jones- the Harold Brown Chair and is director of
the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS), \"The Future of Warfare is Irregular\",
8-26-2018, National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/future-warfare-irregular-29672)//mishelle

AMONG THE Trump administration's most significant national security
decisions has been the shift from counterterrorism to inter-state
competition. [The United States is increasingly engaging in global
rivalry with "revisionist" states like China, Russia, Iran and North
Korea]{.underline}. To do this well, [some U.S. policymakers have argued
that the United States needs to develop capabilities to
fight]{.underline}---and win---conventional and possibly even nuclear
wars against these states if deterrence fails. As the National Defense
Strategy argues, "The surest way to prevent war is to be prepared to win
one. Doing so requires a competitive approach to force development and a
consistent, multiyear investment to restore warfighting readiness and
field a lethal force." While there are good reasons to focus U.S.
national security on balancing against global and regional state
adversaries, [it would be a mistake to assume that most future conflict
will be conventional or even nuclear]{.underline}. It won't. [The United
States remains the world's preponderant military power]{.underline}. For
Russia, Iran, North Korea and even China, [conventional or nuclear war
with the United States would be risky and prohibitively
costly]{.underline}. What's more, America's struggles in Afghanistan and
Iraq suggest that the U.S. military is vulnerable when faced with
adversaries that resort to irregular strategies, operations and tactics.
These realities suggest that [competition between the United States and
its main adversaries will likely be irregular---not
conventional]{.underline}. Russia will likely continue to focus on a
suite of overt and covert actions, from supporting state and nonstate
proxies in Syria, Ukraine and potentially the Baltics to information
warfare. Iran will attempt to expand its power through proxies in
Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan and Bahrain---not by amassing a
more potent army, navy or air force capable of fighting conventional
battles against the United States. China is already spreading its
influence in the Pacific by utilizing economic coercion, conducting a
sophisticated information campaign, and resorting to fishing vessels and
other "grey zone" tactics to lay claim to islands. Even North Korea will
likely continue to develop its special operations and cyber
capabilities.The future of conflict means that the United States needs
to prepare to compete with these states not primarily with divisions,
aircraft carriers and strategic bombers---but by, with, and through
state and nonstate proxies, cyber tools, and overt and covert
information campaigns. At the moment, however, the United States is
ill-prepared for irregular competition. WHILE THE United States needs to
prepare for the possibility of conventional and nuclear war, neither
will likely be the primary means of competition for at least two
reasons. First, [the United States remains the dominant global military
power]{.underline}. [Its defense budget is still larger than the defense
budgets of the next eleven countries]{.underline} in the world
[combined]{.underline}. More importantly, [the United States' land, air,
naval, space and cyber capabilities are formidable]{.underline}. For
Russia, Iran, North Korea and even China, conventional or [nuclear war
with the United States would be risky]{.underline}. The gap between the
United States and China, in particular, is narrowing. Beijing is
developing more accurate, long-range missiles; integrated air defense;
fourth-generation fighter aircraft; enhanced naval power projection;
more advanced space and counterspace capabilities; and nuclear forces,
including a new generation solid-propellant intercontinental ballistic
missile, the df-41. [But U.S. military capabilities surpass those of its
competitors**.**]{.underline} Second[, the costs of]{.underline}
conventional and [nuclear war are likely to be staggering]{.underline}.
Over the past several years, [the U.S. government and think tanks have
conducted numerous wargames and analyses of conflicts]{.underline} [with
Russia]{.underline} in the Baltics, [China]{.underline} in the Taiwan
Straits and South China Sea, [Iran]{.underline} in the Middle East [and
North Korea]{.underline} on the Korean Peninsula. [The results are
generally bleak]{.underline}. Most conclude that [war could lead
to]{.underline} tens or [hundreds of thousands of dead soldiers and
civilians, domestic unrest, billions of dollars in economic damages, a
global economic downturn and the potential collapse of long-held
alliances]{.underline}. In addition, these [conflicts]{.underline} might
[escalate to nuclear war,]{.underline} raising the number of dead to
millions of civilians, [create]{.underline} far-reaching [environmental
destruction and trigger unthinkable global financial
costs**.**]{.underline} A U.S. war with China could reduce China's gross
domestic product (GDP) by between 25 and 35 percent and the American GDP
by between 5 and 10 percent, according to a rand report. As the report
concluded: A long and severe war could ravage China's economy, stall its
hard-earned development, and cause widespread hardship and dislocation.
Such economic damage could in turn aggravate political turmoil and
embolden separatists in China. Both the United States and China would
also suffer huge numbers of military and civilian deaths and risk
large-scale destruction of their military forces. If war expanded to
include their allies, economic and casualty figures would skyrocket even
further. [Wargames that involve a conflict between NATO and
Russia]{.underline}, including scenarios with Russian forces invading
one or more Baltic countries, [often escalate to include
the]{.underline} threat---or [use]{.underline}---[of tactical nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. Even a conventional war in the region could led to
substantial destruction. [If one or both sides used nuclear weapons, the
number of casualties would be virtually unthinkable]{.underline}. These
costs and risks will likely give Washington, Moscow, Beijing, Tehran and
even Pyongyang pause. During the Cold War, Moscow and Washington
confronted a similar bleak reality, which meant that most competition
was irregular. THE COLD War offers a useful historical lens to assess
the risks of conventional and nuclear war between major powers. NATO
planners prepared for a possible Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion of
Western Europe. The United States and other NATO countries deployed
forces close to the intra-German and Czech-German border to stop Warsaw
Pact forces from conducting an armored blitzkrieg into West Germany.
NATO also planned for nuclear war, limited or otherwise. The United
States amassed a vast nuclear arsenal and adopted strategies like
mutually assured destruction (MAD), which assumed that a full-scale use
of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the
annihilation of both the attacker and the defender. [The threat of such
heavy costs deterred conflict]{.underline}, despite some close calls.
During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States and Soviet Union
nearly went to war after a U.S. U-2 aircraft took pictures of Soviet
medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs)
under construction in Cuba. But Washington and Moscow ultimately
assessed that direct conflict was too costly. Deterrence held.

Despite everything that has happened, if we reject the counsels of the
new "realism" and resume our support for the liberal world order, it is
still within our capacity to defend it and put off its collapse, perhaps
for quite some time. [Today the order remains intact, despite the
hostility of the present administration and the weakness of the
last.]{.underline} [The international structures supporting it are
durable]{.underline}. This is partly [because they rest on geographical
realities and a distribution of power that still favor the liberal order
and]{.underline} still [pose obstacles to those who would disrupt
it]{.underline}. It is also because [liberal values,]{.underline} though
under assault, [remain a force that binds the democratic nations of the
world together.]{.underline} Authoritarianism also has its appeal and
will always compete with liberalism, but the [authoritarian governments
do not feel the same sense of commonality as]{.underline} the monarchies
and aristocracies of the early nineteenth century. [The Chinese and
Russians]{.underline} are not adversaries, but they [are not
allies]{.underline} either. They share little except their antipathy to
liberalism. [The democratic nations, however, are bound
together]{.underline} by more than common adversaries, as the post--Cold
War era has proved. [America's alliances in Europe and Asia have so far
held]{.underline}, therefore, [despite the weakening of America's
commitment under two administrations. There is still a liberal world
order to be salvaged]{.underline}, if the American people decide it is
worth salvaging. [They will also have to decide that they are prepared
to pay the costs]{.underline}, and those costs have not changed. It took
great and consistent exertions of American power and influence to create
and sustain this world order. It will take no less to continue upholding
it into the future. [Americans]{.underline} over the past two decades
[have]{.underline} become convinced that the United States is doing too
much when actually it has [been doing too little. Much of what needs to
be done to shore up the order requires only diplomatic and economic
measures]{.underline}. [The United States needs to return to the deep
engagement with Europe]{.underline} that characterized the relationship
from the postwar years to the early post--Cold War years. Americans must
understand that a healthy liberal Europe is the anchor of the order from
which they benefit. Therefore [such matters as the negotiation of
Britain's withdrawal from the EU, the Eurozone crisis, the cyber threats
from Russia, and European energy supplies must be addressed]{.underline}
not just as European problems but as transatlantic problems that affect
the United States, too. [The United States also needs to work with
European governments to address]{.underline} the [democratic
backsliding]{.underline} in Europe. Nations that entered the EU and NATO
after the Cold War had to meet high standards of democratic governance
in order to gain membership. If some have ceased to meet those
standards, they need to be suspended from membership or denied some of
the benefits of membership. Hungary and Turkey cannot expect to enjoy
the benefits of NATO, and, in Hungary's case, EU membership, so long as
they celebrate their "illiberalism" and reject the basic premises of the
liberal world order. Finally, [the United States needs to return
to]{.underline} the liberal compact when it comes to [trade and
international institutions]{.underline}. It was a serious blow to the
liberal order when the United States walked away from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership---and a great boon to China. The order will suffer further
if American trade policies seek "wins" over close allies like Canada and
Germany. Americans need to understand that [the free trade regime
undergirds the order from which they benefit as much or more than
anyone]{.underline}. It is not a "win" if that regime collapses into the
protectionism that characterized the decades before World War II. Then
[there is the question of maintaining America's military
predominance]{.underline} in the international system. [For all the talk
of "soft" power and "smart" power, it is ultimately]{.underline} the
American security guarantee, [the ability to deploy hard power to deter
and defeat potential aggressors, that provides the essential foundation
without which the liberal world order could never survive]{.underline}.
Members of Congress from both parties have underfunded the military
since the beginning of the post--Cold War era, but especially over the
last decade. Defense secretaries from both parties have raised alarms
about the increasing inability of the armed forces to perform their
missions of deterrence around the world. And the dangers of war have
only grown in recent years, not diminished. [Americans need to remember
that deterring a war is much less expensive than fighting one. It
is]{.underline} not only the money to preserve power, however, but also
the willingness to apply that power, with all the pain and the
suffering, the uncertainties and the errors, the failures and follies,
the immorality and brutality, the lost lives and the lost
treasure[.]{.underline} Most of what we need to do to sustain the
liberal order will not require sending troops, but there will be times
when it will be necessary. [It is simply dishonest to tell]{.underline}
the American [people that the relative security and prosperity they have
enjoyed can be sustained without the occasional threat or use of
force]{.underline}. There will be challenges on the Korean Peninsula, in
the South China Sea, in the Middle East, and along the fault lines
between Russia and NATO. [We would like to be sure that there will be no
more Iraqs and Vietnams, and we should do our best, learning from past
mistakes, to avoid such failures.]{.underline} But it would be foolish
to imagine we can avoid mistakes and failures entirely. [There is no
doctrine other than pure isolation and inaction that can prevent such
tragedies.]{.underline} The Obama administration offered a doctrine of
not doing "stupid" things; others have spoken of the need to fight only
"necessary" not "unnecessary" wars; in the past people have argued for
fighting only for "vital" national interests in "core" areas and
avoiding fights in the "periphery." The problem with all of these
sensible-sounding proposals is that [it is often only in hindsight that
we can be sure what was "stupid" and what was "necessary,"]{.underline}
what was "vital" and what was "peripheral" and safely ignored. There
were many smart people who believed that American intervention in
Vietnam was essential to forestall a communist victory, that it was a
vital strategic interest for the United States, partly to protect Japan
and partly in the overall effort to resist aggression. [An equally long
and distinguished list of foreign policy thinkers and politicians
supported the war in Iraq because they believed it was vital to protect
the world from what most believed were Iraq's WMD programs and from a
serial aggressor and mass killer. Later on, when those efforts
failed]{.underline}, when the intelligence proved faulty and the
political-military strategies inadequate, [many of those who supported
those wars declared]{.underline} not only that they were a mistake but
[they were an obvious and avoidable mistake]{.underline}---even though
they themselves did not see it at the time. That is one of the problems:
[many mistakes are not obvious until they are made]{.underline}.
[So]{.underline}, [too]{.underline}, [the distinction between supposedly
"necessary" and "unnecessary" wars]{.underline}. [Prior to December
1941]{.underline} and Germany's declaration of war on the United States,
many American experts and [the great majority of the American people did
not think it was necessary to go to war in Europe to defeat
Hitler]{.underline}. As for wars on the periphery, the world is not a
collection of distinct regions neatly walled off from one another. We
may call one region "Europe," one "Asia," and one "the Middle East," and
we may say we will intervene in one but not the other. This is an
artificial construct, however. Regions abut one another and bleed into
one another; their histories, cultures, and religions as well as their
economies are tightly entangled. Great powers have been intervening in
the Middle East and Persian Gulf for centuries, before there was oil and
before there was a Suez Canal. [To extricate ourselves from the Middle
East would mean extricating ourselves from the world connected to and
through the whole region]{.underline}. Even that might not keep us from
having to intervene. In recent decades we have learned, tragically, that
what happens in the Middle East does not stay in the Middle East.
Americans would love never to have to think about the Middle East again,
but no administration has succeeded in extricating the United States
from it---not even Obama. Meanwhile, [the more we rely on proxies like
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel to determine the course of events in the
Middle East, the less it will be a course we would choose]{.underline}.
[Even if they could manage the task without us]{.underline}, which seems
unlikely, it will be their interests they will be protecting, not ours,
and not those of the liberal order. For the United States, it is not a
question of all in or all out. We cannot intervene everywhere, and we
haven't ever come close to doing so. In the Middle East and elsewhere,
we will still be required to make decisions: when to intervene, how to
intervene, how much to commit, and how long to stay, and the answers
will not be obvious and the outcomes will not be certain or even
predictable. Nor will our interventions "solve" the problem; or they
will solve one problem and create others. [Those who insist on outcomes
that pose no further dangers and require no further involvement are
asking the impossible]{.underline}. Our intervention in World War II
defeated Hitler but led to Soviet communist control of half of Europe
and four decades of Cold War. That is the messy reality. President Obama
said he didn't like the idea of just putting a lid on problems like
Syria. But the most masterful foreign policies in history, whether those
of a Bismarck or a Disraeli, have always been about containing rather
than solving problems. America's entire grand strategy since World War
II has been about putting lids on problems, in Europe, in Asia, and
elsewhere. Whether that is good or bad depends on what's under the lid
and whether it is better to keep things under it than to let them out.
T[he American people would like a foreign policy that avoids mistakes
and disasters]{.underline}, and who can blame them? [But that is a bit
like wanting to throw touchdowns but not interception]{.underline}s, to
make only good investment decisions, [or to win all your
cases.]{.underline} The price of failures in [foreign
policy]{.underline} is measured in human lives and national treasure,
and therefore the greatest care must be taken to get it right, but it
[nevertheless remains a human activity and therefore
subject]{.underline} both to our foibles and [the failure of our
best-intentioned efforts to predict the future]{.underline}. People
don't stop what they're doing after a mistake is made; they try to do a
better job next time. [We can't quit having a foreign policy, even if
our geography, our wealth, and our power sorely tempt us to
try.]{.underline} There are, moreover, two kinds of errors: errors of
commission and errors of omission. After World War I, Americans were
more focused on the former; after World War II, they worried more about
the latter. Today we are fixated almost entirely on errors of
commission. A couple of years ago, Robert Merry, the editor of The
American Conservative, made a list of "America's Five Biggest Foreign
Policy Fiascoes." At the top of the list was Iraq, followed by America's
entry into World War I, the Vietnam War, the intervention in Somalia,
and the Bay of Pigs "invasion." These were all acts of commission. But
[what about the "fiascoes" that resulted from our failure to act? What
about our failure to destroy al Qaeda]{.underline} bases in Afghanistan
[before three thousand people were killed in the Twin
Towers]{.underline} and the Pentagon; [or the failure either to
deter]{.underline} or to prepare adequately for [a Japanese attack on
the Philippines, which led]{.underline} in early 1942 [to the death of
ten thousand American and Filipino soldiers]{.underline} in three months
of fighting followed by the deaths of thousands more in the infamous
Bataan Death March? Was that not a far worse error than the tragedy
which led to eighteen American dead in Mogadishu[? What about the price
the liberal world order, and particularly America's key allies in
Europe, have paid for our failure to contain the crisis in
Syria?]{.underline} Were not these errors of omission more costly than
our errors of commission in Somalia? [At the root of such thinking is
the belief that]{.underline} there is an escape from power or that [it
is possible to wield power without error and without
failure]{.underline}. Americans, blessed by their favorable geography
and wealth, still believe they have a choice between engaging the world
and letting the world fend for itself. There has been no shortage of
realists, idealists, progressives, and conservatives telling them that
substantially disengaging from our alliances and overseas commitments is
possible and cost-free. But [the real choice we face is not between the
good and the bad but between the bad and the worse.]{.underline} It is
between maintaining the liberal world order, with all the moral and
material costs that entails, or letting it collapse and courting the
catastrophes that must inevitably follow. [What is likely to follow is a
return to the multipolar power struggles]{.underline} [that brought so
much devastation]{.underline} to the world before the United States
redirected the course of history. That is where the deep ruts lead, back
to the state of the world prior to 1945. [Only this time, the powers
competing and clashing will be armed with nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
It is ironic that some of those who spent the Cold War warning that
America's hawkish foreign policies would result in nuclear holocaust do
not seem to fear nuclear war in the competitive multipolar world that
may be our future. [We have yet to test the question of whether nations
with nuclear weapons can go to war, because so far the United States and
the liberal world order have prevented such wars.]{.underline} But if
history is any guide, to count on the horror of new weaponry alone to
maintain the peace is a most risky bet. Had you cast that bet before the
two world wars, you would have lost. These days some experts tell us it
was the existence of nuclear weapons that prevented the United States
and the Soviet Union from coming to blows, but few at the time had any
confidence that nuclear weapons were a guarantor of peace. Throughout
much of the Cold War there were those who simply assumed that the world
was heading inevitably toward Armageddon. They were wrong that it would
come as a result of American Cold War policies, but in the long run they
may still prove right. --- These are the quandaries we cannot avoid no
matter how hard we try. Reinhold Niebuhr believed that what he called
"the world problem" could not be solved if America did not "accept its
full share of responsibility in solving it."187 To support a "world
community beyond our own borders" he went on, both was virtuous and
reflected a "prudent understanding of our own interests." But he also
predicted that Americans would be "the poorer for the global
responsibilities which we bear." And poorer not just in a material sense
but also in a moral sense. It was impossible "to build a community
without the manipulation of power," and it was impossible "to use power
and remain completely 'pure.' "188 As Hans Morgenthau put it, "Whoever
wants to retain his moral innocence must forsake action altogether."
Niebuhr did not want Americans to have an "easy conscience" about the
things they were going to have to do, for there was always the danger
that they would enjoy power too much and would use it to dominate others
rather than to address the "world problem." But he also did not want
their "uneasy conscience" to "tempt us into irresponsibility."189
Americans, it is fair to say, have not enjoyed power too much. These
days, they would prefer to wield it less. Yet the struggle for power in
the international system is eternal, and so is the struggle over beliefs
and ideals. If it is not our system of security and our beliefs shaping
the world order, it will be someone else's. If we do not preserve the
liberal order, it will be replaced by another kind of order, or more
likely by disorder and chaos of the kind we saw in the twentieth
century. That is what the world "as it is" looks like. That is what
history and human nature have led to in the past and will lead to in the
future if not continually shaped, managed, and resisted

[China is definitely on the rise]{.underline}. [But don't write off
American dominance just yet]{.underline}. Even if the trade wars between
the United States and China that dominated the Trump era have receded
slightly, many other issues have intensified. [China tested a hypersonic
and potentially globe-spanning weapon this summer.]{.underline} It
conducted dozens of sorties by combat aircraft that touched on Taiwan's
Air Defense Identification zone and otherwise menaced the island of 23
million (plus much of the world's semiconductor production capacity)
that it claims as its own. The Pentagon's artificial intelligence guru,
Nicolas Chaillan, recently resigned with a warning that the United
States is losing the AI race to China. Intelligence and military
officials warn that China may be expanding its nuclear arsenal by up to
several hundred warheads. And commanders of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in
Hawaii have estimated that China might well attempt to take Taiwan
within a half-dozen years or so, given its military modernization
trends. [We should not overreact to these troubling trends. They are
serious. They are, however, far from truly foreboding. China is flexing
its muscles more than preparing for war; this is not the equivalent of
Europe in the late 1930s, given how much China depends on a stable
international order for its continued success. We do need to stay
vigilant, remember the art of war even in this age of (relative) peace,
and expand our economic as well as military toolkit for crisis
management.]{.underline} We need not and must not panic, however,
because doing so could turn manageable crises into truly scary ones.
First, let's remember [America's many strengths. Our military budget is
about three times' China's, and our allies in Europe and East Asia
together outspend China themselves]{.underline} (even if not all would
fight in a war in the Pacific, admittedly). [The loose coalition of
European nations and the U.S. also represents the consumer market of
more than a billion comparatively wealthy individuals whom China needs
in order to sustain its still-export-driven economy.]{.underline} That
means [we have many tools of economic, as well as military, warfare if
needed]{.underline}. Since 1945, seven Democratic and seven Republican
U.S. presidents have collectively upheld a rules-based international
order that has established a very strong norm against interstate
aggression, making any Chinese attack on Taiwan hugely problematic for
President Xi Jinping and his fellow leaders in Beijing. The [world's
response to an actual attack against Taiwan --- and this is the scenario
that is truly the most worrisome for its potential to shake world peace
--- would likely be rather unified and strong.]{.underline} China knows
it. For this reason, I believe that U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and other
parts of the government need to be careful and restrained with their
rhetoric (as most but not all are). China may have growing capacity to
attempt to seize Taiwan, [but it knows that actually making the attempt
would be a cosmic roll of the dice, to be attempted only under the most
extreme of circumstances.]{.underline} Beyond these broad advantages are
a number of specific factors working in our favor to direct China's rise
in a generally peaceful direction: Even if our AI efforts, at the
Pentagon and elsewhere, could be better focused, we enjoy numerous
advantages in high technology vis-à-vis China, including in stealth,
submarine technology, and long-range strike platforms like aircraft
carriers. [Even if China's military is bigger than ours in some ways ---
total troop count, total ship count --- ours is much better]{.underline}
(and battle-hardened). Also, [just to take one frequently misused
statistic, if China's navy has more ships than ours, we have a fleet
with larger vessels, meaning the U.S. Navy wields twice the total ship
tonnage, based on calculations my colleagues and I have
done.]{.underline} Every time China fortifies another artificial island,
should it continue down that path, we can respond. We can add bases in
the Indo-Pacific region ourselves, or tighten various security
partnerships, as with India. We should do this with restraint, and
proportionality, to be sure --- but the bottom line is that the United
States has lots of allies and China does not. We also have a globally
capable military that can, for example, continue to uphold our access to
the South China Sea even when Beijing wrongly and dangerously claims it
as territorial waters. [If China does attack Taiwan, with the goal of
reunification, I believe it is far more likely to attempt a blockade
(combined with cyberattacks) than an outright invasion]{.underline}.
Moving big ships near the coasts of a vigilant adversary is very hard to
do in the era of precision-strike weaponry and advanced mines. [In a
blockade scenario, we have other options besides fighting right next to
Taiwan --- we can, for example, use economic warfare backed up by our
military to interfere with China's access to oil and other commodities
coming from the Persian Gulf and Africa.]{.underline} To be sure, the
United States needs to stay vigilant --- and to keep getting "stronger"
ourselves, as Brookings Institution scholar Ryan Hass argues in a new
book of that very title. [Our military command and control must be more
resilient in order to makes sure our "kill chain" is robust. Our armed
forces need more long-range strike platforms, including more bombers and
long-range unmanned systems operating off aircraft carriers and attack
submarines, given China's ability to threaten nearby U.S.
bases.]{.underline} Nations need to diversify and harden their
economies, and the global supply chains that undergird them, so that
China does not have the upper hand in any future economic warfare
scenarios. Managing China's rise is going to be a challenge for America
and her allies for a generation. But if we stay calm in crises, and make
ourselves stronger and more resilient militarily and economically, [we
should have the tools needed to sustain the peace.]{.underline}
