#### Emerging tech cooperation is an expression of the death drive -- that causes projection of our fears onto the human and non-human world to justify their annihilation 

**Dodds 12** \[Joseph, MPhil, Psychoanalytic Studies, Sheffield
University, UK, MA, Psychoanalytic Studies, Sheffield University, UK
BSc, Psychology and Neuroscience, Manchester University, UK, Chartered
Psychologist (CPsychol) of the British Psychological Society (BPS), and
a member of several other professional organizations such as the
International Neuropsychoanalysis Society, Psychoanalysis and Ecology at
the Edge of Chaos, p. 70\]

Here there are echoes of Freud\'s (1916) idea of \'anticipatory
mourning\' and the associated attacks and spoiling that we will study
below (see p. 72). However, for Searles the natural world is not just a
space for externalizing our conflicts. Rather[, a healthy relationship
to the non-human environment is essential for human psychological
well-being.]{.underline} Furthermore, [[one consequence of]{.mark} our
[**alienation from nature** is]{.mark} an omnipotent **[longing for
fusion with]{.mark} our [technology]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and a
powerful anxiety should this fully occur.

Over recent decades [we have come from dwelling in an outer world in
which]{.underline} the living [works of nature either predominated or
were near at hand, to **dwelling in an environment dominated by a
technology**]{.underline} which is **[wondrously powerful and yet
nonetheless dead]{.underline}** \... \[T\]his [technology-dominated
world \[is\] so alien, so complex, so awesome, and so overwhelming that
we have been able to cope with it only by regressing, in our unconscious
experience \... to a degraded state of nondifferentiation from
it]{.underline} \... \[T\]his \'outer\' reality is psychologically as
much a part of us as its poisonous waste products are part of our
physical selves. (Searles 1972: 368)

[[The further we are alienated]{.mark} from nature, [the more we]{.mark}
are [drive]{.mark}n [into]{.mark} primitive regressive identification
and omnipotent [fascination with]{.mark} our [tech]{.mark}nology, a
**powerful positive feedback loop.**]{.underline} [The]{.underline}
inner [conflict between our human and non-human selves, and our animal
and technological natures, is projected onto the
environment]{.underline}, further [rupturing the relationship and
[leading to]{.mark} a **spiral of
[destructiveness]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as we \'project this conflict
upon, and thus unconsciously foster, the war in external reality between
the beleaguered remnants of ecologically balanced nature and
\*(hu)man\'s technology]{.underline} which is ravaging them\' (ibid.).

Here we are in Klein\'s paranoid-schizoid world, with a primitive ego
unable to differentiate between good and bad mother. While ecologists
portray a good eco-mummy doing battle with bad techno-mummy, things are
not so simple. As we have seen, [civilization (and its
[tech]{.mark}nology) is a defence, a \'good mother\' to **[protect us
from]{.mark} capricious and uncaring mother
[nature]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Freud 1930), but, as Searles suggests,
[we are supposed to accept that \'our good mother is poisoning
us\']{.underline} (Searles 1972: 369).

For Searles (1972), [**[behind]{.mark} both nuclear danger and
ecological [catastrophe]{.mark}** [lies]{.mark} the raw destructiveness
Kleinians link to Thanatos, or]{.underline} what Erich Fromm (1992)
understands in terms of **[[necrophilia]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Searles
(1972: 370) argues that at this level of functioning **[[we project
\'our]{.mark} own pervasive, poorly differentiated and poorly integrated
[murderousness]{.mark}]{.underline}**, bora of our terror and
deprivation and frustration, **[[upon the hydrogen bomb, the
m]{.mark}ilitary-[i]{.mark}ndustrial [c]{.mark}omplex,
[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**.\' [We may find the slow, more
controllable death from pollution preferable to \'sudden death from
nuclear warfare\' or we might yearn for the quick relief of a nuclear
blast to the \'slow strangulation\' of environmental
devastation]{.underline} (Searles 1972: 370). **[[Living with]{.mark}
such [apocalyptic threats leads]{.mark} to a kind of ultimate version of
the defence]{.underline}** Anna Freud (1936) described as
[**[identification with the aggressor]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

At an unconscious level [[we]{.mark} powerfully [identify with]{.mark}
what we perceive as omnipotent and immortal [tech]{.mark}nology, [as
a]{.mark} defense against intolerable feelings of]{.underline}
insignificance, of [deprivation]{.underline}, of [guilt]{.underline}, of
**[[fear of death]{.underline}]{.mark}** \... **[Since the constructive
goal of [saving the world can be achieved only by one\'s
working]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as but one largely anonymous individual
among uncounted millions \... **[[it is]{.mark} more [alluring to give
oneself]{.mark} over [to]{.mark} secret [fantasies of]{.mark} omnipotent
[destructiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [in **identification with the
forces that threaten to destroy the world**. **[This]{.mark} serves to
[shield one from]{.mark} the recognition of one\'s own guilt-laden
[murderous urges]{.mark},**]{.underline} experienced as being within
oneself, to destroy one\'s own intrapersonal and interpersonal
world.(Searles 1972: 370)

In this view, [we are seeing a kind of repetition on a planetary level
of an early intrapsychic anxiety situation.]{.underline} In childhood
\'a fantasied omnipotence protected us against the fUll intensity of our
feelings of deprivation, and now **[it is dangerously easy to identify
with seemingly limitless technology and to fail to cope with the
life-threatening scarcity]{.underline}** of usable air, food, and water
on our planet\' (ibid.). [Unfortunately our technological powers have
outstripped our emotional maturity, and the omnipotent phantasies of
infancy now have a frightening objectivity]{.underline}. In place of a
religion we no longer believe in, or hopes for future generations we no
longer have meaningful contact with, [we identify with our immortal,
inanimate technology.]{.underline}

In this realm of omnipotent fantasy \... mother earth is equivalent to
all of reality \... a drag \... to our yearnings for unfettered
omnipotence \... [It may be not at all coincidental that our world today
is threatened with extinction through environmental pollution, to which
we are so strikingly apathetic, just when we seem on the threshold of
technologically breaking the chains that have always bound our race to
this planet of our origin.]{.underline} I suspect that we collectively
quake lest our infantile omnipotent fantasies become fully actualized
through man\'s becoming interplanetary and ceasing thereby to be man
\... \[W\]e are powerfully drawn to suicidally polluting our planet so
as to ensure our dying upon it as men, rather than existing elsewhere as
\... gods or robots \... **[[\[T\]he greatest danger lies neither in
the]{.mark} hydrogen [bomb \... nor in]{.mark} the more slowly lethal
effect of [pollution \... \[but\] in the]{.mark} fact that the
[world]{.mark} is in such a state as [to evoke our]{.mark} very earliest
[anxieties]{.mark} and at the same time to offer the [delusional
\'promise\']{.mark}]{.underline}** [[\... of assuaging these]{.mark}
anxieties]{.underline}, effacing them, [[by]{.mark} fully
[externalizing]{.mark} and reifying [our]{.mark} most primitive
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} [\...]{.mark} **[In the pull upon us to
become omnipotently free of human conflict, [we]{.mark} are in danger of
[bring]{.mark}ing [about]{.mark} our
[extinction]{.mark}.]{.underline}**(Searles 1972: 371-372).

#### Their life-affirmation culminates in fundamentalist violence -- only the death drive makes life worth living

**McGowan 13** \[Todd, Associate Professor of Film and Television
Studies at the University of Vermont, *Enjoying What We Don't Have: The
Political Project of Psychoanalysis*, Symploke, University of Nebraska
Press (Lincoln, NE): 2013, p. 224-7\]

On the level of common sense, this opposition is not symmetrical.
[[What]{.mark} thinking [person would not want to side with]{.mark}
those who love [life]{.mark} rather than death. 3 [Everyone can]{.mark}
readily [understand how one might love life, but the love of death
is]{.mark} a [counterintuitive]{.mark} phenomenon]{.underline}. It seems
as if it must be code language for some other desire, which is how
Western leftists often view it. Interpreting terrorist attacks as an
ultimately life-affirming response to imperialism and impoverishment,
they implicitly reject the possibility of being in love with death.
[[But]{.mark}]{.underline} this type of interpretation can\'t explain
why so many suicide bombers are middle-class, educated subjects and not
the most downtrodden victims of imperialist power.4 We must imagine that
for subjects such as these [[there is an appeal in death itself.]{.mark}
Those who emphasize the importance of death at the expense of life do so
because death is the source of value. 5 [The fact that life has an end,
that we do not have]{.mark} an [infinite]{.mark} amount of [time
to]{.mark} [experience every possibility, means that we must value some
things above others. **Death creates hierarchies of value**, and these
hierarchies are not only vehicles for]{.mark} [oppression but the
pathways through which what we do matters at all. **Without the value
that death provides, neither love nor ice cream**]{.mark} **nor
friendship [nor]{.mark} [anything]{.mark} that [we enjoy would have
any]{.mark} special [worth whatsoever]{.mark}**[. Having]{.mark} an
[infinite]{.mark} amount of [time, we would have no incentive to opt for
these]{.mark} experiences rather than other ones. **[We would be left
unable to enjoy]{.mark}** what seems to make life most worth living.
Even though [enjoyment]{.mark} itself is an experience of the infinite,
an experience of transcending the limits that regulate everyday
activity, it nonetheless [depends on the limits of finitude. When one
enjoys, one accesses the infinite as a finite]{.mark} [subject, and it
is this]{.mark} contrast [that renders enjoyment enjoyable]{.mark}.
Without the limits of finitude, our experience of the infinite would
become as tedious as our everyday lives]{.underline} (and in fact would
become our everyday experience). Finitude provides the punctuation
through which the infinite emerges as such. The struggle to assert the
importance of death- [the act of being in love with death]{.underline},
as [bin Laden claims that the Muslim youths are - is a mode of avowing
one\'s allegiance to the infinite enjoyment that death doesn\'t
extinguish but instead spawns]{.underline}.• This is exactly why Martin
Heidegger attacks what he sees as our modem inauthentic relationship to
death. In Being and Time Heidegger sees our individual death as an
absolute limit that has the effect of creating value for us. As he puts
it, \"With death, Dasein stands before itself in its own most
potentiality-for-being. This is a possibility in which the issue is
nothing less than Dasein\'s Being·in·the-world.\"\" [Without the
anticipation of our own death, we flit through the world and fail to
take up fully an attitude of care, the attitude most appropriate for our
mode of being]{.underline}, according to Heidegger. [Nothing really
matters to those who have not recognized the approach of their own
death. **[By depriving us of an authentic relationship to death, an
ideology that proclaims life as the only value]{.mark} [creates a
valueless world where nothing matters]{.mark} to us.** But of course the
partisans of life are not actually eliminating death
itself.]{.underline} They simply privilege life over death and see the
world in terms of life rather than death, which would seem to leave the
value-creating power of death intact. But this is not what happens. [By
privileging life and seeing death only in terms of life, we change the
way we experience the world. Without the mediation that death provides,
the system of pure life becomes a system utterly bereft of
value]{.underline}.• We can see this in the two great systems of
modernity- science and capitalism. Both modern science and capitalism
are systems structured around pure life.• Neither recognizes any
ontological limit but instead continually embarks on a project of
constant change and expansion. The scientific quest for knowledge about
the world moves forward without regard for humanitarian or ethical
concerns, which is why ethicists incessantly try to reconcile scientific
discoveries with morality after the fact. After scientists develop the
ability to clone, for instance, we realize what cloning portends for our
sense of identity and attempt to police the practice. After Oppenheimer
helps to develop the atomic bomb, he addresses the world with
pronouncements of its evil. But this rearguard action has nothing to do
with science as such. Oppenheimer the humanist is not Oppenheimer the
scientist.10 The same dynamic is visible with capitalism. As an economic
system, it promotes constant evolution and change just as life itself
does. Nothing can remain the same within the capitalist world because
the production of value depends on the creation of the new commodity,
and even the old commodities must be constantly given new forms or
renewed in some way.11 Capitalism produces crises not because it can\'t
produce enough- crises of scarcity dominate the history of the
noncapitalist world, not the capitalist one - but because it produces
too much. The crisis of capitalism is always a crisis of overproduction.
The capitalist economy suffocates from too much life, from excess, not
from scarcity or death. Both science and capitalism move forward without
any acknowledged limit, which is why they are synonymous with
modernity.\" [Modernity emerges with the bracketing of death\'s finitude
and the belief that there is no barrier to human possibility.\" **The
problem with [the exclusive focus on life at the expense of death is
that it never finds enough life and thus remains]{.mark} perpetually
[dissatisfied]{.mark}.** The limit of this project is, paradoxically,
its own infinitude]{.underline}. It evokes what Hegel calls the bad
infinite - an infinite that is wrongly conceived as having no relation
at all to the finite. [We succumb to the bad infinite when we pursue an
unattainable object and fail to see that the only possible satisfaction
rests in the pursuit itself. The bad infinite - the infinite of
modernity- depends on a fundamental misrecognition. We continue on this
path only as long as we believe that we might attain the final piece of
the puzzle, and yet this piece is constitutively denied us by the
structure of the system itself.]{.underline} We seek the commodity that
would finally bring us complete satisfaction, but [**[dissatisfaction is
built into the commodity structure]{.mark}**,]{.underline} just as
obsolescence is built into the very fabric of our cars and computers.
Like capitalism, scientific inquiry cannot find a final answer: beneath
atomic theory we find string theory, and beneath string theory we find
something else. In both cases, the system prevents us from recognizing
where our satisfaction lies; it diverts our focus away from our activity
and onto the goal that we pursue. In this way, modernity produces the
dissatisfaction that keeps it going. But [it also produces another form
of dissatisfaction that wants to arrest its forward movement. [The
further]{.mark} the project of [modernity moves in the]{.mark}
[direction of life, the more forcefully]{.mark} the specter of
[fundamentalism will make its presence felt. **The exclusive focus on
life has the effect of producing eruptions of death**]{.mark}**.** As
the life-affirming logic of science and capitalism structures all
societies to an increasing extent, [the space for the creation of value
disappears. Modernity attempts]{.mark} [to construct a]{.mark} symbolic
[space where there is **no place for death**]{.mark} and the limit that
death represents. As opposed to the closed world of traditional society,
modernity opens up an infinite universe.14 But this infinite universe is
established through the repression of finitude. Explosions of
[fundamentalist violence represent the return of what modernity\'s
symbolic]{.mark} [structure cannot accommodate]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
Lacan puts it in his seminar on psychosis, \"Whatever is refused in the
symbolic order, in the sense of Verwerfung, reappears in the real.\" 15
[Fundamentalist [violence is]{.mark} [blowback not simply in response to
imperialist aggression, as the leftist common sense would have]{.mark}
it. This **[violence marks the return of what modernity necessarily
forecloses]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### We don't need an alternative besides our framework of analysis -- the fantasy will reveal itself as long as we continue asking questions to expose their concealment of the lack -- in other words, it's your job to confuse and frustrate them via a refusal to partake in their politics

**Dean 6** \[Jodi, Professor of Political Science at Hobart and William
Smith Colleges, *Zizek's Politics,* Taylor & Francis: London and New
York, 2006, p. xvii-xx\]

By inserting popular culture into his writing, and himself into popular
culture, [Zizek enacts the way enjoyment colors or stains all thinking
and acting]{.underline}. What this means, as I set out in detail in
Chapter Three, is that [[there is a deep **nonrational** and **libidinal
nugget** in]{.mark} even [the **most rational**,]{.mark} **formal**
**[ways of thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Again, it is not simply that
popular culture is at the core of the theoretical enterprise of his
books---it is that enjoyment is. [Enjoyment is an unavoidable component
of any philosophical effor]{.underline}t (though many try to deny it).
Zizek thus emphasizes the inevitable stain on philosophy, on thought, as
[he tries to demonstrate a way of thinking that breaks with]{.underline}
(Zizek often uses Lacan\'s term traverses) [the fantasy of \"pure
reason.\"]{.underline}

This leads to another key element of Zizek\'s thought: [the possibility
of taking the position of the excess]{.underline}. As I explain in
discussions of his readings of St. Paul and Lenin, [Zizek theorizes
revolutionary politics as occurring through the occupation of this
excessive place]{.underline}. Paul endeavors to put the Christian
message to work, to establish new collectives beyond old oppositions
between Greeks and Jews. Lenin also breaks with the given, arguing
against all around him and against Marxist orthodoxy that the time for
revolution is now, that it cannot be predicted, awaited, but must be
accomplished with no assurances of success. Like Paul, he puts truth to
work, organizing it in the form of a revolutionary political Party.

Zizek emphasizes that [Lacan conceptualized this excessive place, this
place without guarantees, in his formula for \"the discourse of the
analyst]{.underline}\" (which I set out in Chapter Two[[). In
psycho-analysis, **the analyst just sits there, asking questions**
]{.mark}**from time to time**]{.underline}. [[She is some kind of object
or cipher onto which the analysand transfers love, desire, aggression,
and knowledge.]{.mark} The analysand]{.underline}, in other words,
proceeds through analysis by positing the analyst as someone who knows
exactly what is wrong with him and exactly what he should do to get rid
of his symptom and get better. [But, really, the analyst does not
know]{.underline}. Moreover, [[the analyst]{.mark} steadfastly
**[refuses to provide the analysand with any answers]{.mark}
whatsoever**]{.underline}. [[No ideals, no moral certainty, no goals, no
choices. Nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This is what makes the analyst
so traumatic]{.underline}]{.mark}, Zizek explains[, **[the fact that she
refuses to establish a law or set a limit]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[[that she does not function as some]{.mark} kind of [new
maste]{.mark}]{.underline}**[r]{.mark}.7 [Analysis is over when the
analysand accepts that the analyst does not know]{.underline}, [that
there is not any secret meaning or explanation]{.underline}, [and then
takes responsibility for getting on with his life]{.underline}. [The
challenge for the analysand]{.underline}, then, [is freedom,
autonomously determining]{.underline} his own [limits, directly
assuming]{.underline} his own [enjoyment]{.underline}. So, again, [the
position of the analyst is in this excessive place as an object through
which the analysand works through the analytical process]{.underline}.

[Why is the analyst necessary in the first place]{.underline}? If she is
not going to tell the analysand what to do, how he should be living,
then why does he not save his money, skip the whole process, and figure
out things for himself? There are two basic answers. First, [[the
analysand is not self-transparent]{.underline}. [He is a stranger to
himse]{.underline}]{.mark}[lf, a decentered agent \"struggling with a
foreign kernel]{.underline}.\"8 [[What is more likely than
self-understanding, is self-misunderstanding]{.underline}]{.mark}, that
is, [one\'s fundamental misperception of one\'s own
condition]{.underline}. **[[Becoming aware of this
misperception]{.mark}, grappling with it, [is the work of
analysis.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [Accordingly]{.mark}, second, **[[the
analyst is that external agent or position that gives a new form to our
activity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Saying]{.mark} [things]{.mark} out
loud, [presenting them to another]{.mark}, and [confronting them in
front of this external position concretizes]{.mark} and arranges [our
thoughts and activities in a different way,]{.mark} a way that is more
difficult to escape or avoid]{.underline}**. [The analyst then provides
a form through which we acquire a perspective on and a relation to our
selves]{.underline}.

Paul\'s Christian collectives and Lenin\'s revolutionary Party are, for
Zizek, similarly [formal arrangements]{.underline}, forms \"[for a new
type of knowledge linked to a collective political
subject]{.underline}.\"9 Each provides an external perspective on our
activities, [a way to concretize and organize our spontaneous
experiences]{.underline}. More strongly put, a political Party is
necessary precisely [**because [politics is not given; it does not
arise]{.mark} naturally or [organically]{.mark}** out of the
multiplicity of immanent flows and affects [**but has to be produced,
arranged, and constructed out of these flows in light of something
larger**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In my view, [when Zizek]{.underline} draws on popular culture and
[inserts himself into this culture, he is taking the position of an
object of enjoyment, an excessive object that cannot easily be
recuperated or assimilated. This **excessive position** is that of the
**analyst** as well as that of the **Party**]{.underline}. Reading Zizek
as occupying the position of the analyst tells us that [it is wrong
to]{.underline} expect Zizek to [tell us what to do, to provide an
ultimate solution or direction through which to solve all the world\'s
problems]{.underline}. [[The analyst]{.mark} does not provide the
analysand with ideals and goals]{.underline}; instead, [he [occupies the
place of an object in relation to which we work these out for
ourselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In adopting the position of the
analyst]{.underline}, [Zizek is also practicing what he refers to as
\"Bartleby politics,\" a politics [rooted in a kind of refusal wherein
the subject turns itself into a disruptive]{.mark}]{.underline} (of our
peace of mind!) [[violently passive object who says, \"I would prefer
not to.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}10 Thus, to my mind, [becoming preoccupied
with Zizek\'s style is like becoming preoccupied with what one\'s
analyst is wearing]{.underline}. [Why such a preoccupation]{.underline}?
How is this preoccupation enabling us to avoid confronting the truth of
our desire, our own investments in enjoyment? [How is complaining that
Zizek (or the analyst) will not tell us what to do a way that we avoid
trying to figure this out for ourselves]{.underline}?11

### 1NC\-\--Race/Identity

#### Their demand for racial recognition sustains the ability of whiteness to function as a master signifier that structures collective social desires \-\-- the alternative's psychoanalytic confrontation with the quixotic quest for racial wholeness enables the traversal of the racial fantasy that can best solve collective violence

**George 14** \[Sheldon, Associate Professor and Director of the
Graduate Program in English. Simmons College of Arts and Sciences, "From
alienation to cynicism: Race and the Lacanian unconscious,"
*Psychoanalysis, Culture & Society* 19.4, (Dec 2014): 360-378\]

Separation, Impaired by Race

Lacan described separation as the significant step through which the
subject of desire truly emerges. As is shown in Figure 2 - See PDF,
above, he schematized the alienating vel through the image of a letter
V, above which is placed an inverted V to represent the reverse process
of \"separation\" that completes the subject\'s loop of development into
full subjectivity and binds the subject to a desire that emerges in the
losange of the unconscious. In this separation, what the subject has to
\"free himself of is the aphanisic effect of the binary signifier\"
(1998b, p. 219). Rooting subjectivity in \"scepticism\" as what Lacan
called \"a mode of sustaining man in life\" (p. 224), [Lacanian theory
ties the reversal of alienation to a \"cynic\[ism\]\" by which the
subject **questions the desire of the Other who grants the
signifier**]{.underline} (p. 238). This [[cynicism]{.underline}]{.mark},
which Lacan [[tied to]{.mark} the establishment of [a]{.mark} more
[personal relation to one\'s own desire, constitutes]{.mark} what I
would call [an ethical stance]{.mark} for the subject of
race,]{.underline} [one in which this subject comes [to]{.mark}
interrogate and **[reject]{.mark} the [racial signifiers that mandate
the subject\'s relation to]{.mark} being and [the
Other]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

For Lacan, [[the]{.mark} significant living [Other within the
Symbolic]{.mark} is both the Other, who personifies the site of
jouissance that is the illusory Real of wholeness, and the paternal
authority, who represents the Symbolic and its law of desire but also
facilitates alienation by granting access to the signifiers that define
identity for the subject.]{.underline} Not accounting particularly for
race as a complicating factor in this process of separation, Lacanian
theory nonetheless shows that in separation [the subject must first move
toward recognition of the desire/lack both of the subject and of the
Other, who [functions as a fantasy source of bliss.]{.mark} The goal
here is to shift from a stultifying obsession with being and bliss
toward an embrace of the signifier and fantasy]{.underline}. Lacan
explained, \"\[I\]t is in so far as his desire is beyond or falls short
of what she says, of what she hints at, of what she brings out in
meaning, it is in so far as his desire is unknown, it is in this point
of lack \[recognizable in the desiring Other\'s meanings\], that the
desire of the subject is constituted\" (p. 218-219). [By filling the
gaps left in the Other\'s discourse with his own meanings and fantasies,
the subject thus constitutes in the losange of his unconscious a desire
that institutes separation from the Other.]{.underline}

[What emerges in this separation produced by desire and fantasy is the
desiring subject whose completion of the loop from alienation to
separation Lacan presented]{.underline} in his formula for fantasy,
\$\*a , read as the barred subject in relation to the fantasy object.
But it [is precisely a relation to this fantasy object that complicates
matters for the subject of race]{.underline}. [Because in the racist
American Symbolic the goal of the signifier is to aggrandize the lost
bliss of the Real, the Symbolic functions actively to impair the raced
subject\'s separation from this Real while also fortifying this
subject\'s alienation by the signifier.]{.underline} Lacanian scholar
Kalpana Seshadri-Crooks has shown that [[the Symbolic is structured
around the racial signifier whiteness, which functions as a \"master
signifier\" by establishing a \"structure of relations,]{.mark} a
signifying chain that [through a]{.mark}]{.underline} [[process of
inclusions and exclusions]{.mark} constitutes a pattern for organizing
human difference\"]{.underline} (2008, p. 4). Though **[[securing
for]{.mark} only [whites the hierarchal fantasy of their]{.mark}
\"sovereign [humanness,\" whiteness presents itself as the ideal to
which all subjects aspire]{.mark}]{.underline}** (p. 55). Despite the
subject\'s alienation from not only the part of the self constituted as
the non-meaning of the unconscious but also the impossible Real, [what
**[this master signifier \"promises the subject]{.mark} is precisely
[access to being\"]{.mark} (p. 45), thus directing the racial subject
toward the very Real from which this subject must
separate.**]{.underline}

[It is [this **obsessive pursuit of the Real**]{.mark}, thus
**encouraged by race, that [can lead to the violence]{.mark} and
frustration [of racism]{.mark}**. This frustration arises because
whiteness can never reconstitute being]{.underline}. In truth,
[whiteness functions only as the object a that merely promises wholeness
by]{.underline} [simultaneously masquerading as the phallus, the
castrated object that manifests the illusory site of bliss in the
Imaginary form of the subjective-se]{.underline}lf. [Distinguishing the
phallus from \"the organ\"]{.underline} (2006b, p. 579), [Lacan
associated the phallus with [Imaginary fantasies of lack]{.mark},
fantasies about \"exclusion\[s\] from the specular image]{.underline}\"
(p. 697). [It is such fantasies of bodily parts \"falling off\" from the
Imaginary self that define the aggressivity, or sense of psychic
fragmentation, that [may lead to]{.mark} the [aggression]{.mark} that
invades race relations.]{.underline} [**[Whiteness produces]{.mark} such
[aggressivity because it aims at an impossible ideal of completion that
no living subject - not even a white subject - can ever
embody]{.mark}**. Providing ideals both for the physical human form and
for its fragmented psychic structure that simply are unattainable,
**[the very term \"white\" marks its]{.mark} own discursive and fantasy
[function by defying the phenotypic reality of all
subjects.]{.mark}**]{.underline} With the subject of race remaining
incapable of maintaining in actuality the two central positions in
relation to being articulated by Lacanian theory, those of either
\"being\" or \"having\" the phallus, [the best this subject can do is
position himself as having the fantasy object a that functions as
referent to the phallus, the illusory remainder that when positioned
within the]{.underline} self [leaves even the white subject always one
step removed from the ideal he seeks to embody]{.underline} (p. 582).
[[There is]{.mark} thus [a fundamental]{.mark} frustration,
[insufficiency]{.mark} and aggressivity [awakened by]{.mark} this ideal
called forth by the illusion of
[whiteness]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[The problem with [contemporary]{.mark} theoretical and political
[approaches to]{.mark} the aggression and [racism]{.mark} that still
plague race relations today is that their frequent reliance upon the
concept of race [precludes engagement with]{.mark} this fundamental
aggressivity produced by [the concept itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[While recognizing the destructive power and persistence of the illusion
of race, [**the attempt made by numbers of African American scholars
is**]{.mark} not to destroy this illusion; instead, it **is [to give the
illusion new mythical meaning by adopting a process of
resignification]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is made intelligible by
Derridean poststructuralist theory. Tying agency to resignification of
existing signifiers, Jacques Derrida, the father of poststructuralism,
described the need to ground what we may call [a critical stance toward
the Other]{.underline} in a process modeled by the \"bricoleur\"
(Derrida, 1978, p. 285). As skeptical critic, the bricoleur recognizes
\"the necessity of borrowing one\'s concepts from the text of a heritage
which is more or less coherent or ruined\" (p. 285). His task is to
embrace the \"received historical discourse\" while altering its meaning
by putting it to a use for which it \"had not been especially
conceived\" (p. 285). It is this approach of the bricoleur that African
Americans have often embraced in accepting the terms of race posited by
the racist Symbolic.

[This approach is driven by the need to reinforce a sense of being that
was visibly challenged by slavery and continues to be challenged by
racism]{.underline}. In Lacanian terms, [the goal here is to alter the
fantasy relation to being]{.underline}. [This alteration is addressed
most directly at the object a that structures fantasies of race. Where
it is the a that stands as the internal object common to members of the
race - the fantasy essence within each African American]{.underline} -
rearticulation of African American identity is aimed at revaluing this
internal, fantasy self. This self is what is devalued in the racist
Symbolic as the object a of whiteness gains the discursive dominance
that facilitates its masquerade as phallus, as signifier of being and
jouissance. It is thus only through this glorification of the fantasy
object thought to link African Americans intersubjectively that the
subject rooted in this identity establishes a relation to being, thereby
alienating himself in the signifiers that also liberate him.

[This paradoxical path toward freedom through alienation creates what I
would identify as an ambivalent relation to race for African Americans,
whereby they challenge its racist implications by embracing the
distinctions of self and other it promotes]{.underline}. [But because
[the very function of race is to make the self and other knowable only
through fantasy]{.mark}]{.underline} - by which the racial other is not
only already defined, but is also often already defined as enemy --

what I propose is a traversal of the fantasy of race. This [[traversal
involves separation]{.underline}]{.mark} not only from the Real
represented by the mother, but also [[from the Symbolic that
redirects]{.underline} [the raced subject to this Real through
buttressing the fantasy a of race]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}
While racial identity can petrify the subject into the signifier of his
or her race, thus contributing to the aphanisis of the raced subject\'s
being, I argue that through a [cynical questioning of the mandates and
signifiers of the racial Symbolic]{.underline} the raced subject [may
attain an \"obstacle to his fading,\" one that involves this subject
coming to \"recognize\" his racial desire \"as desire of the Other,\" as
a desire shaped by a Symbolic structure that precedes and delimits the
raced subject\'s existence]{.underline} (1998b, p. 235).

The Drive and **[Traversal of the Racial Fantasy]{.underline}**

[[Most important]{.mark} in this traversal of race [is an essential
recognition of the lack]{.mark} in the signifiers of the Other, a
recognition that the signifier does not capture the subject\'s entire
being]{.underline}. Especially [**apparent in signifiers of race** -
like \"**black boy**\" -, there is always a **left over**, a **part of
the self that cannot emerge fully through the racial signifiers\'
subjective meanings**. It is this **very failure of the
signifier**]{.underline} that is highlighted in Figure 1 - See PDF,,
[wherein the circle of being designates an entire portion of the split
subject that exists in the Real and is only partially accessible through
the unconscious.]{.underline} The first implication of the fact that
being is elided by the signifier\'s meaning is that, as we have seen,
[[the subject is]{.mark} thus [petrified into a signifier and]{.mark}
simultaneously [alienated]{.mark}]{.underline} [from that part of the
[self]{.mark} that can be, but is not, signified by language, that part
situated in the unconscious, where **being and signification overlap to
create non-meaning**]{.underline}. But [more radical than this is the
implication that there is a part of the subject that is not available to
the operations of the signifier but yet may express itself through
desire]{.underline}, the part that comprises the rest of the circle of
being. As Lacan argued, [[desire is \"the metonymy of our
being,\"]{.mark} and the]{.underline} [\"channel in which desire is
located is not simply that of the modulation of the signifying
chain\"]{.underline} (1997, p. 321). [This [desire]{.mark}]{.underline},
I suggest, [[is what can facilitate an ethical
separation]{.underline}]{.mark} of the S1 and S2, [[creating critical
distance]{.mark} from the signifier [and opening up a space for the
subject to access]{.mark}]{.underline} [[better that of the self which
escapes the signifier]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[If we return to Fanon]{.underline}\'s Jean Veneuse, what [we see is
exactly a desire for abandonment that]{.underline} [escapes
signification and indeed grants structure to the signifiers that define
subjectivity, organizing them by their effort to repress this desire.
The escape of desire from the signifier is]{.underline} [possible
because the Lacanian subject is not merely the subject of the
signifier]{.underline}, who \"appears in the field of the Other,\" but
also \"the subject in the field of the drive,\" (1998b, p. 199), where
desire functions as that which is \"agitated in the drive\" (p. 243).
[[Characterized by a \"constant force]{.mark},\" a tension that is [at
odds with]{.mark} the [homeostasis]{.mark} and delayed gratification
[promised by the signifier]{.mark}]{.underline} (p. 164), [[the drive
is]{.mark} \"different from any stimulation coming from the outside
world\" because it is [an \"internal\" force]{.mark}]{.underline} (p.
164). [It emerges]{.underline} from the libido [as]{.underline} \"pure
life instinct,\" [\"[irrepressible]{.mark}\" and \"indestructible
life\"]{.underline} (p. 198). This libido, manifesting itself most
appropriately as that which \"the sexed being loses in sexuality\" (p.
197), is [connected to Freud\'s notion of the subject as initially
\"polymorphous, aberrant,\" able to attain pleasure from
all]{.underline} [sources, but as subsequently forced to localize
pleasure in the erogenous zones]{.underline} (p. 176). The signifier and
the mores of the Symbolic institute a homeostasis that restricts
\"sexuality,\" as a manifestation of the force of the libido, into
coming \"into play only in the form of partial drives\" (p. 176), so
that we \"deal only with that part of sexuality that passes\" into \"the
networks of the signifier\" (p. 177); but the force of this immortal
libido insistently marks its presence at the site of the \"gaps that the
distribution of the signifying investments sets up in the subject\" (p.
180). [We see this insistence]{.underline}, for example, in parapraxis,
[as something slips through the network of the signifier, something
emerging from the \"losage \*,\" from the unconscious as a gap that
Lacan places \"at the centre of any relation\" between \"reality and the
subject\"]{.underline} (p. 181). It is because [the force of what
emerges from the unconscious in this movement outward directs the
subject to the Other that the drive holds particular importance to an
understanding of race]{.underline}.

[What [race encourages]{.mark} through the Other is [substitution of
desire for the drive, as it petrifies the subject in a stagnant relation
to]{.mark} the [fantasy]{.mark} object. The movement of the [drive
involves a \"circular\" path]{.mark} out from the gaps of subjectivity
[toward the Other]{.mark} and back to the subject]{.underline} (1998b,
p. 178). In the place of the Other, [the [drive encounters]{.mark} and
closes in on \"[the]{.mark} petit a ,\" which is \"in fact simply the
presence of a hollow, a [void\" that]{.mark} \"can be occupied by any
object\" but that [functions as]{.mark} representative of [the \"lost
object]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (p. 180). [In the American Symbolic, I
contend, **[the object a of race]{.mark}**, acquired from the Other,
**[binds the racial subject to this circular path]{.mark} around a
hollow [that serves as the source of identity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Unlike]{.mark} the path of [desire, which involves a]{.mark} continual
metonymic [movement from object to object in search]{.mark} of a source
[of satisfaction]{.mark}, the [drive endlessly circles its illusive
object, \"attaining its satisfaction without attaining its
aim]{.mark}]{.underline}[\"]{.mark} (p. 179[). While failing to attain
the racial identity represented by the object a of race, [the subject of
race]{.mark} yet still [remains bound]{.mark} to the a [because]{.mark}
the a of [race becomes integral to the drive\'s function not just of
\"making oneself seen]{.mark} ,\" but more fundamentally of \"making
onesel]{.underline}f \" (p. 195). In encountering the object a defined
by the Other, the subject acquires in this object, in race, a \"little
mirror,\" an \"illusion\" of self, to which the subject may
\"accommodate his own image\" (p. 159[). We can say that in race the
subject \"assumes the role of the object,\" embracing the reversal
whereby it is the jouissance and demands of the Other that are
privileged]{.underline} (p. 185).

But this static objectification stifles the metonymy of desire. [The
fantasy object petrifying the self becomes the master signifier through
which a \"primal\" repression of being is achieved]{.underline}, and
[what is \"built on\" the signifier]{.underline}, as we saw with
Vaneuse, [is \"the symptom\" of the subject,]{.underline}
\"constituted\" as a \"scaffolding of signifiers\" (1998b, p. 176). It
is because of the satisfaction gained from the symptom, the jouissance
and sense of being granted by race as the soul or remnant of a lost
being, [that the drive need not reach its aim of hitting the mark set by
race as object a . This [satisfaction is sustained as]{.mark} the source
of a subjective self with \"nothing else\" ensuring its \"consistency
except the object, as [something that must be circumvented]{.mark},\"
something both [aimed at and missed]{.mark}]{.underline} (p. 181).
[Lacan tied the pleasure of the symptom upheld by the drive to a kind of
autoeroticism that he described in the image of \"a mouth sewn up\"
in]{.underline} [\"certain silences,\" closed \"upon its own
satisfaction\"]{.underline} (p. 179). **[[It is this closing up
upon]{.mark} a jouissance of [pain and pleasure]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[this insertion into the self of the Other\'s signifier, that
I]{.underline} [associate with race.]{.underline}

However, [Lacanian theory also shows that \"by snatching at its object,
the drive learns in a sense that this is precisely not the way it will
be satisf]{.underline}ied\" (1998b, p. 167). I suggest that the
[existing ambivalence about race of both African Americans and white
Americans makes possible increased recognition that race does not
produce the sovereign humanness]{.underline} [or supreme]{.underline}
satisfaction that binds subjects to race as a fantasy source of being.
Though the extent to which recent events in America mark a permanent
shift in relations to the signifiers of race is yet to be seen,
[[whiteness]{.mark} itself [and the]{.mark} very [value of race have
been]{.mark} cynically [questioned in the wake of]{.mark} publicized
incidents of \"white\"-on-\"black\" murders - like]{.underline} the
shootings of [[Trayvon Martin]{.mark}]{.underline} by George Zimmerman,
[and]{.underline} Jordan Davis by [Michael Dunn - and
[police]{.mark}-on- \"black\" [killings]{.mark},]{.underline} like the
death of [[Eric Garner]{.mark} in]{.underline} an illegal chokehold by
New York police who alleged he was unlawfully selling cigarettes. 5 In
light of active protests in Missouri after 18-year-old
[[Michael]{.underline} [Brown]{.underline}]{.mark} was shot by police in
the streets of Ferguson, some have even argued optimistically that we
are bearing witness to a \"new civil rights movement which has sprung
up\" (Ifill, 2014). Whether or not this movement comes to full fruition,
it is precisely a process of bearing witness that is key to its
development thus far. What I suggest has occurred in the immediate
aftermath of the killing of these black men is a shift in many
Americans\' scopic relation to the Other.

At issue in this shift is [[the gaze of the Other]{.underline}]{.mark},
which Lacan stated \"[**[has the effect of]{.mark} arresting
movement**\" and **[halting transgression]{.mark}**]{.underline} (1998b,
p. 118). [What objectifies the subject, as the]{.underline} [movement of
his or her drive binds the subject to the jouissance of the a , is
subjection to an \"entirely hidden gaze\" of the Other, which the
subject positions as a policing authority for whom the subject performs
his or her identity (p. 182). **[This disembodied]{.mark} observer and
[judge]{.mark}** constitutes an extimacy that [**polices unconscious
desires**, ensuring that]{.mark} \"it is in the space of [the Other
that]{.mark} \[the subject\] [sees]{.mark} **himself and [the point from
which he]{.mark} looks at himself [is also in that
space]{.mark}\"**]{.underline} (p. 144). This space of the \"capital
Other,\" Lacan said, is the \"locus of speech,\" the Symbolic (p. 129).
Where Lacan associated this locus with the law, the law of the father
and the law of desire, it can be said that [[**this hidden gaze is often
given presence by the police**.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Embodying the
arresting gaze that \"surprises\" the subject in his moment of
transgression, the police should allow to arise \"the conflagration of
shame\" that realigns the subject\'s desire away from the pathological
object of his or her fixation]{.underline} (p. 182). But [while the
police of Ferguson have facilitated an ostensive realignment of
America\'s subjective relation to the object of race, they have done so
by also largely dispossessing themselves of the agency of the
shaming]{.underline} gaze.

Indeed, after the killing of the unarmed Michael Brown by police on
August 18th, 2014, the agency of the shaming gaze was notably
transferred to the community and the larger American and international
public in turn. The community was the first to watch as the body of
Michael Brown lay in the streets for hours. Marking this indignity in
his eulogy at Brown\'s funeral, the Reverend Al Sharpton recalls that
for \"four and a half hours\" the \"family couldn\'t come to the ropes\"
but were left to watch \"Dogs sniffin\' through\" (2014). Explaining
that it signaled to him \"how many of us are considered nothing,\" how
\"we were just so marginalized and ignored,\" Sharpton displays his own
struggles against a Symbolic that destroys African Americans\' fantasies
of being (2014): he emphasizes, it was like Brown\'s \"life value
didn\'t matter\" (2014). But Sharpton\'s rhetoric throughout the eulogy
also marks the shift of the public gaze toward the Ferguson police and
America itself. He asks, \"How do you think we look when the world can
see you can\'t come up with a police report?\" - which was only produced
with sparse details almost two weeks after the shooting - and \"how do
you think we look when young people march nonviolently asking for the
land of the free and the home of the brave to hear their cry, and you
put snipers on the roof and point guns on them?\" (2014). Highlighting
what many in the media and the public see as excessive force in the
police\'s response to protestors, Sharpton exhorts, \"America, it\'s
time to deal with policing\" (2014).

Sharpton\'s rhetoric echoes a larger national shift whereby the
authority of the police as enforcer of the law and holder of the gaze is
cynically challenged. As a reverend himself, Sharpton transfers the gaze
from the earthly agency of the law to the divine agency of God, asking
the mourners, \"What does the Lord require of you\" as response to the
killing? (2014). But Sharpton finally pins both agency and
responsibility to the self, arguing that \"nobody gonna help us if we
don\'t help ourselves,\" so \"we\'ve got to \[start\] a movement\"
(2014). Throughout, Sharpton\'s rhetoric directs the shaming gaze to the
police by positioning this gaze as the possession alternately of the
community, Americans in general, the international community that sees
an America bound to practices of the past, and the heavenly authority
who is positioned in judgment of all these participants. The eulogy
contributes to and charts the optical shift that, now making the
Ferguson police the object of the shaming gaze, has led not only to
public calls for body cameras to document police activity but also to
federal investigation of the Ferguson police department by the United
States Department of Justice. This shifting of the gaze goes some way
toward freeing the subject from the power of the policing Other, whose
abuse and even transgressions of the law unveil the inherent racism of
the Symbolic itself. With the Symbolic Other\'s capacity to define the
raced African American subject cynically challenged, the individual
African American is positioned to define more freely his or her own
identity.

The possibility opened up here is dual, offering the subject access to
an identity grounded in a reconfigured relation either to the fantasy a
or to an individual desire actuated by the drive. Already emulating the
metonymy of desire, the shifting of the gaze away from the line of sight
traced in the vision of the policing Other and toward perception of the
violent excesses this Other embraces because of race, opens up the
object a of race to reevaluation by diverse onlookers. Through this
displacement of the gaze, the violence that emerges from racial identity
can be put to uses for which it was not intended, helping to fortify the
poststructuralist approach of evolving African American identity through
the bricolage of self-redefinition. But it can also, at the more
individual level of the subject who is racialized as African American,
issue a challenge to the very concept of race itself.

Conclusion

[Though the ethical responsibility of issuing this challenge to the
concept of race is ceded through the glorification of the a , this
responsibility is established even in the model of poststructuralism
that holds such sway over contemporary thinking about social
change]{.underline}, [wherein the ultimate aim of the theory is not an
essentialist but a strategic deployment of identity]{.underline}. In the
poststructuralist vision, [because the given identity is \"never fully
owned,\" [it remains open to \"urgent and expanding political
purposes]{.mark}\" that demand shifting allegiances across such lines as
race, class and gender]{.underline} (Butler, 1993, p. 228). But while
poststructuralism produces this politics driven by a metonymic shift in
subjective positionality by assuming a center-less self untethered from
all identity, [I envision **through psychoanalysis [the subject\'s
encounter with an excluded center masked by the illusions of this
subject\'s embraced identities]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Where
belief in race threatens to bind the subject to the fantasies of
wholeness secured by the object a , and where]{.underline} true
[poststructuralist [resignification of race forecloses recognition of
the deeper drives that **guide the identity politics of the individual
subject**, such]{.mark} a potentially seminal moment in the
reconfiguration of race [offers]{.mark} the racialized subject [a
unique]{.mark} opportunity to attempt a Lacanian [traversal of race that
can **ground individual political activity in deeper recognition of the
subject\'s desire**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Lacan specified that the object a \"plays the role of obturator,\"
inhibiting such recognition by facilitating the \"closing of the
unconscious]{.underline}\" (1998b, p. 144). Aimed at an impossible
wholeness, [what the object a of race attempts is to fill the
constitutive gaps in the subject, the spaces left unoccupied by the
subject\'s absent being.]{.underline} But Lacanian theory stipulates
that [the \"subject who has traversed the radical fantasy \[can\]
experience the drive\" that exudes from the space of these
gaps]{.underline} (p. 273). [Where this drive is an expression of the
undirected libido whose \"effective presence\" is registered only in
\"desire]{.underline},\" it is through the process of reorienting one\'s
desire away from such fantasies as race that the subject may begin the
process of experiencing and directing this internal tension of the drive
(p. 153). [[Through]{.mark} the process of [\"mapping\" one\'s own
desire in]{.mark} one\'s [cynical questioning]{.mark} of the object a
presented by the Other]{.underline} (p. 273), [[the subject is]{.mark}
placed upon the \"track of something that is specifically \[her\]
business,\" [situating herself in relation to a]{.mark} desire and
[drive that is]{.mark} particularly [her own
belonging]{.mark}]{.underline} (1997, p. 319). It is perhaps most likely
that the [**recent [attention to repeated incidents of deadly violence
to black men]{.mark}** [will not produce sustained social
skepticism]{.mark} about the value of race, [for \"the loop\" of
the]{.mark} fundamental [fantasy]{.mark}]{.underline}, Lacan stressed,
[\"[must be run through several times]{.mark}\" if the subject is to
free himself truly from the illusions of the Other]{.underline}.
However, **[[the unconscious gap opened up by this cynical response to
race]{.mark} at the national level [allows essential space for the
initial movements of the individual subject of race]{.mark} along the
path of this loop]{.underline}**.

#### In contemporary American society, racial identity often functions as an object a. White racial identity structures its coherence through conjuring images of mythic enjoyment experienced by black people; consequently, they become the objects of the surveillance of white racial gaze, objects whose excessive enjoyment must be curtailed, with spectacular violence of necessary.

[Difference may be isolated from the racial body in this manner because
it [is ultimately jouissance that grounds difference]{.mark},
[establishing this difference through its]{.mark} [circumscription of
the fantasy object Lacan calls the **object a**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Most precisely, [[jouissance designates the pleasure that would emerge
from an impossible wholeness]{.mark}. Lacan explains]{.underline},
however, [that [in the face of such impossibility the signifier serves
as \"the cause of jouissance,\" producing pleasure through its
articulation of the fantasies of]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[wholeness]{.underline}]{.mark}, or being, [[that compensate for
**subjective lack**]{.underline}]{.mark}.14 [**[This being]{.mark}**,
**[lost to the subject]{.mark}**, [is defined as a **psychic sense of
unity**]{.mark}, autonomy, and individuality [that the subject can
construct only through the signifier\'s isolation of the object
a]{.mark}, [the illusory lost object that promises to **return the
subject** to a **jouissance-filled state of
wholeness**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[In American society, this fantasy
object a]{.underline}]{.mark}, I argue, [[is often racial
identity]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[supporting both difference and
jouissance-inducing fantasies of being. Within the fantasies of the
racialized subject]{.underline}]{.mark}, this object a of race, [[this
\"object that puts itself in the place of what cannot be glimpsed of the
other\" and the self, serves as the \"basis of being,\" isolating an
imaginary core self that \"holds the image \[of the racial body\]
together]{.mark},\" granting it psychic and semantic significance for
the subject]{.underline}.15 [Race, as object a,]{.underline} [functions
as what I]{.underline} [would call after Lacan the \"para-being,\" the
\"being beside,\" which is \"substitute\[ed\] . . . for the being that
would take flight.\"16 More so than the physical body, **[it is racial
identity as founded by this illusory core being]{.mark}**, the racial
essence distinct to each racial group, **[that provides structure and
coherence to fantasies of difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
But where this a as racial core is both illusory and thus elusive,
[[what racial fantasies ultimately isolate as proof of the other\'s
alterity is the other\'s enjoyment, which is perceived as]{.mark} an
index of [this other\'s jouissance]{.mark}, a reification of [the bliss
experienced by this other through access to an illusory
a]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[In racial fantasies, the other\'s visible]{.mark} or even stylized
[expressions of pleasure]{.mark}, which are exemplified so distinctly in
music, [come to define the other\'s particular mode of]{.mark}
[jouissance]{.mark}, his or her specific manner of accessing being.
[This visible enjoyment helps to construct the other as bound to a
distinctive jouissance of being that differentiates]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[self from other and racial group from racial
group]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Through the group\'s mode of jouissance,
its very being or core self is defined and its racial identity is
solidified. [Racial]{.mark} [alterity is]{.mark} thus often
[contextualized by]{.mark} a fantastical sense of [the incompatibility
of the other\'s mode of jouissance with that of the subjective
self]{.mark}]{.underline}, or that of this self\'s racial group; but the
other\'s jouissance, bound to fantasy, actively oscillates between
subjective imaginings that designate it alternately as alien and as
excessive, and [[this jouissance]{.mark} [can therefore also
found]{.mark} what Lacan terms [\"jealouissance,\" the frustrated hatred
that may spring forth from the subject upon conviction that the other
\"has the a\" and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[accesses a bountiful bliss the
subject lacks]{.underline}]{.mark}.17 [Where hatred of the other is
fundamentally \"addressed to being\" and is essentially isolated through
the jouissance perceived in]{.underline} [the other\'s manifest
enjoyment, [it is toward the bountiful excesses of a visible pleasure
alien to Dunn\'s self-identity]{.mark}, an unrestrained jouissance of
being expressed in the boys\']{.underline} [loud rap music and
undisciplined behavior]{.underline}, [[that Dunn directs his hatred and
aggressivity]{.mark}.]{.underline}18

[[Behavior]{.mark}, signaling a mode of jouissance, [becomes the core of
an otherness that Dunn would violently **restrain and
discipline**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Echoing his interpretation of the
case, Dunn\'s attorney, Cory Strolla, asserts to the press that \"this
isn\'t a black-and-white issue.\"19 He states, \"It\'s what \[Dunn\]
would call a subculture thug issue. . . . And again, it doesn\'t go to
race. It goes to how people behave and respond to situations.\"20 While
proclaiming, with the help of Strolla, that the incident occurred
because he requested \"a common courtesy\" in asking the boys to turn
their music down, Dunn attests that the boys responded to his request by
not turning down but turning off the music; however, they then turned it
back on, he says, and Davis started to curse and verbally threaten him
from inside the boys\' vehicle, actions Dunn himself responded to by
rolling down his window and directly asking Davis, \"Are you talking
about me?\"21 Dunn describes the boys\' behavior as \"obnoxious,\"
adding that he was \"stunned and . . . horrified and just couldn\'t
believe that things escalated the way they did over a common
courtesy.\"22 The boys\' \"obnoxious\" behavior confirmed for Dunn an
existing image into which he now solidly positioned them: acknowledging
that he could have been \"imagining\" the danger he feared, Dunn
explains, \"You know, you hear enough news stories and you read about
these things, they go through your mind\"; with such stories about
fearsome blacks in mind, and given \"the way they behaved\" in response
to his request, Dunn concluded that \"everybody in the car was a thug or
a gangster.\"23

#### The 1ac's resistance to whiteness is contrary to its intent. The aff participates in the very mythologization of that which it set out to confront. This is because the way the 1ac imagines achieving its goal is in fact structured by the very institutionalization of whiteness it claims to fight against. Any successful politics will require a new approach to the constitution of desire and symbolic capital.

amplifier]{.underline}]{.mark}** of every single moment, event and
accident. [[The **age of urgency** is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [an age
when new [wounded bodies]{.mark} erupt and undertake to actually occupy
spaces they used to simply haunt]{.underline}. [They are now piling up,
swearing and cursing, speaking with excrements, [**asking to be
heard**.]{.mark} They speak [in **allegories** ]{.mark}**and analogies**
-- [the "colony", the "plantation]{.mark}", the "house Negro", the
"field Negro", **[blurring]{.mark} all [boundaries]{.mark}**[,]{.mark}
**embracing confusion**, mixing times and spaces, **at the risk of
anachronism**]{.underline}. [They are [claiming]{.mark} all kinds of
rights -- **[the right to violence]{.mark}**; the right **[to disrupt
and jam]{.mark}** that which is parading as normal; the right to insult,
intimidate and bully those who do not agree with them; the right [to
be]{.mark} angry[, enraged]{.mark}; the right to go to war in the hope
of recovering what was lost through conquest; the right to hate, **[to
wreak vengeance, to smash something, it doesn't matter what, as long as
it looks "white".]{.mark}** All these new "rights" are supposed to
achieve one thing we are told the 1994 "peaceful settlement" did not
achieve -- decolonization and retributive justice, the only way to
restore a modicum of dignity to victims of the injuries of yesterday and
today.]{.underline} Demythologizing whiteness And yet, [some hard
[questions must be asked]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[Why [are we
invested in turning whiteness, pain and suffering into]{.mark} such
[erotogenic objects]{.mark}]{.underline}**? [Could it be that [the
**concentration of** ]{.mark}**our [libido on whiteness]{.mark}**[,
**pain** and **suffering** is]{.mark} after all [typical of **the
narcissistic investments** ]{.mark}**so [privileged by this neoliberal
age]{.mark}**? To frame the issues in these terms does not mean
embracing a position of moral relativism]{.underline}. How could it be?
After all, [in relation to our history, too many lives were destroyed in
the name of whiteness]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the structural
repetition of past sufferings in the present is beyond any reasonable
doubt. [Whiteness as a necrophiliac power structure]{.mark} and a
primary shaper of a global system of unequal redistribution of life
chances will not die a natural death]{.underline}. **[But [to]{.mark}
properly [engineer its death]{.mark} -- and thus the end of the
nightmare it has been for a large portion of the humanity -- [we]{.mark}
urgently [need to demythologize it]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [[If
we fail]{.mark} to properly demythologize whiteness, [whiteness]{.mark}
-- as the machine in which a huge portion of the humanity has become
entangled in spite of itself -- **[will end up claiming
us]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [As a result of whiteness having
claimed us; as a result of having let ourselves be possessed by it in
the manner of an evil spirit, [we will **inflict upon ourselves injuries
of** ]{.mark}**which [whiteness]{.mark}**, at its most ferocious, would
**scarcely have been capable**]{.underline}. Indeed [[for whiteness
to]{.mark} properly [operate]{.mark} as the destructive force it is in
the material sphere, [it **needs to capture its victim's imagination**
and turn it into **a poison well of
hatred**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [For **[victims of white
racism]{.mark}** to hold on to the things that truly matter, they
[must]{.mark} incessantly [fight against]{.mark} the kind of
[hatred]{.mark} which never fails to destroy]{.underline}, in the first
instance, [the man or woman who **hates** while **leaving the structure
of whiteness itself intact**. As a poisonous fiction that passes for a
fact, **[whiteness seeks to institutionalize itself]{.mark}** as an
event by any means necessary. This it does [b**y colonizing**]{.mark}
the entire realms of **[desire]{.mark}** and of the imagination. [To
demythologize whiteness, it will not be enough to force "bad whites"
into silence or]{.mark} into confessing [guilt]{.mark} and/or
complicity. **This is too cheap**]{.underline}. [[To **puncture** and
**deflate** the fictions of whiteness will require **an entirely
different regime of desire**, new approaches in the constitution
of]{.mark} material, aesthetic and [symbolic capital,]{.mark} another
discourse on value, on what matters and why]{.underline}.

#### Uplift and emancipation are rhetorical tools deployed in the aff's particular mode of storytelling to produce a redemptive feeling in the listener. This pedagogy of optimism on the level of the form is actually a simplification of individual stories and participates in a political vampirism, a draining of the vital force and complexity of life in the over-presencing of imagistic representations.

What distinguishes these critical texts are the startling ways they
struggle to encounter the Uncle Tom form without reproducing it,
declining to pay the inheritance tax. The postsentimental does not
involve an aesthetic disruption to the contract sentimentality makes
between its texts and readers -that proper reading will lead to better
feeling and therefore to a better self. What changes is the place of
repetition in this contract, a crisis frequently thematized in formal
aesthetic and generational terms. [[In its traditional and political
modalities, the sentimental promises that in a just world a consensus
will already exist about what constitutes uplift]{.mark}, amelioration,
[and emancipation]{.mark}, those horizons toward which empathy
powerfully directs itself.]{.underline} [[Identification with suffering,
the ethical response to the sentimental plot, leads to its repetition in
the audience and thus]{.mark} to [a generally held view about what
transformations would bring the good life]{.mark} into being. [This
presumption]{.mark}]{.underline}, that the terms of consent are trans-
historical once true feeling is shared, [[explains]{.underline}]{.mark}
in part [[why emotions, especially painful ones, are so central to the
world-building aspects of sentimental alliance.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Postsentimental texts withdraw from the contract that presumes consent
to the conventionally desired outcomes of identification and empathy.
[[The desire for unconflictedness might]{.mark} very well [motivate the
sacrifice of surprising ideas to the norms of the world against which
this rhetoric is being deployed.]{.mark}]{.underline} What, if anything,
then, can be built from the very different knowledge/experience of
subaltern pain? What can memory do to create conditions for freedom and
justice without reconfirming the terms of ordinary subordination? More
than a critique of feeling as such, [[the postsentimental
modality]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[challenges
what]{.underline}]{.mark} literature and [[storytelling have come to
stand for]{.mark} in the creation of sentimental national
subjects]{.underline} across an almost two-century span. Three moments
in this genealogy, which differ as much from each other as from the
credulous citation of Uncle Tom\'s Cabin we saw in The King and I and
Dimples, will mark here some potential within the arsenal that counters
the repetition compulsions of sentimentality. This essay began with a
famous passage from James Baldwin\'s \"Everybody\'s Protest Novel,\" a
much-cited essay about Uncle Tom\'s Cabin that is rarely read in the
strong sense because its powerful language of rageful truth-telling
would shame in advance any desire to make claims for the tactical
efficacy of suffering and mourning in the struggle to transform the
United States into a postracist nation. I cited Baldwin\'s text to open
this piece not to endorse its absolute truth but to figure its
frustrated opposition to the sentimental optimism that equates the
formal achievement of empathy on a mass scale with the general project
of democracy. Baldwin\'s special contribution to what sentimentality can
mean has been lost in the social-problem machinery of mass society, in
which [[the production of tears where anger or nothing might have been
became more urgent with the coming to cultural dominance of]{.mark} the
Holocaust and [trauma as models for having and remembering
collective]{.mark} social [experience]{.mark}]{.underline}.20 Currently,
as [[in traditional sentimentality, the authenticity of overwhelming
pain that can be textually performed and shared is disseminated as a
prophylactic against the reproduction of a shocking and numbing mass
violence.]{.underline}]{.mark} Baldwin asserts that [[the overvaluation
of such redemptive feeling is]{.mark} precisely [a condition of that
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}** Baldwin\'s encounter with
Stowe in this essay comes amidst a general wave of protest novels,
social-problem films, and film noir in the U.S. after World War Two:
Gentleman\'s Agreement, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Best Years
of Our Lives. Films like these, he says, \"emerge for what they are: a
mirror of our confusion, dishonesty, panic, trapped and immobilized in
the sunlit prison of the American dream.\" [[They cut the complexity of
human motives]{.mark} and self-understanding [\"down to size\" by
preferring \"a lie more palatable than the truth\" about the]{.mark}
social and [material effects the liberal pedagogy of optimism
has]{.mark}, or doesn\'t have, [on \"man\'s\" capacity to produce a
world of authentic truth]{.mark}, justice, and freedom]{.underline}.21
Indeed, \"truth\" is the keyword for Baldwin. He defines it as \"a
devotion to the human being, his freedom and fulfillment: freedom which
cannot be legislated, fulfillment which cannot be charted.\"22 In
contrast, Stowe\'s totalitarian religiosity, her [[insistence that
subjects \"bargain\" for]{.underline}]{.mark} heavenly [[redemption with
their own]{.underline}]{.mark} physical and spiritual
[[mortification]{.mark}, merely and [violently confirms the fundamental
abjection of all persons, especially the black ones who wear the dark
night of the soul out where all can see it.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Additionally, Baldwin argues that Uncle Tom\'s Cabin instantiates a
tradition of locating the destiny of the nation in a false model of the
individual soul, one imagined as free of ambivalence, aggression, or
contradiction. By \"human being\" Baldwin means to repudiate stock
identities as such, arguing that their stark simplicity confirms the
very fantasies and institutions against which the sentimental is
ostensibly being mobilized. [[This national-liberal refusal of
complexity is what he]{.mark} elsewhere [calls \"the price of the
ticket\" for membership in the American dream.]{.mark}]{.underline}23 As
the Uncle Tom films suggest, [[whites need blacks to \"dance\" for them
so that they might continue disavowing the costs]{.mark} or ghosts [of
whiteness, which involve]{.mark} religious traditions of [self-loathing
and]{.mark} cultural traditions [confusing happiness with
analgesia.]{.mark}]{.underline} The conventional reading of
\"Everybody\'s Protest Novel\" sees it as a violent rejection of the
sentimental.24 It is associated with the feminine (Little Women), with
hollow and dishonest capacities of feeling, with an aversion to the real
pain that real experience brings. \"Causes, as we know, are notoriously
bloodthirsty,\" he writes.25 [[The
politico-sentimental]{.underline}]{.mark} novel [[uses suffering
vampirically to simplify the subject,]{.mark} thereby [making the
injunction to empathy safe for the subject]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of
course there is more to the story. Baldwin bewails the senti- mentality
of Richard Wright\'s Native Son because Bigger Thomas is not the
homeopathic Other to Uncle Tom after all, but one of his \"children,\"
the heir to his negative legacy.26 Both Tom and Thomas live in a simple
relation to violence and die knowing only slightly more than they did
before they were sacrificed to a white ideal of the soul\'s simple
purity, its emptiness. [[This addiction to the formula of redemption
through violent simplification persists with a \"terrible power\": it
confirms that U.S. minorities are constituted as Others even to
themselves through attachment to the most hateful]{.mark}, objectified,
[cartoon-like versions of their identities, and that the shamed
subcultures of America really are]{.mark}, in some way, [fully expressed
by the overpresence of the stereotypical image.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### We should adopt a position of drive, rather than desire, when confronting race. Desire is when one thinks that there is an object which can fill their lack. Drive, by contrast, affirms lack itself as constitutive of the subject- founding identity on a void that can never be filled. Three impacts: 1) This is the condition for WISDOM, according to Lacan. 2) This is the only way to overcome the fantasy of a self that can be complete or full or satisfied. 3) This is the condition for overcoming racialized desire.

Radically altering one\'s psychic relation to the Other, the process of
self-naming I here advocate both redirects the urge to grieve the
ancestor and repudiates the racialized designations through which the
Other seeks to confine the subject in the steel jug of the Symbolic.
[[What is ultimately entailed in this self-naming is the subject
recognizing his or her \"own image\" as \"a mortal cause, and
griev\[ing\] this object\" as a loss, as an emptiness around which the
subject\'s own personality must be built as an incrementally expansive
structure to contain this internal absence.]{.mark}32 In establishing
such personality, [the goal is not to escape lack but rather to ground
the self within it, to, more precisely, build the self around its
sustained void]{.mark}. [Lacanian theory shows that the only way \"to
found wisdom \[is\] on lack,\" which presents the single viable source
of self-recognition afforded the subject]{.mark}.33 [The absent image,
as container, as personality, must be cultivated and built up
\"ex-nihilo,\" from nothingness,]{.mark} as psychic defense against the
alluring phallus and objects a that act as the decoys for desire within
the confining ambit of the Symbolic.34 [By recognizing this absence as
the true pathway to desire, and by coming to travel this discovered
path, the subject of race may not only attain the means of expressing
the multiplicity of an identity and desire]{.mark} [unhinged from the
fantasy a of race, but also potentially direct him- or herself toward a
goal that centers the very practice of psychoanalysis:]{.mark} [not just
a transcendence of race but a transcendence of the fundamental fantasy
of recoverable loss that drives subjective and racial desire.]{.mark}
What Lacanian theory posits is the possibility that, after the
experience of actively mapping one\'s own relation to the fantasy object
is undertaken by the subject, this \"experience of the fundamental
phantasy\" can become \"the drive\" by which desire is then
\"agitated\"; unveiled by the theory is the potential that, [in
cynically questioning the fantasy of race, the subject may confront the
very lack that fuels all fantasy and all desire, the lack that must be
subjectified as the empty core of a newly adumbrated
self]{.mark}]{.underline}.35 Lacan importantly cautions that the
\"loop\" of the subject\'s fantasy often must be \"run through several
times\" before the subject abandons it. I propose, however, that because
of the cynicism already central to their relation to the Symbolic,
African Americans are uniquely positioned to embrace this very daunting
task of transcending both race and the fundamental fantasy it
supports.[36](#bookmark1602)

#### We don't need an alternative besides our framework of analysis -- the fantasy will reveal itself as long as we continue asking questions to expose their concealment of the lack -- in other words, it's your job to confuse and frustrate them via a refusal to partake in their politics

**Dean 6** \[Jodi, Professor of Political Science at Hobart and William
Smith Colleges, *Zizek's Politics,* Taylor & Francis: London and New
York, 2006, p. xvii-xx\]

By inserting popular culture into his writing, and himself into popular
culture, [Zizek enacts the way enjoyment colors or stains all thinking
and acting]{.underline}. What this means, as I set out in detail in
Chapter Three, is that [[there is a deep **nonrational** and **libidinal
nugget** in]{.mark} even [the **most rational**,]{.mark} **formal**
**[ways of thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Again, it is not simply that
popular culture is at the core of the theoretical enterprise of his
books---it is that enjoyment is. [Enjoyment is an unavoidable component
of any philosophical effor]{.underline}t (though many try to deny it).
Zizek thus emphasizes the inevitable stain on philosophy, on thought, as
[he tries to demonstrate a way of thinking that breaks with]{.underline}
(Zizek often uses Lacan\'s term traverses) [the fantasy of \"pure
reason.\"]{.underline}

This leads to another key element of Zizek\'s thought: [the possibility
of taking the position of the excess]{.underline}. As I explain in
discussions of his readings of St. Paul and Lenin, [Zizek theorizes
revolutionary politics as occurring through the occupation of this
excessive place]{.underline}. Paul endeavors to put the Christian
message to work, to establish new collectives beyond old oppositions
between Greeks and Jews. Lenin also breaks with the given, arguing
against all around him and against Marxist orthodoxy that the time for
revolution is now, that it cannot be predicted, awaited, but must be
accomplished with no assurances of success. Like Paul, he puts truth to
work, organizing it in the form of a revolutionary political Party.

Zizek emphasizes that [Lacan conceptualized this excessive place, this
place without guarantees, in his formula for \"the discourse of the
analyst]{.underline}\" (which I set out in Chapter Two[[). In
psycho-analysis, **the analyst just sits there, asking questions**
]{.mark}**from time to time**]{.underline}. [[She is some kind of object
or cipher onto which the analysand transfers love, desire, aggression,
and knowledge.]{.mark} The analysand]{.underline}, in other words,
proceeds through analysis by positing the analyst as someone who knows
exactly what is wrong with him and exactly what he should do to get rid
of his symptom and get better. [But, really, the analyst does not
know]{.underline}. Moreover, [[the analyst]{.mark} steadfastly
**[refuses to provide the analysand with any answers]{.mark}
whatsoever**]{.underline}. [[No ideals, no moral certainty, no goals, no
choices. Nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This is what makes the analyst
so traumatic]{.underline}]{.mark}, Zizek explains[, **[the fact that she
refuses to establish a law or set a limit]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[[that she does not function as some]{.mark} kind of [new
maste]{.mark}]{.underline}**[r]{.mark}.7 [Analysis is over when the
analysand accepts that the analyst does not know]{.underline}, [that
there is not any secret meaning or explanation]{.underline}, [and then
takes responsibility for getting on with his life]{.underline}. [The
challenge for the analysand]{.underline}, then, [is freedom,
autonomously determining]{.underline} his own [limits, directly
assuming]{.underline} his own [enjoyment]{.underline}. So, again, [the
position of the analyst is in this excessive place as an object through
which the analysand works through the analytical process]{.underline}.

[Why is the analyst necessary in the first place]{.underline}? If she is
not going to tell the analysand what to do, how he should be living,
then why does he not save his money, skip the whole process, and figure
out things for himself? There are two basic answers. First, [[the
analysand is not self-transparent]{.underline}. [He is a stranger to
himse]{.underline}]{.mark}[lf, a decentered agent \"struggling with a
foreign kernel]{.underline}.\"8 [[What is more likely than
self-understanding, is self-misunderstanding]{.underline}]{.mark}, that
is, [one\'s fundamental misperception of one\'s own
condition]{.underline}. **[[Becoming aware of this
misperception]{.mark}, grappling with it, [is the work of
analysis.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [Accordingly]{.mark}, second, **[[the
analyst is that external agent or position that gives a new form to our
activity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Saying]{.mark} [things]{.mark} out
loud, [presenting them to another]{.mark}, and [confronting them in
front of this external position concretizes]{.mark} and arranges [our
thoughts and activities in a different way,]{.mark} a way that is more
difficult to escape or avoid]{.underline}**. [The analyst then provides
a form through which we acquire a perspective on and a relation to our
selves]{.underline}.

Paul\'s Christian collectives and Lenin\'s revolutionary Party are, for
Zizek, similarly [formal arrangements]{.underline}, forms \"[for a new
type of knowledge linked to a collective political
subject]{.underline}.\"9 Each provides an external perspective on our
activities, [a way to concretize and organize our spontaneous
experiences]{.underline}. More strongly put, a political Party is
necessary precisely [**because [politics is not given; it does not
arise]{.mark} naturally or [organically]{.mark}** out of the
multiplicity of immanent flows and affects [**but has to be produced,
arranged, and constructed out of these flows in light of something
larger**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In my view, [when Zizek]{.underline} draws on popular culture and
[inserts himself into this culture, he is taking the position of an
object of enjoyment, an excessive object that cannot easily be
recuperated or assimilated. This **excessive position** is that of the
**analyst** as well as that of the **Party**]{.underline}. Reading Zizek
as occupying the position of the analyst tells us that [it is wrong
to]{.underline} expect Zizek to [tell us what to do, to provide an
ultimate solution or direction through which to solve all the world\'s
problems]{.underline}. [[The analyst]{.mark} does not provide the
analysand with ideals and goals]{.underline}; instead, [he [occupies the
place of an object in relation to which we work these out for
ourselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In adopting the position of the
analyst]{.underline}, [Zizek is also practicing what he refers to as
\"Bartleby politics,\" a politics [rooted in a kind of refusal wherein
the subject turns itself into a disruptive]{.mark}]{.underline} (of our
peace of mind!) [[violently passive object who says, \"I would prefer
not to.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}10 Thus, to my mind, [becoming preoccupied
with Zizek\'s style is like becoming preoccupied with what one\'s
analyst is wearing]{.underline}. [Why such a preoccupation]{.underline}?
How is this preoccupation enabling us to avoid confronting the truth of
our desire, our own investments in enjoyment? [How is complaining that
Zizek (or the analyst) will not tell us what to do a way that we avoid
trying to figure this out for ourselves]{.underline}?11

### 1NC\-\--High Theory

#### Their method ultimately fails to produce more satisfied subjects because there is no coherent social order to demand anything to. There is no complete moral philosophy capable of explaining the answer to simple questions like: "why care about others?"

because society has given up on prohibiting anything

**McGowan 13** \[Todd, Associate Professor of Film and Television
Studies at the University of Vermont, *Enjoying What We Don't Have: The

Press (Lincoln, NE): 2013, p. 99-112\]

The problem with this reading of Hegel (which is in no way confined to
Rawls and is in fact nearly the dominant reading) stems from its
inability to come to grips with Hegel\'s insight into the ultimate
failure of recognition.5 Through the search for recognition inaugurates
subjectivity, recognition can never apprehend the subject in its
singularity. [Recognition reduces the subject to a symbolic
identity]{.underline} --- I am recognized as a professional, as a
parent, as an American, and so on --- [and thus completely misses the
subject\'s uniqueness, what in the subject is irreducible to determinate
symbolic coordinates, even if this uniqueness is finally nothing more
than a fantasy]{.underline} (or the subject\'s singular mode of
fantasizing).

The failure operates in the other direction as well: [the subject who
seeks the other\'s recognition does not address itself to the real other
but only to a symbolic entity that exists only as a]{.underline}
[construction of the signifier]{.underline}. Even when we seek the
recognition of an actual person, [what gives value to this recognition
is its authorization by social authority, which is itself wholly
unauthorized]{.underline}. **[The search for recognition cannot have any
ethical status whatsoever because it involves submission to an entity
that exists only through the act of submitting to it]{.underline}**.6

[When the subject seeks recognition, it devotes itself to becoming
someone in the eyes of social authority, and the search for recognition
validates this authority. But at no point does the subject actually
encounter the real other, the other as such.]{.underline} Encountering
the real other, the other that several thinkers have christened the
\"neighbor,\" requires turning away from social authority and abandoning
the project of recognition.\' At the point where the subject does not
experience social recognition, it discovers the neighbor. As Kenneth
Reinhard explains, the neighbor \"materializes an uncanniness within the
social relationship, an enjoyment that resists sympathetic
identification and \'understanding/\"8 The experience of recognition
obscures this uncanniness and mediates the other\'s enjoyment in order
to render it more palpable for the subject. But in the process,
[recognition allows the subject to avoid the neighbor or the real
other.]{.underline}

[The encounter with the real other is the key to the subject\'s ethical
being and to the subject\'s enjoyment. **Psychoanalysis allows us to see
the foundational link that exists between ethics and
enjoyment**]{.underline}, where other approaches erect a clear divide
between the two. [Ethics]{.underline}, [for most ways of
thinking]{.underline}, involves a sacrifice of my own enjoyment for the
sake of someone else\'s. Rather than lying to get ahead at work, I tell
the truth to help create a more pleasant workplace atmosphere. [Rather
than devoting all my free time to watching pornography, I spend part of
it working at the food bank]{.underline}. For Spinoza in his Ethics, I
become ethical when I cease thinking from my own private perspective and
approach an Amor intellectualis Dei, or \"intellectual love of God,\" in
which I can think in terms of the whole of creation rather than simply
view isolated events from my limited perspective. This movement from the
private and self-interested to the public and concerned for the whole
defines almost every ethical project. [But psychoanalytic thought does
not conceive of ethics in this way. **It is through enjoyment itself,
not the sacrifice of it, that I genuinely encounter the other. An
insistence on enjoyment is at the same time an insistence on ethical
subjectivity.**]{.underline}

The neighbor or real other is the enjoying other. [The other\'s mode of
enjoyment marks the other as absolutely singular. Everything else about
the other]{.underline} --- emotions, thoughts, desires, achievements,
and so on --- [can be understood and communicated through the order of
signification or language.]{.underline} We can share all these
experiences through the mediation of the signifier, which informs them
in their very origin. [The other\'s enjoyment, unlike everything else
about the other, disturbs us when we encounter it because it does not
take us into account. While the other\'s symbolic identity includes us
as the source of the look that validates it, the]{.underline} [other\'s
enjoyment not only ignores us but seems to go so far as to occur at our
expense. When we encounter the enjoying other, we experience our own
isolation, our own absolute insignificance for the other.]{.underline}

The encounter with the enjoying other occurs at moments when a radical
cut emerges between the other and the subject. Events such as basketball
games and rock concerts allow spectators to identify with the enjoyment
that they see and thereby to avoid the trauma of the encounter with the
other\'s enjoyment. In contrast, [the shared laughter of people speaking
a foreign language]{.underline}, [the rumor of an orgy at a secret
society, or the strange noises that a toddler hears behind the closed
door of the parental bedroom do not provide any opening to the
outsider]{.underline}. One hears the enjoyment without any possibility
of partaking in it through the act of identification, and [one almost
inevitably imagines that one\'s exclusion is part of the
enjoymen]{.underline}t. The distinction between an enjoying other
enjoying itself at my expense and an enjoying other indifferent to me
becomes negligible. The pertinent fact is the other\'s enjoyment that
doesn\'t include me.

**[Beyond the Demand]{.underline}**

[In traditional social arrangements]{.underline}, [societies confront
subjects with demands]{.underline}, [and subjects respond by attempting
either to follow the demands or to seek the desire of the social
authority]{.underline} [that the demand hides. The former path is the
neurotic one]{.underline}: by sticking to the authority\'s demand, the
neurotic hopes to gain its recognition. [The problem is that what the
authority demands is not what it necessarily desires]{.underline}. As we
saw in the last chapter, there is no demand that doesn\'t conceal --- or
seem to conceal, which for the subject amounts to the same thing --- a
desire. [The project of securing the social authority\'s recognition
always runs aground on the ineffability of its desire and the
irreducibility of this desire to an articulated demand]{.underline}. The
irreducibility of desire to demand leaves subjects confronted by a
social demand with the choice between these two paths.9

[This fundamental choice that defines our subjectivity has almost fully
disappeared in contemporary capitalist society]{.underline}. While many
of the dramatic changes that have recently taken place (the Internet
revolution, the globalization of the economy, the emergence of hybrid
subjectivities) create illusory movement and leave underlying social
structures intact, the turn away from the dialectic of demand and desire
represents a substantive transformation in the way that subjects
experience their social existence[**. Subjects today do not encounter a
clear demand from social authority**, and consequently they also do not
confront the secret of the authority\'s desire beneath this
demand]{.underline}.10

**[Instead of a clear demand]{.underline}** prohibiting the subject\'s
private enjoyment and exhorting a contribution to the public good,
**[the subject receives inducements to enjoy itself from a variety of
authority figures]{.underline}**. Authority\'s demands are no longer
demands in the traditional sense, and they do not appear to conceal
anything. Rather than hiding its desire, [**authority publicly flaunts
its enjoyment and encourages the subject to do the same**.\" From
Charlie Sheen\'s rants about his status as a \"winner\" to Nicolas
Sarkozy\'s marriage to a supermodel to Silvio Berlusconi\'s open
displays of corruption, **figures of authority today parade their
enjoyment and issue an implicit imperative for others to do the
same.**]{.underline} As a result, [the subject does not face a choice
between sticking to the explicit demand or seeking the hidden desire but
rather the choice between trying to obey the imperative to enjoy or
searching for the **missing demand hidden somewhere in the social
fabric**]{.underline}. **[This is the choice between the position of the
pathological narcissist and that of the fundamentalist, and it defines
our era]{.underline}**.

In contrast to the traditional social structure founded on the demands
of a strong paternal authority, today\'s structure utilizes a new form
of paternal authority, and this new authority has clear consequences for
our relationship to enjoyment. This transformation bears directly on the
ability of paternal authority to shield subjects from enjoyment.
Traditional authority figures ruled through prohibition: they demanded
that subjects sacrifice their enjoyment for admittance into the social
order. This type of paternal authority governs through the establishing
of distance --- distance between the authority figure and the subject,
as well as distance between the subject and enjoyment. [The new
authority]{.underline}, however, [abandons distance for the sake of
proximity]{.underline}. [Rather than confronting us with an impenetrable
demand that remains out of our comprehension, he assaults us with
displays of his enjoyment]{.underline}.

[The new authority rarely appears in the guise of an authority, but
this]{.underline}, ironically, [garners all the more power for
him.]{.underline} As Slavoj Zizek points out, \"Today\'s boss or father
\... insists that we should treat him as a friend; he addresses us with
intrusive familiarity, bombarding us with sexual innuendos, inviting us
to share a drink or a vulgar joke,\" and as a result, \"[we are deprived
even of the private space of irony and mockery, since the master is on
both levels: an authority as well as a friend]{.underline}/\'12 The
proximity of the contemporary paternal authority deprives the subject of
any space for private respite, and at the same time, it confronts the
subject with its own obscene enjoyment.

[What results is not a traditional subject of desire, a subject
struggling with lack, but a subject wrestling with a disturbing
presence.]{.underline} This is why, according to Eric Santner,
[contemporary anxiety is an anxiety \"not of absence and loss but of
overproximity, loss of distance to some obscene and malevolent
presence.\"]{.underline}13 **[Authority has become too close, and its
obscenity has become visible]{.underline}**. The transformation of
paternal authority --- a turn from the prohibition of enjoyment to a
command that subjects enjoy themselves --- fundamentally alters the
subject\'s relation not just to authority itself but to the other as
such.

Whereas prohibition creates a social authority that exists at a distance
from the subject --- or that installs distance within all of the
subject\'s relationships --- [the absence of an explicit prohibition
leaves the contemporary subject in the proximity of a real other. The
social field of prohibition is a terrain stripped of all enjoyment where
**everyone is reduced to the form of symbolic identity.**]{.underline}
[Without this terrain]{.underline} (which is the contemporary
situation), [one encounters the other beyond its symbolic identity, the
enjoying other.]{.underline} It is others listening to music with their
headphones, talking loudly on a cell phone, eating excessive amounts of
food, communicating in an unknown language, or emitting an unusual
odor/4 **[Public displays of enjoyment occur with increasing frequency
today because the dominant form of authority does not function through
prohibition]{.underline}**. **[Rather than violating the ruling social
imperative, the public display of enjoyment heeds it. The result is
rampant anxiety]{.underline}**. **[Without the distance from the other
requisite for desire, one experiences the anxiety produced by its
presence]{.underline}**.

[Though a contemporary society that bombards us with the enjoying other
is markedly different from traditional societies that prohibit public
displays of enjoyment in order to sustain a public bond, there is a
sense in which the current situation represents the truth of traditional
societies]{.underline}. Just as Marx sees capitalism as revealing the
truth of all hitherto existing social forms (specifically the
structuring role that economy played), the society ruled by the
imperative to enjoy lays bare the truth of all previous societies ruled
by prohibition.

[Through restrictions on enjoyment, these societies covered over the
real encounter between the enjoying subject and the enjoying
other.]{.underline} Nonetheless, [even when the symbolic relation
mediates this real encounter, it continues to mark the ultimate stake in
social relations insofar as it]{.underline} occupies the limit point of
all social relations, the point that social relations cannot include. In
traditional societies, just as in contemporary society, [the fundamental
question remains the same for the subject, and it concerns the
relationship that the subject takes up to anxiety]{.underline}.15 [The
ethical position, for psychoanalysis, necessarily involves the **embrace
of this anxiety**]{.underline} - **[and this is at once the path to
enjoyment]{.underline}**.

#### Our paranoid hatred of others is rooted in jouissance, that excessive, rapturous pleasure humans irrationally strive toward that, "begins with a tickle and ends with blaze of \[gasoline\]."[^1] Put another way, jouissance is the enjoyment that we imagine as incoherent, tapping into some mysterious reservoir of the unknown, something dangerous, something seductive. 

#### Jouissance ultimately emerges from an essential principle of human psychology: our very ability to communicate with others is premised on our traumatic separation from the world before language, a jouissance-filled state of wholeness forever foreclosed by our entrance into the social order. This constitutive lack defines the subject as eternally split between two worlds: impulsive desires internal to the self are to struggle against the constant, contradictory demands of the external world, with perfect mediation between the two worlds, self and other, an impossible fantasy. 

#### With that impossible wholeness behind us, we naturally seek substitutes and fill-ins that offer stopgap access to the jouissance that wholeness offered. Lacan designated these fantasy objects as "object a," objects of desire that offer the promise of unbridled pleasure but are ultimately unattainable (because nothing can deliver unbridled pleasure- there's no silver bullet to eternal psychic happiness). Embracing the anxiety of the other's enjoyment \-\-- the death drive itself \-\-- offers the only possibility of ethical encounter 

\-\--cynicism/pessimism fails b/c it's not cynical about what other
people believe (i.e. it believes that everyone is just way dumber than
you which is itself a fantasy that maintains faith in the overall
system)

\-\--enjoyment is overwhelming and unproductive- it takes control of
you- allowing ourselves to be disturbed by the Other as other is the
most ethical and sustainable way to confront difference

\-\--Fascism = attempt to confront the other on the terrain of your own
rules, structuring enjoyment such that others have to submit to you or
disappear inevitably produces violence factions- even if you achieve
your goal, it won't satisfy you so you come to find another scapegoat

Political Project of Psychoanalysis*, Symploke, University of Nebraska
Press (Lincoln, NE): 2013, p. 112-120\]

There is, however, a different way of thinking about anxiety. Despite
his kinship with Heidegger on so many points, Jacques Lacan defines
anxiety in precisely the opposite way. For Lacan, [anxiety does not
involve a confrontation with absence]{.underline} --- with what
Heidegger calls the nothing --- [but with an overwhelming
presence]{.underline}. Though the experience of castration establishes
the scene where anxiety will play out, castration alone does not
generate anxiety in the subject. [The absence or nothingness that
castration produces can have the effect of reassuring the
subject]{.underline}: it [provides the subject with a sense of distance
from the other and breathing space for itself]{.underline}. [The trauma
of the rupture it occasions has a pacifying reverse side.]{.underline}

[We experience anxiety when]{.underline} the absence that castration
produces --- [the lost object]{.underline}, or objet petit a --- [ceases
to be an absence. As]{.underline} Lacan puts it in his seminar devoted
to the topic of anxiety, \"[It is this sudden appearance of lack in a
positive form that is the source of anxiety]{.underline}.\"24 We expect
the absence that is the lost object, but we encounter a field of
representation where this gap has been filled.

[Social authority appears nonlacking and ubiquitous, never allowing the
subject the space to desire.]{.underline} Lacan says, \"[The possibility
of absence makes up the security of presence. What is most]{.underline}
[anxiety-provoking for the child is precisely when the relationship on
which he sets himself up,]{.underline} [the relationship which makes him
desire, is disrupted]{.underline}; it is the most disrupted when there
is no possibility of lack, when the mother is all the time on his back,
and especially when she is wiping his ass, which is the model of the
demand that cannot fail.\"2s [The total presence of the
authority]{.underline} [leads to anxiety because the child in this
situation has no distance from the other\'s enjoyment]{.underline}. This
situation proliferates from the parent/child relation to every social
relation. [The other\'s private enjoyment]{.underline} --- its smell,
its way of talking, its gestures --- [ceaselessly bombards the subject.
This is an assault that occurs all the time in the contemporary social
world.]{.underline}

During Clarence Thomas\'s confirmation hearing or Bill Clinton\'s
impeachment trial, private enjoyment became a normal part of public
discourse. The details of Thomas\'s alleged sexual harassment of Anita
Hill and of Clinton\'s sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky were a
regular topic of discussion in newspapers, on the nightly news, and
throughout the culture. At the time, one could find no respite from the
obscene enjoyment of Thomas and Clinton, which had the effect of
triggering anxiety ---and calls for cleansing the public space by
rejecting Thomas or impeaching Clinton --- in large portions of the
populace. But these celebrated cases only testify to a larger social
phenomenon that occurs on a quotidian level today, though one can see it
emerging even in the 1950s, the decade supposedly marked by strong
paternal authority.

Though critics often dismiss the reductive Freudianism of Nicholas
Ray\'s Rebel without a Cause (1955), it nonetheless exemplifies in a
traditional way how the other\'s excessive presence produces anxiety. M
The film stands as a cultural landmark for its expression of teen angst
through the central character Jim Stark (James Dean). His anxiety stems
not from an existential experience of nothingness but from the
overzealous attention of his parents and the proximity of their displays
of enjoyment. Jim\'s famous cry at the police station early in the film
-\"You\'re tearing me apart!\" ---represents his initial effort to
escape the anxiety, but the final escape occurs during the film\'s
denouement in a planetarium, where, with his friends, he finds freedom
from anxiety at the site where earlier they witnessed a show on the vast
nothingness and indifference of space. Rather than causing anxiety,
nothingness in Rebel without a Cause functions as its cure.

[The most common strategy for escaping the anxiety that inheres in
today\'s subjectivity is the recourse to cynicism]{.underline}. [The
cynic adopts a posture of nonchalance toward the enjoyment of the other,
**seeing this enjoyment as nothing special**]{.underline}. [For the
cynic, there is no such thing as real enjoyment, no object that has more
value than any other]{.underline}. Cynicism allows the subject to see
through the fiction of the impossible object and to see it as just
another everyday object. For example, [Diogenes]{.underline}, the parent
figure of cynicism, [masturbates in public in order to demonstrate that
activities seemingly laden with enjoyment]{.underline} (like
masturbation) are [really just everyday affairs.]{.underline}

[Through this transformation, the subject avoids the anxiety that
emerges from its encounter with the enjoying other. To the extent that
it works as it hopes to work, cynicism produces a]{.underline} [world
free of anxiety because it produces a world bereft of
enjoyment.]{.underline}

But as theorists of contemporary cynicism have shown, [cynical subjects
don\'t really sustain a thoroughgoing cynicism relative to
enjoyment.]{.underline} While they disbelieve in the possibility of
enjoyment or authentic commitment, **[they do believe in
belief]{.underline}**. That is, **[they believe that there are others
who really believe]{.underline}**. [Despite the cynical knowledge that
this belief is false,]{.underline} [the cynical subject does believe in
the enjoyment that comes from belief, and as a result, cynicism doesn\'t
offer the respite from anxiety that it initially promises.]{.underline}

Unlike cynicism, [the opposite strategy]{.underline} --- [the attempt to
restore prohibition and paternal law --- involves an avowal of the lost
object and its ability to deliver enjoyment. We try to create the
requisite distance from enjoyment through our various efforts to
resurrect prohibition, to return to the reign of traditional symbolic
authority.]{.underline} These efforts most often take the form of
various fundamentalisms. [One of the chief appeals of fundamentalism is
its promise to reintroduce a barrier to enjoyment into the experience of
contemporary subjectivity. By reintroducing this barrier, fundamentalism
promises to keep anxiety at bay, to allow us to attain some distance
from the enjoying other.]{.underline}

But [like cynicism]{.underline}, [efforts to restore prohibition end up
returning the subject to the situation of]{.underline} [anxiety rather
than providing relief Contemporary fundamentalism derives its energy not
from]{.underline} [the idea of restricting enjoyment but from the idea
of unleashing]{.underline} it. It promises increased enjoyment through
restriction, and it delivers on this promise, though in doing so it
produces even more anxiety. As fundamentalism restores prohibitions, it
creates more intense sites of enjoyment. [Whereas the cynical subject
sees no enjoyment in the revelation of an almost-naked]{.underline}
[body, the fundamentalist subject sees enjoyment proliferating with the
baring of a small patch of skin. In a world of anxiety, even the attempt
to create distance has the effect of creating more enjoyment. Both
cynicism and fundamentalism emerge in response to the contemporary
subject\'s anxious proximity to the present object. Both see **distance
from the enjoyment of the other as the only possible solution to the
experience of anxiet**y]{.underline}.

[The **alternative**]{.underline} --- the **[ethical path that
psychoanalysis identifies]{.underline}** --- **[demands an embrace of
the anxiety that stems from the encounter with the enjoying
other]{.underline}**. [If there is a certain ethical dimension to
anxiety, it lies in the relationship that exists between anxiety and
enjoyment]{.underline}. Contra Heidegger, [the ethics of anxiety does
not stem from anxiety\'s relation to absence but from its relation to
presence - to the overwhelming presence of the other\'s
enjoyment]{.underline}. In some sense, the encounter with absence or
nothing is easier than the encounter with presence. [Even though it
traumatizes us, absence allows us to constitute ourselves as desiring
subjects. Rather than producing anxiety, absence leads the subject out
of anxiety into desire]{.underline}. Confronted with the lost object as
a structuring absence, the subject is able to embark on the pursuit of
the enjoyment embodied by this object, and this pursuit provides the
subject with a clear sense of direction and even meaning. [This is
precisely what the subject lacks when it does not encounter a lack in
the symbolic structure. When the subject encounters enjoyment at the
point where it should encounter the absence of enjoyment, anxiety
overwhelms the subject.]{.underline}

In this situation, the subject cannot constitute itself along the path
of desire. It lacks the lack-the absence -that would provide the space
through which desire could develop. Consequently, [this subject
confronts the enjoying other and experiences anxiety. Unlike the subject
of desire - or the subject of Heideggerean anxiety-the subject who
suffers this sort of anxiety actually experiences the other in its real
dimension]{.underline}.

[The real other is the other caught up in its obscene enjoyment, caught
up in this enjoyment in a way that intrudes on the subject]{.underline}.
There is no safe distance from this enjoyment, and one cannot simply
avoid it. [There is nowhere in the contemporary world to hide from
it.]{.underline} As a result, [the contemporary subject is necessarily a
subject haunted by anxiety triggered by the omnipresent enjoyment of the
other. And yet, this enjoyment offers us an ethical
possibility]{.underline}. As Slavoj Zizek puts it, \"[It is this
excessive and intrusive jouissance that we should learn to
tolerate]{.underline}.\"[27 **When we tolerate the other\'s \"excessive
and intrusive jouissance\" and when we endure the anxiety that it
produces, we acknowledge and sustain the other in its real
dimension**]{.underline}.

[Tolerance is the ethical watchword of our epoch.]{.underline} However,
[the problem with contemporary tolerance is its insistence on
**tolerating the other only insofar as the other cedes its enjoyment and
accepts the prevailing symbolic structure. That is to say, we readily
tolerate the other in its symbolic dimension, the other that plays by
the rules of our game. This type of tolerance allows the subject to feel
good about itself and to sustain its symbolic identity. The problem is
that**]{.underline}, at the same time, it **[destroys what is in the
other more than the other]{.underline}** - the **[particular way that
the other enjoys]{.underline}**.

[It is only the encounter with the other in its real dimension - the
encounter that produces anxiety in the subject - that sustains that
which defines the other as such. Authentic tolerance tolerates the real
other, not simply the other as mediated through a symbolic
structure]{.underline}. In this sense, **[it involves the experience of
anxiety on the part of the subject]{.underline}**. **[This is a
difficult position to sustain]{.underline}**, [as it involves enduring
the \"whole opaque weight of alien enjoyment on your
chest.]{.underline}\"28 [The obscene enjoyment of the other bombards the
authentically tolerant subject, but this subject does not retreat from
the anxiety that this enjoyment produces]{.underline}.

[If the embrace of the anxiety that accompanies the other\'s proximate
enjoyment represents the ethical position today, this does not
necessarily provide us with an incentive for occupying it.]{.underline}
[Who wants to be ethical when it involves enduring anxiety rather than
finding a way]{.underline} - [a drug, a new authority, or something ---
to alleviate it? What good does it do to sustain oneself in
anxiety?]{.underline} In fact, [**anxiety does the subject no good at
all, which is why it offers the subject the possibility of enjoyment**.
When the subject encounters the other\'s enjoyment, this is the form
that its own enjoyment takes as well. To endure the anxiety caused by
the other\'s enjoyment is to experience one\'s own
simultaneously]{.underline}. As Lacan points out, when it comes to the
enjoyment of the other and my own enjoyment, \"nothing indicates they
are distinct/\'29 Thus, [not only is anxiety an ethical position, it is
also the key to embracing the experience of enjoyment. To reject the
experience of anxiety is to flee one\'s own enjoyment]{.underline}.

The notion that the other\'s enjoyment is also our own enjoyment seems
at first glance difficult to accept. [Few people enjoy themselves when
they hear someone else screaming profanities in the workplace or when
they see a couple passionately kissing in public]{.underline}, to take
just two examples. In these instances, [we tend to recoil at the
inappropriateness of the activity rather than enjoy it,]{.underline}
[and this reaction seems completely justified]{.underline}. [The public
display of enjoyment violates the social pact with its intrusiveness; it
doesn\'t let us alone but assaults our senses. It violates the
implicit]{.underline} [agreement of the public sphere constituted as an
enjoyment-free zone. And yet, recoiling from the other\'s enjoyment
deprives us of our own.]{.underline}

[How we comport ourselves in relation to the other\'s enjoyment
indicates our relationship to our own]{.underline}. [What bothers us
about the other]{.underline} -the disturbance that the other\'s
enjoyment creates in our existence --- [is our own mode of
enjoying]{.underline}. If we did not derive enjoyment from the other\'s
enjoyment, witnessing it would not bother us psychically. We would
simply be indifferent to it and focused on our own concerns. Of course,
we might ask an offending car radio listener to turn the radio down so
that we wouldn\'t have to hear the unwanted music, but we would not
experience the mere exhibition of alien enjoyment through the playing of
that music as an affront. The very fact that the other\'s enjoyment
captures our attention demonstrates our intimate --- or extimate ---
relation to it.30

[This relation becomes even clearer when we consider the epistemological
status of the enjoying other.]{.underline} [Because the real or enjoying
other is irreducible to any observable identity, we have no way of
knowing whether or not the other really is enjoying. A stream of
profanity may be the result of someone hurting a toe.]{.underline} [The
person playing the car radio too loud while sitting at the traffic light
may have simply forgotten to turn down the radio after driving on the
highway]{.underline}. Or the person may have difficulty hearing. The
couple\'s amorous behavior in public may reflect an absence of enjoyment
in their relationship that they are trying to hide from both themselves
a..: the public.

[Considering the enjoyment of the other]{.underline}, [we never know
whether it is there or not. If we experience it, **we do so through the
lens of our own fantasy**]{.underline}. [We fantasize that the person
blasting the radio is caught up in the enjoyment of the music to the
exclusion of everything]{.underline} else; we fantasize that the public
kisses of the couple suggest an enjoyment that has no concern for the
outside world. [Without the fantasy frame, the enjoying other would
never appear within our experience]{.underline}.

[The role of the fantasy frame for accessing the enjoying other becomes
apparent within Fascist ideology. Fascism posits an internal
enemy]{.underline}---the figure of [the Jew or some
analogue]{.underline} --- that [enjoys illicitly at the expense of the
social body as a whole. By attempting to eliminate the enjoying other,
Fascism hopes to create a pure social body bereft of any stain of
enjoyment]{.underline}. This purity would allow for the ultimate
enjoyment, but it would be completely licit. [This **hope for a future
society free of any stain** is not where Fascism\'s true enjoyment
lies]{.underline}, however. [Fascists experience their own enjoyment
through the enjoying other that they persecute.]{.underline} The
enjoyment that the figure of the Jew embodies is the Fascists\' own
enjoyment, though they cannot avow it as their own. [More than any other
social form, **Fascism is founded on the disavowal of
enjoyment**]{.underline} --- **[the attempt to enjoy while keeping
enjoyment at arm\'s length]{.underline}**.31 But this effort is not
confined to Fascism; it predominates everywhere, because no subjects
anywhere can simply feel comfortable with their own mode of enjoying.

[The very structure of enjoyment is such that we cannot experience it
directly: **when we experience enjoyment, we don\'t have it; it has
us**.]{.underline} [We experience our own enjoyment as an assault coming
from the outside that dominates our conscious intentions. This is why we
must fantasize our own enjoyment through the enjoying other. Compelled
by our enjoyment, we can\'t do otherwise; we act against our
self-interest and against our own good**. Enjoyment overwhelms the
subject**]{.underline}, even though the subject\'s mode of enjoying
marks what is most singular about the subject.

[Even though the encounter with the enjoying other apprehends the real
other through the apparatus of fantasy, this encounter is nonetheless
genuine and has an ethical status]{.underline}. Unlike the experience of
the nonexistent symbolic identity, which closes down the space in which
the real other might appear, [the fantasized encounter with the enjoying
other leaves this space open. By]{.underline} [allowing itself to be
disturbed by the other on the level of fantasy, the subject acknowledges
the singularity of the real other]{.underline}---its mode of enjoying
--- [without confining this singularity to a prescribed
identity.]{.underline}

[The implications of privileging the encounter with the disturbing
enjoyment of the real other over the assimilable symbolic identity are
themselves disturbing]{.underline}. [The tolerant attitude that never
allows itself to be jarred by the enjoying other becomes,]{.underline}
according to this way of seeing things, [further from really
encountering the real other than the attitude of hate and
mistrust.]{.underline} [The liberal subject who welcomes illegal
immigrants as fellow citizens completely shuts down the space for the
other in the real]{.underline}. [The immigrant as fellow citizen is not
the real other. The xenophobic conservative]{.underline}, on the other
hand, [constructs a fantasy that envisions the illegal immigrant awash
in a linguistic and cultural enjoyment that excludes natives. This
fantasy,]{.underline} paradoxicaly, [permits an encounter with the real
other that liberal tolerance forecloses]{.underline}. Of course,
xenophobes retreat from this encounter and from their own enjoyment, but
they do have an experience of it that liberals do not. [The tolerant
liberal is open to the other but eliminates the otherness, while the
xenophobic conservative is closed to the other but allows for the
otherness. The ethical position thus involves sustaining the liberal\'s
tolerance within the conservative\'s encounter with the real
other]{.underline}.

#### Embracing the drive presents the most meaningful act that the judge can endorse \-\-- the alternative's negativity exposes the compulsion to repeat traumatic loss and confronts social violence at its foundations

**McGowan 13** \[Todd, Associate Professor of Film and Television
Studies at the University of Vermont, *Enjoying What We Don't Have: The
Political Project of Psychoanalysis*, Symploke, University of Nebraska
Press (Lincoln, NE): 2013, p. 283-86\]

[There is no path leading from the death drive to utopia. The death
drive undermines every attempt to construct a utopia]{.underline}; it is
the enemy of the good society. [It is thus not surprising that political
thought from Plato onward has largely ignored this psychic force of
repetition and negation. But]{.underline} this does not mean that
psychoanalytic thought concerning the death drive has only a negative
value for political theorizing. [It is possible to conceive of a
**positive politics of the death drive**.]{.underline}

The previous chapters have attempted to lay out the political
implications of the death drive, and, on this basis, [we can sketch what
a society founded on a recognition of the death drive might look
like.]{.underline} Such a recognition would not involve a radical
transformation of society: [in one sense, it would leave everything as
it is. In contemporary social arrangements]{.underline}, the death
[drive subverts progress with repetition and leads to the widespread
sacrifice of self-interest for the enjoyment of the sacrifice itself.
This structure is impervious to change]{.underline} and to all attempts
at amelioration. [But]{.underline} in another sense, [the recognition of
the death drive would change everything.]{.underline} Recognizing the
centrality of the death drive would not eliminate the proclivity to
sacrifice for the sake of enjoyment, but it would change our
relationship to this sacrifice. Rather than being done for the sake of
an ultimate enjoyment to be achieved in the future, it would be done for
its own sake.

[The fundamental problem with the effort to escape the death drive and
pursue the good is that it leaves us unable to locate where our
enjoyment lies. By positing a future where we will attain the ultimate
enjoyment]{.underline} (either through the purchase of the perfect
commodity or through a transcendent romantic union or through the
attainment of some heavenly paradise), [we replace the partial enjoyment
of the death drive with the image of a complete enjoyment to
come.]{.underline} There is no question of fully enjoying our submission
to the death drive. [**We will always remain alienated from our mode of
enjoying**.]{.underline} As Adrian Johnston rightly points out,
\"Transgressively \'overcoming\' the impediments of the drives doesn\'t
enable one to simply enjoy enjoyment."1 [But we can transform our
relationship to the impediments that block the full realization of our
drive.]{.underline} We can see the impediments as the internal product
of the death drive rather than as an external limit.

[The enjoyment that the death drive provides, in contrast to the form of
enjoyment proffered by capitalism, religion, and utopian politics, is at
once infinite and limited.]{.underline} This oxymoronic form of
enjoyment operates in the way that the concept does in Hegel\'s *Logic.*
The concept attains its infinitude not through endless progress toward a
point that always remains beyond and out of reach but through including
the beyond as a beyond within itself. As Hegel puts it, \"The
universality of the concept is the *achieved beyond,* whereas that bad
infinity remains afflicted with a beyond which is unattainable but
remains a mere *progression* to infinity."2 That is to say, [the concept
transforms an external limit into an internal one and thereby becomes
both infinite and limited. The infinitude of the concept is nothing but
the concept\'s own self-limitation.]{.underline}

The enjoyment that the death drive produces also achieves its infinitude
through self-limitation. It revolves around a lost object that exists
only insofar as it is lost, and it relates to this object as the vehicle
for the infinite unfurling of its movement. The lost object operates as
the self-limitation of the death drive through which the drive produces
an infinite enjoyment. Rather than acting as a mark of the drive\'s
finitude, the limitation that the lost object introduces provides access
to infinity.

[A society founded on a recognition of the death drive would be one that
viewed its limitations as the source of its infinite enjoyment rather
than an obstacle to that enjoyment.]{.underline} To take the clearest
and most traumatic example in recent history, [the recognition of the
death drive in 1930s Germany would have conceived the figure of the Jew
not as the barrier to the ultimate enjoyment that must]{.underline}
therefore [be eliminated but as the internal limit through which German
society attained its enjoyment.]{.underline} As numerous theorists have
said, the appeal of Nazism lay in its ability to mobilize the enjoyment
of the average German through pointing out a threat to that enjoyment.
[The average German under Nazism could enjoy the figure of the Jew as it
appeared in the form of an obstacle, but it is possible to recognize the
obstacle not as an external limit but as an internal one.]{.underline}
In this way, [the figure of the Jew would become merely a figure for the
average German rather than a position embodied by actual
Jews. ]{.underline} Closer to home, [one would recognize the terrorist
as a figure representing the internal limit of global capitalist
society. Far from serving as an obstacle to the ultimate enjoyment in
that society, the terrorist provides a barrier where none otherwise
exists and]{.underline} thereby [serves as the vehicle through which
capitalist society attains its enjoyment. The absence of explicit
limitations within contemporary global capitalism necessitates such a
figure: if terrorists did not exist, global capitalist society would
have to invent them.]{.underline} [But recognizing the terrorist as the
internal limit of global capitalist society would mean the end of
terrorism. This recognition would transform the global landscape and
deprive would-be terrorists of the libidinal space within which to act.
Though some people may continue to blow up buildings, they would cease
to be terrorists in the way that we now understand the
term.]{.underline}

[A self-limiting society would still have real battles to
fight.]{.underline} There would remain a need for this society to defend
itself against external threats and against the cruelty of the natural
universe. Perhaps it would require nuclear weapons in space to defend
against comets or meteors that would threaten to wipe out human life on
the planet. But [it would cease positing the ultimate enjoyment in
vanquishing an external threat or surpassing a natural limit. The
external limit would no longer stand in for a repressed internal one.
Such a society would instead enjoy its own internal limitations and
merely address external limits as they came up.]{.underline}

[Psychoanalytic theory]{.underline} never preaches, and it [cannot help
us to construct a better society. But it can help us to **subtract the
illusion of the good from our own society**. **By depriving us of this
illusion, it has the ability to transform our thinking about
politics.**]{.underline} With the assistance of psychoanalytic thought,
we might reconceive politics in a direction completely opposed to that
articulated by Aristotle, to which I alluded in the introduction. In the
*Politics,* Aristotle asserts: \"Every state is a community of some
kind, and every community is established with a view to some good; for
everyone always acts in order to obtain that which they think good. But,
if all communities aim at some good, the state or political community,
which is the highest of all, and which embraces all the rest, aims at
good in a greater degree than any other, and at the highest good."3
Though later political thinkers have obviously departed from Aristotle
concerning the question of the content of the good society, [few have
thought of politics in terms opposed to the good. This is what
psychoanalytic thought introduces.]{.underline}

[If we act on the basis of enjoyment rather than the good, this does not
mean that we can simply construct a society that privileges enjoyment in
an overt way. An open society with no restrictions]{.underline} on
sexual activity, drug use, food consumption, or play in general [would
not be a more enjoyable one than our own. That is the sure path to
impoverishing our ability to enjoy]{.underline}, as the aftermath of the
1960s has made painfully clear. [One must arrive at enjoyment
indirectly. A society centered around the death drive would not be a
better society, nor would it entail less suffering. Rather than
continually sacrificing for the sake of the good, we would sacrifice the
good for the sake of enjoyment. A society centered around the death
drive would allow us to recognize that we enjoy the lost object only
insofar as it remains lost.]{.underline}

#### We don't need an alternative besides our framework of analysis -- the fantasy will reveal itself as long as we continue asking questions to expose their concealment of the lack -- in other words, it's your job to confuse and frustrate them via a refusal to partake in their politics

**Dean 6** \[Jodi, Professor of Political Science at Hobart and William
Smith Colleges, *Zizek's Politics,* Taylor & Francis: London and New
York, 2006, p. xvii-xx\]

By inserting popular culture into his writing, and himself into popular
culture, [Zizek enacts the way enjoyment colors or stains all thinking
and acting]{.underline}. What this means, as I set out in detail in
Chapter Three, is that [[there is a deep **nonrational** and **libidinal
nugget** in]{.mark} even [the **most rational**,]{.mark} **formal**
**[ways of thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Again, it is not simply that
popular culture is at the core of the theoretical enterprise of his
books---it is that enjoyment is. [Enjoyment is an unavoidable component
of any philosophical effor]{.underline}t (though many try to deny it).
Zizek thus emphasizes the inevitable stain on philosophy, on thought, as
[he tries to demonstrate a way of thinking that breaks with]{.underline}
(Zizek often uses Lacan\'s term traverses) [the fantasy of \"pure
reason.\"]{.underline}

This leads to another key element of Zizek\'s thought: [the possibility
of taking the position of the excess]{.underline}. As I explain in
discussions of his readings of St. Paul and Lenin, [Zizek theorizes
revolutionary politics as occurring through the occupation of this
excessive place]{.underline}. Paul endeavors to put the Christian
message to work, to establish new collectives beyond old oppositions
between Greeks and Jews. Lenin also breaks with the given, arguing
against all around him and against Marxist orthodoxy that the time for
revolution is now, that it cannot be predicted, awaited, but must be
accomplished with no assurances of success. Like Paul, he puts truth to
work, organizing it in the form of a revolutionary political Party.

Zizek emphasizes that [Lacan conceptualized this excessive place, this
place without guarantees, in his formula for \"the discourse of the
analyst]{.underline}\" (which I set out in Chapter Two[[). In
psycho-analysis, **the analyst just sits there, asking questions**
]{.mark}**from time to time**]{.underline}. [[She is some kind of object
or cipher onto which the analysand transfers love, desire, aggression,
and knowledge.]{.mark} The analysand]{.underline}, in other words,
proceeds through analysis by positing the analyst as someone who knows
exactly what is wrong with him and exactly what he should do to get rid
of his symptom and get better. [But, really, the analyst does not
know]{.underline}. Moreover, [[the analyst]{.mark} steadfastly
**[refuses to provide the analysand with any answers]{.mark}
whatsoever**]{.underline}. [[No ideals, no moral certainty, no goals, no
choices. Nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This is what makes the analyst
so traumatic]{.underline}]{.mark}, Zizek explains[, **[the fact that she
refuses to establish a law or set a limit]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[[that she does not function as some]{.mark} kind of [new
maste]{.mark}]{.underline}**[r]{.mark}.7 [Analysis is over when the
analysand accepts that the analyst does not know]{.underline}, [that
there is not any secret meaning or explanation]{.underline}, [and then
takes responsibility for getting on with his life]{.underline}. [The
challenge for the analysand]{.underline}, then, [is freedom,
autonomously determining]{.underline} his own [limits, directly
assuming]{.underline} his own [enjoyment]{.underline}. So, again, [the
position of the analyst is in this excessive place as an object through
which the analysand works through the analytical process]{.underline}.

[Why is the analyst necessary in the first place]{.underline}? If she is
not going to tell the analysand what to do, how he should be living,
then why does he not save his money, skip the whole process, and figure
out things for himself? There are two basic answers. First, [[the
analysand is not self-transparent]{.underline}. [He is a stranger to
himse]{.underline}]{.mark}[lf, a decentered agent \"struggling with a
foreign kernel]{.underline}.\"8 [[What is more likely than
self-understanding, is self-misunderstanding]{.underline}]{.mark}, that
is, [one\'s fundamental misperception of one\'s own
condition]{.underline}. **[[Becoming aware of this
misperception]{.mark}, grappling with it, [is the work of
analysis.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [Accordingly]{.mark}, second, **[[the
analyst is that external agent or position that gives a new form to our
activity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Saying]{.mark} [things]{.mark} out
loud, [presenting them to another]{.mark}, and [confronting them in
front of this external position concretizes]{.mark} and arranges [our
thoughts and activities in a different way,]{.mark} a way that is more
difficult to escape or avoid]{.underline}**. [The analyst then provides
a form through which we acquire a perspective on and a relation to our
selves]{.underline}.

Paul\'s Christian collectives and Lenin\'s revolutionary Party are, for
Zizek, similarly [formal arrangements]{.underline}, forms \"[for a new
type of knowledge linked to a collective political
subject]{.underline}.\"9 Each provides an external perspective on our
activities, [a way to concretize and organize our spontaneous
experiences]{.underline}. More strongly put, a political Party is
necessary precisely [**because [politics is not given; it does not
arise]{.mark} naturally or [organically]{.mark}** out of the
multiplicity of immanent flows and affects [**but has to be produced,
arranged, and constructed out of these flows in light of something
larger**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In my view, [when Zizek]{.underline} draws on popular culture and
[inserts himself into this culture, he is taking the position of an
object of enjoyment, an excessive object that cannot easily be
recuperated or assimilated. This **excessive position** is that of the
**analyst** as well as that of the **Party**]{.underline}. Reading Zizek
as occupying the position of the analyst tells us that [it is wrong
to]{.underline} expect Zizek to [tell us what to do, to provide an
ultimate solution or direction through which to solve all the world\'s
problems]{.underline}. [[The analyst]{.mark} does not provide the
analysand with ideals and goals]{.underline}; instead, [he [occupies the
place of an object in relation to which we work these out for
ourselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In adopting the position of the
analyst]{.underline}, [Zizek is also practicing what he refers to as
\"Bartleby politics,\" a politics [rooted in a kind of refusal wherein
the subject turns itself into a disruptive]{.mark}]{.underline} (of our
peace of mind!) [[violently passive object who says, \"I would prefer
not to.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}10 Thus, to my mind, [becoming preoccupied
with Zizek\'s style is like becoming preoccupied with what one\'s
analyst is wearing]{.underline}. [Why such a preoccupation]{.underline}?
How is this preoccupation enabling us to avoid confronting the truth of
our desire, our own investments in enjoyment? [How is complaining that
Zizek (or the analyst) will not tell us what to do a way that we avoid
trying to figure this out for ourselves]{.underline}?11

The main analytical task of these scholars has been to highlight the
contested and contingent ground upon which expertise is constructed and
exercised. Leander (2014) offers an excellent example of the
contestation and controversies over the production of expert knowledge
in the case of the 2013 Sarin gas attack in Syria. And scholars such as
Büger and Villumsen (2007) have shown repeatedly how ['facts' are
produced through a web of practices. The production
relates]{.underline}, for example[, to the network of peace researchers,
**US policy-makers**, **NATO officials and bureaucrats** that stabilised
the 'democratic peace thesis', or to the practice of quantification,
expert monitoring groups, and special advisors, which generate a
specific form of knowledge on piracy]{.underline} (Bueger 2015).
Similarly, a group of security scholars -- the so-called Paris School --
approaches security as a professional struggle between experts (the
managers of unease), who, through their bureaucratic, everyday practices
and routines, define what counts as insecurity (Bigo 2002; Huysmans
2006; Bigo and Tsoukala 2008). Whether drawing on the work of Bourdieu,
Foucault or Actor-Network Theory, the existing contributions tend either
to reduce security experts to the 'scientific knowledge' and tools
for'political interests' or to treat security experts as passive
deployers of security techniques. [This tendency is particularly present
in the many studies of security governance through risk.]{.underline}
Here, [the attention to **technologies that represent the tools** for
**generating 'objective' knowledge about risks** has not only pushed the
experts developing, proposing the use of, or applying the technologies
to the background, but has also directed the analytical lens primarily
towards the **production of bionic subject-positions of those being
'risk managed'**]{.underline}. Amoore and de Goede (2008, 9--10) call
the current **[usage of data-driven (surveillance)
technologies]{.underline}** to **[identify risky bodies and bodies at
risk]{.underline}**, **[the 'techno-expert deployment of
risk']{.underline}**. **[Biometric technologies are]{.underline}** the
prime example of **[the dominant mode of risk management]{.underline}**,
and they are used to illustrate how [the technologies, rather than
addressing the political subject, **govern bodies** with the aim of
controlling the future through enforcing the (political) status-quo in
the present]{.underline} (Bell 2006; Epstein 2008). But while experts
are not the focus of these analyses, the literature on
security-governance-through-risk contains an opening to ask new
questions about security experts. Critical risk scholars such as Aradau
and van Munster (2011) argue that **[governing through calculation and
management of the future]{.underline}** [has fostered public concern
about **unknowable, future catastrophes**, such as terrorism and natural
disasters]{.underline}. [This increasing focus on unknowable disasters
and worst-case scenarios, some scholars have suggested, **renders the
subject neurotic and anxious**]{.underline} (De Goede 2008; Walklate and
Mythen 2010; Fournier 2014). The neurotic subject was first discussed in
the context of risk by Isin, who draws on Freudian insights to account
for citizens' acceptance of the social effects of neoliberalism. Isin
(2004, 225--6) argues that [the subject called upon to adjust its
conduct in times of emerging risks is not 'a rational, calculating or
competent subject' but an affective subject that needs 'soothing,
appeasing and tranquillizing' to manage anxieties.]{.underline} [The
neurotic subject-citizen speaks and makes demands: It wants the
impossible (absolute security and safety) and is presented with new
solutions to manage its affects]{.underline} (ibid: 232). The critical
security contributions that find inspiration in Isin's work all locate
anxiety and neurosis at the level of the citizens who are being risk
managed and in juxtaposition to the experts and government officials
that mobilise these anxieties (Fournier 2014: 315--7; De Goede 2008;
Eklundh, Zevnik, and Guittet 2017). Charlotte Heath-Kelly (2018) has
taken an important initial step towards moving beyond the dichotomy
between experts who mobilise anxiety and the anxious subject. She
examines the role of anxiety among those experts and government
officials who are in a position of securitising issues and who practice
security towards various threat objects. With the change in focus, she
has also switched the psychoanalytic starting point from Freud to Lacan.
She introduces Lacan's divided (or split) subject and related concepts
such as drive, anxiety, enjoyment, and lack and applies them to the War
on Terror to understand the continuous invention of new threat objects
that occurs as soon as the old ones are destroyed (ibid.). Building on
Heath-Kelly's argument that [the subject repeatedly invents insecurities
to avoid confronting an ontological lack/insecurity]{.underline}, the
next section proposes to situate the subject in Lacan's most formalised
methodological matrix, his 'Four Discourses'. Lacan's Discourses do no
refer to specific content (e.g. legal, political, medical, etc.) but can
be understood as structuring different social bonds between the subject
and the social field, i.e. different modes of communication through
which the subject identifies. The following section introduces the
divided subject and develops an analytical strategy for approaching the
neurotic expert-subject through a particular social bond, Lacan's
discourse of the hysteric.

### Link -- Capitalism

#### Speculation of a growth-laden future abandons the idea of an endpoint and cedes the psyche to greed -- that culminates in a "bad infinite" which leaves the subject terminally dissatisfied

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 163-167, 20 September 2016,
MG)

[Any investment in capitalism]{.underline} as a system [demands an
investment in the **idea of constant expansion**. Capitalism maintains
its equilibrium not by sustaining a stable level of production but
through increasing production]{.underline}, without any notion of an end
to this increase. [When the capitalist system confronts]{.underline} an
obstacle (in the form, say, of [**a crisis**), the answer is always
increasing production]{.underline}. The future will necessarily be more
productive than the present, just as the present is more productive than
the past. Reversals can only be temporary.

[One finds an expression of the insistence on constant expansion in
almost every champion of capitalism.]{.underline} For instance, in his
history of finance, Niall Ferguson contends, "There have been great
reverses, contractions and dyings, to be sure. But not even the worst
has set us permanently back. Though the line of financial history has a
sawtooth quality, its trajectory is unquestionably upwards."9 Ferguson's
choice of the term upwards [conjures an image of **space exploration**
in order to continue the expansion after the Earth itself became
exhausted. **Thinking about capitalism requires the abandonment of the
possibility of an endpoint** or of a static point where relations of
production have completely stabilized.]{.underline}

[Capitalism has developed through an unprecedented growth of population,
income, and production. It both feeds this growth and feeds off
it]{.underline}. In The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective, Angus
Maddison provides a quantitative chronicle of this growth. He claims
that there was almost no growth in the first millennium of the modern
era and very little in the second before the development of capitalism.
But then a radical change takes place. After 1820---after capitalism
installs itself as the world's economic system---growth changes
exponentially. According to Maddison, "Since 1820, world development has
been much more dynamic. Per capita income rose more than eightfold,
population more than fivefold."10 This incredible rate of growth
relative to prior epochs of human history is not just a contingent fact
but rather the sine qua non of capitalism.

The need for population growth to accommodate the expansion of capital
leads even some defenders of capitalism to worry about the capacity of
the system to include the excess population that it fosters.11
[Capitalism demands an increasing population as both a labor force and a
consumption force, but it also requires that there be too many laborers
and too many consumers. Like capital itself, population expands to the
point of instability rather than stability. In every aspect of
capitalist society, expansion plays a central role because expansiveness
inheres in the idea of capitalist production.12 For most of its
champions, this is its great virtue; for many of its detractors, this is
its great defect]{.underline}. But no one disagrees that one cannot even
think the capitalist system without the idea that infinite expansion is
possible. To render capitalism finite would be to destroy it.13 On the
level of microeconomics, we can see the same requirement.

The idea of unending progress governs corporate behavior, investor
decisions, and consumer choices. It functions in all aspects of economic
planning within the capitalist system, from family budgets to the policy
decisions of international economic organizations. At no point can
anyone accept the possibility of stagnation or shrinkage. The worker
must earn more next year than this year; the company must predict more
growth next year; and the nation's gross domestic product must increase
next year. These demands stem from the structure of the capitalist
system, not from greedy individuals or corporations. [Greed for more is
integral to the process of growth and thus has a central place in this
system.14]{.underline}

[Though greed as a structural necessity brings with it many **psychic
difficulties**, the prominence of the bad infinity relieves capitalist
subjects of the burden of the true infinite. This **psychic relief** is
an essential part of capitalism's appeal. The bad infinite focuses the
subject on the future and the possibility of a form of satisfaction that
will **never be realized**]{.underline}. As capitalism was in its
nascent moments, Blaise Pascal considered why turning our attention to
the future would provide respite. He notes, ["the present is usually
painful. We hide it from our sight because it distresses us; and, if it
is agreeable, we regret seeing it slip away. We try to support it with
the future and think of arranging things we cannot control, for a time
we have no certainty of reaching."15]{.underline} Pascal reveals here
why we look to future accumulation rather than contenting ourselves with
what we have. He diagnoses the logic of capitalism. But Pascal's
description of the present nonetheless highlights the form of
satisfaction associated with the true infinite. It includes an awareness
of loss, whereas [the bad infinite associated with the future posits a
definite separation between the dissatisfaction of loss and the
experience of satisfaction.]{.underline}

[**Theoretical speculation about the goal of capitalist subjects**
inevitably invokes the **bad infinite**, even as the conception of this
goal undergoes significant changes]{.underline}. For classical
economists, subjects pursued wealth, whereas for neoclassical economists
they pursued the satisfaction of their needs. In both cases the point is
that the object is infinite. [I always require more wealth, and I always
have more needs to satisfy (or I can satisfy them more
fully).]{.underline} Even though neoclassical economists base their
calculations on needs, they assume that these needs are not finite.
[Though a particular desire is necessarily finite---I can only eat so
many packages of M&Ms--- desires themselves are not]{.underline}.

In this sense, the multitude of different desires solves the problem of
the finitude of particular wants. Our particular wants can reach a
saturation point, but another want will always emerge in its stead. In
his Principles of Economics, Alfred Marshall makes clear this basic
principle of capitalist economics. He says, "There is an endless variety
of wants, but there is still a limit to each separate want."16 Marshall
is able to grant some finitude within the economic structure, but the
bad infinite of perpetual increase trumps it. Particular wants are
finite; wants as such are infinite. Later, Marshall describes the
infinite of endless progress in more detail, noting, "On every side
further openings are sure to offer themselves, all of which will tend to
change the character of our social and industrial life, and to enable us
to turn to account vast stores of capital in providing new
gratifications and new ways of economizing effort by expending it in
anticipation of distant wants."17 [The capitalist subject will **never
attain full satisfaction** because it cannot satisfy or even anticipate
its "distant wants." The infinite of desire justifies the infinite of
production and consumption.]{.underline}

The infinite can even manifest itself within particular desires. If we
examine, for instance, the very particular desire for potato chips, the
infinite reappears in response to this limited desire. Capitalist
production continues to add new products---and aims to do so
infinitely---in order to expand this desire. Thus, the consumer can
choose from regular chips, wavy chips, sour cream and onion chips, wavy
sour cream and onion chips, and so on. Just when one imagines it's safe
to return to the supermarket without finding a new form of potato chip,
Lays invents the wavy, fat-free chip flavored with sea salt. Capitalism
has the capacity to transform an apparently limited desire into an
infinite one.

[The infinite does not only reside in different desires but also in the
**subject's overall project**. The project is infinite because its ideal
is clouded in obscurity. This obfuscation starts at the **beginning of
the attempt to understand capitalism** and continues without any
abatement today]{.underline}. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith
posits the existence of a "natural effort of every individual to better
his own condition."18 He assumes no limit to this process of betterment,
and the ambiguity of the terms better and condition makes it impossible
to say when the project might have reached its end. [This ambiguity
becomes exacerbated as the **theorizing about capitalism** and the
satisfaction it produces expands on and breaks from Smith's initial
account.]{.underline} Even when later theorists of capitalism reject
Smith's understanding of why people do what they do, they accept his
assumption of an infinite movement forward.19

#### Arguing on behalf of capitalism dooms them to inevitable dissatisfaction and trauma

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 222-224, 20 September 2016,
MG)

[Though within the capitalist universe we tend to think of scarcity as
the natural condition of humanity, many societies have existed on the
earth **without** this threat constantly hanging over them]{.underline}.
The original form of human society---the hunting and gathering
society---was a society of abundance that dealt with only occasional
bouts of scarcity rather than the constant threat that haunts us today.
1 The ease of finding food and shelter often allowed for a degree of
abundance absent among all but the extremely wealthy within capitalism.
But [once capitalism arises, the threat of scarcity becomes the
background against which exchange takes place.]{.underline}

[Capitalism **doesn't require that scarcity is real**---that there isn't
enough for everyone to have what they need to survive and find
satisfaction---but it does demand that the threat of scarcity be
credible. If subjects know that they can find an enjoyable life without
capitalist relations of production, they will have **no incentive** to
enter into these relations. Capitalism depends on the **subject's sense
of insecurity** and on the belief that an absence of plentiful resources
looms just around the corner]{.underline}. Living under capitalism means
living with this constant threat and thus in perpetual unease about
tomorrow. This is one of the lures with which capitalism seduces its
subjects.

Though we imagine that scarcity and insecurity are what we seek to
avoid, they actually provide an integral part of capitalism's appeal.
[When we exist in a state of perpetual insecurity or scarcity, we can
posit an **external obstacle---the source of our insecurity---as the
barrier to our satisfaction**. In this way, we avoid confronting the
internal obstacle that prevents complete satisfaction. By ensconcing us
in scarcity, capitalism enables us to avoid the trauma of an always
**partial satisfaction**.]{.underline}

One of the principal justifications for a capitalist economy is the
limited quantity of natural resources. The inequalities generated by the
market offer a way of dividing up the resources that the natural world
provides without recourse to physical violence.2 If the natural world
were abundant, there would be no need for capitalism's unflagging effort
to squeeze the maximum productivity out of labor for the least possible
cost. There would be no need for competition. [This is why all
proponents of capitalism presuppose scarcity. Without this
presupposition, the desire to accumulate would undergo a radical
transformation.3]{.underline}

The role that scarcity plays in capitalism becomes evident as capitalist
economists work out the variegations of the market. In his Principles of
Political Economy and Taxation, David Ricardo develops his version of a
labor theory of value and theorizes profit within the contours of this
theory. As he does so, he includes the assumption that "the laws of
nature...have limited the productive powers of the land."4 Ricardo never
develops a proof for natural scarcity, but simply asserts it as a given.
He refuses to countenance the possibility that the productive powers of
humanity might increase to such an extent that this natural scarcity,
even if it exists now, might be overcome. For him, natural scarcity must
have the status of an immutable law. This is a presupposition that he
shares with every other defender of capitalism. There are no
exceptions.5

[In fact, economics as a science only develops on the basis of scarcity.
It doesn't exist prior to the capitalist epoch, and its calculations
about human behavior depend on the idea that the world is not abundant
or plentiful.]{.underline}6 Economists can make mathematical
calculations about the functioning of markets because they know that
there are a limited number of resources that society must distribute. If
these resources were unlimited, economic equations would become
instantly incalculable. It would be as if one placed a zero in the
denominator of a fraction: division of resources only makes sense as
long as we have a finite amount to divide.

Capitalist economist Lionel Robbins, for one, claims straightforwardly
that scarcity is the sine qua non of economic science. He says, "Every
where we turn, if we choose one thing we must relinquish others which,
in different circumstances, we would not wish to have relinquished.
Scarcity of means to satisfy ends of varying importance is an almost
ubiquitous condition of human behaviour."7 If nature provided abundance
or society achieved it, there would be no struggle to allocate resources
and no need to distribute them unevenly. Capitalism would have no place
in the abundant world. In other words, if scarcity didn't exist,
capitalism would have to invent it. [And when scarcity begins to
disappear, capitalism does embark on the task of reinventing it over and
over again. **Arguing on behalf of capitalism requires an investment in
the inevitability of scarcity as an article of the
faith**.8]{.underline}

[But just as the defenders of capitalism cling to scarcity as an
absolute presupposition of existence, they also present **capitalism as
a solution to scarcity**. If we stick to its demands, capitalism will
lead us out of the desert of scarcity to the promised land of
abundance]{.underline}. As a solution to scarcity, capitalism's
investment in the promise becomes clear. [It is the promise of a
**better future** with no possibility for the fulfillment of that
promise]{.underline}. As far into the future as we can plan, resources
will be scarce, though we can imagine a time when they won't be.

This contradiction besets every attempt to champion the capitalist
future, but nowhere does it become as clear as in the thought of Deirdre
McCloskey. 9 McCloskey's project champions the virtues that capitalism
produces along with material wealth. In contrast to those who lament
capitalism's deleterious effect on morality, McCloskey highlights its
moral benefits and sees the malfeasance of investment bankers as a
betrayal of the capitalist ethic rather than its expression. Like
Ricardo, she emphasizes that "scarcity in your own life seems essential
for a real human life."10 [Without scarcity, we would cease to strive
and thereby cease to be virtuous.]{.underline}

### Link -- Climate Change

#### Climate politics represent a broad project of disavowal of the Real of capitalism that culminates in broad paranoia and eco-catastrophe

**Fletcher 18** (Robert Fletcher -- Environmental Anthropologist and
work in the Sociology of Development and Change group at Wageningen
University in the Netherlands , "Psychoanalysis and the GlObal",
University of Nebraska Press, Pages 69-71, 1 September 2018, MG)

Conclusion: [Enjoying Climate Change]{.underline}

What all of this suggests, from the psychoanalytic perspective explored
here, is that [climate politics increasingly represents a **glObal
effort to disavow** both the Real of capitalism as an economic system
riddled with internal contradictions that make it inherently unstable
unless continually expanding (Wilson 2014; Kapoor 2015) and the Real of
nature as both a finite source of inputs for this system and a sink for
its outputs whose fundamental limits have been exceeded (Stavrakakis
1997a). In this sense, the various forms of "**magical thinking"**
outlined earlier could be understood as different stages in the process
of disavowal]{.underline}. As Healy asks, "Could it be that [the
'post-politics' of **carbon markets** described by Swyngedouw, the
promises of an easy cure in the form of the **utopian city** described
by Davidson, and the denials issued by the **Heartland Institute**, are
simply a vacillation between admission and denial]{.underline}" (2014,
192), which is precisely what disavowal is about? In short, [the
neoliberal environmentalism increasingly dominating climate politics
might be seen, like neoliberalism in general, as "an increasingly
desperate struggle to hold reality together, against the traumatic
incursions of the Real of Capital"]{.underline} (Wilson 2014, 315).

[In response to this, the quintessential Lacanian injunction is to
encourage subjects to "traverse the fantasy."]{.underline} As Michael
Brearley summarizes this process, "the task of the ego (is) to wean
itself away from its early reliance on magical and wishful thinking and
painfully attempt to represent to itself what really is the case" (2013,
160). In the instance considered here, this would entail fully
acknowledging the Real of capitalism as a self-destructive system
driving us toward the brink of ecological catastrophe. And this, of
course, would require consciously confronting the pain resulting from
both loss of attachment to the capitalist society of enjoyment and
recognition of the environmental devastation this society has wrought to
break the cycle of melancholia and perversion. As Mishan asserted some
time ago, "[The psychic cost of such a move into recognition is the cost
of the move from the]{.underline} ~~paranoid-schizoid~~ [toward the
depressive position. The cost is the **psychic pain of guilt** at damage
done, and the necessity of mourning of our grandiose fantasy of
self-sufficiency and immortality. Without such a move we risk
**eco-catastrophe**, because we cannot assess the true threat" (1996,
65). Or as Healy puts it, we need to experience "a kind of hitting
bottom in our relation to oil addiction as a precondition for moving
beyond it" (2014, 193).]{.underline}

More than a lack of practicable alternatives, in other words, [it may be
our unconscious attachment to the contemporary capitalist order despite
our expressed desire to transcend (or at least substantially transform)
it that helps to hold it in place, raising the sobering prospect that
many of us may not be nearly as willing to make the dramatic changes we
know are necessary to develop a just and sustainable world as we would
like to believe (see chapter 4]{.underline}). From the psychoanalytic
perspective advanced in this chapter, achieving effective change
requires generating the desire for attachment to a new situation
sufficient to motivate subjects to face the pain of and then undergo the
process of mourning necessary to break attachment to present
circumstances. As Margaret Rustin phrases this dilemma, "Moving out of
the ~~paranoidschizoid~~ into more depressive ways of thinking and
feeling can be found too painful to endure, if there are no internalized
good objects to sustain a belief in the existence of good objects
outside the self" (2013, 175). [Yet if this new desire is merely for
further unfulfillable fantasies, then **nothing will have been gained**.
Hence, the aim must be to mobilize novel forms of "postfantasmatic
enjoyment" capable of traversing fantasy and accepting the impossibility
of either achieving or escaping jouissance (Byrne and Healy
2006)]{.underline}. Žižek (2010) suggests that this requires moving
through Kübler-Ross's (1969) classic stages of grief from denial through
anger, bargaining, depression, and finally to full acceptance.

Herein lies the crux of our present predicament. [Assessments of our
environmental problems overwhelmingly tend to envision an **apocalyptic
future** in which depletion of natural resources will lead to either
fierce competition for, or strict rationing of, what is left---a
perspective that Swyngedouw (2010) evocatively calls forecasting
"apocalypse forever." Both situations are generally depicted as quite
grim and pleasure-less. It is difficult for even those of us gravely
concerned by ecological degradation and highly motivated to address it
to be inspired by such prospects, particularly when this entails
**giving up a lifestyle** that does in fact provide the promise (if not
achievement) of jouissance in myriad forms]{.underline}. And so while we
may in fact claim that we desire the dramatic change we know is needed,
we may secretly fear this change as well, engaging in our own disavowal
concerning the depth of our commitment to the cause. Thus, Renee Aron
Lertzman highlights "[the power of **unconscious desires**: that we may
in fact want our cars and cheap flights and also want to avoid global
climate-induced catastrophes" (2013, 120), generating a deep-seated
ambivalence toward the change we (half-)know is needed.]{.underline}

### Link -- Cyber 

#### The deeming of "threats" to cyberspace speaks on behalf of the master signifier which designates the Other to discriminate against while preserving our own "liberal values"

Reading China as the symptom of the (impossible) US cyber defence

[The symptomal reading of the US cyber defence community comes in two
steps. First, it engages in a discursive reading of the community's
self-representation as well as **representations of the object** that
prevents the community from reaching its 'true potential'.]{.underline}
The second step examines the displacement of 'truths'. Let me start with
the first reading.

The Office of the US Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)'s annual
Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community as well as
[the US Department of Defense Cyber Strategy are the authoritative
documents for determining **what counts as threats to the United**
States and what national security looks like. Those in the US cyber
defence community who speak through these documents speak **on behalf of
the master signifier**: Whatever is proclaimed as threatening in these
documents has the status of truth, and they give meaning and clear
direction to a broader system of signification, namely national security
politics in cyberspace]{.underline}. The documents, in short, fixate
what the US cyber defence community is defending and what it is
defending against.

The 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy allows, for example, a clear representation
of the American self, which the DoD is tasked to protect in cyberspace:

[The United States is committed to an open, secure, interoperable, and
reliable Internet that enables prosperity, public safety, and the free
flow of commerce and ideas. These qualities of the Internet reflect core
American values -- of freedom of expression and privacy, creativity,
opportunity, and innovation. And these qualities have allowed the
Internet to provide social and economic value to billions of
people.58]{.underline}

[Through (Lacanian) discourse analytical lenses, the Internet emerges as
that which **enables the United States to be who it really is: free,
creative, opportunistic, and prosperous**]{.underline}. The United
States is altruistic, a global force of good that brings social and
economic well-being to billions of people. The document further links
the United States, or particularly the DoD, to transparency and
restraint: '[We're going to execute our mission while being as
transparent as possible, because that's also who we are.' 59 And
similarly, in the DoD Cyber Strategy: '\[T\]]{.underline}he United
States will always conduct cyber operations under a doctrine of
restraint ... and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.' 60

[Officially, the US military **implements these values**]{.underline}.
Pentagon's use of cyber weapons against ISIL in Syria and Iraq
illustrates the attempt to be transparent and show restraint.61 Here,
the Pentagon went public and announced that it 'dropped cyberbombs' in
the attempt to disrupt propaganda, command and control servers, as well
as payment of fighters. Not only did this decision signal openness, it
also signalled restraint: instead of exploiting the anonymous potential
of cyberspace to maintain deniability, the United States showed through
its actions that it follows the Laws of Armed Conflict -- specifically
the principles of proportionality and distinction.62 Officials cited by
the Washington Post emphasised, for example, that commanders could
choose cyberattacks only when it reduced the odds of civilian
casualties.63

[Yet, the US threat assessments clearly indicate that US cyber defence
has **not been successful in defending the nation in cyberspace**.64 And
as the rest of the section shows, the cyber threats from China are
articulated as that which prevents the United States from being able to
fully enjoy the 'core American values' it represents and promotes in
cyberspace. In the Lacanian vocabulary, **the US cyber defence
community's representation of China echoes the subject's attempt to
conceal its dividedness** by inventing a fantasmatic object that
prevents it from enjoying a 'whole' secure identity. In other words,
'China in cyberspace' emerges as a central fantasy figure who steals our
enjoyment by transgressing the legal and normative restraints that bound
the US cyber defence. Chinese transgressions of the values promoted by
the United States in cyberspace give the US cyber defence an excuse for
why it fails to bring security to an open, free and prosperous
cyberspace.]{.underline}

In the US threat assessments, China appears to be among the states
'shaken by the role the Internet has played in political instability',
which is why it pursues a different model for governing the Internet --
a model that involves technological measures to control content in the
name of political stability.65 This model of state-centric content
control threatens to undermine 'our policy goals, particularly those to
protect freedom of expression and the free flow of online information
and ensure a free marketplace for information technology products and
services'. 66 The Chinese government's ambition of political stability
-- that is, the consolidation of power through prioritising economic
growth and military preparedness -- is also articulated as the
background for the threat from excessive cyber-enabled Chinese
intellectual property theft.67 To the US defence, Chinese economic cyber
espionage transgresses the rules promoted by the United States with
regard to economic competition between states, and is articulated as a
serious national security concern: Everything of value flows to China;
it is 'the biggest transfer of wealth in history' as then Director of
the NSA and commander of the US Cyber Command, General Keith Alexander
famously proclaimed.68 And 'China in cyberspace' is a threat object that
takes on additional meanings, for example, when it is further
articulated in less official sources.

[The 'real scary part']{.underline} of the Chinese content control, as a
US Army Officer underlined in an interview, [is **not simply the
filtering of content**: state ownership, control of service providers,
and constant technological optimisation]{.underline} allow the Chinese
government to surveil and identify all users, and in so doing create a
constant risk of punishment, which leads to self-censorship. 'This is
the real power of the Chinese domestic cyber policy', the Officer
stated, and further emphasised that: '\[It\] ends up making people want
what the government wants.' Such homogenisation is not only the ultimate
form for regime stability but it transgresses the core US principle of
protecting the privacy of the individual as well. Homogenisation is also
tied to another threat from China in cyberspace: the threat from
patriotic hackers.

When a state enjoys full obedience from its citizens, it is threatening
because it allows for hackers with no clear connection to the Chinese
government to pursue the government interests while offering 'plausible
deniability'. 69 This obfuscates the international legal distinction
between state and private responsibility promoted by the United States.
'In Chinese society, independence from government direction and control
does not carry with it the idea of separation from the state', as former
US Army linguist Scott J. Henderson has underlined when discussing the
opaque connection between Chinese hackers and the government.70 And
because the Chinese government is believed to exert implicit power over
loyal, patriotic hackers, as Colonel Jayson M. Spade suggests, it is
sufficient for the Chinese government to organise 'hacking competitions
to encourage hackers to develop CNE \[cyber espionage\] techniques and
software'. 71 In other words, in the US defence articulation, there
seems to be something within the Chinese subject that makes it prone to
fulfilling the will of the government. While Spade also identifies
concerns in the Chinese government over potential negative implications
of patriotic hacking, an influential RAND report written for the Office
of the Secretary of Defense on the Chinese Military concludes that the
Chinese government, if worried about negative consequences, simply gives
indirect orders to the patriotic hackers through 'unsigned editorials'
in the state-run media.72

[In short, the US cyber defence community represents **China's behaviour
in cyberspace as a threat that transgresses the values and norms the
United States officially follows and promotes**. China is everything the
United States is not. The Chinese government has an omnipresent gaze,
enabled by excessive use of surveillance techniques and censorship,
which challenges and violates the respect for and protection of freedom
of expression and privacy that the United States promotes
online]{.underline}. The Great Firewall represents to the US cyber
defence community an attempt to secure the power of the Chinese
government and the United States seeks to secure liberal values for all
in cyberspace. Thus, Chinese government's primary interest in
consolidating its own centralised power by draining the economic power
of others through cyber theft of intellectual property undermines the
United States' official ambition of becoming the global force for good
that brings economic prosperity to billions all over the world. [Lastly,
the opaque Chinese government/patriotic hacker relationship is a
transgression of the idea of a transparent and lawabiding state that the
United States publicly promotes and defends.]{.underline}

### Link -- Cyber (China)

#### Fantasizing about a China threat in cyberspace is a move towards an infinite and impossible fantasy rooted in the logic of transgression

**Jacobson 20** (Jeppe T. Jacobson - Assistant Professor at the
Institute for Military Technology, Royal Danish Defence College, "Lacan
in the US cyber defence: Between public discourse and transgressive
practice", Review of International Studies, 20 March 2020,
<https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-international-studies/article/abs/lacan-in-the-us-cyber-defence-between-public-discourse-and-transgressive-practice/38646AE140D77651862DCD1683BFBF35>,
MG)

[First, 'China in cyberspace' displaces the fact that there are more
uncomfortable and disavowed 'truths' about the cyberspace politics in
the United States, 'truths' that are **pushed to the margins of the US
cyber defence discourse**]{.underline}. Prior to the Snowden
revelations, this was, for example, the fact that American privacy
online is under pressure, not only from Facebook but also from the
intelligence agencies' attempt to prevent terrorism. Similarly, [one can
detect a process of **displacement** in relation to the fact that the
United States' pursuit of military superiority in cyberspace involves
exploiting vulnerabilities in IT systems used by Americans as well as
allies, which ultimately reproduces an environment that is technically
insecure]{.underline}. Pushed to the margins by the Chinese fantasy is
also the fact that [the US cyber defence community itself is **riddled
with tensions**, for example, over funding or who should have authority
over the US cyber capabilities -- that is, whether to use software
exploits (cyber weapons) for intelligence (NSA) or military (US Cyber
Command) purposes. Thus, 'China in cyberspace' is a **symptom of more
fundamental tensions**. It plays a role as the object that **prevents
the US cyber defence community from confronting the fact that it is
neither defending cyberspace nor is a homogenous whole**. In other
words, China is not only our other, it is that which enable us to keep
the illusion that we are a 'whole' American self, and that which allows
us to identify with this self. It prevents the US cyber defence
community from confronting the fact that the very social field it
represents is structured around an impossibility -- that **fulfilling a
fantasy does not deliver the enjoyment it promises.**]{.underline}

Second, the displacement is supported by a condensation: the Chinese
cyber threat takes on contradictory features. While more 'traditional'
discourse analyses would see such inconsistencies as evidence of a less
stable discourse,73 the symptomal reading draws the opposite conclusion.
It was noted above, how the Chinese government through its Great
Firewall is perceived to exert total control over its citizens and how
the government enjoys total homogenisation with these subjects. Yet, it
is also commonly understood among members of the US cyber defence
community that the technical restrictions deployed by Chinese government
authorities are easily circumvented by Chinese netizens and that the
general level of cybersecurity in China is low. This is illustrated, for
example, by a US Cyber Command official who explained in an interview
that the NSA with ease had penetrated networks in Chinese universities,
mobile phones, fibre-optic cables and servers controlled by the Chinese
government, and second, by an official US policy that invests millions
of dollars in technologies to promote freedom online, including tools
for citizens to circumvent censorship regimes.74

[According to the logic of condensation, the perception of the
weaknesses of Chinese cybersecurity **exacerbates**, rather than dampens
the perception of China as a threat]{.underline}. In an interview, a US
official working with cyber defence policy worried that the insufficient
Chinese cybersecurity allows other groups to route their cyberattacks
through Chinese networks, while permitting China to deny responsibility
for any hostile cyber activity with reference to a possible third party
having penetrated its IT infrastructure. [In other words, China is
**both a cyber superpower and cybersecurity novice** -- and threatening
for both reasons. However, what hold these conflicting narratives
together is what they have in common. In both cases, the Chinese
government enjoys what the US cyber defence community cannot have:
plausible deniability due to poor cybersecurity and totalitarian control
with its citizens. This is the role of condensation.]{.underline}

[Importantly, while China is a symptom that displaces other more
fundamental 'truths', **these 'truths' return**. Thus, the]{.underline}
Snowden [revelations symbolise 'a return of the]{.underline} repressed'.
Snowden and other whistleblowers revealed how [the US cyber defence
**community is not simply defending a unified United States from Chinese
threats** from cyberspace but is conducting excessive surveillance and
cyber exploitation]{.underline} practices; as will be elaborated in the
following, [the US cyber defence entities undermine global network
security, collect data on its own citizens, and bribe private companies
to share more user data than necessary -- and they lie to Congress about
it. As I will argue, these transgressive practices should **not be
understood as being detached from the official US cyber defence
discourse** characterised by restraint, transparency and clarity, but as
constitutive hereof. **Transgression is closely connected to the
fantasmatic distinction** between an idealised harmonious self and the
Chinese symptom]{.underline}. The last section elaborates this claim by
extracting the kernel of enjoyment that work to sustain the US cyber
defence discourse.

### Link -- Cyber threats 

#### Their understanding of "cyber threats" produces neurotic subjects, to be sacrificed on the alter of the cult of policy expertise.

[The goals of security policy experts]{.underline} -- a term used
collectively here to describe independent consultants and think tankers
that produce policy recommendations and advise the US Administration --
[keep shifting]{.underline}. [A case in point is the extensive policy
discussion on cyber deterrence. **Improving deterrence of cyberattacks**
against the US has been a recommendation put forward by task forces and
commissions at regular intervals during the Obama
Administration]{.underline} (National Research Council 2010; CSIS 2017;
DSB 2013; DSB. 2017). The Administration's [attempts to accommodate
these recommendations have invariably been met by new and different sets
of proposals and demands, and a reluctance on the part of experts in the
cyber community to stand by previous policy proposals]{.underline}. By
way of a brief summary, elaborated further in the body of this article:
[Before 2010, policy experts called for more offensive cyber
capabilities to ensure a cyber deterrence posture. Around the time that
the Administration provided these capabilities, the cyber deterrence
problem ceased to be attributed to a cyber capability problem and was
now thought to result from a lack of signalling]{.underline}. [Shortly
thereafter, the Administration responded by signalling a willingness to
respond strongly to cyberattacks, at which point the expert community
began calling instead for resilience in both civilian and military US
networks to achieve cyber deterrence. This demand for cyber resilience
was put forward in such vague terms that it is impossible to determine
when it is achieved.]{.underline} The dependency on increasingly complex
socio-technical systems in contemporary society has rendered reliance on
experts unavoidable. And [with their rise to ubiquity in policy circles,
expertise has also become a frequent object of study in social
sciences]{.underline}. In critical security studies, the sociological
approaches have been particularly attuned to the study of expertise.
Within this field, security scholars have focused largely on how the
[everyday practices of professional experts play a role in categorising
what constitutes an insecurity -- and ultimately, in (re)producing
particular 'regimes of truth']{.underline} (Bigo 2002; Berling and
Bueger 2015). In so doing, [these contributions see experts as the
embodiments of specific forms of knowledge that is practised or
articulated as part of a dominant rationality of government]{.underline}
(or dispositif or field). This article introduces a strategy for
studying security policy experts that does not reduce the expert to the
embodiment of a knowledge regime or a tool for political interests. It
suggests that [paying attention to how the expert subject identifies
with and performs its role as an expert vis-à-vis the government that
takes policy decisions, advances our understanding of the **expert's
role in reproducing insecurities**]{.underline}. The article takes its
cue from the writings of those critical security scholars that show how
[today's risk governance has led to increasing public awareness and
general concerns in society about unpredictable and catastrophic
events]{.underline} (Aradau and van Munster 2011; Aradau, Lobo-Guerrero,
and van Munster 2008). Such **[concerns about
uncertainty]{.underline}**, the critical security scholars argue,
[have]{.underline} not only [led to the government introducing
**precautionary and pre-emptive strategies** for governing security but
has also **given rise to anxious and neurotic subjects**]{.underline}
(De Goede 2008; Walklate and Mythen 2010; Eklundh, Zevnik, and Guittet
2017). Scholarly contributions within this field have so far almost
exclusively diagnosed the neurotic subject among citizens being
governed. In fact, the neurotic subject is treated somewhat disconnected
from or even juxtaposed to the experts that implement or propose the
current security governing strategies and thus can be said to mobilise
collective anxieties (Fournier 2014). Experts are, apparently,
unaffected by anxieties about future uncertainties. This article extends
the notion of the neurotic subject to the expert, and asks: [How does a
reading of the expert as a neurotic subject advance the way we study the
reproduction of insecurities?]{.underline} For answering this question,
the Freudian-inspired work on the neurotic citizen by Isin (2004), which
is the main inspiration for the above-mentioned turn to anxiety and
neurosis in the risk literature, is a useful stepping-stone. However,
the article switches the theoretical point of departure from Freud to
Jacques Lacan -- the latter of which enjoys increasing attention in
critical security studies recently (Mandelbaum 2016; Heath-Kelly 2018;
Danil 2018; Eberle 2019). To date, the [Lacanian contributions within
this literature have generally introduced Lacan's notion of the divided
subject -- and one or a few concepts related to it -- to extend the
analytical power of existing critical security and IR
approaches]{.underline} (Epstein 2011). However, Lacan offers a --
largely unexplored1 -- systematic strategy for locating and studying the
divided subject in different social relations, his matrix of the 'Four
Discourses' (Lacan 1998, 2007). The article zooms in on one of the four
discourses, Lacan's discourse of the hysteric, introducing it as an
analytical strategy for studying policy experts as neurotic subjects.
Lacan defines the Four Discourses as abstract ways to structure our
communication and identification. The Hysteric Discourse, one of the
four discourses, is a social bond where a neurotic subject constantly
protests and demands that an 'other', in the position of the master
signifier, delivers what the subject desires (for example, absolute
security) (Fink 1995, 129--37). The article focuses on US policy experts
in the field of cyber defence.2 [US cyber defence is as an apt case
study not only because 'cyber' is officially considered the biggest
threat to US national security, but also because **cyberspace is
articulated in the US** as an **uncertain**, **unpredictable** and
**insecure domain** where governments rely on assistance from outside
experts to solve problems]{.underline} (Dunn Cavelty 2013; Hansen and
Nissenbaum 2009). [As the **neurotic subject** is likely to **emerge
from uncertainty** and as experts hold a privileged position in the
cyber policy debate, the social bond between the US cyber defence
experts and the government is an ideal case for examining the expert as
a neurotic subject that communicates through the Hysteric Discourse as
well as what it means for the **reproduction of
insecurity**.]{.underline} Through the case study of the US cyber policy
experts, the article contributes to the emerging body of critical
security studies on experts. It introduces a Lacanian-inspired hysteric
strategy for advancing the analysis of security experts. First, the
article locates the drifting of desire in the public expert documents on
cyber deterrence and argues that [the **US cyber policy experts'**
**ever-evolving and ultimately elusive demands** are illustrative of a
**desire for a desire unfulfilled**, which **reproduces cyber
insecurity** as a national defence priority.]{.underline} And second,
the article shows that [the social bond between the cyber policy expert
subject and the US government is sustained -- despite the former taking
up employment in the executive branch -- by the subject pushing the
object of desire in front of it to the point of ultimately returning to
the position as outside experts.]{.underline} Together, the two readings
illustrate a critical security strategy for studying the reproduction of
insecurity through the experts' neurotic identification as experts.

### Link -- Cyber policy

#### The affirmative's demand for government cyber policies to strengthen cyber \[deterrence/defense/resilience\] is a neurotic relationship to both the government and cyberthreats, [BUT]{.underline}, the object of desire is [always out of reach]{.underline} -- their inability to confront their desire makes their impacts inevitable by reproducing cyber as a security threat.

for ableist language

[Experts supposedly offer impartially and evidence-based knowledge and
lay out possible ways forward]{.underline}. Experts are not enmeshed in
normative partisan politics. At least, US think tanks emerged in the
beginning of the 20th century on this foundation (Rich 2004, 34--41).
Traces of this ideal still exist, although there are clear political
divisions across US think tanks today (Abelson 2018). [In]{.underline}
the ongoing **[policy debates]{.underline}** [on how to defend the
nation in cyberspace, non-partisan task forces and commissions put
forward policy recommendations based on their 'objective' assessment of
the nature of cyberspace and the actors acting within it. One of the
**most iterated recommendations** **revolves around how to achieve
credible cyber deterrence.**]{.underline} Yet, the next subsection
reviews the [policy recommendations related to]{.underline} cyber
deterrence made by commissions and task forces during the Obama
Administration and in doing so, challenges the idea of [experts as
nothing but the embodiments of a dominant knowledge regime]{.underline}.
The first subsection reads [the **relationship between policy expert and
government** as a **hysteric social bond** where **cyber deterrence is
kept out of reach** by **constantly changing demands** or **demands that
are articulated so vaguely** that they are impossible for the government
to meet]{.underline}. The second subsection analyses the [US cyber
policy experts' entry into the government]{.underline} as a break with
the hysteric social bond that [risks forcing the neurotic subject to
confront its own desire, but it shows that such a move is accompanied by
a constant reinvention of excuses as to why the expert-turned-master is
unable to provide the cyber defence it is responsible for]{.underline},
ultimately [leading to a definition of the object of desire as that
which the subject cannot currently do: criticise and make
demands]{.underline}. In this way, [the hysteric social bond between
experts who reproduce insecurities through demands for policy change and
a government that seeks to accommodate these demands is
sustained.]{.underline} The desire for a desire unfulfilled At the end
of 2008, [the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)
brought together policy experts to develop cybersecurity recommendation
for the incoming president. Under the headline 'Military Doctrine and
Deterrence', the commission report emphasised the importance of 'the
need for a credible military presence in cyberspace to provide a
deterrent against potential attackers']{.underline} (CSIS 2008, 24).
**[The following quote]{.underline}** from the report, however[, calls
in to question the commission's own recommendation:]{.underline}

> [Deterrence in cyberspace is particularly complicated because of the
> problems with attribution and identification. If a country does not
> know who is attacking, it is difficult to create appropriate and
> proportionate responses in ways that reduce the chance of escalation.
> A signal that a country is contemplating a response that goes to all
> potential attackers will not deter and could actually create more
> conflict]{.underline} (ibid.: 26).

In short, [**if the attacker is not attributable** and hence does not
fear retaliation, then **even the most potent cyber military is
superfluous.**]{.underline} [To make a policy recommendation and in the
same breath call into question the soundness of this policy is a
**hysteric communication par excellence**. It **avoids the anxiety**
that **emerges when the specific object of desire** (**offensive
military capabilities**) **is achieved by already introducing a new
object of desire (better attribution).**]{.underline} Tellingly, [the
Administration's decision to establish the US Cyber Command, the cyber
branch of the US military, was immediately criticised as
insufficient]{.underline}. CSIS director James Lewis underlined, for
example, that 'the U.S. is widely recognized to have pre-eminent
offensive cyber capabilities, but it obtains little or no deterrent
effect from this' (cited in Markoff, Sanger, and Shanker 2010). In other
words, the government should do a better job defending against and
identifying the culprits in cyberspace. Then Deputy Secretary of
Defense, William J. Lynn III was ready with a plan for improving cyber
defence capacities. Presenting the Department's cyber strategy, Lynn
underlined that '\[US cyber\] deterrence will necessarily be based more
on denying any benefit to attackers than on imposing costs through
retaliation' (Lynn III 2010, 99--100). The [newfound priority of cyber
defence did not appear to reassure the expert subject.]{.underline} As a
case in point, [the National Research Council (NRC) hosted a 2010
workshop with policy experts on cyber deterrence]{.underline}. And
shortly after, [the independent Defense Science Board (DSB) created a
task force on Resilient Military System and the Advanced Cyber Threat to
provide recommendations on how to maintain deterrence in the cyber era.
Neither the NRC workshop nor the DSB report found offensive cyber
capabilities or cyber defence to be the solution to the cyber deterrence
problem]{.underline}. Instead, **[the desired object had drifted
along:]{.underline}** **[Now, the Administration needs to clearly
articulate the willingness and the capacity to respond to cyberattacks
not only with cyber weapons but with all available tools -- ultimately
nuclear weapons]{.underline}** (DSB 2013: 15; Rosenzweig 2010, 247).
Articulating the willingness to respond to cyberattacks with any means
was first introduced by the Obama Administration in the 2011
International Strategy for Cyberspace and subsequently iterated in both
the Department of Defense (2015) Cyber Strategy as well as in a White
House cyber deterrence white paper of late 2015 (Obama 2011: 14;
Department of Defense 2015: 11; Otto 2015). However, [as is prototypical
in a hysteric social bond, **getting close to the object of desire** --
that is, **having more steadfast articulations about the willingness to
retaliate** -- **causes anxiety that prompts a slide towards a new
object of desire.** In this case, manifesting in a redefinition of the
meaning of cyber deterrence. Two subsequent commission reports on cyber
deterrence]{.underline}, namely the CSIS cyber recommendations to
President Trump and the 2017 DSB follow-up report on cyber deterrence
(CSIS 2017a; DSB. 2017), [no longer focused only on large-scale
cyberattacks against the US critical infrastructures as that which
needed to be deterred]{.underline}. **[In fact,]{.underline}** [the
**government's cyber deterrence's efforts** including the articulation
of a willingness to respond with all means necessary **seemed to have
worked, as no serious**,]{.underline} ~~crippling~~ [\[devastating\]
**cyberattacks against US critical infrastructures had taken place --
despite the experts' continuous criticisms of US national cyber
insecurity**]{.underline}. What the US did not prevent, however, was
economic cyber espionage and minor, non-destructive disturbances of
public and private networks. [Thus, in the new commission reports, the
anxiety over such malicious cyber activity was now included as that
which needed to be deterred]{.underline}. Once again, **[anxiety pushes
desire along]{.underline}**, now in the form of a desire for better
defining a proportional response to cyberattacks on private entities and
economic espionage. [This drift to better declaratory policy also offers
an explanation as to why the government -- when it finally delivered on
the previous demand for better attribution -- failed to satisfy the
expert's desire for cyber deterrence]{.underline}. In 2014, the US
successfully attributed and indicted Chinese government hackers for
commercial cyber espionage, but as the expert's desire for cyber
deterrence now involved a desire for a strong national security response
to cyber espionage, the US government's attributions only reinforced the
demands for economic sanctions (Nakashima 2015). In short, [as soon as
the government delivers, the expert subject's desire shifts, from
offensive military capabilities in cyberspace to better attribution, to
an articulation of willingness to respond, and most recently, to the
need to define proportional responses to non-military cyber activity.
With the drift, the cyber threat continues as a pertinent national
security challenge -- to which the solution remains always just out of
reach.]{.underline} Yet, [the constant drift in the object of desire is
only one manifestation of a hysteric social bond. Another is a **demand
for the unachievable**]{.underline}. [One of the policy recommendations
that seems most persistent is cyber resilience]{.underline}: The 2013
DSB report demanded investments in resilient systems to ensure a
'survivable strike capability' (DSB 2013, 41), which was reinvented as
the demand for resilient 'thin line strike capabilities' in the 2017 DSB
report (2017, 17--8). And both the 2008 and 2017 CSIS report (2008: 27;
2017a: 6), and the NRC workshop proceedings (Rosenzweig 2010, 256) call
for more cyber resilience initiatives. As an element in a hysteric
social bond, [the persistent demand for resilience ties to the **lack of
clarity that accompanies this policy recommendation**]{.underline}. [The
same reports that call upon the Administration to implement
resilience-building measures, call into question the feasibility of
resilience.]{.underline} The DSB. (2017: 4, 10) underlines that the
Internet of Things 'will only exacerbate an already tenuous posture and
make defense even more challenging in the coming years', and
consequently that 'offensive cyber capabilities continue to grow and are
likely to outpace cyber defense and resilience'. The CSIS (2017a, 6) is
equally sceptical: 'While there have been good advances in the network
protections of leading defence contractors, this has only encouraged
opponents to become more inventive and more persistent'. [The assessment
that resilience in cyberspace is unfeasible is understandable.
Resilience is defined as 'the ability to provide acceptable operations
despite disruption: natural or manmade, inadvertent or
deliberate']{.underline} (DSB 2013, 2). But [when is something
'acceptable'? And, how do you determine whether resilience efforts are
deterring the adversary? These questions remind unanswered.]{.underline}
The critical risk literature has explained how resilience, along with
precaution, premediation and imagination are styles of reasoning that
have come to dominate security governance, for example, in the response
to terrorism or natural disasters (Aradau and van Munster 2011). As the
above has shown, this also applies to cyberspace; however, reading the
expert subject's call for cyber deterrence through the hysteric social
bond reveals the shortcomings of reducing the expert to the provider of
security techniques such as resilience. [Truly embracing risk or
uncertainty management would force expert subjects at least to recognise
the need to discuss what 'acceptable' levels of cyber risks and
'resilient enough' look like. The lack of attention given to questions
such as these suggests that the expert subject occupies a social
position not simply for managing cyber risks and uncertainties but where
identification takes place through making demands that keep the space
for criticism open.]{.underline} With reference to uncertainty, [the
expert subject can **always insist that current strategies do not
sufficiently manage the cyber insecurities**, **keep the confrontation
with its desire at a distance,** and ultimately **reproduce 'cyber' as a
national insecurity**]{.underline}. The first part of the case study
showed how a hysteric social bond can be applied as a reading strategy
in security studies. Through the analyses above, the article suggests
that **[by identifying the expert subject's object of desire, it becomes
possible to show how experts contribute to the reproduction of cyber
deterrence as a national security issue]{.underline}**. The next
subsection studies the moment when a hysteric social bond appears to
break down, i.e. when the policy experts' take on the master position by
entering the executive branch. The subsection explores the implications
for the object of desire as well as what it means for the hysteric
social bond.

#### Their claim that debates over government cyber policy spill up to produce better policy making is [yet]{.underline} another deferral of the confrontation with the object of their desire.

for ableist language

Contrary to the expectations generated by Lacan's hysteric social bond,
[the revolving door between the executive branch and the US think tanks
suggests that the **expert subject pursues its desire to become the
master.** To be master does not sit comfortably with Lacan's divided,
hysterical subject, who always recourses to another subject (master) to
organise its desire]{.underline} (Žižek 2008, 212). The question then is
how the expert subject avoids a confrontation with its own desire when
it becomes the master. [The following locates the different stages that
enable the expert subject who takes up a role in the executive branch to
avoid confronting the ontological lack at the heart of
desire.]{.underline} First, [the obligatory public speeches that senior
officials and politicians tend to deliver when taking office usually
follow a template of criticising predecessors' policies before
announcing a new set of policies. The previous government always failed
to live up to its obligations and when in office, things are always
worse than expected]{.underline}; or, as the then President Trump's
Homeland Security Advisor, former Atlantic Council fellow, Tom Bossert
underlined in the context of the cyber threat: 'I feel like I have
reawoken from a long eight-year nap and I have found a world that is on
fire' (cited in CSIS 2017b). In other words, **[the expert-turned-master
pre-empts his immediate failure to provide the promised enjoyment (a
solid cyber defence): The object standing in for objet petit a remains
out of reach, and the illusion of the master as a master (rather than
divided subject) is able to continue.]{.underline}** However, [as time
goes by, blaming the predecessor becomes an increasingly inadequate
excuse and **another reason for the lack of enjoyment must be
invented**]{.underline}. [The commonly articulated object that prevents
US cybersecurity is the nature of cyberspace: The fact that the domain
is complex, and innovation moves fast means that the US '\[cyber\]
vulnerability has continued to expand']{.underline}, as President
Obama's cybersecurity coordinator, Michael Daniel explains (Marks 2017).
Several interviews with former
policy-experts-turned-government-employees suggest an additional reason.
They suggest that [the symbolisable lack that prevents the subject from
confronting objet petit a is predominantly internal. On the one hand,
the missing object takes its form as a cross-departmental disagreement,
i.e. the fact that different departments cannot agree on one cyber issue
and neither can the Department of Defense nor the members of National
Security Council. Internal political disagreements as well as petty
personal grudges and departmental power struggles are pointed to as
obstacles to progress]{.underline}. [On the other hand, the former
policy experts face a large and rigid bureaucracy, slower and more
frustrating than expected.]{.underline} Here, the symbolisable lack
becomes the extensive lines of approval and countless processes that
steal the time from a thorough and in-depth analysis that could have
laid the proper foundation for a historic cyber policy initiative.
Former CIA and NSA director, Michael Hayden (2016: xiii), captures this
frustration from his position at the top of hierarchy: '\[A director\]
can move (or get more) money, move boxes on an organizational chart,
change out people, and exhort and inspire. That's just about the whole
toolbox.' **[Rather than causing a confrontation with the void behind
their desire, the desire of the expertturned-master continues to
slide]{.underline}**. Until, [invariable, one day the new object of
desire becomes the enjoyment that awaits when leaving
office;]{.underline} the anticipation of not having to deliberate over
and endlessly edit every sentence in a slow-moving bureaucracy with
multiple and competing interests. It is the yearning to return to the
role as an outside expert who is free to criticise. Thus, several
government officials interviewed before they left the Obama
Administration in favour of think tank or consultancy jobs emphasised
how they were looking forward to speaking in public without scripted
talking points and to travel the world to share their expertise in
panels and debates aware that the things they said did not have to take
bureaucratic hindrances and politics into account. Thus, [after the
detour in government, the expert subject returns: back to criticising
and making demands]{.underline}, or as former Defense Secretary Ash
Carter (2017) did shortly after he joined the Harvard Kennedy School,
air the disappointment he had felt by the military's cyber campaigns
against ISIS during his time in office. Yet, [once back in the role of
expert outside government who reproduces insecurities through criticism
and demands, the object of desire also takes another form -- of that
which is no longer there, i.e. the time when one made a sacrifice to
make a difference for the country]{.underline}. Former CIA and NSA
director, Michael Hayden recollects -- with nostalgia -- the mental
stress of being constantly surrounded by security escorts after
appearing in an Iraqi deck of cards identifying American targets (Hayden
2016, 62). And former Deputy Director of the NSA, Chris Inglis recalls
with illconcealed pride how he fought to defend NSA's reputation 'in
front of a madding crowd' during the days of the Snowden revelations,
and participated in 42 hearings in Congress even though he is a 'raving
introvert' (Inglis 2015). In several of interviews that went into this
study, current US cyber policy experts -- without being asked about it
-- told me that their time in government had not only meant a sacrifice
of a normal work-life balance but had also been the formative experience
that they continue to draw on. Some even explained how the policies they
authored laid the foundation for how we think about cybersecurity policy
today. [The articulations of such nostalgic recollection of 'paying
one's dues' and making a 'real' difference suggest that the expert
subject continues to desire the master position despite its previous
failure to produce full enjoyment.]{.underline} In conclusion, **[the
expert subject who enters government postpones the confrontation with
objet petit a by producing excuses for why cyber defence (full
enjoyment) is not achieved]{.underline}**. [Even when the illusion about
a master who can solve all insecurities risks becoming exposed as an
illusion through the expert's own experiences in the executive branch,
the subject avoids confronting the void at the heart of its desire. And
desire to return to the position as an expert remerges]{.underline}.
Interestingly[, when back in her previous position, the expert subject
cannot escape the nostalgic recollection of the sacrifice made and hence
a desire for 'truly making a difference' inside the
government]{.underline}. Constantly [postponing the fulfilment of desire
ends up sustaining a social bond between policy expert and government
that keeps cyber defence out of reach.]{.underline} Conclusion The
article advances critical security studies on expertise by proposing a
strategy for studying how the experts' identification as experts
contributes to the reproduction of insecurities. By studying the policy
experts as neurotic subjects, the article -- based on Lacan's Hysteric
Discourse -- moves beyond the current distinction in the critical
security literature between a neurotic, 'risk managed' citizen and an
expert who is reduced to the embodiment of a particular knowledge
regime, and thus mobilises anxieties without itself being influenced by
them. The Lacanian strategy encourages the analyst to analyse the object
of desire in the policy expert's communication vis-à-vis the government,
and the article turns to the US cyber defence experts and their
production of policy recommendations as an illustrative case study.
Through the case study, the article shows the drifting of desire in the
policy documents on cyber deterrence and argues that [the experts'
ever-evolving and ultimately elusive demands for new deterrence policies
suggest a desire for a desire unfulfilled. The drifting of desire
reproduces cyber insecurity as an ever-pertinent, still-unsolved
national security issue]{.underline}. Furthermore, the article suggests
that renewed analytical attention to the shifting object of desire also
offers insights into how **[a hysteric social bond between policy
experts and government is re-established and sustained when policy
experts in think tanks take up a position in government]{.underline}**.
[The expert-turned-master avoids confronting the void at the heart of
desire by constantly reinventing excuses as to why s/he is unable to
provide the cyber defence s/he is now responsible for.]{.underline}
Ultimately, **[the drifting of desire leads to redefinition of the lost
object]{.underline}** [as that which the subject cannot currently do in
government, i.e. criticising and demand solutions from the
master]{.underline}. Thus, [after the stint in government, the expert
subject returns, and subsequently looks upon its time in government with
nostalgic recollection. Such a drift of desire, the article suggests,
sustains a social bond where more cyber defence to overcome the eternal
cyber threat, is always in demand.]{.underline} 10 J. T. JACOBSEN The
introduction of Lacan's Hysteric Discourse as a reading strategy and its
application to the case study of the US cyber policy expert has
hopefully served to inspire future critical security studies on
expertise to bring additional analytical attention to the ways in which
**[desire manifests itself in the subject's identification as an expert
and]{.underline}** how such a perspective **[furthers]{.underline}** our
understanding of **[the reproduction of insecurity.]{.underline}**

### Link -- Death

#### Promulgating an image of death to be avoided instills guilt and total despair onto bodies -- unless we're dying from twinkies, their project is an attempt to obfuscate trauma

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 173-176, 20 September 2016,
MG)

In this sense, moral philosophers like Sandel who insist on sustaining
some terrain outside capitalist production are indispensible for the
functioning of the capitalist system. This is not to say that Sandel is
a capitalist stooge or a double agent planted by capitalist powers in
the world of moral philosophy---though, given his involvement with
MOOCs, one can't be sure---but that [the challenge to capitalism
**cannot** occur through the attempt to limit the system. If capitalism
requires a limit to transcend (which it does), every introduction of a
new limit will be inherently self-defeating for the would-be limiter of
the market's reach.]{.underline} One must instead rethink the form that
the limit takes.

By articulating the difference between the bad and the true infinite,
Hegel anticipates the psychoanalytic understanding of how the subject
satisfies itself. Though [the subject consciously imagines itself making
**infinite progress toward its goal of total satisfaction**, it never
arrives at this goal because the totally satisfying object **exists
insofar as it is lost**. When the subject successfully obtains the
object that it seeks, this object ceases to embody the lost object. But
capitalism promulgates images of the bad infinite and hides the
inescapability of the true infinite]{.underline}. The concept of the
true infinite was Hegel's way, given the conceptual tools available to
him at the time, of formulating the self-limiting structure of
subjectivity.

[By structuring our existence around the bad infinite and its ideal of
constant movement forward, capitalism focuses all our despair on **death
and aging.** Though human beings have always despaired in the face of
death, capitalist society brings this despair to a head. The end of
one's individual existence implies a **failure of growth**, the keystone
of the system. The imminence of our death and our inability to continue
growing becomes the **fundamental limit that we must
confront**]{.underline}. And it comes to us as an external limit.
[Unless we drive wildly on the wrong side of the highway or take
eighty-five pills of Valium or **eat Twinkies with abandon**, most of us
**will not cause our own deaths**. Though we work to find ways to
prevent death or offset aging, we know that ultimately we will fail in
these efforts. This is the cause of incredible despair for the subjects
of capitalism.]{.underline}

This despair leads us to spend vast amounts of money on products that
promise to help keep the body fit, hide signs of aging, or hold death
off as long as possible.30 [To be aging or dying is to **betray the bad
infinite**, to cease to develop, which adds to the **existential
horror**. Not only does one cease to exist, but one also feels
**guilty** for succumbing to this cessation. One should have done more
to stay young looking (like tanning) and to avoid death (like staying
out of the sun). The imperative of infinite progress manifests most
clearly in the anxiety produced by aging and death under
capitalism.]{.underline}

Even though he is certainly an anticapitalist philosopher, one could not
imagine Martin Heidegger constructing a philosophy around the problem of
death prior to the capitalist epoch. According to the early Heidegger,
[death **individualizes** us and creates the possibility for
authenticity because it is the one event that no one can do for us.
While we talk, eat, and work following the model of others, no one can
die in this way. Death brings an end to our possibilities and forces the
recognition of our constitutive finitude. Its very unavoidability gives
death its **existential importance**]{.underline} for Heidegger. 31
Certainly, capitalist life helps people to elude this confrontation with
death, and this is a large part of why Heidegger thinks of capitalist
modernity as a grave danger. But this danger elevates the significance
of death and its centrality. Though people died in traditional society,
death was not yet an ontological scandal.

[Death is certainly a problem of existence. But when one lives according
to the demand of the bad infinite, the centrality of this problem
becomes **magnified** and obfuscates **other, more traumatic, problems,
such as that of eternity**. The problem of eternity, however one
considers it, is more vexing than that of death]{.underline}. On the
surface, this verdict seems absurd. We might understand it coming from
God or some other eternal being, but [coming from a human being it
appears to reflect an inadequate understanding of the finitude of
earthly existence. If subjects were simply finite beings, this objection
would be a winning one. But we are burdened by the weight of our
infinitude as well as our finitude. We are beings not only of infinite
striving toward the future but also of the true infinite---an encircling
of our own limit.]{.underline}

Despite his opposition to Hegel, Søren Kierkegaard provides an almost
perfect formulation of the true infinite through his conception of the
sickness unto death. The idea of a sickness unto death seems to imply,
as with Heidegger, a concern with anxiety in the face of one's imminent
demise. But Kierkegaard has something entirely different in mind. For
him, the sickness unto death is the result of the subject's
confrontation with eternity.

Unlike other animals, the subject, as Kierkegaard sees it, cannot simply
die. As he puts it, "to be sick unto death is to be unable to die, yet
not as if there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is
not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, we
hope for life; but when we learn to know the even greater danger, we
hope for death. When the danger is so great that death becomes the hope,
then despair is the hopelessness of not even being able to die."32
Despair is the result of an inability to find respite in death, of a
confrontation with eternity. One need not have Kierkegaard's belief in
eternal life to recognize the nature of his insight here. He sees that
the focus on death actually causes us to miss the real existential bind
that ensnares us as subjects. We must find a reason to act, a passion to
drive us, and no reason is given to us by the universe.

[The eternal is the realm in which one must find a **reason for acting
in the world**. Many of our actions have a motivation in finite
exigencies---like the desire for food. But we need a reason to continue
living and not simply to abandon ourselves to death]{.underline}. This
is where we encounter the eternal. In eternity everything is possible,
and nothing makes a lasting difference because no temporal constraints
exist. There is an unlimited time to explore all alternatives. This
eternity is constantly present for us when we confront the decision of
our existence. [We face the burden of having to act and to posit the
**cause of our own act**. In this act, we take part in the true infinite
with no assistance from external sources. But capitalism relieves us of
this burden of the true infinite by translating the **existential
problem into a question of survival**.33]{.underline}

### Link -- East Asia Competition

#### Their anxiety over a "rising East Asia" who will "overtake the economy" is born of a psychic shift that relegates East Asia as a racial aberration in a violent nostalgic fantasy

**Sioh 18** (Maureen Sioh PhD -- Associate Professor in Global Asian
Studies at DePaul University , "Psychoanalysis and the GlObal",
University of Nebraska Press, Pages 50-52, 1 September 2018, MG)

[Insurgent East Asia]{.underline}

[Anxiety about the West, as represented by **the United States being
"defeated" by an economically insurgent East Asia**, was on display in
the 2016 American presidential election, most prominently in Donald
Trump's "Make America Great Again" campaign slogan. But anxieties about
the West's position of preeminence have been voiced less bombastically
with regard to East Asia]{.underline} (Panitch 2014; Hutton 2013; Cox
2012; Jacques 2009). [These anxieties have **pivoted around economic
gains**, because in the contemporary world the ultimate assertion of
superiority lies in the **financial arena**. Financial prestige, long
the privilege of the West, was now threatened by the competitor's
success]{.underline}. Hutton (2013) asserts that [even an emergent East
Asia is the creation of Western values so that emergent East Asia is
conceptualized as an extension of the West]{.underline}. Recalling
Kohut's (1973, 637--38) description of the selfobject as inseparable
from the self, we can say that [**East Asia is perceived as the
selfobject of the West**. Therefore, even East Asian success could be
considered an approving mirror of the West. While much of contemporary
Western anxiety has to do with the rise of China, it has roots in the
fears of Japanese competition in the 1980s and the bloc of Asian
countries---South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and to a lesser
extent Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand---in the 1990s. The
significance of East Asian financial success lay in two factors: it
proved that Japan was not a **racial aberration** in economic
development, and it represented an indigenous development model
acceptable to the West, as opposed to the socialist-inflected Latin
American import-substitution model]{.underline}. In the early 1990s, the
World Bank described the East Asian economies as a miracle (Birdsall et
al. 1993). Until the 1997--98 financial crisis, they were the poster
children, to invoke Bollas, for the "militant ideology" (2011, 168) of
the neoliberal policies promoted by the IMF and World Bank that were
supposed to create a safe and prosperous future.

[So why was a financial crisis tacitly reframed in the international,
and largely Western, media within the cultural and psychological
parameters of a debate on Asian values?]{.underline} While Western
opprobrium targeted all the governments affected by the crisis, Malaysia
was especially singled out for its defiance of the IMF in imposing
currency controls. Originally a controversial decision, it is now
accepted that the move stabilized the Malaysian economy (Kaplan and
Rodrik 2001; IMF 2012). But even in 1998 it was accepted that Malaysia's
ability to defy the international financial community rested on its
healthy reserve-to-debt ratio (Jomo 2001, 41). This would have long-term
consequences in the buildup of foreign reserves by all East Asian
states. In January 2016 the figure for the affected East Asian states,
as well as Japan and China, came up to over \$5.9 trillion (Trading
Economics 2017). In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, an IMF-led
Western intervention forced countries that appealed for external help to
restructure their economies, resulting in massive local social unrest.
Instead, by overlooking the material hardship and social upheaval, I
argue that the [Western media reframed the financial crisis as a
**referendum on Asian values**. Finance, race, and human worth became
yoked together in a relationship of logical equivalence (see chapter
1).]{.underline}

Before the financial crisis in 1997, poverty in Malaysia was down to 8
percent from 60 percent in 1970 (Jayasankaran and Hiebert 1997). By the
mid-1990s GDP growth was averaging 9 percent a year (Fox 1998, 100). The
Financial Post described the Malaysian model of privatization as one of
the most successful in the world (Wheeler 1995, 29). On the left of the
political spectrum, Mahmood Mamdani (2008) held up Malaysian development
to African countries as a model of the material benefits and dignity
that development could deliver. Globalization as the savior of the
developing world was primarily a trope referring to East Asian
countries. Their success offered hope to the rest of world that exiting
poverty was possible through their own agency (Sheridan 1997, xiii;
Ghesquire 2007). Malaysia, like the other East Asian economies, was
admired for its pro-capital, pro-West policies (Khanna 2008, 267). But
even before the crisis, Malaysia and the other East Asian economies were
rebelling against the model student image of one who has succeeded by
simply copying the West (Inoue 1999, 39). [This rebellion manifested
itself in the promotion of the developmental state, itself implying a
socialistic turn toward state intervention. More subtly, **the
conflation of race and nation-state, a legacy of colonialism**, meant
that the promotion of the role of the state set the stage for arguing
that culture and race played a role in success. This indirect appeal
became overt through the promotion of Asian values]{.underline}. Freud
(1959, 1962, 2004) would have noted [the significance of race as the
libidinal tie that was strengthened through competition with the West in
globalization.]{.underline}

Malaysia became a focal point for Western critics because of its
combative prime minister at the time, Mahathir Mohammad. As the Guardian
described him, "Nobody has symbolized East Asia's confidence in itself
and its ability to take on the world single-handedly more than the \[now
former\] Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohammad" (Brummer 1997,
19). What exactly was Mahathir taking on? Development, after all, as
Kasese-Hara (2004, 547) notes, is construed as an indicator of racial
potential for progress. [In asserting that the economic improvement of
East Asian national economies was a product of controversial Asian
values, proponents implicitly argued that race and culture, the traits
that condemned East Asians to official and unofficial colonization, were
now the basis of Asian success. A number of Asian commentators observed
that Western unease over this Asian success is rooted in **Western
anxiety over the region's rise** from former colonies to]{.underline}
competitors (Lim, Ho, and Yee 1998; Inoue 1999; Mahbubani 2002).
Admittedly, the position of East Asia in the colony role precludes
official colonized status---colony is used here to indicate a
differential power relationship. If in Kohut's (1973, 637--38, 644)
framework, [the former colonies are selfobjects meant to provide an
approving mirror to the West, then the success of the East Asians is now
construed as an **offense to the West**]{.underline}. Mahathir's
pronouncements convey the new confidence that emerged in the region at
the time of record-breaking economic growth. [The Asian values
controversy signaled a **psychic shift** that got underway in the 1980s
with Japan and was continued by the other East Asian countries and now
China.]{.underline}

### Link -- Economic Competition

#### **Fears of "economic competition" are born out of narcissistic injury that only culminates in aggression**

**Sioh 18** (Maureen Sioh PhD -- Associate Professor in Global Asian
Studies at DePaul University , "Psychoanalysis and the GlObal",
University of Nebraska Press, Pages 47-50, 1 September 2018, MG)

Aggression

Freud (1962, 39) suggests that [people will repress their aggression and
anxiety sufficiently to **bind themselves to some people**, as long as
there are others left to be the recipients of their aggression. Just as
the fear of others binds a group, complicity in inflicting aggression
onto an **external scapegoat** binds the perpetrators
together]{.underline}. Freud (1962, 23) suggested that [the oppression
of others is a precondition of a group's satisfaction and that the
acceptable form of aggression through mastery of others in competition
and ranking is pleasurable. Aggression is a means to achieving both
security and pleasure]{.underline}. Peter Gay (1994, 4--5) describes
aggression as ranging from confident self-advertisement to sadistic
torture. Verbal aggression is less fatal but still unmistakably
aggressive, as is flaunting one's possessions, overcoming a rival in
love, making social comparisons, and winning competitions or prizes in
sports, politics, trade, art, and literature. Gay (1994, 6) notes that
the kind of aggressiveness a culture rewards depends on the times and
circumstances, but the point is everyone recognizes aggression because
it leaves casualties in its wake. [In our time, the obvious acceptable
place for aggression and the ultimate assertion of superiority **lies in
the financial arena**. An act of aggression is transactive (Gay 1994,
6--7). It must be recognized by both sides in order for the effect to
register, and so must have culturally commensurable
meaning]{.underline}. Economic globalization has meant that signals of
economic contests are now widely culturally commensurable.

[Freud postulated that aggression was a "**drive to mastery**" (1962, 8)
and therefore linked to libido, but he also thought that aggression was
subsumed within the death]{.underline} instinct. Gay suggests that
aggression rises out of a "capacity to be aggressive which works itself
out in a wide variety of circumstances. It is mobilized by whatever is
experienced as unpleasurable, whether external pressures or internal
impulses" (1994, 536). For my purposes, I argue that earlier historical
manifestations of colonial or imperial aggression are now acceptably
channeled into finance. Ironically, [for postcolonial states in
globalization, econ**omic space is the safe space that they try to**
create]{.underline}. When Freud (1959, 18, 27) suggests that prestige is
a sort of domination exercised over us by an individual but is lost in
the event of failure or, similarly, by a competitor's success, it is
easy to understand why [the proposition of Asian values as a cultural
basis for their economic success came to be experienced as a
**narcissistic injury by the West**. Within the hegemonic framework of
global capitalism and its antecedents in colonialism, the East Asian
assertion of an indigenous basis for success was culturally
commensurable as a challenge to the old order.]{.underline}

Narcissistic Injury and Rage

Understanding the Asian values discourse in the wake of the financial
crisis requires an understanding of why it evoked such an emotional
response. Much of the contemporary scholarly work applying
psychoanalysis to the role of group identity in international aggression
focuses solely on nationalism and military conflicts (see Rachjman 1995;
Rose 2004, 2005, 2007). Yet [the most common contemporary deployment of
aggression in the international arena lies in finance. Old patterns of
hegemonic identity are being superseded by those that are
finance-oriented because **that is where the stakes are** highest. I
argue that because the prestige of a group's identity is so closely
associated with its **economic status**, a change in that status is
experienced **as a narcissistic injury**]{.underline}. This section
expands on the related concepts of narcissistic injury and rage
developed by Heinz Kohut (1973) to explain how the antagonistic Asian
values debate was played out.

Kohut (1973) reconceptualizes narcissism using the term "selfobject" to
refer to any narcissistic experience in which the other is in the
service of the self, the latter being defined as a structure that is
required for an individual's sense of psychic coherence and well-being.
He sees a selfobject as inseparable from the self so that the other
person's functions are related to the self (Kohut 1973, 637--38). The
selfobject offers support for the vulnerable self through an approving
mirroring response, which Kohut (1973, 628) envisions as forming the
basis for realistic self-esteem. But he argues that if the subject's
prior experience has not allowed for transformation of the narcissistic
cathexis with the grandiose self into a healthy self-esteem, then
deprived of an "approving mirroring response" (Kohut 1973, 628) from the
selfobject, the self will experience a narcissistic injury and respond
with extreme rage. In this chapter, I extend the concepts of self and
selfobjects to encompass groups.

Bollas (2011, 81) suggests that under intense emotional pressure such as
envy or anxiety, an individual or group's negative traits will be
projected externally to coalesce into allegories or stereotypes of other
groups. Likewise, Kohut proposes that defensive responses, of which
narcissistic rage is an extreme version, are activated because the
recalcitrant selfobject is not seen as an autonomous source but as a
"flaw in a narcissistically perceived reality" (1973, 644; emphasis in
original), over which the narcissistically vulnerable self had expected
to exercise control. Thus, [the selfobject's independence or difference
is experienced as offensive. This is the **crux of Western behavior to
challenges**, real or perceived, to its authority under globalization.
Given that Kohut (1973, 643--45) posits that a narcissist must exert
absolute control over his or her environment and demand unconditional
availability of the approving mirroring for the maintenance of
self-esteem, the narcissist must grind down the opponent who dares to
outshine him or her because this contradicts the self-image of the
grandiose self. **Global economic competitions create intense anxiety
even among the winners**, and envy among those who perceive themselves
as losers, even if this loss is only relative]{.underline} (see
introduction and chapter 5). [When the only identity that counts is an
economic one, and this is coupled with a sense of historically based
racial entitlement, then by the above logic, the success of rivals
becomes a defeat of the self and is experienced as
narcissistic]{.underline} injury. The success of the East Asian emerging
economies destroyed the sense of unconditional approval of Western
social organization, especially when the East Asian states put forth a
cultural and racial basis (Asian values) for their economic success.
Their subsequent stumbling and weakness during the financial crisis then
seemed to invite the moralistic punitiveness of the IMF and Western
commentators. It is in this context that I argue that the vaunting of
Asian values as the cultural or racial basis of East Asian economic
success became a flashpoint for the economically punitive austerity
programs that were imposed on East Asian countries, as well as for
gloating by Western pundits in the wake of the financial crisis.

Humiliation

Kohut (1973, 642) argues that [we can recognize that narcissistic rage
is involved when an individual is **excessively preoccupied with a
situation involving other people**, which he attributes to the
narcissistic individual's inability to recognize others as independent
subjects. We see this in the West's response to the Asian financial
crisis, which focused on denigrating the cultural basis for East Asian
success]{.underline}. Kohut (1973, 637--38) suggests that narcissistic
rage occupies a specific position in the spectrum defined by an
obsession for revenge because of an archaic fixation. I suggest Kohut is
making the point that narcissistic rage is as much a reaction to a past
relation rather than the one ostensibly at hand, and in the case of the
Asian values discourse, the rage was a function of a historic sense of
Western entitlement. Bollas (2011, 176) goes on to hypothesize that
extreme reactions occur as part of an unconscious restructuring of past
trauma in which the subject puts others through an equivalent, if
different, trauma. In this logic, aggressive narcissists identify only
with those aspects of their identity that provide them with admiration
and a sense of superiority (Bollas 2011, 82). Western contempt and
ridicule of Asian values is a reflection of narcissistic rage at the
economic challenge, but [it could also be a function of the West
projecting its **own anxieties of the social dislocation** inherent in
the rising inequality in their home countries that accompanied the
transition from a manufacturing to service economy from the 1970s
onward. And while both Western and East Asian responses during the
crisis originate in defensiveness, the West is defensive and outraged at
the perception that its culturally privileged position has been
assailed]{.underline}, whereas East Asian outrage is driven by fear or
anxiety at their relative lack of power in economic globalization. In
any case, the East Asian response to the humiliating economic policies
imposed on them in the aftermath of the financial crisis was tempered by
their inability to retaliate.

For Bollas (2011, 83--87), [the shame of narcissistic injury must be
projected elsewhere in the "**circuit of depersonalization**" (87) in
which a psychopathic subject dehumanizes his or her victims in the name
of a militant ideology]{.underline}. Here, it is the ideology of
neoliberalism that asserts its higher purpose to create a prosperous
world through its proponents' intellectual superiority. Bollas (2011,
168--71) describes a militant ideology as an active process involving
seduction, the promise of a false safe space, and the development of a
dependent relationship so that the subsequent shock of betrayal becomes
even more traumatic. The goal is to cause the victim to lose perspective
and induce a traumatic experience, leaving the victim more likely to
comply with further victimization (Bollas 2011, 171--73). [This process
makes sense when it is applied to the promises of financial deregulation
in globalization. In globalization, **Western financial institutions
present freedom for capital** to developing countries as the solution to
their poverty. In the event of asset bubbles, and subsequent
unsustainable debt leading to capital flight and a liquidity crisis, the
false hope of prosperity is replaced by the imposition of shock therapy
in the form of austerity by the very institutions that once promoted the
asset bubbles. In tandem with the material betrayal, the trauma is
reinforced through a **parallel humiliating discourse that dehumanizes
the victim**s. This form of the narcissistic injury is inflicted through
the following practices: stereotyping through aggregate group identity,
distorting the victims' views so that they appear less intelligent, and
belittling and caricaturing the victims, which can include character
assassination of specific individuals]{.underline} (Bollas 2011,
88--89). All of these practices were present in the Asian values
discourse during the financial crisis in 1997--98 as we shall see later.

### Link -- Emancipatory Politics

#### Emancipatory politics work only in theory, not in practice -- attaching desire to their politics works to retroactively create the global system and ensure loss

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 42-44, 1 July 2013, MG)

The prevalence of nostalgia has perhaps its most obvious impact in the
shaping of contemporary political programs. The entirety of the
contemporary right-wing social and cultural agenda has its basis in the
nostalgia for a time of plenitude. [Nostalgia fuels the demand for
school prayer, the **opposition to gay marriage**, the effort to
eliminate abortion, the support for the death penalty, and so on.
According to contemporary American conservatism, the abandonment of
school prayer, for instance, has helped to bring about many of the
social ills (teen pregnancy, school violence, incivility, etc.) that
plague contemporary American society]{.underline}. Champions of school
prayer see the epoch when students prayed in school as time prior to
loss.

At this earlier historical moment, subjects enjoyed a direct relation
with their privileged object and achieved a perfect satisfaction. [We
exist in the **aftermath of a fall**, and from the perspective of the
fall, we can see the possibilities for **complete satisfaction** in the
world we have lost]{.underline}. Similarly, eliminating the threat of
gay marriage allows conservatives to imagine a time when marriage itself
was a pure institution, a bond that permitted a direct link to one's
object. Within the nostalgia framework that conservatism offers, loss
has a place only as a limit to overcome through the return to a
nonlacking past. Conservatism cannot admit the notion of a constitutive
or necessary loss.

Though right-wing political activity is unthinkable without nostalgia,
[**emancipatory politics** often succumbs to its power as well. Within
certain forms of environmentalism, the alternative medicine campaign,
and the **antiglobalization movement**, we can see prominent examples of
this. In each case, the leftist political goal --- protecting the
environment, providing people more health options, **countering global
capitalism** --- becomes intertwined with the idea of a return to an
earlier epoch and to a less alienated way of relating to the world.
Implicit in this idea is the image of a nonlacking subjectivity, and
this image stains the political goal with the tint of
nostalgia.]{.underline}

[Those who argue for a return to harmony with nature, for privileging
non-Western and homeopathic forms of medicine, and for forsaking global
capitalism by supporting only local producers all take up a politics of
nostalgia. The idea that we might return to a stable relation with the
natural world posits a prior time in which this stability existed, a
time lost with the onset of subjectivity. By]{.underline} appealing to
the inherent nostalgia of subjects, the forces of emancipation
undoubtedly gain adherents. Many people drawn to the idea of "buying
local" would not otherwise find common cause with emancipatory projects,
for instance. But the long-term cost of this strategy is not worth the
supporters that it wins for the emancipatory politics. Though
conservatism doesn't have a monopoly on nostalgia, nostalgia does have
an inherently conservative structure to it.

[Nostalgia is fundamentally conservative insofar as it works to
**obscure the gap within the social order**. It posits the possibility
of an order that works without interruption and thus leaves no room for
subjectivity itself. The freedom of the subject depends on the
imperfection of the social order, its inability to achieve completion or
harmony]{.underline}. A political philosophy that represses this failure
also inherently represses the opening through which freedom emerges. In
effect, the nostalgic subject longs to access a past prior to its
subjectivization. To retreat into nostalgia is to flee one's own
freedom. In order to accomplish this and to close the gap within the
social order, nostalgic projects necessarily rely on a strong authority
figure who promises to reinvigorate the lost past rather than on the
freedom of the subject.34 [The emancipatory goal placed in a nostalgic
appeal **loses touch with the overall emancipatory project** of freeing
the subject from its submission to authority figures. What's more,
nostalgia **works only in theory, not in practice**.]{.underline}

[Nostalgic appeals always create disappointment in the last instance. We
long for a time before loss, but this time only comes into existence
with its loss: the birth of subjectivity **retroactively creates the
object that it loses**. The politics of nostalgia involves never
actually following through on the nostalgic promise, as contemporary
conservatism's social politics makes evident]{.underline}. In contrast
to their vigorous pursuit of a conservative economic program, Ronald
Reagan and George W. Bush (the two great proponents of a politics of
nostalgia in the last fifty years) did not actively try to enact their
social agenda. For Reagan and Bush, the dream of a return has a
political effectiveness that an actual return could not have. If school
prayer again became the norm in public classrooms, the nonexistence of
the former wholeness would be revealed. If the threat of the gay
lifestyle were really eliminated, the banality of heterosexual marriage
would once again show itself. [Nostalgia remains a useful political tool
only insofar as one doesn't effectuate it. **This is the limit of its
power.**]{.underline}

**[Why [psychoanalysis]{.mark}?]{.underline}** [On the face of it, it
[seems]{.mark} frankly [irrelevant.]{.mark} Surely [it is]{.mark} the
basic sciences of geology, ecology, biology, and [climatology that we
need,]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[combined with]{.mark} various
hi[-tech]{.mark} engineering]{.underline}**? Yes and no. [The science
informing us of the risks and]{.underline} possible [[technical
solutions has **run far ahead of our psychological state**. **We are not
yet at the point** ]{.mark}**emotionally [of being able to]{.mark}
clearly [grasp the threat,]{.mark} and act accordingly**]{.underline}.
[[We need to ask why this issue,]{.mark} despite its]{.underline}
current [prominence, **[fails to ignite]{.mark} people\'s
[motivation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the [major changes
science tells us is necessary]{.underline}. [This concerns not only the
\'public\' but the academy and the psychoanalytic
community]{.underline}. In spite of the fact that Harold Searles was
already writing in 1960 that psychoanalysts need to acknowledge the
psychological importance of the non-human environment, until very
recently his colleagues have almost entirely ignored him.

In this section we explore some of the theories with which we may be
able to construct a psychoanalysis of ecology. Fuller elaboration will
involve incorporating approaches from the sciences of complexity and
ecology, and Deleuze and Guattari\'s \'geophilosophy\' or \'ecosophy\',
which itself emerged in critical dialogue with psychoanalysis and
complexity theory. However, we first need to explore the ecological
potential within psychoanalysis itself, as without the latter\'s methods
and theories for unmasking hidden motivations and phantasies, this
investigation will not be able to proceed.

Renee [Lertzman]{.underline} (2008), one of the first psychoanalytically
informed social scientists to engage with the ecological crisis,
[describes a common surreal aspect of our everyday responses to
\'eco-anxiety\', the experience of flipping through a newspaper and
being]{.underline} suddenly [[confronted with]{.mark}:]{.underline}

the stop-dead-in-your-tracks, [bone-chilling kind of [ecological
travesties]{.mark}]{.underline} taking place around our planet today
\... [declining honey bees, melting glaciers, plastics in the
sea]{.underline}, or the rate of [coal plants being built in
China]{.underline} each second. But **[how many of us actually do stop
dead in our tracks? [Have we become numb?]{.mark}]{.underline}** \...
[if so, how can we become more awake and engaged]{.underline} to what is
happening?

[Environmental campaigners have become increasingly frustrated and
pessimistic]{.underline}. **[[Even as their messages spread further and
further, and as scientists unite around their core concerns, there is an
alarming gap between]{.mark} increasingly [firm evidence and public
response]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The fact that oil companies donate
millions to climate \'sceptic\' groups doesn\'t help (Vidal 2010). Nor
does the fact that eight European companies which are together
responsible for 5-10 per cent of the emissions covered in the EU
emissions trading system (Bayet, BASF, BP, GDF Suez, ArcelorMittal,
Lafarge, E.ON, and Solvay) gave \$306,100 to senatorial candidates in
the 2010 United States midterm elections who either outright deny
climate change (\$107,200) or pledge they will block all climate change
legislation (\$240,200), with the most flagrant deniers getting the most
funds (Goldenberg 2010; Climate Action Network 2010). These are the same
[companies]{.underline} that [campaign against EU targets of 30 per cent
reductions in emissions using current inaction in the United States as a
justification, while claiming their official policy is that climate
change is a major threat and they are committed to doing all they can
to]{.underline} help in the common cause of dealing with the danger (for
the full report see Climate Action Network 2010).

[Recent opinion polls show climate scepticism is on the rise in the
UK]{.underline} as well. In February 2010 a BBC-commissioned poll by
Populus (BBC 2010a, 2010b) of 1,001 adults found that 25 per cent
didn\'t think global warming was happening, a rise of 8 per cent since a
similar poll in November 2009. Belief that climate change was real fell
from 83 per cent to 75 per cent, while only 26 per cent believed climate
change was established as largely man-made compared with 41 per cent in
November. A third of those agreeing climate change was real felt
consequences had been exaggerated (up from a fifth) while the number of
those who felt risks had been understated fell from 38 per cent to 25
per cent (see Figure 3). According to Populus director M. Simmonds, \'it
is very unusual \... to see such a dramatic shift in opinion in such a
short period \... The British public are sceptical about man\'s
contribution to climate change and becoming more so\' (BBC 2010a).

[Most remarkable here is the discrepancy between public and expert
opinion]{.underline}. According to the chief scientific advisor at the
Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Professor Robert
Watson: \'Action is urgently needed \... We need the public to
understand that climate change is serious so they will change their
habits and help us move towards a low-carbon economy.\' Why this shift?
Whilst the poll took place with the background of heavy snow and
blizzards in the UK, always a convenient backdrop to climate sceptic
jokes, [the BBC]{.underline} (2010a) article [focused on a high-profile
story concerning stolen emails alleging scientific malpractice at the
University of East Anglia]{.underline} (UEA). [While this was a very
serious accusation, no mainstream scientific body seriously imagines it
changes in any real way the overall science, and yet this is not how the
public perceived it.]{.underline}

Subsequently, the UK Parliament\'s Commons Science and Technology
Committee completed its investigation into the case (BBC 2010c). The
MPs\' committee concluded there was no evidence that UEA\'s Professor
Phil Jones had manipulated data, or tried \'to subvert the peer review
process\' and that \'his reputation, and that of his climate research
unit, remained intact\' (BBC

2010c). The report noted that \'it is not standard practice in climate
science to publish the raw data and the computer code in academic
papers\' and that \'much of the data that critics claimed Prof Jones has
hidden, was in fact already publicly available\' (BBC 2010c) but called
strongly for a greater culture of transparency in science. The report
concluded that it \'found no reason in this unfortunate episode to
challenge the scientific consensus that global warming is happening and
is induced by human activity\' (BBC 2010c).

[This story was followed closely by another in January 2010 when the
IPCC admitted a mistake concerning the timetable of Himalayan glacial
melting]{.underline}. In such a lengthy report of over 3 000 pages,
produced from the combined efforts of the world scientific community on
a topic with as many variables as climate change, it is unsurprising
some estimates need revising. Undoubtably there will be more revisions
in the future, some major. [It is important to emphasize that for the
world\'s scientists the overall picture has not been affected, but
public perception is completely different, with triumphant claims of
proof \'it is all made up\']{.underline}. No doubt many sceptics will
use the Parliamentary committee\'s report as further evidence of an
institutional cover-up.

[The important psychological point is that **[people are ready for such
events]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[indeed eager for
it]{.underline}]{.mark}** - [the psychosocial equivalent of a sandpile
in a state of self-organized criticality]{.underline} (Palombo 1999; Bak
1994), [when a single grain can cause a major avalanche]{.underline}
cascading through the whole system. [Understanding such subtle shifts,
and the often unconscious motivations behind them, is where
psychoanalysis perhaps more than any other discipline has a lot to
offer]{.underline}. As Lertzman (2008) writes:

[What if [the core issue is]{.mark} more about **[how humans respond to
anxiety?]{.mark}**]{.underline} [\...]{.mark} \[[Environmental problems
\... conjure up anxieties that \... we are done for]{.underline}, and
nothing can really be done \... [To help me understand more, I turn to
Freud]{.underline} \... because I have found few others who speak as
eloquently, and sensitively about what humans do when faced with anxiety
or anxiety-provoking news.

Freud, civilization, nature and the dialectic of the Enlightenment

[Is Freud really relevant to understanding our current
crisis?]{.underline} While he was very much engaged in relating
psychology to social issues, from war to racism, group psychology and
the discontents of civilization (Freud 1913a, 1915, 1921, 1927, 1930),
he was writing during a period when the possibility that human
activities could bring the Earth\'s ecosystems to the brink of collapse
would have been hard to contemplate. Romanticism may have complained
about \'unweaving rainbows\' and industry\'s \'dark satanic mills\', but
by Freud\'s day this could be seen as Luddite anti-progress talk,
especially for those working within the Weltangschung of science and the
Enlightenment to which Freud (1933) pinned his psychoanalytic flag.
However, [much of [our]{.mark} current bewildering [situation can be
understood as rooted]{.mark} in part in a world view that was at its
zenith during Freud\'s day and]{.underline}, as Lertzman (2008)
suggests, **[[in our responses to anxiety]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
addition, [Freud did offer us some **crucial reflections on our
relationship with nature:**]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} principle [task of civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}, its
actual raison d\'etre, [[is to **defend us against nature**]{.mark}. We
all know that in many ways civilization does this fairly
well]{.underline} already, and clearly [as time goes on it will do it
much better]{.underline}. But no one is under the illusion that nature
has already been vanquished; and few dare hope that she will ever be
entirely subdued to man. (Freud 1927: 51)

Here we can see an interesting ambivalence in Freud\'s rhetorical style,
which perhaps unwittingly captures two crucial aspects of [our
civilization\'s relationship to \'Nature\']{.underline} and thus [begins
to open up a psychoanalytic approach to ecology.]{.underline} First, [he
depicts a series of binary oppositions]{.underline} typical for his era,
and not so different in our own: [[human versus nature]{.mark}, man
versus woman and]{.underline} (more implicitly) [[order versus
chaos]{.mark}. Here we find the classic tropes of the
Enlightenment,]{.underline} modernity, patriarchy, industrialism and
capitalism, [which Jungian ecopsychologist Mary-Jane Rust (2008) calls
[the myths we live by]{.mark}. The myths]{.underline} she is referring
to in particular [[are the \'myth of progress\']{.mark} and the \'myth
of the Fall\']{.underline}. She argues that [in order to create a
sustainable future]{.underline}, or indeed any future, **[[we need to
find other stories]{.underline}]{.mark}**, other myths, [through which
to live our lives, [to **rethink**]{.mark} **how we have fallen and
[what it means to progress]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Freud\'s work
suggests that [Western **culture views civilization as a defence against
nature**]{.underline}, and against wildness, inner and outer, but as
Rust (2008: 5) writes, [at \'this critical point in human history we
most urgently need a myth to live by which is about **living with
nature, rather than fighting it**]{.underline}.\' Thus, according to
Rust, we find ourselves \... between stories (Berry 1999), in a
transitional space \... of great turbulence, with little to hold onto
save the ground of our own experience. [[Our]{.mark} therapeutic [task
\... is to **understand how**]{.mark} **these [myths]{.mark} still
[shape our]{.mark} internal [worlds]{.mark}, our language, and our
defences**]{.underline} \... \[S\]omewhere in the midst of
\'sustainability\' \... lies an inspiring vision of transformation \...
We need to dig deep, to re-read our own myths as well as find
inspiration from the stories of others. (ibid.)

[[The myth of progress enters]{.mark} the climate change debate [in
**calls for geo-engineering and Utopian**]{.mark}
**[techno-fixes]{.mark}** such as putting thousands of mirrors in space,
[and in the dismissal of]{.mark} even gentle [questioning]{.mark} of
current economic models of unlimited [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}. We
will later look at Harold Searles\' (1972) approach to [[our
**fascination with technology** and]{.mark} its role in the current
crisis]{.underline}. Returning to Freud, however, [there
is,]{.underline} as always, [another side, an implicit awareness that
**[the feeling of mastery civilization gives us is]{.mark} in many ways
[a dangerous illusion]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Behind our need for
mastery lies our fear]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and trembling in the face
of the awesome power of mother nature.]{.underline}

[[There are]{.mark} the [elements which]{.mark} seem to [mock]{.mark} at
all [human control]{.mark}: the earth, which quakes and is torn apart
and buries all human life]{.underline} and its works; water, which
deluges and drowns everything in turmoil; storms, which blow everything
before them \... [With these forces [nature]{.mark} rises up against us,
majestic, cruel and inexorable; she [brings to our mind]{.mark} once
more [our weakness]{.mark}]{.underline} and helplessness, **[[which we
thought to escape through]{.mark} the work of
[civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. (Freud 1927: 15-16)

Here is the other side of Freud\'s writing on the relation between
\'Nature\' and \'Civilization\', with humanity portrayed as a weak and
helpless infant in awe and fear of a mighty and terrible mother. [The
lure and horror of matriarchy lie behind the defensive constructs of
patriarchal civilization]{.underline}, just as Klein\'s
paranoid-schizoid fears of fragmentation, engulfment, and annihilation
lie behind later castration threats (Hinshelwood 1991).

With each new earthquake or flood, nature erupts into culture -similar
to Kristeva\'s (1982) description of the eruption of the \'semiotic\'
into the \'symbolic\' - and we are thrown back into a state of terror.
The \'illusion\' in the title of Freud\'s 1927 essay The Future of an
Illusion was meant to refer to how [religion arose to deal with these
anxieties. However, the structural function of the myth of progress,
while]{.underline} undoubtably [more successful in terms of practical
benefits, can also be included here]{.underline}. In these words of
Freud [[we]{.mark} have already a deep understanding]{.underline},
albeit largely implicit, [of our own current crisis: a relationship to
nature based on a master-slave system of absolute binaries, and **an
[attempt to maintain]{.mark} an** **[illusory]{.mark} autonomy and
[control in the face of chaos]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

There is often a tension in Freud, between the celebration of
Enlightenment values found in works such as The Future of an Illusion
(1927) and the more Romantic Freud who won the Goethe prize and
constantly emphasized the elements Enlightenment rationality leaves out
such as jokes, dreams, slips and psychological symptoms. Thus, as well
as being a perfect example of the Enlightenment with its call to make
the unconscious conscious and give the \'rational\' ego greater power
over the wilds of the id, [[psychoanalysis]{.mark} also [provides
a]{.mark} serious [challenge to this]{.mark} way of
thinking]{.underline}. **[There will always be something beyond our
control. We are not, and never can be, masters in our own
house]{.underline}**, [and the core of who we are is irrational, and
often frightening]{.underline}. Marcuse (1998) touched on a similar
tension when declaring Freud\'s (1930) Civilization and Its Discontents
both the most radical critique of Western culture and its most trenchant
defence. Psychoanalysis, as always, is exquisitely ambivalent.

Ultimately, for Freud, [both the natural world and our inner nature are
untamable and the most we can hope for are temporary, fragile, anxious
compromises between competing forces]{.underline} (Winter & Koger 2004).
**[[The chaos of nature]{.mark} we defend against [is]{.mark} also [the
chaos of our inner nature,]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[the wildness in the
depths of our psyche]{.underline}**. **[Civilization does not only
domesticate livestock but also humanity itself]{.underline}** (Freud &
Einstein 1933: 214). However, **[[attempts to eliminate]{.mark} the
[risk have]{.mark} in many ways [dangerously
backfired]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [comparable to the ways that the
historical [programmes aiming to eliminate forest fires]{.mark} in the
United States have [led to far bigger and more uncontrollable
fires]{.mark} taking the place of previously smaller and more manageable
ones]{.underline} (Diamond 2006: 43-47).

[The control promised by the Enlightenment, [the power of the intellect
to overcome chaos]{.mark} (environmental and emotional), [is]{.mark}
therefore at least partly [a]{.mark} **defensive and at times [dangerous
illusion]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[In our age of anxiety,
[with]{.mark} the [destruction]{.mark} of civilization [threatened by
nuclear holocaust, ecosystemic collapse]{.mark}, bioweapons [and]{.mark}
dirty [bombs, Freud\'s warning is]{.mark} more [relevant]{.mark} than
ever:]{.underline}**

[[Humans\* have gained control over]{.mark} the forces of [nature to
such an extent that]{.mark} with their help **[they would have no
difficulty]{.mark} in [exterminating one another]{.mark} to the last
man** **[\... hence comes]{.mark} a large part of [their]{.mark} current
unrest, their unhappiness and their mood of
[anxiety]{.mark}**.]{.underline} (Freud 1930: 135)

Freud\'s binaries \'masculine/Enlightenment/control/autonomy\' versus
\'feminine/nature/chaos/dependency\' also lead us to consider what
Gregory Bateson (2000: 95) called [the \'bipolar
characteristic\']{.underline} of Western thought, which even [tries \'to
impose a binary pattern upon phenomena which are not dual in
nature]{.underline}: youth versus age, labor versus capital, mind versus
matter - [and]{.underline}, in general, [lack\[s\] the organizational
devices for handling triangular system]{.underline}s/ In such a culture,
as with the child struggling to come to terms with the Oedipal
situation, \'any \"third\" party is always regarded \... as a threat\'
(ibid.).

Deleuze and Guattari describe such dualistic forms of thinking using the
ecological metaphor of the tree with its fork-branch patterns (although
they would not use the term metaphor): \'Arborescent systems are
hierarchical systems with centers of signifiance and subjectification
\... an element only receives information from a higher unit, and only
receives a subjective affection along preestablished paths\' (Deleuze &
Guattari 2003a: 16). However, [Freud\'s \'arborescent\' system of
binaries can also **show us the way out,** capturing the psychological
bind we are now]{.underline} in. As Deleuze and Guattari (2003a: 277)
write: [\'The only way to get outside the dualisms is \... to pass
between, the intermezzo.\' [Deconstructing]{.mark} these [dualisms
allows us to think about how our **destructive urge to
dominate**]{.mark} and control [is connected to **our fear of
acknowledging dependency on**]{.mark} **this largest of \'holding
environments\', [the]{.mark} ultimate [\'environment]{.mark}
mother\'**]{.underline} (Winnicott 1999,1987).

#### These pathologies distort not only how we respond to crisis but also why and to which crises -- as such, your primary role is to investigate the aff's psychological investment in technomangerialism is an exercise in reprogramming our position in a non-linear and inevitably chaotic world.

[The metaphor of [an acrobat]{.mark} on a high wire referred to by
Bateson (2000: 506) is particularly apt for us now. The acrobat, in
order not to fall, requires maximum freedom to \'move from one position
of instability to another.\' **This [is the paradox of order]{.mark}**
and disorder that we discussed in Chapter 11. [In our]{.mark} current
[ecological crisis we must face the possibility that
**achieving**]{.mark} **the [freedom]{.mark} and flexibility that we
need [to survive requires]{.mark} a [fundamental re-examination
of]{.mark} many of [the basic coordinates of our lives]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark} some of our most cherished theories. In analyzing the rise
and fall of past civilizations, we find that a **[\'new technology for
the exploitation of nature]{.mark}** or a new technique for the
exploitation of other men \... [gives]{.mark} elbow room or
[flexibility\' but that]{.mark} **[\'the using up of that flexibility is
death\']{.mark}** (Bateson 2000: 503).]{.underline}

[Like the patient stuck on a local optima that we discussed in Chapter
12, unable or unwilling to cross the threshold to a more adaptive peak,
entire species, and civilizations, have in the past found themselves in
dangerous dead ends and unable to change. These dead ends include those
within the ecology of mind, **[ways of thinking and being]{.mark} that
[become pathological]{.mark}** if they fail to evolve along with the
constantly shifting relations in the constitution of natural and social
ecosystems. [Ecopsychoanalysis, which draws on]{.mark} the tools and
ideas of [**nonlinear science**, understands]{.mark} that our world is
**governed by [nonlinear dynamics,]{.mark}** [to the extent that the
**prediction and control**]{.mark} **promised by Enlightenment
rationality [will always remain]{.mark} to some degree
[illusory]{.mark}**. Instead, we need to engage with the creativity of
the Earth, and follow the lines of flight we uncover, exploring \'the
potential for self-organization inherent in even the humblest forms of
matter-energy\' (DeLanda 2005:273).]{.underline}

[Our species has experienced such severe existential threats before. One
of the most extreme examples was an evolutionary bottleneck which
molecular biology shows us occurred approximately 70,000 years ago, when
the human species was down to the last few thousand individuals or even
less. Geological evidence suggests that this near extinction may have
been linked to the Toba supervolcano in Indonesia, whose eruption
triggered sudden climate change with major environmental impacts
(Dawkins 2004). We do not know how we emerged from that particular
crisis, or how close we may have come to extinction at various other
times in our history.]{.underline}

[We might reflect on these experiences as applying to the whole species
an idea that Winnicott (1974: 104) once discussed in terms of the fear
of breakdown in individual psychoanalysis. For Winnicott, this fear
refers to a breakdown that has already occurred, but it was a
catastrophe which took place before there was yet a subject to folly
experience it with a reflective consciousness. At the risk of
anthropocentrism, we might do well to consider Dennett\'s (2003: 267)
point that in many ways we do occupy a unique position in the history of
the Earth, as \'wherever lineages found themselves on local peaks of the
adaptive landscape, their members had no way of so much as wondering
whether or not there might be higher, better summits on the far side of
this valley or that.\']{.underline}

[Despite all the defensive reasons to not know which we explored in
Chapters 4-7. we are, to some extent at least, becoming conscious of the
enormity of the danger which confronts us. Today we are forced to think
in these complex terms, to wonder about other valleys and other peaks on
the plane of immanence, our virtual realm of possibility, to find a path
through the current deadlock. As we saw in Part I of this book, these
are difficult times. As Bateson (2000: 495) writes, the \'massive
aggregation of [threats]{.mark} to (hu)man(kind) and his ecological
systems **[arise]{.mark}s [out of errors in our habits of
thought]{.mark}** [at]{.mark} **deep and partly [unconscious
levels.\']{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[The contribution of psychoanalysis is]{.mark} precisely [to]{.mark}
help us to [overcome such errors through **investigating their
unconscious roots**]{.mark}. [Ecopsychoanalysis recognizes the need
for]{.mark} a radical [questioning of]{.mark} our theories, whether
psychoanalytic, philosophical, scientific or political, and the
corresponding [ways of living **individually**]{.mark} and collectively
that they make possible and reflect. However, it does so through a
respectful engagement with the best that our various traditions have to
offer, entering into uncanny new symbioses, making these disciplines
strange to themselves not in order to destroy them but to make them more
vital and alive.]{.underline}

[Despite the gravity of our situation, there are \'patches of sanity
still surviving in the world\' (Bateson 2000: 495), ideas in the ecology
of mind worth exploring, helping us to construct a new alpha function we
can only hope is capable of dreaming at the precipice. This book has
sought to uncover what some of the components of this might be, focusing
in particular on the constructive synergy between psychoanalysis,
complexity theory, ecology, and the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari.
Ecopsychoanalysis wonders whether it is precisely in the very severity
of the desperate ecological situation we face that [a great opportunity
lies for re-imagining]{.mark} the human, our societies, and [our place
in the world]{.mark}. It is in the ecopsychological spirit of nurturing
hope while facing despair that this book was written.]{.underline}

[However, **[there is no \'big Other]{.mark}\'** (Zizek 2007) **[to
guarantee our success, or even our]{.mark} future [existence]{.mark}**.
In a chaotic world without certainty, ecopsychoanalysis can turn to the
experimental pragmatics of Deleuze and Guattari (2003a: 161): \'Lodge
yourself on a stratum, experiment with the opportunities it offers \...
find potential movements of deterritorialization, possible lines of
flight, experience them, produce flow conjunctions here and there, try
out continuums of intensities segment by segment, have a small plot of
new land at all times.\']{.underline}

[Assumptions according to which we have long lived our lives collapse as
we begin to feel the disturbing effects of the hyperobject of climate
change on the ecology of mind. [Ecopsychoanalysis]{.mark} itself can be
viewed as a hyperobject in that it does not yet fully exist. It [should
not be seen as an end state but a process of becoming]{.mark}, a work in
progress, a meshwork emerging at the interstices of the three ecologies,
and the elaboration of an alpha function that is able to think and dwell
in our new uncanny home. As Bateson (2000: 512) writes, **[\'we are not
outside the ecology for which we plan - we are always]{.mark} and
inevitably a [part of it]{.mark}**. Herein lies the charm and the terror
of ecology.\' Ecopsychoanalysis can never occupy an outside from which
to explore and engage with the new strange ecology(s), but is always
already extimate with it (Lacan 1992: 139).]{.underline}

[**[For]{.mark} all [its chaos, because of]{.mark} all [its chaos, the
world is]{.mark} still [a place of wonder]{.mark}**, and we can only
hope that we find ways of staying in it at least a little while longer.
[The **nonlinearity and chaos of nature**]{.mark}, and the forms of
thinking required to sustain our relationship to it beyond the limited
horizons of our experience, [are **both frightening and
liberating**]{.mark}. Yet, despite the anxiety, guilt and terror that
climate change forces us to face[, this moment]{.mark} of crisis
[can]{.mark} also [offer]{.mark} us [an opportunity for a **more open
vision of ourselves**,]{.mark} as subjects, as societies, and as a
species among the interconnected life systems of the Earth.]{.underline}

### Link -- Environmentalism

#### Palpating a fantasy of Green Ideology is a form of disavowal and half-knowing where we internalize the true inevitable loss inherent in ecological crisis in exchange for submission to the global and psychic pain

**Fletcher 18** (Robert Fletcher -- Environmental Anthropologist and
work in the Sociology of Development and Change group at Wageningen
University in the Netherlands , "Psychoanalysis and the GlObal",
University of Nebraska Press, Pages 65-67, 1 September 2018, MG)

[Psychoanalysis and the Environment]{.underline}

From Joseph Mishan's (1996) formative "First Thoughts" on the
relationship between psychoanalysis and environmentalism, consideration
of the connection has progressed slowly but steadily, producing a small
yet insightful stream of academic literature. Stavrakakis draws on Lacan
to describe [a "Green ideology" aiming "to refound and recreate the
political, social and economic foundations of western societies on the
basis of a political project that is constructed around a **certain
conception of nature**]{.underline}" (1997a, 260). He views [this
ideology as symptomatic of the "limits to growth and economic expansion,
limits imposed **by the Real of nature**"]{.underline} (Stavrakakis
1997b, 124), [evidenced by the **environmental crises giving rise to
Green ideology itself**]{.underline}. Meanwhile, Swyngedouw (2011)
references Žižek (1992) to [describe environmentalism as the "**new
opium for the masses**" in its tendency to obscure the fundamentally
political nature of ecological damage in positing purely technocratic
solutions for these problems]{.underline}. Paul Robbins and Sarah Moore
(2013) diagnose [a growing "ecological anxiety disorder" manifest, for
instance, in scientific debate concerning the merits of novel ecological
systems. Building on all of this, elsewhere I have described how
neoliberal environmental discourse **resorts to fantasy to conceal the
gap between its lofty promise and meager results in
practice**]{.underline} (Fletcher 2013a, b, 2014) as well as the way
[overpopulation serves as a scapegoat for the failure of sustainable
development policies]{.underline} (Fletcher, Breitling, and Puleo 2014).

[Increasingly, this literature has come to focus on **climate change in
particular**]{.underline}. Hence, Swyngedouw (e.g., 2010, 2015)
describes [mainstream responses to climate change, in the form of carbon
markets and related mechanisms, as a kind of "post-politics" that offers
the fantasy of a purely technical fix for what are in reality deeply
political issues demanding dramatic socioeconomic
transformation]{.underline}. Mark Davidson analyzes mounting discussion
of "sustainable cities" as a similar fantasy offering the
(im)possibility of "continued economic growth without necessary
reductions in carbon emissions" (2012, 14). Building on this, Healy
(2014) describes [the fossil fuel dependency propelling global warming
as a form of "**addiction**," contending that this is sustained by a
capitalist "economy of enjoyment" that lures subjects into deep
attachment to an unsustainable society of which global warming
constitutes a key symptom.]{.underline}

More ambitiously, Sally Weintrobe (2013a) has assembled a collection of
psychoanalysts and others to explore the psychic mechanisms inhibiting
effective climate change response. [The key concept]{.underline} in this
collection [is]{.underline}, as one might expect,
"**[denial]{.underline}**." While denial has been a frequent topic in
critique of climate change politics, most centrally with respect to
efforts on the part of oil producers and others to impede or discredit
scientific evidence affirming the problem (see, e.g., Oreskes and Conway
2011; Healy 2014), [psychoanalysts focus on the ways in which particular
subjects may impede their own awareness of events.]{.underline}
Weintrobe (2013b) thus distinguishes three forms of denial. [Denialism
comprises "campaigns of misinformation about climate change, funded by
commercial and ideological interests]{.underline}" (Weintrobe 2013b, 7),
such as the ultraconservative Heartland Institute (Healy 2014).
[Negation "involves saying that something that is, is not" (Weintrobe
2013b, 7), as in efforts to directly refute the overwhelming scientific
evidence documenting global warming. A third form of denial, disavowal,
is more insidious, in that "reality is more accepted, but its
significance is minimized" (Weintrobe 2013b, 7). Phrased differently,
disavowal is a **simultaneous admission and denial**, or a state of
"half-knowing," that operates according to the formula "**I know very
well, but still** . . ."]{.underline} (Žižek 1989, 12). As a result,
Weintrobe asserts, [disavowal "is a more serious and intractable form of
denial," for "while negation says no to the truth, it does not distort
the truth. Disavowal, by contrast, can be highly organized at an
unconscious level and can become entrenched. It distorts the truth in a
**variety of artful ways.** Disavowal can lead us further and further
away from accepting the reality of climate change. This is because the
more reality is systematically avoided through making it insignificant
or through distortion, the more anxiety builds up unconsciously, and the
greater is the need to defend with further disavowal" (2013b,
7).]{.underline}

[Such disavowal commonly manifests as perversion, a dysfunctional state
involving a "**turning away from the truth**" (Layton 2010, 209) as "a
way of not coming to terms with loss]{.underline}" (Hoggett 2013, 59;
see also chapter 12 in this volume). In the case of climate change, Paul
Hoggett thus asserts, ["The majority of us in the West '**know'** the
facts, but we turn away from what we know" (2013, 60). Or more
precisely, "We 'know' and yet we seem ill-equipped to bear the pain of
what we know. In the perverse state of mind reality is not rejected
outright but is simultaneously acknowledged and disavowed" (Hoggett
2013, 61). To facilitate this "halfknowing," rather than outright
denying the problem disavowal characteristically "involves an
**entrenched 'quick fix' approach to problems**" rather than serious
inquiry into their complex causes and solutions (Weintrobe 2013b,
8).]{.underline}

[This is, as I have suggested earlier and elsewhere (Fletcher 2013b),
precisely **how neoliberal environmentalism tends to function**. By
disavowing the reality of neoliberal capitalism's contributions to
ecological degradation, this discourse sustains the fantasy that
degradation can be redressed through the same mechanisms that perpetuate
it if we are only able to "get the market right" by internalizing
environmental (and social) costs of production, thereby sending the
proper market signals to producers and consumers. Visions of carbon
markets and green cities]{.underline} smoothly paving the path to a
post-carbon society thus [serve as "**palliative fantasies that offer an
'easy fix'**"]{.underline} for a problem demanding substantial
socioeconomic transformation (Healy 2014, 182).

In this respect, [neoliberal environmentalism functions in much the same
manner as Žižek's oft-cited example of the chocolate laxative, an actual
product that claims to be the antidote to the
problem---constipation---that it itself precipitates (Fletcher 2014).
When Klein (2014) calls this approach "**magical thinking**," from a
psychoanalytic perspective this indeed can be seen as an extension of an
infant's magical efforts to avoid the reality principle and preserve a
sense of omnipotence in the face of increasing awareness of its limited
power to control the larger glObe (Mishan 1996).]{.underline}

Mourning and Melancholia

[Advocacy of neoliberal environmentalism in order to preserve the status
quo of mainstream capitalist society is rendered more paradoxical still
by evidence that for a significant segment of the population, including
many societal elites, this way of life is far from a satisfying
one]{.underline}. Signs of discontent within modern society have been
growing for some time (Freud 1962), expressed in all manner of media and
cemented by a growing body of research demonstrating a fundamental
disconnect between subjective happiness and material wealth beyond a
certain minimum threshold (see, e.g., Anielski 2007). [In other words,
both those denied the benefits of modern society and those receiving
them are **rendered unhappy by its excesses**]{.underline}. Why, then,
do many remain so attached to a way of life that not only degrades the
planet but makes them miserable as well?

For psychoanalysts, [attachment is cemented by the jouissance it
delivers. While this jouissance, as noted earlier, is rarely
unequivocally pleasurable, rather offering pleasure and pain in equal
measure, the fleeting pleasure it does provide reinforces commitment via
the **fantasy** that the pain can be **overcome** and pure pleasure
attained]{.underline}. Breaking attachment therefore requires the loss
of both this fantasy of total fulfillment and the limited jouissance
actually experienced. Facing this loss entails a process of mourning for
the pain of separation and deprivation of pleasure (see chapter 11). [To
avoid this pain, we tend to retain attachment at all costs, or when
forced to endure loss, we turn away from and repress the pain, in which
case mourning is replaced by **melancholia**, a state of low-level
depression precipitated by the inability to mourn and therefore
dissipate the negative]{.underline} emotion (Freud 1925). Melancholia is
supported by a variety of defense mechanisms, but one of the most
significant is [disavowal, which allows subjects to **half-acknowledge
their pain** while simultaneously denying its significance. Manifest as
perversion, this entails, paradoxically, **a (largely unconscious)
"'choice' to feel pain rather than suffer the painful
truth**]{.underline}**"** (Layton 2010, 309). One of psychoanalysis's
most important insights is that this dynamic of attachment occurs even
with respect to circumstances that subjects consider negative and that
they may explicitly claim to want to end. In short, as Žižek asserts in
the epigraph, attaining ["freedom hurts."]{.underline}

#### Optimistic calls for an environmental future fail to elude Scylla of Finitude and Charybdis of the Bad Infinite -- that ensures their project is inevitably undermined as they retrench the system

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 170-172, 20 September 2016,
MG)

One popular alternative in [the ecological movement]{.underline}, Ted
Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger's Break Through, [tries to counter
the narrative of the acceptance of human finitude proffered by earlier
environmentalists]{.underline} like Carson and James Lovelock (in The
Revenge of Gaia). [Against this narrative, which they label "tragic,"
they call for an **optimistic ecology**. 26 At the end of their
treatise, they ask those concerned about the current ecological crisis
to have the courage to **dream about large-scale transformative
projects** that would enable humanity to shatter the limits that have
hitherto functioned as absolute boundaries for both thought and
action]{.underline}.

Nordhaus and Shellenberger's political program successfully escapes the
lure of finitude that ensnares earlier environmentalists like Carson.
[They will not just erect **another limit that capital will attempt to
transcend**. But their success is ultimately also what **undermines this
program**. Rather than react against the logic of capitalism like the
environmentalists they attack, they freely **adopt** this logic through
their insistence on the wealth of possibilities for the future. In this
sense, they produce an ecology even more in tune with the demands of
capitalism.]{.underline}

[An ecological alternative to capitalism must elude the **Scylla of
finitude** and the **Charybdis of the bad infinite**]{.underline}, the
Scylla of Rachel Carson and the Charybdis of Ted Nordhaus and Michael
Shellenberger. [Doing so requires reconceiving nature not as an external
limit to capitalism nor as a site of infinite possibility but as the
**internal limit of human society**. The social order requires the
natural world in order to function, but the unpredictability of this
world constantly throws off social progress. Whether it's an earthquake
in Lisbon, the eruption of Mt. Krakatoa, or widespread death of
honeybees, nature has the capacity at any time to throw social
productivity out of joint. But this limit---this unpredictability and
violence of the natural world---can become an **internal limit of the
social order**, the basis for a true infinite.27 By starting with this
unpredictability as the limit, social production would orient itself
around addressing this limit without any possibility of ever
transcending it.]{.underline}

FAKING THE LIMIT

[Other attempts to erect barriers to the expansion of capitalism
inevitably run into the **same problem that besets environmentalism**.
The barriers do not deter but rather inspire the process of
commodification]{.underline}. Michal Sandel's What Money Can't Buy: The
Moral Limits of Markets and Debra Satz's Why Some Things Should Not Be
for Sale both lament this increasing commodification and propose that we
set limits on it. Sandel claims that [we are now witnessing "the growing
reach of money and markets into spheres of life once governed by
nonmarket norms."28]{.underline} Sandel is particularly upset about the
intrusion of advertising into the sports arena, but he also documents
the introduction of private inequalities into formerly public domains,
like highway lanes in which one can pay extra for the privilege of
using. Sandel wants to introduce some finitude into capitalism's
infinite expansion, and he argues for this position on the basis of
moral grounds. As he sees it, the claims of the market should not decide
every question. Some things are priceless.

But there is really nothing to separate Sandel's position from that of
MasterCard. In its very successful advertising campaign touting the
ability of MasterCard to pay for almost everything, the company admits
that there are some objects that have no price. Perhaps the most famous
of these commercials depicts an elephant assembling a care package for
his ailing keeper. The elephant takes a MasterCard to various stores,
and as he purchases the supplies, a voiceover announces their cost. The
voiceover says, "Hot soup: \$4. Cold medicine: \$11. Tissues: \$1.
Blanket: \$24. Making it all better: priceless." Just like Sandel,
MasterCard is perfectly willing to grant that some elements of life
cannot be figured in terms of the market. The company doesn't just use
the fantasy of a terrain outside the market to sell their product.
[Capitalism actually **requires** this barrier in order to **constitute
itself** as infinitely expanding. What is priceless today, one can be
sure, will have a price tomorrow, when something else will miraculously
become priceless.]{.underline}

### Link -- Europe

#### The fantasy of helping Europe impose "good governance" reflects and supplants racialized notions of responsibility onto ethnicized others

**Bousfield 18** (Dan Bousfield - professor in the Political Science
department at Western University, "Psychoanalysis and the GlObal",
University of Nebraska Press, Pages 38-40, 1 September 2018, MG)

The problem of capital as a unitary force is the substitute of faith for
an understanding of the historical and geopolitical trajectory of
societal relations. [The concept of Europe is **more** than an issue of
identity; it is a source of accumulation, profitability, and exclusion.
It helps to define just practice, legality, and the terrain of political
and social possibility. This stems from an equation of capital as a
unitary object with sovereign order, a top-down perspective of control
whereby the goal of all power and counterpower consists of people having
a unitary identity]{.underline}. Indeed, this understanding of power is
tainted by the issue of faith---that the ability to impose order itself
is inevitably subjective. As Žižek explains, "[Sovereignty always . . .
involves the **logic of the universal** and its constitutive exception:
the universal and unconditional rule of Law can be sustained only by a
sovereign power which reserves for itself the right to proclaim a state
of exception, that is, to suspend the rule of law(s) on behalf of the
Law itself---if we deprive the Law of the excess that sustains it, we
lose the (rule of) Law itself]{.underline}" (2006, 373).

From the Lacanian perspective, [fantasy is significant because its
existence sustains the semblance of law, sociality, and order (see
chapter 3). This is **typified in the concept of Europe**, an identity
that both **justifies and retroactively legitimates decisions** made in
its defense. Order is maintained by drawing on institutional and
contingent power by presenting that power as inevitable and inescapable.
Social order is maintained by the transgressions and excesses that are
inherent to sustaining order. This is a necessarily irrational and
subjective condition of capitalism, which stems from the structural
foundation of the state's authority and introduces a **deeply political
and contested core** to any assertion of capitalist power. Order is
never simply fully constituted, no more than it is apolitical or
ahistorical.]{.underline}

More to the point, Marx's notion of primitive accumulation addresses
this problem directly and continues to argue that struggle is inherent
in the most universalized forms of capitalization. As he argues:

Direct extra-economic force is still of course used, but only in
exceptional cases. In the ordinary run of things, the worker can be left
to the "natural laws of production," i.e. it is possible to rely on his
dependence on capital, which springs from the conditions of production
themselves, and is guaranteed in perpetuity by them. It is otherwise
during the historical genesis of capitalist production. The rising
bourgeoisie needs the power of the state, and uses it to "regulate"
wages, i.e. to force them into the limits suitable for making a profit,
to lengthen the working day, and to keep the worker himself at his
normal level of dependence. This is an essential aspect of so-called
primitive accumulation. (1977, 799-- 800)

The experience in common between developed capitalist workers and
communities facing forms of primitive accumulation is the use of
partisan political force to ensure the expansion and deepening of
capitalist commodification. This means that [all power is **inherently
fantastic**: it involves configurations and contingent conjunctures
(i.e., the Real) of subjective events that are defined by their inherent
subjectivity rather than their moments of abstract similarity.
Identification with order as objective represents an effort to avoid the
complicated and contested political practices that defy
oversimplifications of reason and predictability]{.underline}. Fantasy
is important because it undermines claims of objectivity and exposes the
desire to sublimate subjectivity. As an extension of this power,
politics needs to be seen as inherently fantastic, in that it is capable
of projecting a vision of the world that is greater than that which
exists. The supplemental belief of society's members is what renders
politics possible; there is a seeming cohesiveness, which is split by
their participation in processes of accumulation through which the
benefits are distributed by partisan, not abstract, processes. Lacanian
fantasy provides a foundation for challenging the myth of a universal
capital while thoroughly politicizing the nonrational and psychoanalytic
foundations of the contemporary capitalist system. However, unlike
Jean-François Lyotard's (1993) efforts to develop a libidinal economy,
here fantasy provides clear insights into both the politicization and
the need for counter-politicization of struggles over capital.
Psychoanalysis has not been able to develop a libidinal (nonrational)
foundation for economic analysis precisely because it has assumed a
totally subjectivized response to the objectifying processes of
capitalism (with the body as the starting point). Such an approach
misses the way in which capital itself is necessarily subjective and
therefore politicized from the outset.

There are thus three key aspects of [the European response to the crisis
and its relationship to faith and fantasy:]{.underline}

[1. Analysis of the problem: While responses to the crisis persistently
refer to systemic collapse, there is little direct consideration of the
systemic issues involved in the]{.underline} crisis. Unlike in the New
Deal or even after the 1997 East Asian financial crisis, little effort
has been made to change the fundamental practices that led to the
problem, and the ECB responses only further deepened the role of the
market in Europe. [Analysis of the crisis could be said to follow Naomi
Klein's (2007) **shock doctrine thesis** in that it compartmentalized
any larger analysis or possible connections with other political issues
(such as the failure to establish adequate funding for European
migration in these same regions). It also follows Klein's thesis that
the crisis has led to a deepening of **neoliberal privatization efforts
and** that this response **reflects historical and racialized notions of
responsibility**. When economic crises emerge, existing hierarchies of
power are able to hoist responsibility on ethnicized others, so Greek,
Spanish, and Portuguese debtors are scrutinized for cultural
deficiencies, whereas French and German creditors demand
"reasonable"]{.underline} solutions.

2\. The role of fantasy: The extent to which the economic crisis was
driven by a belief that debt would result in economic failure in new
eurozone members sustains a fantasy imposed by core ECB actors. Debt
ratios and the need for economic austerity are as much a product of the
vision of Europe as they are about underlying economic fundamentals.

3\. The role of faith: Despite the early and persistent argument about
public interest in ECB discussions on the goals of the intervention, the
constitutional separation of the ECB and fiscal policy mechanisms is a
persistent and ongoing matter of dogma. [The notion of fantasy is
important here for the way in which it both remakes the glObal through
faith, while simultaneously **occluding the truth of the mechanisms**
that expand and contribute to market civilization. The **ability to
impose mechanisms with no legal or constitutional basis and yet accept
limited responsibility** for bearing the costs of austerity is a project
of **historical and geopolitical power**]{.underline}. Greek and even
IMF objections to the ECB's plan were framed as hysterical and
unreasonable. [The language of mastery in economic policy occludes the
lack of an "objectivity" from any actor in the context of the
crisis]{.underline}. As Lacan argues, the hysterical subject is one that
acts out against the certainty provided by order (what he calls the
"Name of the Father"), trying to occupy the position of authority but
without the means to do so (see chapter 12). [The geopolitical core of
the European project utilizes the margins **as the place of failure to
impose "good governance**."]{.underline} The goal of a (psycho)analysis
of capital is to question the core assumptions of the current economic
system and to provide an alternative framework of interpretation of
these events.

### Link -- Existential Threats

#### The 1AC's invocation of apocalyptic imaginations is a product of the death drive -- through their repetitive simulation of destruction and salvation from \[x impact\], we come to enjoy an illusion of control over the presence and absence of the world, a fort-da game with human kind. 

**Matheson 15** \[Calum Matheson, PhD is Associate Professor of Public
Deliberation and Civic Life and the incoming Chair of the Department of
Communication at the University of Pittsburgh.; "Desired Ground Zeroes:
Nuclear Imagination and the Death Drive"; 2015;
https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/210598703.pdf\]//eleanor

This is the central argument of this dissertation: [the fascination and
terror of nuclear destruction are essentially connected by their
perceived reference to an unmediated Real.]{.underline} [Because the
Real cannot be perfectly represented, our efforts to mediate it
necessarily fail to completely capture reality, but the investments that
sustain our repeated efforts guarantee that they continue, for our very
beings demand connection with the world and each other.]{.underline}
That efforts to capture the Real do not succeed in that aim is not to
say that they are not productive, that rich array of theoretical tools
in communication studies should be abandoned, or that they are not
important. Indeed, these efforts are quite literally our entire world.
[To square our existence as subjects marked off from the totality of the
Real with our desire to experience it without mediation, we come to
enjoy the illusion of control over the presence and absence of the
world]{.underline}, as in Freud's fort-da game. In the nuclear context,
[we **repetitively simulate destruction and salvation**, worlds without
us and ones made present for our habitation. **Nuclear
imaginations**]{.underline} persist after the Cold War [and their
various tropes have **metastasized** into new **apocalyptic
imaginations**]{.underline}: **[environmental
destruction]{.underline}**, **[terrorism]{.underline}**,
**[pandemics]{.underline}**, even **[zombies]{.underline}**. While the
Bomb did not inaugurate apocalyptic fear, the tropes and habits
developed by its mediation in the intense crucible of the Cold War
influence the way these other crises are mediated. More fundamentally[,
the economy of cathectic investment that animates these cultural
assemblages is a product of the death drive---perhaps unfortunately
named because it is not a wish for death but a wish for unmediated
experience evident only in the constant attempts to mediate that same
experience.]{.underline} As that drive has communication at its core,
the tools of communication studies are the appropriate means to study it
and the various discourses, material practices, and technological
artifices that arise from its operation. To do so might reveal much
about communication itself, along with the limits and possibilities of
how we respond politically to the threat of human extinction. I do not
intend to create a complete, self-contained system to schematize the
Real. Such a thing is impossible because the Real is by definition that
which escapes symbolic assimilation. In suggesting that the Real is the
intrusion of the non-human world into the symbolic network of the
social, I aim to explore how [the perceived limits of communication
inform what discourses develop to explain and order nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

### Link -- Existential Risk Cooperation

#### Attempting to cooperate over existential risks is a failed project -- their desire to impose continuity and order onto chaos is an illusion of mastery.

This dissertation does not have an answer for Lenin's most famous
question. Nuclear warfare is still a possibility. [Every few months a
crisis occurs where the Bomb lurks in the shadows---the Korean DMZ, the
Kashmir Line of Control, the Spratly Islands, the Kurile Islands, Iran,
Israel, the Crimean Peninsula and Donbass. The major change from the
Cold War might not be that nuclear war is less probable, or even less
likely to wipe out humanity (if that was ever possible), but that it is
no longer seen as the only likely threat capable of doing so. **Climate
change**, itself identified and modeled with the help of simulations
designed initially for modeling the effects of nuclear war, has become a
more prominent issue. The term replaces "global warming" because it
ostensibly reflects the Earth's reality more accurately. It shares much
with the Bomb: **apocalyptic predictions, survivor and disaster
fiction**, and the sense of **humanity destroying itself through
advancements in tech**nology. Both issues have inspired much spilled
ink, many conflicts between politicians, news media, and public figures,
solemn efforts for international cooperation, and very little effective
change]{.underline}. The brief, euphoric atmosphere of global unity as
the Warsaw Pact states dissolved did not result in a permanent communion
between the Earth's peoples. But [**to expect harmony** is to believe in
the **impossibility of an eventual triumph of automaton** against the
caprice of tuché. The **many pledges for global
cooperation**]{.underline} from Kellogg-Briand to BushGorbachev [**have
all unraveled**. **Continuity and order** in this sense appear to be
**impossible so far,** and in their failures the **contingency of the
Real emerges**. We still attempt to bridge these rifts, but we also seem
to enjoy the vertigo that comes with staring into them. We are enjoined
to stay on the bridge, to step back from the edge. After all, one single
mistake could destroy everything, and the logic of infinite risk is part
of the sign of survival that disciplines us when we drift too far
towards the forbidden enjoyment of apocalyptic imagination. The command
to survive pins the discourse of nuclear weapons together. Survival is
such an overwhelmingly powerful site for cathectic investment that it
can outshine all others, allowing any risk to be run along the way. The
basic foundation of deterrence is the threat of nuclear
retaliation]{.underline}, ultimately [against cities]{.underline}. The
United States, attacked by Russia, would detect incoming weapons and
launch its own in return before they could be lost ("use it or lose it,"
in Cold War parlance). Of course enemy military power would already be
incoming; it would be pointless to destroy empty missile silos, so at
least implicitly, the threat is against tens of millions of Russians who
might not even know that the war had started. In other words, **[the
basic national strategy of NATO, Russia, China, and other nuclear states
relies on planning to commit genocide on an unprecedented scale against
people that each of them argues are oppressed by their own
government]{.underline}**. [The rational reason to threaten a nuclear
war is to prevent a nuclear war]{.underline}. Thus, [nuclear weapons
threaten survival in the name of protecting it. Every atrocity and
degradation of life that does not threaten human extinction is tolerable
to prevent one that does, in a "tyranny of survival"]{.underline}
(Callahan 92-100[). This tolerance for risk applies equally to
disarmament---after all, the chief argument made against it is that it
weakens deterrence and allows the "other side" freedom to initiate a
nuclear conflict without fear of reprisal]{.underline}. [Nuclear
strategists treated human survival like poker, but to seek a
justification for this policy is closer to Three-card Monte. The
investment in survival cannot be rational. Despite the immense
importance we attach to it, at bottom, there is nothing but a
void.]{.underline} Why survive at all? This might be one of the last
truly forbidden questions to which we have failed to generate an answer.
[If there is some cosmic plan for humanity in the Real, it eludes us.
Any assertion of value---that we are intelligent life, that death brings
suffering, that we are obliged to future generations, and so
forth---simply leads to another "why," in the kind of game toddlers
routinely play. Efforts to avoid nuclear war, both through deterrence
and disarmament, rely on supposedly rational means to reach a goal that
is fundamentally irrational.]{.underline} One reaction has been
"virulent nihilism," as in Nick Land's book of that name, or Thomas
Liggotti's declaration that human existence is "malignantly useless" and
consciousness a "long con." Ray Brassier, who wrote an introduction to
Ligotti's book, expresses similar sentiments in Nihil Unbound. There is
even a Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT, pronounced
"vehement") and a Church of Euthanasia which councils suicide and
cannibalism, amongst other solutions. If there is no reason for
survival, why bother? Why keep looking for something we will never find?
The insights of the death drive seem to lead to a very bleak conclusion:
we cannot live in the Real, at least not in a way meaningful to others.
We are condemned to seek after an object that we cannot have, endlessly
falling short, endlessly cracking the artifice of the Symbolic walls
that contain us, and, seeing the light filter through, repairing them
rather than tearing them down.

### Link -- Globalization

#### Discourses of globalization are an ideological fantasy that acts as cover for the logic of social apartheid that constructs anxiety, fear, and resentment towards the Other

**Kapoor 18** (Ilan Kapoor - professor of Critical Development Studies
at the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change at York University in
Toronto, "Psychoanalysis and the GlObal", University of Nebraska Press,
Pages 20-22, 1 September 2018, MG)

[Seen in this light, the discourse of globalization is a kind of
**rebranding of imperialism**]{.underline} (Halliday 2002, 77),
[attempting to obscure its many symptomatic ills (the Real), ranging
from inequality and environmental destruction to "illegal" migration and
cultural deracination (or, to riff on the "vulgar" sexual overtones of
"hole," globalization discourse is a bid to disavow capital's unceasing
penetration \[invagination?\] and buggery of the glObe).]{.underline} As
Žižek (2008, 102) points out, i[ncreasingly we have greater mobility of
capital but declining movement of people, with the construction of
physical and politico-legal barriers to better and more strictly
regulate the flow of people (e.g., "fortress Europe," walls between
Israel and Palestine and the United States and Mexico, gated
communities, slum cities).]{.underline} The human dimension of
globalization is thus greater immobility. To ensure its smooth
functioning, [global capitalism requires a **logic of social
apartheid**, positioning people as either "inside" or "outside" the
formal social economy]{.underline}. It is this other side of
globalization---its fissures, gaps, and exclusions ---that several
chapters in this book make it a point to examine: the "disempowered"
women of the global South (chapter 6); the favelas in Recife, Brazil
(chapter 11); the dispossessed and unemployed in Egypt who rise up
against authoritarianism and austerity (chapter 12); and the enraged
white working classes that elect Trump or vote for Brexit (epilogue).

[But if globalization is often a code word for economic discipline and
social apartheid, it is also a **cover for hostility and war**. The
never-ending "war on terrorism" is just a recent manifestation of this,
but there are countless other conflicts (e.g., the invasions of Iraq and
Afghanistan, the toppling of the Allende regime in Chile, perhaps even
the First World War---if Lenin \[1917\] is to be believed) that are also
the product of the violence, inequality, and imperialism that lie at the
core of globalization.]{.underline} In this regard, in chapter 5, Anna
Secor focuses on the war in Syria and its production of human suffering
and refugees. She reflects on [the affective dimensions of conflict and
migration---their circuits of anxiety and obscene
enjoyment---underlining once again the **libidinal underpinnings of the
Real of globalization**]{.underline}. Her intervention [strikes a
cautionary note for those who **too easily rejoice at the greater
exchange**, communication, and border crossing enabled by globalization:
despite human suffering and need, the Other---the neighbor, the refugee,
the migrant---is not necessarily a welcome friend. Psychoanalytically
speaking, the Other can in fact be a **traumatic intruder**, whose
sociocultural differences trouble or threaten us (see Žižek 2006). As a
consequence, the closeness of the Other brought about by global flows,
far from being a cause for celebration, can instead yield to **anxiety,
fear, resentment, or even envy** (see the epilogue).]{.underline}

Psychoanalysis, in the way that it is deployed in this book, therefore,
is a way of doing an ideology critique of globalization. To the extent
that [the **discourse of globalization constructs an ideological
fantasy**---"the spread of capitalism yields prosperity," "free trade is
beneficial to all," "globalization brings about greater mobility and
mutual understanding"---the role of psychoanalysis is to help uncover
the Real (excess, anxiety, hostility) that such a fantasy
disavows]{.underline}. Following Žižek (1989), the contributors of this
book argue, in fact, that [ideology can no longer be prosecuted only
through ideas; it increasingly requires **identifying the kernel of
enjoyment** on which ideology is founded]{.underline}. In a world where
critique is easily blunted or coopted (e.g., green- and pink-washing,
the granting of minority civil rights as opposed to broader
socioeconomic or land rights), ideology critique must happen not just at
the level of the intellect---identifying its blind spots or
exclusions---but, more important, at the level of affects---reckoning
with its production, maintenance, and circulation of (unconscious)
desire. And here, only psychoanalysis can offer us insights.

Finally, a note about the potential for change associated with such a
psychoanalytic perspective: [because the Real at the core of the global
is so **destabilizing**, this very destabilization can be grounds for a
transformative politics. Unconscious desire or enjoyment may well bind
us to (capitalist) globalization, but its excess and unpredictability
may also open up spaces for liberation]{.underline}. This is the import
of Fletcher's and MacDonald's contributions (chapters 3 and 4,
respectively), each arguing for the need to reorient desire toward an
alternative global political economy. [If our unconscious attachments to
the contemporary global order are what help hold it in place, then
drawing on other modalities of desire or struggling to turn our
jouissance to alternative ideological practices may be **our only way
out**. In]{.underline} chapters 11 and 12, Pieter de Vries and I agree
with the need for such a reorientation, but we each warn of the perils
of so doing: in the context of the local politics of Recife, de Vries
pins the disarray of the Left on its having compromised its desire for
change in the face of neoliberal market forces, and similarly, in the
context of Egypt's 2011 revolution, I analyze how a radical "hysterical"
political movement is seduced by the comfort and stability of the status
quo. [Thus, a politics of the Real rooted in the difficult struggle to
reorient our unconscious desires is promising but never guaranteed; it
can **all too easily be diverted by the hegemony of the
glObal**.]{.underline}

### Link -- Images

#### Images do nothing but preserve the status quo -- all the radical usage of it did was create anxiety of the Other

**Secor 18** (Anna J. Secor PhD -- Profesor of Cultural Geographies at
Durham University , "Psychoanalysis and the GlObal", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 96-98, 1 September 2018, MG)

[The image as it circulated incited an **eruption of affective
politics**---that is, politics framed not by ideology but as a passage a
l'acte riding on a surge of feeling. This event manifests what Brian
Massumi calls the role of "images as the **conveyers of forces of
emergence**, as vehicles for existential potentialization and transfer"
(2002, 43). Massumi places the mass circulation of images within the
context of an affective theory of late capitalist power, wherein they
perform as relays for the transmission of potential that is then
inhibited in its emergence as part of the **cultural-political
functioning of the media** and connected apparatuses]{.underline}. This
idea of the image as the bearer of affective power owes a debt to Walter
Benjamin's "dialectical image," or [the image that emerges in a flash to
threaten the **preservation of the status quo** with the instantaneous
irruption of the now]{.underline} (2002, 473, N9,7). As an event, the
image of the dead child can be seen as just such a blast of
now-time---though whether the measures taken in the wake of the
explosion dislodge the "continuity of history" is a question to which I
will return (Benjamin 2002, 474, N9a,6).

[But first, what affect is transmitted in the circulation of
the]{.underline} Kurdi [image?]{.underline} O'Neill, the journalist
quoted earlier, refers to "a self-satisfied feeling of sadness." But
rather than sadness, I will argue that [anxiety is the primary affective
register of the image within the politicaleconomic context of its
circulation]{.underline}. And I wager that my focus on anxiety makes
sense, psychoanalytically speaking: for Lacan (2014), [anxiety is really
the **affect**, the only one that matters. It is that which does not
deceive. **Sorrow, anger, joy, shame**---these may be red herrings,
leading the conscious subject away from that which it cannot bear. But
anxiety is always true.]{.underline}

Second, how does the Kurdi picture solicit anxiety? And what is the
topological structure of that anxiety? [According to Lacan, if we are
anxious, it is because we have been confronted with the **unbearable
loss at the root of our desire**. This loss is not the loss of a little
boy's life. Although we see ourselves as being moved by his death, in
our effusions we are **not mourning** Alan Kurdi so much as we are being
stirred to anxiety. So how, then, does this photograph, in the
sociopolitical context of its circulation, make us anxious]{.underline}?
In other words, how does it confront us with the Real of human
inconsistency, [with the fear of the radioactive Otherness that inhabits
us?]{.underline}

[Manifestly, the image calls forth **expressions of responsibility**, of
shared humanity, of an obligation to act. It speaks the language of what
Didier Fassin calls "humanitarian reason": "the vocabulary of suffering,
compassion, assistance, and responsibility to protect forms of our
political life" (2012, 2). The child is the hook for this humanitarian
discourse because]{.underline}, as Miriam Ticktin explains, "The
quintessential humanitarian victims bear no responsibility for their
suffering. [Their innocence is what qualifies them for humanitarian
compassion]{.underline}. As innocents, they are pure, without guile, and
without intent---they are seemingly outside politics and certainly
outside blame for their misfortune. [Yet who are these perfect victims?
Interestingly, children are usually the face of humanitarianism; they
are represented as innocent victims of famine, war, or natural disaster"
(2015, para. 4).]{.underline}

Kurdi serves as such an innocent victim of the war in Syria and the
international regime that lets refugees die and wash up on the shore
like so much "wreckage, dreck, and waste" (Rich 1991, 4). The innocence
of the dead body is what gives the photograph its affective charge. The
obscenity of India Today's photograph of Chinese dissident artist Ai Wei
Wei posing as Kurdi on the shore of Lesbos arises from the dissonance
between the scripted innocence of the dead child and the staged
manipulation attributed to the (live) man (fig. 4; Chung 2016).

[What follows the "viral" circulation]{.underline} of the Kurdi
image---[the surge of statements, signatures, money---is a **discharge
of political action** that rides the affective wave]{.underline}. Like
the student that ejaculates when he hands in his final exam (Lacan 2014,
169), [the political rush comes at the height of our anxiety. Why?
Because, for Lacan, jouissance protects the imaginary body from
encountering the **impasse of the Real**]{.underline} (see chapters 3
and 7). [The surge of action---however short-lived or
rhetorical---following the international dissemination of the photograph
thus appears as a response to the intimate geopolitical anxieties
incited by the circulating image. In this response, there is an attempt
to annul the anxiety produced by the unbearable pain of lack with
actions that serve to **(re)constitute a consistency of
meaning**]{.underline} around the image of the dead child.

In the passage to action that follows the Alan Kurdi photo, there is a
moment of bliss---a moment when the boundary between us seems to
dissolve, when humanity appears as one--- followed by the inevitable end
of this ecstatic transport and the return to the stability of the known
order. [The affect of anxiety moves the subject along the trajectory
between jouissance and its lethal end (detumescence, castration, or
death).]{.underline} Thus, in eroto-politics, short bursts of political
action give pleasure in the first moment and then offer us a return to
known consistencies in the second moment. The trajectory between these
moments assuages our anxiety and deflects our encounter with the
traumatic real.

To this point I have been staging my analysis as though there is a
dyadic relationship between the image and our desire. Yet I do not think
this is an adequate topological structure for either a
political-geographic understanding or a psychoanalytic understanding of
the anxiety that the image calls forth. [It is not just between the
image and our lack (our desire) that the anxiety and the jouissance of
action take place. The image **does not exist in
isolation**]{.underline}; what we are talking about when we talk about
the Kurdi photograph is the image and the sociosymbolic-political
context of its circulation. The image of Kurdi is thus bound to its
affective load---to the anxiety that signals an opening to the impasses
of the Real---through a third party, through the Other. [Because,
although it is true that we become anxious, the image does not primarily
aim at our unwinding; what puts us on the hook is the desire of the
Other, and thus it is the **Other's anxiety that is the primary target
of the photo**. In other words, the image does not provoke our anxiety
directly; it does not itself interrogate us at the point of our desire.
But instead it works on us through its call for God's anxiety---that is,
the anxiety of the **Other** whose law it is that recognizes in the
child's corpse a debasement of the human.]{.underline}

### Link -- Nukespeak

#### The aff sustains the 'nuclear priesthood' of debate -- in an attempt to control the absolute contingency of the Real, we repetitively invest in a practice of control over nuclear weapons which becomes a form of violent repetition compulsion that turns the case.

[It is tempting to answer this question as many disarmament advocates
are]{.underline} wont to do [by citing the folly of ignoring ongoing
dangers of nuclear war. Indeed, some persistent nuclear threats which
have the potential to kill millions, or perhaps billions, of people were
a few things to go quite wrong.]{.underline} Russian-American nuclear
tension is rising sharply after recent violence in Ukraine, and there is
talk of a "new Cold War." Nuclear weapons are still maintained in a
state of readiness that increases the chance of an "accidental" nuclear
war. While safeguards are supposedly in place to reduce the chance that
such a catastrophe might occur, there are reasons to doubt their
efficacy. It has come to light that the codes for U.S. Permissive Action
Links (PALS) were set to a string of zeroes by the Strategic Air Command
(SAC) to circumvent the safety measure, while personnel and safety
problems continue to plague nuclear forces (Blair 2004; Hoff 2014).
Meanwhile, tensions with North Korea, ongoing disputes in South Asia,
and the increase in Chinese military might has some Pentagon analysts
thinking again about just how fiery the Pacific Rim might become. [The
argument has been made that the public must be reminded of nuclear
horror for only the immediacy of danger conveyed in lurid descriptions
of societal destruction can turn us away from our impending doom and
encourage us to demand democratic oversight.]{.underline} In
communication studies, the peak of nuclear weapons scholarship occurred
in the 1980s following Jacques Derrida's call for "nuclear criticism"
and the psychological work of Robert Jay Lifton (Derrida "No
Apocalypse;" Lifton). Although not universally present, [much of this
work exhibits a concern with accountability and democratic
responsibility, **assuming that it is ultimately more deliberation that
will curb the excesses of nuclear warfare**]{.underline}. A number of
rhetoricians participated in this debate by emphasizing their field's
traditional concern for public deliberation, although often in novel
ways. David Cratis Williams attempted to combine Derrida's approach with
the insights of Kenneth Burke (Williams). Barry Brummett relied on
Burke's language of perfection and motives to explain several nuclear
debates current in the decade (Brummett). Bryan C. Taylor is one of the
few scholars of rhetoric who has continued to write about nuclear
weapons ("'A Hedge Against the Future;'" Nuclear Legacies; "Nuclear
Weapons and Communication Studies;" "Our Bruised Arms;" "Radioactive
History"). Outside the field of rhetoric, Carol Cohn's work on the
language of defense intellectuals has significant affinities with these
pieces (Cohn). William Chaloupka's book Knowing Nukes also treats the
rhetoric of nuclear weapons from a poststructuralist standpoint
(Chaloupka). These various works tend to focus on the rhetoric of
nuclear weapons as an instrumental concern. They focus primarily on
organization for political action, the formation of public attitudes, or
the content of specific metaphors, as in Ron Hirschbein's Massing the
Tropes: The Metaphorical Construction of American Nuclear Strategy. More
materially-oriented work has also been done to expose elements of the
nuclear complex, even as the topic has increasingly been eclipsed by the
study of newer technologies (drones, surveillance, and so forth). Jeremy
Packer and Joshua Reeves's work on the SAGE nuclear warning system, for
example, compares it to increasingly automated drone warfare to locate a
logic of anthropophobia (Packer and Reeves). Peter van Wyck has studied
the attempt to communicate the danger of nuclear waste at the Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant (Van Wyck). Rey Chow's The Age of the World Target
uses the atomic bomb to examine a larger epistemological shift in
relation to visual mediation, an argument which I will expand in Chapter
3 to note the Bomb's differential effect on the dynamics of race and
class across space. Explicitly or subtly, [the implication of much of
this work is that criticism should aim at uncovering the logics,
artefacts, and ongoing consequences of nuclear war preparations, if not
as a solution, then at least as a necessary precursor to
one]{.underline}, and therefore resembles the more rhetorically-oriented
work of the 1980s and after. Although [this work]{.underline} is
important and helpful, I will argue that much of it [downplays the very
attributes that make nuclear war unique]{.underline}. It is unsurprising
that scholarship in communication studies tends to focus on the
potential for political awareness and change based on language or
symbolic action. Rhetorical criticism has roots in the deliberative
discourse of ancient Athens and emphasizes the important link between
rhetoric and democratic change. [**To call for more public
deliberation** or transparency **on nuclear war** is to **treat it like
any other issue** of national politics **that can be studied, debated,
and ultimately addressed as rhetoric motivates political
action.**]{.underline} Indeed, a great deal of media exists to make
meaning out of the Bomb, organize its potential use, and describe its
political significance. **[In the Bomb's inaugural moment at
Trinity]{.underline}**, however, **[the immediate reaction was
silence,]{.underline}** [followed by a **conviction that language was an
inadequate tool to convey the experience.**]{.underline} [**The
"unthinkable," "unspeakable," and "unsayable" qualities of nuclear war**
have since been repeatedly affirmed]{.underline}. **[The Bomb seems to
escape symbolization, to gesture towards something beyond
mediation]{.underline}**. [Many commentators struggle to speak at a
limit where "language no longer acts as currency]{.underline}," to
borrow from Georges Bataille (Erotism 276). [What happens when the
crisis in which we must intervene is one defined in part by the failure
of the symbolic efficiency of language? How can we communicate a
political response when the advent of the Bomb is understood to sunder
mediation itself? **The awesome power of the Bomb reveals the
fundamental inability of language to fully capture the universe beyond
human reality, the precariousness of our existence, and the
arbitrariness of our beliefs**]{.underline}. But [with all the horror of
the unknown, there is also an unmistakable fascination with the promise
of unmediated continuity with reality.]{.underline} My argument here is
not that communication inevitably fails, although certainly it often
does. [Language is not too small for the task. Reality is too big.
Sometimes, especially when **we attempt to understand something that
threatens human extinction**, we are confronted with the fact that the
**universe far outstrips our capacity to understand,** that the world we
build for ourselves does not exhaust all chance and possibility but
sometimes **appears to teeter on the edge of the meaningless chaos
intimated by a universe in which we are the center only for
ourselves**]{.underline}. [There is an excess that is understood as
beyond mediation, but our efforts to communicate continue. The awestruck
silence of the Bomb still works on the language that we do produce as we
attempt to find the means to describe it.]{.underline} For Bataille,
there was continuity---the unmediated world without distinctions imposed
by human classification, the world we seek in love and death (Bataille,
Erotism 12-13). For Heidegger, what lurked in the shadow of human
artifice was the "gigantic" (das Risige), an intimation of some
incalculable greatness (135). For Longinus, the sublime was the force of
"greatness" that made language overwhelm rather than persuade, the power
beyond language that could only be partially intimated by its skillful
use (4). These concepts all dovetail with Lacan's Real, deliniated more
completely in Chapter 1. [The Real is not the world of non-human objects
and forces but the eruption of that world into the mediated world of
human society constructed and maintained by our communication with one
another. **Excess**]{.underline}, whether approached through the
language of the Real, the sublime, continuity, or Heidegger's
"gigantic," [**shapes the field of language** around it like the gravity
well of a black hole observable by its distortions]{.underline}. [These
distortions guide our investments in some tropes over others and shape
the economy of affects1 that animate meaning and create the durable
constructs through which we attempt to connect with one
another]{.underline}. [We cannot respond to the Bomb by exposing its
"reality" in writing, speeches, films, or any other media without
implicitly playing its game by insisting that language can accurately
convey the excess of the Real because the question is not one of greater
precision in language but whether any medium is capable of assimilating
the Real, a task which is impossible by definition]{.underline}. [In
acting as if this was not the case, we **participate in the desire for
unmediated access to reality** that **maintains the Bomb's power in the
first place.** **Too much debate over nuclear policy sidelines this
sense of the Bomb as infinite, focusing on the techniques of
organization and persuasion to the detriment of the ultimate questions
that make the Bomb so powerful and creating a linguistic framework in
which these questions are written off, or at best appended as "useful
embellishment," only "received into mainstream discourse when presented
as appendages to currently debated political options**]{.underline}"
(Chernus, Nuclear Madness 59). [The Real of the Bomb reveals the
incompleteness of this world and motivates attempts to find what we
imagine is concealed beneath it. Nuclear obliteration is to its devotees
perhaps even a promise of divine Truth that offers transcendence of the
fallen world of mediation in which reality is never complete. With such
a contradictory set of attachments, it is hard to imagine that efforts
to think about the Bomb can achieve their goals---while they might
demonstrate their own consistent logic, the rationality of nuclear
politics is warped by the intrusion of the Real and the desire to
commune with it directly]{.underline}. Communication studies is full of
cogent analyses of instances where language or other media worked very
well indeed to organize political responses, persuade audiences, bind
people together around texts, and change attitudes, but these accounts
are incomplete without attention to the Real. The subject of nuclear war
challenges how we think about communication itself and demands new
thinking on the limits of mediation. The central question of this
dissertation is not how should we talk about nuclear war, but what can
nuclear war show us about how we attempt to mediate that which we
understand to exceed the limits of mediation itself? For attempt we do.
**[The vertiginous hole in the whole of reality is only the first part
of the Bomb's relationship to desire. Nature abhors a vacuum, and so
does the symbolic order through which the human world is
built]{.underline}**. [The Symbolic]{.underline}, as Jacques Lacan
styles it, [cannot tolerate the revelation of its inadequacy in the
Real, the tears left in our map by the inhuman world]{.underline}. [We
endlessly attempt to heal the rifts of the Real, to feign unicity where
it has failed]{.underline} (Lundberg 2-3). **[The response to chaos is
control; order is imposed against contingency in an effort to re-impose
coherence]{.underline}**. This dynamic of automaton (order) scripted
over tuché (contingency) is developed in Chapter 2. When [these attempts
fail---and because the Real by its nature cannot be assimilated, they
must---we simply try again]{.underline}. In Lacanian psychoanalysis,
[this dynamic is the repetition compulsion, in which the subject tries
again and again to control the conditions for presence and absence,
enjoying not the outcome but the exercise of subjectivity itself in the
capacity to act and to choose. Subjectivity requires the sacrifice of
continuity through the formation of the alienating identity of the
mirror phase]{.underline}, a process explained more in Chapters 1 and 2.
[Discontinuous subjects are organized in part around the
lack---something that would make them whole again, represented in an
object that is never more than a partial stand-in for this missing
completion]{.underline}. Frustrated in the quest for something outside,
we enjoy our own subjectivity.2 In [the context of nuclear war, this
meant ever more sophisticated simulations of a phenomenon about which we
remained basically uncertain. This is the second movement of desire in
(or for) the Bomb. The enjoyment of our **reasserted control over the
Bomb** manifested in the **repeated attempts to simulate its use** and
predict its aftermath.]{.underline} The fort-da game described by Freud
and explained here in the first two chapters is an important tool for
unpacking this dynamic because it posits a sense of control over
presence and absence as the condition for a subject's enjoyment. Fort-da
refers to the game in which a child makes an object disappear and
reappear in succession, simulating her or his mother's coming and going
and the possibility of her eventual disappearance. [Enjoyment comes from
the subject's control over these states of presence and absence, a small
example of imposing order in a world of seeming chaos]{.underline}
(Freud, Beyond the Pleasure Principle 13-17). [Understanding this is
necessary to draw the common threads between the cold-blooded excesses
of Pentagon nuclear plans, the compulsion that leads survivalists to
stockpile rooms full of MREs, and the appeal that apocalyptic videogames
hold for millions of players]{.underline}. In all of these pursuits,
**[the world is made absent in the fantasy of destruction and present
again in the myth of reconstruction, survival, and
rebirth.]{.underline}**

### Link -- Nuclear Deterrence

#### The aff's repetitive process of imagining scenarios of nuclear deterrence failure and strategizing about how to improve deterrence is an illusion of mastery -- but, this game of poker playing denies the Bomb's symbolic place beyond rational calculation which means their project inevitably fails.

[The disturbance of Symbolic order by the contingency of the Real is met
with an attempt to restore order, to respond to chance with
law]{.underline}. Lacan describes this dynamic as the interplay of tuché
and automaton: Where do we meet this real? For what we have in the
discovery of psycho-analysis is an encounter, an essential
encounter---and appointment to which we are always called with a real
that eludes us... First, the tuché, which we have borrowed...from
Aristotle, who uses it in his search for cause. We have translated it as
the encounter with the real. [The real is beyond the automaton, the
return, the coming-back, the insistence of the signs, by which we see
ourselves governed by the pleasure principle. The real is that which
always lies behind the automaton]{.underline}...it is this that is the
object of \[Freud's\] concern. (Lacan, Four Fundamental Concepts, 53-54,
italics in original) [This is the central element of the repetition
compulsion. Driven to make our encounter with the Real, we are
perpetually disappointed, but the Symbolic world of reality abhors a
vacuum.]{.underline} [Automaton describes the endless attempts to reach
the Real which are doomed to failure but cannot be surrendered, so are
repeated again and again. These repetitive behaviors thus develop an
aspect of order, and are, paradoxically, orderly attempts to reach the
chaos of contingency]{.underline}. [They are also linked by]{.underline}
Lacan [gambling, death, and signification]{.underline} ("Purloined
Letter" 28-29). [**Nuclear deterrence** can be read]{.underline} in this
frame [as an attempt to]{.underline} **[secure the world against the
contingency of the Real]{.underline}**, **[the uncertainty of nuclear
war]{.underline}**. It is the STRATCOM automaton's answer to the chaos
of the Bomb's tuché. [But the attempt to restore order has at its heart
a desire to encounter the Real]{.underline}. In a history of **[nuclear
defense intellectuals]{.underline}**, Fred Kaplan described them in the
1980s at the height of their power having [come with the **mission "to
impose order**," but **lacking any means** to **control the wild abandon
of the Bomb** in a hypothetical war for which there was no precedent,
"in the end, chaos still prevailed]{.underline}" (Kaplan 391). [Desire
is the motive force, and that what we desire cannot be attained is what
requires repetition. When the chaos of tuché reigns, automaton does not
surrender, but comes to be an end in itself, a site of
investment]{.underline}. **[Repetition itself becomes enjoyable. In
repeatedly simulating nuclear war,]{.underline}** [defense intellectuals
who could not experience the Real of nuclear violence could **enjoy the
illusion of mastery** over the terror and fascination inspired by the
Real by appea**ring to simulate the conditions of presence and
absence**---in this case, **the presence of the world-for-us** and **its
absence in the Bomb's inferno.**]{.underline} Langdon [Winner
distinguishes between risk (a term prevalent in both nuclear war and
poker) and threat or hazard on these grounds]{.underline}: **[risk
always has an implied benefit to it, an element of desire and an
opportunity for control]{.underline}** (145). [There is little empirical
basis for nuclear war simulations and the calculations of probability
they rely on, so nuclear war plans always require a good deal of faith,
and thus to adopt them is a risk---a calculation of both hazard and
reward]{.underline} (Ghamari-Tabrizi 8). [Their parameters are set
arbitrarily by the personnel who design them. In other words, they are
games of chance in which we also manipulate the rules. This is the
obscene supplement of nuclear deterrence]{.underline} that Vice Admiral
Giardina could not be allowed to reveal: **[we don't just repeat nuclear
simulations again and again because we think that they will someday be
perfect. War games are fun, and we don't always care about the
rules.]{.underline}** [Poker, after all, was rumored to be the genesis
of game theory at the RAND Corporation, prominent modelers of nuclear
war, and was a favorite pastime of the defense intellectuals who sought
to tame the world with human reason]{.underline} (Arbella 51-53). This
chapter will begin with an exploration of war games as media for access
to the Real of nuclear war and sites of cathexis that permit the subject
to enjoy its discontinuity, using the videogame First Strike as an
example of enjoyment even amongst those who claim to resist the nuclear
status quo. [War games were supposed to model the conduct of war, but
they were also supposed to predict when and how it might
occur.]{.underline} John von Neumann's game theory and Kenneth Arrow's
resulting rational choice theory, both elaborated at the RAND
Corporation, attempted to quantify human conduct to explain the world.
The second part of this chapter will deal with [a problem that arises
from attempts to make decisions based on nuclear war predictions.
Because the Bomb as a herald of the Real occupies a **place beyond
rational calculation**, the **mathematical language of nuclear war
attempts to calculate the incalculable**. The result is a theological
impasse which provides argumentative resources equally to activists and
their enemies, illustrating the unassimilable distortions worked by the
contingency of the Real in the Symbolic attempts to contain
it.]{.underline} War Games Herman Kahn and Bernard Brodie, perhaps the
most prominent American [strategists]{.underline} of the early Cold
War[, **tried to make nuclear war "thinkable**" in the sense that they
tried to **explain how such a war might start** and **what options would
exist for national leaders.**]{.underline} At the same time, both
acknowledged that the outcome of a full-scale nuclear war was
indescribable. In Brodie's words, to "make an intellectual prediction of
the likelihood of war is one thing, to project oneself imaginatively and
seriously into an expected war situation is quite another"
(Ghamari-Tabrizi 149). [The unwillingness or inability to think
"seriously" about a nuclear war---in other words, to understand it
instrumentally rather than through dislocating language of the
sublime---was met by organizations like the RAND Corporation with an
attempt to systematize nuclear strategy and develop the intellectual and
technical means to actually fight and control a nuclear
war]{.underline}. Before RAND exercised its power through the "Whiz
Kids" of the Kennedy Administration, the Strategic Air Command's "Sunday
punch" nuclear plan, enshrined in SIOP-62, was an all-out nuclear attack
on the USSR, Eastern Europe, and the People's Republic of China. It
might have killed 285 million people in the initial attack (Kaplan 269).
Despite its intricate planning and detailed execution strategies, SIOP
was immensely inflexible. Asked whether the U.S. had any options to
attack without striking China, which might not even be a combatant in
the war, General Thomas Power replied "Well yeh \[sic\], we could do
that, but I hope nobody thinks of it because it would really screw up
the plan" (Kaplan 270, emphasis in original). Starting in the 1960s, [a
set of war games of various complexity was developed to test a broader
range of nuclear theories and attack options at RAND and
elsewhere]{.underline} (Arbella 35). [Games like them continue to be
used for strategic military planning today]{.underline} (Raatz). Most of
[these games]{.underline}---or at least their results---are classified,
as they [became the basis for US nuclear plans]{.underline}. In
politicomilitary games, a number of military officers, civilians, and
generally mid- to lowranking government officials would play various
roles as US and/or foreign decisionmakers. Another group, "control,"
would feed them information about the actions of countries or groups not
played by the participants or about world events that might influence
the context of their actions. [In more limited military simulations,
extant or proposed war plans would be evaluated by computer or human
players to identify possible flaws and improvements. The games
themselves never had a guarantee of accuracy and were often quite
obviously flawed]{.underline}. In one Navy game, American aircraft
carriers were declared to be unsinkable. In others, the Soviet Union was
assumed to have no effective airpower. [Because factors like air
pressure, prevailing winds, defense effectiveness, early warning, and
missile failure rate were largely random or incalculable, a "fudge
factor" simply declared estimated success. Even their designers
sometimes admitted that the games were inaccurate, unprovable, or simply
wishful thinking]{.underline} (Ghamari-Tabrizi 8; Allen 78). [Especially
**in the case of nuclear war**, these **games cannot possibly be
understood as accurate simulations of a real-world system,** because
**there is no empirical data** on the compound effects of many
near-simultaneous nuclear explosions and no data **on what factors cause
states to cross the nuclear threshold** against other similarly-armed
states, a fact that bedevils nuclear planning in general and always
has]{.underline} (Kaplan 87). By the admission of many of those who
create and play them**[, they are "social science fiction" with no
tangible effect other than that they are entertaining]{.underline}**
(Ghamari-Tabrizi 160-1). [Some contemporary social science work supports
this claim especially in the context of extinction-level events. Human
beings simply aren't wired to think at such a scale, and they perform
very poorly assessing probability and calculating magnitude]{.underline}
(Yudkowsky). Others have suggested that warfare is a stochastic system
that we could never identify laws for, no matter how diligent we might
be, because its initial conditions are simply too complex to model and
they do not conform to linear causality (Beyerchen; Buchanan 62).
Indeed, [military planners tended to be far less willing to predict the
conduct and outcome of a conventional war---despite an enormous data set
spanning thousands of years---than a nuclear war fought between two
superpowers, an event that has never occurred in recorded
history]{.underline}. Fred Iklé, former RAND strategists who was at
times head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and Undersecretary
of Defense for Policy, criticized these semi-mathematical abstractions
in harsh terms that deserve to be quoted at length: The prominence of
the calculations continues because we know how to make them...we have
tailored the problem to our capability to calculate. [The seemingly
rigorous models of nuclear deterrence are built on the rule: \"What
cannot be calculated, leave out'"...Such thoughts, especially those
focusing on deterrence, lack real empirical referents or
bases.]{.underline} No other field of human endeavor
demands---absolutely compels---one to work out successful solutions
without obtaining directly relevant experience, without experimenting.
There can be no trial and error here, no real learning. [Curiously, we
are far more skeptical in accepting the calculations of traditional
conventional military campaigns than the calculations of nuclear
warfare]{.underline}. In fact, [the more battle experience and
information military analysts have, the more modest they become in
predicting the course of conventional war. Such modesty is missing for
nuclear war, where pretentious analyses and simplistic abstractions
dominate and blot out the discrepancies existing between abstractions
and possible reality]{.underline}---a reality that for so many reasons
is hard even to imagine. (Iklé 246) Iklé is drawing attention to two
unique aspects of nuclear war planning: first, that no empirical date
(or at least very little) can be gathered for the species of war that
planners concerned themselves with, and second, that unlike other
military problems where little data exists, defense intellectuals were
willing to display great confidence in untested (and untestable)
theories. [Despite this lack of empirical grounding, nuclear war
simulations have been repeated again and again over the decades while
nuclear doctrine has remained fundamentally the same]{.underline}
(McKinzie et al. ix-xi).

### Link -- Nuclear Jargon

#### Even if they win that talking about nuclear war is good, the expert jargon the 1AC uses to describe nuclear threats is counterproductive -- rather than mobilizing anti-nuclear activist, they mystify and enchant nuclear war, concealing its horror -- specifically, this is true of debate.

[This project should **instill skepticism** about the **efficacy of
current strategies** meant to confront nuclear violence by **challenging
it discursively**]{.underline}. [A great deal of work]{.underline} about
the Bomb, following Carol Cohn's excellent article and the germinal work
of Stephen Hilgartner, Richard C. Bell and Rory O\'Connor in Nukespeak,
has [focused on the **sanitizing effects of nuclear
language**]{.underline}. Barry Brummett, Daniel Zins, and Edward
Schiappa have all published work in this vein. Schiappa criticizes
[terms like **"Strategic Defense Initiative" and CORRTEX**]{.underline}
for "**[bureaucratiz]{.underline}**ing" [and]{.underline}
"**[domesticat]{.underline}**ing" [nuclear issues. Through these verbal
strategies, nuclear realities are "**insulated from public inspection**
by **acronyms or sanitized jargon**]{.underline}" (253). Both Barry
Brummett and Charles Kauffman use the work of Kenneth Burke to argue
that [naming practices constrain public knowledge and influence
attitudes about nuclear weapons, either through perfecting "God
terms"]{.underline} for Brummett [or through reference appealing
historical myths such as the American frontier]{.underline} for Kauffman
(Brummett, 1989; Kauffman, 1990). Even David Cratis Williams, who
combines a Derridean perspective to the more familiar Burke, emphasizes
that [a chief goal of nuclear criticism is a "publicly accessible"
language]{.underline} (Williams 202). These are all advocates for what
we might call the concealment thesis. The basic assumption for
proponents of this idea is that **[nuclear terminology conceals the
reality of nuclear warfare and thus makes it palatable]{.underline}**.
[The **nuclear thinking** developed by **RAND game theorists** and
others produced an **arcane vocabulary** for all aspects of nuclear
conflict, much as academia has for its own concerns: **"counterforce
targeting," "throw-weight," "circular error probable," "post-attack
state,"** and, of course, **"countervalue" and "first
strike."**]{.underline} **[These terms mystify and enchant the
public]{.underline}**, [just as they did public intellectuals during the
Cold War, the fictional narrator of End Zone, and **legions of high
school and college undergraduate debaters to this very
day**]{.underline} (myself included). The theories of language used in
the concealment thesis draw from different sources (Burke, Derrida, and
Aristotle, Orwell, just to name a few), but their least common
denominator is a belief that [nuclear metaphors and euphemism sustain
the complex of nuclear destruction by concealing the horror of nuclear
war. The implication of this idea is that providing a new vocabulary for
public debate, such as the "devil terms]{.underline}" Brummett suggests,
[would enable democratic deliberation and therefore constrain the
nuclear state.]{.underline} As Schiappa puts it, a "[negative nukespeak
would consist of linguistic strategies to portray nuclear weapons and
war as dangerous and immoral]{.underline}" (268). [Such a strategy might
"salvage" debate over nuclear weapons in the public sphere]{.underline}
(Schiappa 254). Even outside communication studies, there is a broad
consensus amongst critics of nuclear weapons that democratic debate is
the key method for resistance to nuclear weapons and that concealing
language stands as a barrier to it. [Nuclear critique of all kinds has
dropped off considerably since the end of the Cold War such that the
concealment thesis]{.underline}, although advanced most comprehensively
in the 1980s, [remains the chief contribution of communication studies
to the politics of nuclear warfare.]{.underline} The central argument of
this book suggests that this legacy needs revision. [The economy of
nuclear discourse since the day of Trinity has been driven by the
attempt to get closer to the Real, to have the Bomb as it "really
is."]{.underline} Chapter 2 will suggest that nuclear simulations were
presented as more real and more rational than the Doomsday imaginations
of Curtis LeMay and the early Strategic Air Command. Jonathan Schell's
Fate of the Earth was another effort to bring Americans face-to-face
with the reality of nuclear war, as were the more explicitly fictional
novels churned out especially in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s. Underlying
these efforts is the fact that [nuclear war remains "**fabulously
textual"**]{.underline} in Derrida's terms (24-27). [There have been
**atrocities related to nuclear weapons and their
production**---indigenous peoples subjected to uranium mining and
nuclear testing, inner city populations confined and targeted in the
name of the Bomb, "downwinders" exposed to radioactivity, U.S. soldiers
made to witness tests with inadequate protection, and non-human animals
subjected to cruelty in the name of understanding just what a nuclear
war might be like]{.underline}. But [there has never been a nuclear war
in the sense that strategists, novelists, and survivalists imagined it.
To imagine]{.underline} the graphic details of [a possible nuclear war
does not reveal the truth but instead relies on the same dynamic that
makes the Bomb so fascinating in the first place: **a sense of access to
the Real.**]{.underline} My overall aim is to establish the death drive
as a problematic for communication studies. I argue that it is a desire
for unmediated experience spurred on by the Real, but because
communication is always mediated, this desire is frustrated as soon as
it is expressed. The quest for the Real ends up mired in the Symbolic.
Unable to enjoy the Real because its loss is the necessary condition for
subjectivity in the first place, we invest in subjectivity instead,
enjoying the perceived control over presence and absence demonstrated in
the fort-da dynamic. In developing this argument, I hope to make a
contribution to communication studies by showing that silence, omission,
and lack do not just frustrate our effort to communicate, but partly
determine the ways in which we do so. These unspeakable failures are not
therefore purely negative---they are an excess beyond language, not a
vacuum. Specific media artefacts, whether war games or literary texts,
exist instead of others because they are animated by desire and the
uncanny sense of the Real. Therefore, efforts to understand what we do
communicate require attention to the larger economy of desire and that
which we cannot mediate. For rhetoric, this means a new understanding of
the sublime as an uncanny attribute of signifiers and media itself in
relation to the Real, rather than simply a grand style of speech. For
media and technology studies, it means acknowledging how [the enjoyment
of our power over presence and absence leads us to form attachments that
sustain some particular technologies instead of others, making an
account of desire necessary even for a truly materialist understanding
of mediation. This also means **rethinking the relationship between
public discourse and political change** since, as the example of nuclear
weapons shows, **horror and fascination are woven together** such that
**exposing the potential for catastrophe does not translate into an
effective response.**]{.underline}

### Link -- Nuclear War

Two anecdotes about John von Neumann, famous mathematician who worked on
the hydrogen bomb, serve to introduce **[the problems of risk associated
with attemtps to calculate the incalculable.]{.underline}** First, there
is a story that [von Neumann formulated the early precursors to game
theory playing poker]{.underline} (Allen 142). RAND analysts played the
game regularly, many with some passion. These [players apparently
thought of the game mathematically rather than an exercise in
psychology, since RAND was "stumped" by human behavior.]{.underline} As
RAND president Frank Collbohm said about an Air Force-ordered pilot
reaction study, the one "machine" that remained a mystery "is called a
'pilot'" (Arbella 25). [The **basic assumption** in **reducing war games
to mathematical simulations** was that the **universe could be rendered
in such a language**, that "numbers could save the world" **because life
was ultimately a game of risk**, **calculable and
controllable**]{.underline} (Arbella 134). Later, diagnosed with
terminal cancer, von Neumann supposedly converted to Catholicism on his
deathbed, convinced by another, long dead, mathematician: Blaise Pascal
(Jordan 1). [**Pascal's wager,** that one should believe in God even if
He is very unlikely to exist because the **consequences of eternal
damnation are infinite**]{.underline} (Pascal 67- 9), [is the **basic
structure of the sign of survival** that was inverted in the twentieth
century to be an argument mandating care for the material world
instead]{.underline}. [Incubated in the warmth of the Bomb**, this sign
has metastasized** to **other areas of apocalyptic fantasy
predictions.**]{.underline} As its transmogrification from Jonathan
Schell's pacifist anti-nuclear stance to Dick Cheney's defense of
preemption will show, arguments based on the attempt to calculate the
incalculable are indeterminate. [The excess of tuché frustrates
automaton, and this secular version of Pascal's wager is the broken
machinery it leaves behind.]{.underline} Jonathan Schell wrote perhaps
the most famous book about nuclear war to be marketed as non-fiction.
Fate of the Earth is an attempt to make nuclear war seem real through
the unabashed use of sublime language. The first of its three parts is
full of beautiful passages about the destruction that a nuclear war
might produce before ending in a "republic of insects and grass."
Relying heavily on the assumption that a nuclear winter would follow a
war between the USA and USSR and that such an event would cause humanity
to go extinct,14 Schell contemplates what the end of the human species
might mean and what its possibility suggests for defense policy. Schell,
like Kristiakoswky at the Trinity test, thought of nuclear war as the
end of humanity. Seeing the world apparently as one for us, he wrote
that all value was human value, so a nuclear war would destroy
everything meaningful in the known universe (95). Nuclear war must,
therefore, be avoided at all costs. Schell wrote: \[T\]he mere risk of
extinction has a significance that is categorically different from, and
immeasurably greater than, that of any other risk, and as we make our
decisions we have to take that significance into account...It represents
not the defeat of some purpose, but an abyss in which all human purposes
would be drowned for all time. We have no right to place the possibility
of this limitless, eternal defeat on the same footing as risks that we
run in the ordinary conduct of our affairs in our particular transient
moment of human history...although the risk of extinction may be
fractional, the stake is...infinite, and a fraction of infinity is still
infinity...morally they are the same, and we have no choice but to
address the issue of nuclear weapons as though we knew for a certainty
that their use would put an end to our species. (Schell 95) This passage
serves as the end of the first part of Fate of the Earth and a
transition to the middle section of the book, "The Second Death," which
is about future generations. [Schell's argument is a version of Pascal's
wager where "**infinity" takes the place of a Christian God**.
"Infinity" as a concept is always an **attempt to mediate the Real**
because it replaces something that by definition cannot be resolved in
language or understood by human beings in its entirety into a single
word, a placeholder to **represent with finite bounds** something **that
can never be represented**. It is the ultimate license in metonymy since
all associations are included within it; no proliferation of meaning is
prohibited. Its symbolic function can be compared to the various names
of God in negative theology, all of which stand in for something that is
acknowledged to be inexpressible]{.underline} (Pseudo-Dionysius 52-53).
Some version of Schell's infinite risk argument was used by anti-nuclear
activists in public rallies (Sorensen 141), and also used by others to
think about a range of other "existential threats" (e.g., Matheny). A
report by the Global Challenges Foundation explicitly focuses on
"infinite risks" including nuclear war, describing itself as "the first
science-based list of global risks with a potentially infinite impact"
(Pamlin and Armstrong 31). Representatives of the Vatican recently used
the argument too, signing on to a statement including this line: "as
long as nuclear weapons exist, there remains the possibility of a
nuclear explosion. Even if the probability is small, given the
catastrophic consequences of a nuclear weapon detonating, the risk is
unacceptable" (Gagliarducci). [Even when the hazard is expressed as
"catastrophic," or quantified with some suitably huge number, it is
effectively infinite]{.underline}: as Yudkowsky argues, [human beings
calculate scale poorly, and a sufficiently large number is not
rationally understood]{.underline}. "Human emotions take place within an
analog brain," writes Yudkowsky. "[The human brain cannot release enough
neurotransmitters to feel emotion a thousand times as strong as the
grief of one funeral. A prospective risk going from 10,000,000 deaths to
100,000,000 deaths does not multiply by ten the strength of our
determination to stop it. It adds one more zero on paper for our eyes to
glaze over, an effect so small that one must usually jump several orders
of magnitude to detect the difference experimentally]{.underline}" (16).
In the more elegant formulation attributed to Josef Stalin, one death is
a tragedy. One million deaths is just a statistic. Our failure to grasp
these magnitudes could be called the problem of hrair after the Lapine
language of Watership Down. Rabbits in the novel can only count to four.
Any larger number, be it five or one thousand, is simply hrair. The word
means "a great many; an uncountable number; any number over four" (Adams
475). [The language we employ attempts to master and reduce the
incomprehensible vastness of time and space to mark difference where
comprehension is impossible. Infinity is perhaps the best example, but
any very large number serves the same structural function of expressing
loss beyond practical measure]{.underline}. Thus, [although]{.underline}
the Global Challenges Foundation argues that **["infinite
risk"]{.underline}** [is not meant in a mathematical sense and that
calculations are possible, they are in effect meaningless: **the
investments of "infinity" exceed our ability to
calculate,**]{.underline} as indeed the report acknowledges when it
argues for a categorically different treatment of these risks (Pamlin
and Armstrong 33). [This quandary **frustrates the attempt to make
calculable values that seem to exceed calculation itself**. A **shadow
always remains** in the quantification of infinity and the attempt to
master it technologically, a remainder that **haunts the edges of
supposedly perfect reason.**]{.underline} This is Martin Heidegger's
concept of the gigantic, something much like the sense of the Real that
shines through in the sublime: The gigantic is rather that through which
the quantitative becomes a special quality and thus a remarkable kind of
greatness\... as soon as the gigantic in planning and calculating and
adjusting and making secure shifts over out of the quantitative and
becomes a special quality, then what is gigantic, and what can seemingly
always be calculated completely, becomes, precisely through this,
incalculable. This incalculable remains the invisible shadow that is
cast around all things everywhere when man \[sic\] has been transformed
into subiectum and the world into picture. (Heidegger 135) [Through this
shadow the modern world extends itself into "a space withdrawn from
representation" and gestures towards something which we are denied to
know]{.underline} (Heidegger 136). For Schell, [the losses possible in a
nuclear war are infinite because they threaten future generations beyond
count. Preventing the birth of future individuals is immoral, by this
logic, which has some bizarre]{.underline} (and apparently unintended)
[echoes in the Catholic view on abortion]{.underline} (Schell 116). As
no future individuals are cotemporal with those assigning them worth,
the value of future generations is symbolic, not unique to the
individuals actually "prevented" (Kleinig 196-197). [The reason we must
not immolate ourselves in nuclear fire, then, is that we must continue
to reproduce---the value of each individual lies in that person's
ability to create more individuals. There is no discussion of anything
else that we are obligated to do for the future.]{.underline} For
Schell, responsibility seems to be a finite obligation to an infinite
number of people. [This infinite future is frequently represented by the
metaphor of the child.]{.underline} In Lyndon Johnson's infamous "Daisy
Girl" campaign ad, a child pulls petals off a daisy, accompanied by a
mechanical countdown and interrupted by the familiar mushroom cloud of
the Bomb. "These are the stakes," a man's voice intones. "To make a
world in which all of God's children can live, or go into the dark. We
must either love each other, or we must die" ("Campaign Spot"). Lee
Edelman's words, bitterly describing the Child as a figure for
"compulsory investment in the misrecognition of figure," could have been
about the Johnson ad. "And lo and behold," he writes, "[as viewed
through the prism of the tears that it always calls forth, the figure of
this Child seems to shimmer with the iridescent promise of Noah's
rainbow, serving like the rainbow as the pledge of a covenant that
shields us against the persistent threat of apocalypse now---or
later]{.underline}" (Edelman 18). Unfortunately for disarmament
activists, nuclear strategists have children too, and some, like Jim
Lipp, express the value of their own work in the same terms---as a
matter of caring for "grandchildren's grandchildren" through nuclear
deterrence (Kaplan 78). [The "fraction of infinity" argument has been
used by those defending an aggressive defense posture.]{.underline} The
George W. [Bush]{.underline} administration [invaded Iraq citing that
country's possible future development of weapons of mass destruction as
a primary casus belli.]{.underline} [It is only logical that no time
ought to be wasted---every second that the decision for war is delayed
increases the chance that a rogue regime could develop nuclear weapons.
**Any non-zero risk is equivalent to an infinite one.**]{.underline}
Vice President Dick Cheney went one further, however, establishing the
"Cheney Doctrine" in response to nuclear terrorism. Told at a briefing
with CIA director George Tenet that Pakistani scientists could
potentially be assisting Al Qaeda in the development of nuclear weapons,
[Cheney responded that if "there's a one percent chance...we have to
treat it as a certainty in terms of our response."]{.underline} The
response must be immediate, regardless of proof: "It's not about our
analysis," he said, "or finding a preponderance of evidence. It's about
our response" (Suskind 62). [Members of the security community often
assert that nuclear terrorism is an "existential risk," a threat to
American "civilization" or even the entire species despite the complete
lack of evidence to this effect]{.underline} (Mueller 19-20). [There is
no mathematical way to distinguish between infinite risks. If **any
fraction of infinity is infinity**, then **every fractional risk is
infinite**]{.underline}---Heidegger's unquantifiable "gigantic" casts
its shadow over attempts to calculate. While the last part of Schell's
book is a passionate case for disarmament, the opposite is equally
plausible: if there is any chance greater than zero that disarmament
opponents are right and American nuclear weapons are deterring a nuclear
war (and uncertainty in calculation alone ensures that there must be),
then the risk is infinite. [The future is compressed entirely into the
present, since any action we take now could determine whether that
future exists at all and what character it might have. We are enjoined
to do everything, right now, as fast as we can, because any delay might
cost trillions of deaths]{.underline}---an argument Nick Bostrom has
made about space colonization using the same structure of Pascal's wager
used by Schell (Bostrom 3). [At the same time, we must be in (literally)
perfect stasis and do nothing at all, for **any change might be the one
that cascades into nuclear war**]{.underline}. [If we extend this
infinite value to human extinction more generally, it might even be
imperative that we deliberately cause a nuclear war as soon as possible
to destroy industrial civilization and thus prevent the collapse of
global ecosystems on which all life depends]{.underline} (Caldwell).15
**[The logic of infinite loss results in aporia.]{.underline}** [It is
simultaneously true that no risk is worth taking and that every risk
must be taken.]{.underline} At the same time, [each individual is
afforded some symbolic connection to the Real, because each action we
take has effects on the unbounded infinity of future human beings. Each
decision we make now is of limitless import, and thus **we can enjoy the
imagination of destroying future generations because it invests us with
the power over existence and nonexistence on a cosmic scale.** This
quasi-secular iteration of Pascal's wager shares its defect with nuclear
war games. Both attempt to make rational calculations about nuclear war
by quantifying variables that cannot be quantified]{.underline}. The
Symbolic order can be analogized to a set of operations, like an
equation, that provides the conditions of possibility for meaning, while
the Imaginary describes the value of specific variables in that
equation. [If the Bomb is valued as infinity, then the rest of an
operation is overshadowed: no probability assigned to that variable
fundamentally changes the result.]{.underline} Like the sun outshining
dimmer lights in Longinus's treatment of metaphor, [the threat of human
extinction as an unquantifiable evil outshines the issues attached to it
(preemption or pacifism, reproduction or culling, counterforce or
countervalue, and so forth) such that many paths lead audiences to the
same result: the poorly-healed scar in the Symbolic that results from
automaton's sutures over the wound of tuché]{.underline}. In fact,
because [nuclear war is a problem in which two or more agents are pitted
against each other and the optimal solution for one party requires
responding to the optimal solution of the others, **rationality must
necessarily collapse**]{.underline}---[the only way to frustrate enemy
calculations of American plans is to ensure that they are irrational.
Rationality thereby demands irrationality]{.underline} (Rose, ch. 5)
[Nuclear war games might incorporate data from nuclear testing or
conventional bombing, but they still rely largely on guesswork. The
"infinite risk"]{.underline} of Schell's [argument does the same,
warping calculations by including a cipher for the incalculable. Both
operations are sustained by enjoyment.]{.underline} As Cheney said, it's
not about our analysis---it's about our response. In the case of war
games, simulations allow players to enjoy their ability to enjoy---to
attach to subjectivity itself. The appeal to infinite destruction is
remarkably similar, only those who use it can enjoy the capacity to make
the world present and absent in speech. Imagining the apocalypse is fun;
doubly so if apparently sophisticated simulations allow us to alter the
models of its occurrence. While this kind of scenario planning and
simulation had its most important early developments in Cold War nuclear
games, [the cultural technology has become deeply ingrained and
proliferated in a number of different discourses and practices. A
cottage industry in extinction prediction has blossomed in the last few
decades, concerned with everything from asteroid collisions and ice ages
to magnetic pole shifts and whether the universe is a simulation that
might be switched off]{.underline} (see for example Bostrom; Leslie;
Posner; Matheny; Yudkowsky). The 2014 outbreaks of the Ebola virus in
Africa are a recent example. Modelers quickly produced simulations of
the spread of this disease. An article on the Infowars website discusses
the most extreme of these disease models, asking if "you really want to
wait until after infections have been identified in the United States to
make your preparations?" (Slavo). An embedded Youtube link leads to a
video entitled "Mathematical Model Shows How Ebola Will Spread: 'Worse
Case Scenario\... An Extinction Event'" posted by TheDailySheeple. The
graphical presentation of this video closely resembles the gameplay of
Pandemic 2, a game with millions of online plays popular long before the
outbreak. In Pandemic 2, the player controls the disease and the object
is to kill everyone in the world (Crazy Monkey Games). The notorious
difficulty of infecting Madagascar in the game has spawned its own
Internet meme where players express frustration in sympathy with their
fictional pandemic (interestingly, the aforementioned Ebola video leaves
Madagascar untouched). The website for Northeastern University's MoBS
lab (Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-Technical
Systems) shows efforts to model the spread of Ebola using graphical
icons that also closely resemble Pandemic 2, right down to aircraft
flight paths and a similar color-coding system for the incidence of
infection (MoBS). [It is no wonder that many people might share the
feelings]{.underline} of journalist Abraham Riesman who recently wrote a
self-reflective piece on his "[amoral twinge of excitement" on
reading]{.underline} Ebola [news and imagining the end of the
world]{.underline} (Riesman).

[**In my last year of college debate the national topic involved nuclear
arms control.** I would sometimes stay amongst the "U" call numbers in
the basement of the Michigan State University Library all night reading
books that hadn't been checked out since the 1980s]{.underline} and
walking home in the early morning. [Every day I would pass the
Seventh-Day Adventist Church in the half light of dawn, which, long
after the Cold War ended, **had a prominent yellow "Fallout Shelter"
sign bolted to its masonry**, the **old-fashioned triangular Civil
Defense kind made of metal**. **Today that sign is gone**. **In its
place is the deep-set rust stain that the sign left, indelibly marking
its old place in that triangular shape, an enthymeme of death and hope
for anyone who remembers its old message. The sign is literally absent,
but its distortion remains. The Bomb is still with us.** It's the
shelters that have disappeared.]{.underline} This dissertation has
explored [the distorting influence of the Bomb as a means to understand
the desire to experience the Real beyond mediation and the paradoxical
refraction of that desire into fixation on various forms of mediation
that come to stand in for the unspeakable. This is an issue raised by
symbols in any form, as they must necessarily stand in for something
that is absent. The connection between any particular signifier and what
it represents may be arbitrary, but it is held together by our
investment]{.underline} in the tie, a kind of implicit collective
agreement necessary for language to convey meaning, to provide the
resources for one speaking subject to address another. [These agreements
accrete into broader myths, sustained and shaped to create cultural
formations by specific ideologies that are themselves products of
durable investments]{.underline}. I have argued that desire finds its
point of attachment in the sense of the Real that a symbol conveys.
Essentially, [language works through a habitual confusion in which
artifice is concealed by its own action and we mistake the Symbolic for
the Real, attaching ourselves in those uncanny moments when it seems
that the Real "shines through."]{.underline} Even if the revelation of
the Real cannot be transmitted in its full force from one subject to
another, language can be the spark that refers one to one's own memory
of other witnessed eruptions. [Nuclear weapons are an extreme case
chosen to make these connections clearer, but they are by no means
unique in this regard]{.underline}. The uncanny is never a complete
substitute for the Real, so the effort to reach it is frustrated and
then repeated. Any object of desire understood as distinct from the
subject must necessarily elude total incorporation. Were it to be
attained, the motion of the drive would not stop because each object
stands in for the return to continuity itself, a goal that the subject
cannot attain and remain extant. Perhaps such a thing is possible, but
if so, **[language cannot convey it]{.underline}**. [It is a currency
that only serves up to a point. This basic dynamic is the first part of
the death drive.]{.underline} [The next phase is the enjoyment of our
efforts to control presence and absence,]{.underline} not because we
enjoy either state (although we likely enjoy them both), but because the
subject can attach to the one thing truly available to it: itself, and
specifically its capacity to enjoy. This is still a mediated path, as
[the subject is a product of identification with the Symbolic order. We
are again grasping at shadows]{.underline}. This formulation situates
the death drive as a problematic for communication studies. I have
argued here that the death drive is not reducible to the desire,
biological or otherwise, for death. Rather, it is the union of Eros and
Thanatos: both are a desire for unmediated experience, for connection to
all that the subject surrenders as the cost of its own coming into
being. This current of desire is a product of the necessary conditions
for the Symbolic, not the Real, even though it is a desire animated by
the latter. The death drive is not a hidden structure that organizes the
Real, but a dynamic observable in the Symbolic as it attempts to repair
the rips and threadbare patches worn into it by the unimaginably vast
world that exists outside our ken. The death drive itself might be
silent and invisible, as Derrida argued in Archive Fever, but its
passage leaves a wake of distortions in language. The attempts to
mediate what is beyond mediation comprise the only evidence available
for the motion of the drive, and thus the proper tools to analyze it are
found in communication studies. Things that seem inexpressible, and the
desire to encounter them, have a powerful effect on the human world. To
neglect this is to miss one important factor that shapes our
communication, and, in the uncanny sense of the Real, an attribute of
signs that helps to explain why some might have traction and some might
not. [The tradition most applicable to this understanding of the drive
is the rhetorical tradition of the sublime]{.underline}.30 Edmund Burke,
writing a century and a half before Freud, identified the sublime as the
interplay of two drives, one for pleasure and one for pain, but both
present in the sublime in some measure, the latter more powerful because
it is an "emissary" for that "king of terrors," death (36). Burke
borrowed from the tradition of Longinus which understood the sublime as
an aspect of language, generally metaphor. It is to this understanding
we should return with a difference: [communication is more than
language, and the sublime is an aspect of communication. **The advent of
the atomic bomb and its yet more terrible progeny, the hydrogen bomb,
elevated human expression to a qualitatively new degree.**]{.underline}
[**It became possible to communicate through fission and fusion**,
through **nations destroyed in minutes**, through **genetic and
environmental legacies marked on a millennial scale**]{.underline}.
[**Cold War nuclear deterrence** is a **dialogue expressed primarily in
enthymeme**, and game theory is little but a guide for making and
decoding its messages, now a conversation involving several more
participants. The **latent threat of total destruction** is now promised
by **synthetic biology**, **artificial intelligence**, **asteroid
collisions**, and **host of modern technological anxieties** along
**with nuclear warfare**. These still create **deep metonymic channels**
through which **association might flow between obscure signifiers
covering the ultimate void of metaphysical groundlessness**, expressed
not in the question "why is there something instead of nothing," but
"why does it matter?"]{.underline} In the case of world-ending weapons
themselves, the medium is the message. [The **rhetorical tradition of
the sublime** exposes the **intoxicating power of horror mixed with
desire** and the **counterattack of language** after the breakthrough of
silence, as witnessed by the Trinity observers.]{.underline} The
analysis of ensuing myths, such as the myth of survival and rebirth
after Doomsday, is also facilitated by rhetorical tradition. [These
are]{.underline} excellent tools, but [insufficient without an
understanding of media that stretches beyond the spoken or written word.
Nuclear war games in their various iterations draw us in and change us
through form and function that exceeds text and persuasion. Cities are
built with the Bomb in mind, or justified by appeals to necessity and
the lurking possibility of destruction.]{.underline} In the case of the
sublime, the need is to revisit a venerable and powerful tradition by
bringing to bear more contemporary understandings of communication. The
examples I have chosen are efforts to do this by showing how [practices
like]{.underline} survivalism and [games attempt to mediate the tears of
the Real]{.underline} along with texts like post-apocalyptic novels and
oral histories. [This approach was deliberately taken to illustrate the
ubiquity of the sublime by identifying many far-flung iterations and
uncanny resemblances.]{.underline}

### Link -- Nuclear War Planning

#### Nuclear games playing create an illusion of mastery over nuclear weapons -- they perversely come to enjoy the signifier of the nuclear bomb which makes their use inevitable.

Deliberation and Civic Life and the incoming Chair of the Department of

[Just as metaphors are made meaningful by the repeated investments that
tie signifier to signified, war games are made meaningful by the
**investments that tie them to nuclear war.**]{.underline} **[The
simulations are enjoyable because of their link to the power of the
Bomb]{.underline}**. Lacan explains the enjoyment of subjectivity in the
Symbolic by analogizing it to a game. In Beyond the Pleasure Principle,
Freud recounts a game played by [a young boy]{.underline} of his
acquaintance (13-17). The boy [had a wooden reel attached to a string
which he would throw over his curtained cot, making it "gone" (fort).
Then he would pull the spool back into view, rejoicing that it was
"there" (da). He would repeat these actions again and again. The game
can be read as the child inuring himself against the potential absence
of his mother, but a more productive reading would locate enjoyment not
in the conditions of "gone" or "here" but in the exercise of control
over the conditions of presence and absence, essentially a simulation
that permits agency over a situation in which the child must be
passive]{.underline} (Freud, Beyond the Pleasure Principle 16-17).
[Games are particularly powerful media for this control if they differ
from representation based on the player's ability to affect the outcome
of each repetition within the procedures created by the game. This sense
of control, that the outcome is dependent on the player's actions, is a
key feature that distinguishes games (and, in principle, other
simulations) from traditional linear texts in which the reader's choice
is more limited, as is exposure to "risk"]{.underline} (Aarseth 4). This
is a challenge for work that understands gaming simply as a metaphor
where one term replaces and conceals another, as Barry Brummett argues,
without acknowledging that gaming is both a linguistic choice and a
material practice of substitution and connection (Brummett 91-92).
Norbert Weiner speculated that [games would be used to "determine the
policies for pressing the Great Push Button and burning the earth clean
for a new and less humanly undependable order of things]{.underline}"
(24-25). Noting that there is not enough experience to establish
criteria for nuclear war games, Weiner emphasized the importance of
accuracy: The chief criterion as to whether a line of human effort can
be embodied in a game is whether there is some objectively recognizable
criterion of the merit of the performance of this effort. Otherwise the
game assumes the formlessness of the croquet game in Alice in
Wonderland, where...the Queen of Hearts, who kept changing the rules and
sending the players to the Headsman to be beheaded. Under these
circumstances, [to win has no meaning, and a successful policy cannot be
learned, because there is no criterion of success]{.underline}." (26-27
This argument may well be correct, but it misses [the most important
trait that sustains nuclear war games: they are enjoyable even when they
aren't accurate, hence people ponder the nuclear war even though its
consequences are imponderable]{.underline} (Rose, ch. 5). **[They serve
as a site for cathectic attachment and solidify the subject's sense of
itself. Nuclear deterrence resembles gambling]{.underline}**, just like
the poker games favored by Vice Admiral Giardina[. In the exchange for
one set of risks for another, nothing is produced--- counters are merely
moved around, made meaningful by their assigned values, but ultimately
traded and expended by the players with no real increase in value during
the process, a useless exchange that serves the subject's enjoyment by
creating a space for play separate from work and art]{.underline}
(Caillois 5). [Fudging the numbers in a nuclear simulation, just like
forging fake chips in a casino, is a kind of cheating, but not a threat
to the game itself---breaking the rules maintains a certain fidelity to
them, recognizing them as existing constraints to be manipulated, and
reinforcing the logic of the game even if the cheater is dishonorable.
The cheat only sustains the game. The only threat comes from one willing
to say that the game is arbitrary and therefore completely worthless, to
"break the spell"]{.underline} (Caillois 8-9). It is significant,
therefore, that critics of wargames largely continued to play them.
[More important than the games themselves therefore is their role in
organizing the subject vis-à-vis the Symbolic, understood as reality for
the subject]{.underline}. Lundberg describes this relationship as one of
"useless subjectivity:" Enjoyment is useless in a very specific sense:
although the effect of the habitual capture of affect in the form of
enjoyment purchases a sense of unity for the subject, enjoyment is
useless in regard to the specific site of its exercise. [When a subject
enjoys a relationship to an object, or a specific habituated practice,
it is tempting to read the subject's investment in the object or
practice as a validation of the fact that the subject values the thing
in and of itself. But]{.underline}, if Lacan's account of enjoyment is
correct, [enjoyment in an object or practice is less about the dignity
of the thing invested in than the ways that the object or practice
serves the subject in negotiating a relationship to the general economy
of exchange]{.underline}. Thus, [the exercise of enjoyment is often
somewhat counterfactual: the subject invests in objects or practices for
the sake of something that is beyond the object or practice and for the
sake of accommodating to failed unicity]{.underline}. (Lacan in Public
114) [The subject, permanently frustrated in the desire for continuity
by the state of discontinuity that is the condition for its own
existence, enjoys instead its capacity to enjoy because there is nothing
else that it can do]{.underline}. Thus the death drive works in two
stages in response to the eruption of the Real: first, [the desire to
touch the Real, mistakenly manifested as the desire for a mediated sense
of the Real as it inheres in some symbols, and]{.underline} second, [the
enjoyment of the very conditions of the subject's alienation from the
Real: its subjectivity and attendant capacity to enjoy. In the context
of nuclear war games, players could enjoy not just the sense of control,
but also what Lundberg calls "habituated practices" and we might just as
easily name rituals]{.underline}. Thus [computerized nuclear models
"**take on quasi-religious overtones.** Offerings are put into the black
box by acolytes who are never sure what is going to come out; those who
come to worship are often not sure what has happened either...With large
simulations, unfortunately, unlike large cathedrals...the whole
structure may collapse or become meaningless without anyone's
realizing]{.underline} it" (Brewer and Shubik 25). In some sense, [**the
outcome hardly matters. Only the game does.** Excitement is also
generated by risk. There is always some uncertainty in how the story
will end, what results the player's actions might have. Nuclear war
simulations create a **hypertrophied sense of control over presence and
absence**]{.underline}: [the simulated stakes are usually the presence
and absence of human civilization and perhaps all life on
Earth]{.underline}. Lacan wrote about the significance of our ability to
be the agents of our own downfall and the contradiction between agency
and responsibility: \[Scientists\] have begun to get the idea that they
could create bacteria that would be resistant to everything, that would
be unstoppable. That would clear the surface of the globe of all the
shitty things, human in particular, that inhabit it. And then they
suddenly felt overcome with pangs of responsibility...What a sublime
relief it would be nonetheless if we suddenly had to deal with a true
blight...That would be a true triumph. It would mean that humanity would
truly have achieved something---its own destruction. It would be a true
sign of the superiority of one being over all the others. Not only its
own destruction, but the destruction of the entire living world. That
would truly be the sign that man is capable of something. (Triumph of
Religion 60) For these reasons, [**the use of nuclear war games as
anti-nuclear tools presents a paradox.** Anti-nuclear games do not
reveal the horrors of nuclear war any more than Pentagon simulations
provide scientifically accurate strategic plans. A number of ostensibly
anti-war games have been developed to expose nuclear
strategy]{.underline}. Balance of Power was described by its creator
Chris Crawford in the early 1980s as "a grand, idealistic,
make-my-contribution-for-peace crusade," intended to show the
irrationality and danger of nuclear war (Aaron 2). Players who started a
nuclear war were shown only a black screen admonishing them, refusing to
display images of nuclear war, and stating "we don't reward failure."
After the Cold War ended, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)
created its own simulation of nuclear targeting. Despite the demise of
the Soviet Union, SIOP remains a closely-guarded secret. NRDC hoped to
create a rough picture of current US nuclear war plans based on the
theory that exposing the "grotesque results" of nuclear war would turn
the public against it (McKinzie et al. xi). Lack of access to the tools
of simulation undermines democratic debate, which the NRDC simulation
set out to change (McKinzie et al. 1). The assumption shared by both
Crawford and the NRDC is that nuclear war plans survive only due to
secrecy and therefore that exposing the way things "really are" is an
effective project for anti-nuclear politics. To examine this argument
and further illustrate the common processes of enjoyment these games
share with official war planning, the next section will analyze the
popular 2014 nuclear war simulator First Strike, an ostensibly
anti-nuclear videogame developed by the Swiss Blindflug studios.

### Link -- Political Demands

#### Policy debates over [demands on the government]{.underline} re-invest into the symbolic order by demanding to be recognized as a subject among subjects by the Symbolic Father, which breeds [agentic incapacity]{.underline} -- they perversely attach themselves to the re-production of the status quo because they rely on it to sustain their enjoyment.

How is it possible to ground a literal reading of the rhetorical
functionality of the demand to be recognized as dangerous in this case?
This reading strategy involves identifying a supplemental split to the
one between the universal and particular political content of a demand,
between subjects who enjoy the mere fact of affinity with a group as a
mode of (mis)identification and the set of identitarian equivalences
inaugurated by entry into the particular. This strategy involves reading
such utterances both as **[specific political demands]{.underline}**, as
**[contain]{.underline}**ing **[a universal commitment]{.underline}**
that **[authorize]{.underline}**s [**equivalential linkages,**
and]{.underline} simultaneously as **[practices of
enjoyment]{.underline}**, [**creating ritually repeated relationships**
to a **hegemonic order**.]{.underline} On this reading [it is **not the
change that the demand anticipates** that is significant, **nor is in
the political potential** of forging equivalential links, but rather
**the role demand plays** for **the one who utters it,** and the **modes
of interpassive political affinity** entailed. Working through the
complexity of demands requires reading the demand for recognition as a
practice of enjoyment]{.underline} [as an **affectively invested call**
for **sanction and love by the governing order**.]{.underline} Framing
demands as a practice of enjoyment opens a conversation with and point
of political critique for Laclau's conception of the demand by marking
the affective complexity of the politics of demands [**demands also
entail** a **perverse dialectic** of **political agency as resistance**
and simultaneous **interpassive political constraint**]{.underline}.
Demands empower forms of political agency by generating an oppositional
relationship to hegemonic structures, and by providing the equivalential
preconditions for identity. As Slavoj Zˇizˇek might have it, there is
always the risk that [the demands of protestors are the supplement that
authorizes the functioning of capital]{.underline} (Zˇizˇek 2000).

provides an elegant account of demand as the fundamental unit of the
political, and by extension of politics as a field of antagonism.
Laclau's basic goal is to define the specificity of populist reason, or,
to give an account of populism as 'special emphasis on a political logic
which, is a necessary ingredient of politics tout court', of 'Populism,
quite simply, as a way of constructing the political' (Laclau 2005, p.
18). Here, a focus on demands replaces a now prevalent approach focused
on various taxonomies of populism (which Laclau diagnoses as hopelessly
unsystematic) with a more formal account of the political based on the
logic of demands, which in turn provides a way of thinking about the
political as the space of demand and politics as a practice of working
through specific demands. Demands serve a number of functions that
derive from the split between the universal and the particular that
Laclau relies upon. [Demands articulate a specific political claim at
the level of the particular, and also imply a more **generalized
relationship to hegemony** in the **register of the
universal**]{.underline}. On this logic, [demands represent the
hegemonic order, creating an implicit picture of how it functions and
might change]{.underline}. Simultaneously, demands create possible lines
of equivalential affinity between others also making demands on the
hegemonic order. Thus, the demand is more fundamental than the group, in
that the operation of the split demand inaugurates all 'the various
forms of articulation between a logic of difference and a logic of
equivalence' that animate the social affinities that give groups their
coherence (Laclau 2005, p. 20). The logic of the demand is in turn the
logic of equivalence, and equivalence is as important for how it
animates a group identity, as it is in positing claims on a hegemonic
order. Although Laclau owes a significant debt to Freud and Lacan, it is
not clear that his theory of demand is explicitly crafted from
psychoanalytic categories. For example, how central is enjoyment to
Laclau's relatively formal account of the demand? As Glynos and
Stavrakakis have argued, there is a 'complete and conspicuous absence in
Laclau's work of Lacanian categories such as fantasy, and, perhaps more
importantly, jouissance' (Glynos and Stavrakakis 2006, p. 202). Glynos
and Stavrakakis claim that there is 'to \[their\] knowledge no reference
in Laclau's work to the concept of jouissance' (Glynos and Stavrakakis
2006, p. 209). On Populist Reason contains a brief discussion of the
concept of jouissance as worked out by Copjec, which Laclau summarizes
by saying: there is no achievable jouissance except through radical
investment in an objet petit a. But the same discovery (not merely an
analogous one) is made if we start from the angle of political theory.
No social fullness except through hegemony; and hegemony is nothing more
than the investment in a partial object, of a fullness which will always
evade us. The logic of the objet petit a and the hegemonic logic are not
just similar, they are simply identical. (Laclau 2005, p. 109) There is
an elegance to Laclau's point about enjoyment, provided that enjoyment
is reducible to a set of logical forms. This presupposition makes the
lack of talk about jouissance in Laclau's work understandable. If
jouissance and hegemony are identical, one does not need Lacan to say
something that might be said more elegantly with Gramsci. Jouissance is
simply hegemonic investment, an elevation of an object or identity to
the level of a thing or a universal. Despite occasional caveats to the
contrary, the greatest virtues of Laclau's version of the political stem
from his relentlessly persistent application of a formal, almost
structural account of the political. And, as is the case with many well
executed structuralist accounts, Laclau's system can elegantly
incorporate caveats, objections to and oversights in the original system
by incorporating them into the functioning of the structure jouissance
can easily be read as nothing more than hegemony in this account without
changing the original coordinates of the system too drastically. Yet,
[enjoyment provides one particularly difficult stumbling block for a
dedicated formal account.]{.underline} To start with, enjoyment is never
quite as 'achievable' as the preceding quotation might suggest. Far from
being the consummation of a logic of structure and investment,
[enjoyment is a supplement to a failing in a structure: f]{.underline}or
example, [Lacan frames jouissance as a useless enjoyment of one's own
subjectivity that supplements the fundamental failings of a subject in
either finding a grounding or consummating an authoritative account of
its coherence]{.underline}. This 'uselessness' defines the operation of
jouissance. Thus, for example, when Lacan suggests that 'language is not
the speaking subject' in the Seminar on Feminine Sexuality, lodging a
critique of structural linguistics as a law governing speech, jouissance
is understood as something excessive that is born of the failure of
structures of signification (Lacan 1977). Language is not the speaking
subject precisely because what is passed through the grist mill of the
speech is the result of a misfiring of structure as much as it is
prefigured by logics of structure, meaning and utility. Therefore [the
interpretive difficulty for a structuralist account of enjoyment: the
moment that the fact of enjoyment is recoded in the language of
structure, the moment that it is made useful in a logic of
subjectivization is precisely the moment where it stops being
jouissance]{.underline}. Following Glynos and Stavrakakis's suggestion,
one might press the question of the relationship between the demand and
jouissance as a way of highlighting the differences that a purely
Lacanian reading of demand might make for Laclau's understanding of
politics. [Framing enjoyment as equivalent with hegemony, Laclau
identifies the fundamental 'split' in psychoanalytic theory between the
universal and the particular demands of a group]{.underline}. Framing
the split in this way, and as the privileged site of the political,
Laclau occludes attention to another split: namely, the split within a
subject, between the one who enters an equivalential relationship and
the identitarian claim that sutures this subject into a set of linkages.
This too is a site of enjoyment, where a subject identifies with an
external image of itself for the sake of providing its practices of
subjectivity with a kind of enjoyable retroactive coherence. The [demand
is relevant here, but not simply because it represents and anticipates a
change in the social order or because it identifies a point of
commonality]{.underline}. Here [the demand is also a **demand to be
recognized** as a **subject among other subjects,** and given the
**sanction and love of the symbolic order**]{.underline}. The
implication of this argument about the nature of enjoyment is that [the
perverse dialectic of misfirings, failure and surpluses in identity
reveals something politically dangerous in not moving beyond
demand.]{.underline} Put another way: [not all equivalences are equally
equivalent]{.underline}. [Some equivalences become fetishes, becoming
points of identification that eclipse the ostensible political goal of
the demand]{.underline}. To extend the line of questioning to its
logical conclusion, can we be bound to our equivalential chains? Freud,
Lacan and the demand Demand plays a central role in Freud's tripartite
scheme for the human psyche specifically in the formation of the ego.
Although this scheme does not exercise the same hold over psychoanalytic
thinking that it once did, the question of the ego still functions as an
important point of departure for psychoanalytic thinking as a
representative case of the production of the subject and identity. Even
for critics of 'ego psychology', the idea of the ego as a representation
of the 'I' of the human subject is still significant the main question
is what kind of analytical dispositions one takes towards the ego, the
contingencies of its emergence and its continuing function. Despite the
tendency of some commentators to naturalize Freud's tripartite schema of
the human psyche, Freud's account of the ego does not characterize the
ego as pre-existent or automatically given. Although present in
virtually every human subject, the ego is not inevitably present: the
ego is a compensatory formation that arises in the usual course of human
development as a subject negotiates the articulation and refusal of its
needs as filtered through demand. Hypothetically a 'subject' whose every
need is fulfilled by another is never quite a subject: this entity would
never find occasion to differentiate itself from the other who fulfils
its every need. [As a mode of individuation and subjectification, egos
are economies of frustration and compensation. This economy relies on a
split in]{.underline} the Freudian [demand, which is both a demand to
satiate a specific need and a demand for addressee to provide automatic
fulfilment of need generally]{.underline}. [The generative power of the
demand relies on this split and on fact that some demands will be
refused.]{.underline} This economy of need and frustration works because
refusal of a specific need articulated as a demand on another is also a
refusal of the idea that the addressee of the demand can fulfil all the
subject's needs, requiring a set of individuation compensatory economic
functions to negotiate the refusal of specific demands. 'Ego' is nothing
more than the name for the contingent economy of compensatory
subjectification driven by the repetition and refusal of demands [the
nascent subject presents wants and needs in the form of the demand, but
the role of the demand is not the simple fulfilment of these wants and
needs. The demand and its refusal are the fulcrum on which the identity
and insularity of the subject are produced: an unformed amalgam of needs
and articulated demands is transformed into a subject that negotiates
the vicissitudes of life with others]{.underline}. Put in the metaphor
of developmental psychology, an infant lodges the instinctual demands of
the id on others but these demands cannot be, and for the sake of
development, must not be fulfilled. Thus the logic of the pop-psychology
observation that the incessant demands of children for impermissible
objects ('may I have a fourth helping of dessert') or meanings that
culminate in ungroundable authoritative pronouncements (the game of
asking a never-ending 'whys') are less about satisfaction of a request
than the identity producing effects of the distanciating parental 'no'.
In 'The Question of Lay Analysis', Freud argues: [If \... demands meet
with no satisfaction, intolerable conditions arise \... At that point
\... the ego begins to function]{.underline}. If all the driving force
that sets the vehicle in motion is derived from the id, the ego \...
undertakes the steering, without which no goal can be reached. The
instincts in the id press for immediate satisfaction at all costs, and
in that way they achieve nothing or even bring about appreciable damage.
It is the task of the ego to guard against such mishaps, to mediate
between the claims of the id and the objections of the external world.
(Freud 1986, p. 22) Later works move this theory from the narrow bounds
of the parent/child relationship to a broader social relationship which
was continually constituting and shaping the function of the ego this is
a theme of works such as Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego,
as well as Civilization and its Discontents. The latter repeats the same
general dynamics of ego formation as 'The Question of Lay Analysis', but
moves the question beyond individual development towards the entirety of
social relations. For Freud, the inevitability of conflicts between an
individual and the social whole is simply one of the facts of life among
other people. [Life with others inevitably produces blockages in the
individual's attempts to fulfil certain desires]{.underline} some
demands for the fulfilment of desires must be frustrated. This [blockage
produces feelings of guilt, which in turn are sublimated as a general
social morality]{.underline}. Here [frustration of demand is both
productive in that it authorizes social moral codes, and civilization as
mode of functioning, though it does so at the cost of imposing a
constitutively contested relationship with social mores]{.underline}
(Freud 1989). Though there are many places to begin thinking the
Freudian demand in Lacan, one of the best places to start is an almost
accidental Lacanian rumination on demands. Confronted by student calls
to join the movement of 1968 [Lacan famously quipped: 'as hysterics you
demand a new master: you will get it!']{.underline} Framing the meaning
of his response requires a treatment of Lacan's theory of the demand and
its relationship to hysteria as an enabling and constraining political
subject position. Lacan's theory of the demand picks up at Freud's
movement outward from the paradigmatic relationships between the
parent/child and individual/ civilization towards a more general account
of the subjects, sociality and signification. [The infrastructure
supporting this theoretical movement transposes Freud's comparatively
natural and genetic account of development to a set of metaphors for
dealing with the subject's entry into signification.]{.underline}
Lacan's goal is to rearticulate Freudian development processes as
metaphors for a theory of the subject's production within signification.
In Lacanian terms, [what is at stake in this transposition is a **less
naturalized account of the subject** by **privileging supplementary
practices of enjoyment** that **give a subject coherence as an agent,**
not in the sense of an ultimate ontological grounding, but rather **as a
mode of enjoying** the **repetition of retroactive totalities** that
name and produce subjects.]{.underline} This process is most famously
worked out in Lacan's famous 'Mirror Stage' which details the trauma of
the subject's insertion into the symbolic order, and the way that [this
**constitutive dislocation** generates the jouissance that sustains the
production of subjectivity]{.underline} (Lacan 1982a). Looking in the
mirror, Lacan's hypothetical infant does not yet have a concept of a
unified self, puzzled by the fact that when it moves the image of the
child in the mirror also moves. From the child in the mirror, Lacan
infers the existence of two 'I's underwriting processes of
subjectivization: an 'ideal I', a statuesque projection of what it means
to be an 'I' (in this case the image of the child) and a
phenomenological experience of 'I-ness'. Lacan treats the dialectic of
misidentification in the mirror as a constant and constitutive
performance of subjectivity as opposed to a specific developmental stage
(Wilden 1982). In this interpretation, the child in the mirror stage is
a metaphor for the constant production of the subject as a performance
of the self in relation to a constitutive gap between the Symbolic and
the subject, and [the articulation of subjectivity as a category serves
to repress the trauma produced in the margin between a nascent subject,
its alienation from a projected external identity, and within the
structure of signification.]{.underline} The paradoxical effect of this
mode of subject formation is that not only does the child 'discover'
that she is the child in the mirror, it also experiences a disorienting
distance between itself and its image. Despite this fact, the child
requires the an external image such as the one in the mirror to impose a
kind of unity on its experience the image of the other child provides an
imaginary framing, a retroactive totality or a kind of narrative about
what it means to be a self. [The paradox of subjectivity lies in the
simultaneity of identifying with an image of one's self that is given by
a specific location within the symbolic order and the simultaneous
alienation produced by the image's externality]{.underline}. Thus, the
[assumption of a frame for identity cannot ever completely
effective]{.underline}, or, a [subject is never completely comfortable
inhabiting subjectivity]{.underline} [there is **always an impossible
gap** between an **experience of alienated subjectivity**, a
**prefigured given image of one's subjectivity** and the **experience of
being produced by the Symbolic.**]{.underline} There is a famous
Lacanian aphorism that holds that 'the signifier represents a subject
for another signifier' (Lacan 1977, p. 142). This formulation of the
subject's relation to language inverts the conventional wisdom that
ontologically pre-given subjects use language as an instrument to
communicate their subjective intentions. [Signifiers are constituted by
their difference, and subjects come into being in negotiating their
entry into this realm of difference]{.underline}. Instead of
articulating subjective states through language, **[subjects are
articulated through language]{.underline}**, [within the differential
space of signification.]{.underline} The paradoxical implication of this
reversal is that the subject is simultaneously produced and disfigured
by its unavoidable insertion into the space of the Symbolic. The mirror
stage marks the excess of the demand as a mode of subject formation.
[**Subjects assume the identity as subjects** as a way of accommodating
to the **demand placed on them** by the symbolic, and as a **node for
producing demands on the symbolic,** or, of **being recognized as a
subject**]{.underline} (Lacan 1982a, p. 4). Here jouissance is nothing
more than the useless enjoyment of one's own subjectivity, surplus
produced in negotiating a difficult gap between the phenomenological and
ideal 'I's, produced by a failure in relation between Lacan's
phenomenological I and the Symbolic. Both the site of subject production
and the site where this subject fills out an identity by investing in
equivalential linkages and common demands are sites of enjoyment. In
this sense, perhaps there is an excess of jouissance that remains even
after the reduction of jouissance to hegemony. This remainder may even
be logically prior to hegemony, in that it is a useless but ritually
repeated retroactive act of naming the self that produces the conditions
of possibility for investment, the defining point for Laclau's reduction
of jouissance to hegemony. This specific site of excess, where [the
subject negotiates the terms on a non-relationship with the symbolic is
the primary site splitting need, demand and desire.]{.underline} Need
approximates the position of the Freudian id, in that it is a precursor
to demand. [Demand is the filtering of the need through
signification]{.underline}, but as Sheridan notes '[there is no
adequation between need and demand']{.underline} (Sheridan 1982). The
same type of split that inheres in the Freudian demand inheres in the
Lacanian demand, though in this case the split does not derive from the
empirical impossibility of fulfilling demands as much as it stems from
the impossibility of ever fully articulating needs to or receiving a
satisfactory response from the Other. Since there is no adequation, [the
specificity of the demand becomes less relevant than the structural fact
that demand presupposes the ability of the addressee to fulfil the
demand. This impossibility points to the paradoxical nature of demand:
namely that the demand is **less a way of addressing need** than a
**call for love and recognition** by this other]{.underline}. 'In this
way', writes Lacan, '[demand annuls]{.underline} (aufheht) [the
particularity of everything that can be granted by transmuting it into a
proof of love, and the very satisfactions that it obtains for need are
reduced]{.underline} (sich erniedrigt) [to the level of being no more
than the crushing of the demand for love']{.underline} (Lacan 1982b, p.
286). The difficulty is that **[the Other cannot, by definition, ever
give this gift:]{.underline}** [the **starting presupposition** of the
mirror stage is the **constitutive impossibility** of **comfortably
inhabiting the symbolic**]{.underline} [the mirror stage marks the
constitutive split between the subject and the Symbolic]{.underline}.
This paradoxical split, namely the structural impossibility of
fulfilling demands, resonates with the logic of the Freudian demand in
that the frustration of demand produces the articulation of desire.
Thus, Lacan argues that 'desire is neither the appetite for
satisfaction, nor the demand for love, but the difference that results
from the subtraction of the first from the second' (Lacan 1982b, p.
287). How might this subtraction occur? The answer to this question
requires an account of the Other as seemingly omnipotent, and as
simultaneously unable to fulfil demands. This sentiment animates the
crucial Lacanian claim for the impossibility of the other giving a gift
which it does not have, namely the gift of love: It will seem odd, no
doubt, that [in opening up the immeasurable space that all demand
implies, namely, that of being a request for love]{.underline} \....
[Desire begins to take shape in the margin in which demand becomes
separated from need: this margin being that which is opened up by
demand, the appeal of which can be unconditional only in regards to the
Other]{.underline} \... [having no universal satisfaction]{.underline}
\... [It is this whim that introduces the phantom of omnipotence, not of
the subject, but of the other in which his demand is
installed.]{.underline} (Lacan 1982c, p. 311) [Transposed to the **realm
of political demands**]{.underline}, this [framing of demand
**reverses** the classically **liberal presupposition** **regarding
demand and agency**]{.underline}. In the classical iteration and
contemporary critical theories that inherit its spirit, **[there is a
presupposition that a demand is a way of exerting agency]{.underline}**,
[and **that the more firmly** that the **demand is lodged**, the
**greater the production of an agential effect.**]{.underline} [The
Lacanian framing of the demand sees the **relationship as exactly the
opposite:** the **more firmly one lodges a demand** the **more
desperately one clings to the legitimate ability of an institution to
fulfil it.**]{.underline} Thus, [demands ought to reach a kind of
breaking point where the inability of an institution or order to proffer
a response should produce a re-evaluation of the economy of demand and
desire]{.underline}. In analytic terms, this is the moment of
subtraction, where [the **manifest content of the demand** is **stripped
away** and the **desire that underwrites it is laid bare.**]{.underline}
[The result of this 'subtraction' is that the **subject is in a position
to relate to its desire**, not as a set of deferrals, avoidances or
transposition, but rather **as an owned political
disposition**.]{.underline} As Lacan frames it, this is a dialectical
process, where [at each moment the subject is either learning to
reassert the centrality of its demands, or]{.underline} where it is
[coming to terms with the impotence of the other as a satisfier of
demands:]{.underline} But [it is in the dialectic of the demand for love
and the test of desire that development is ordered]{.underline} \....
Clinical experience has shown us that this test of the desire of the
Other is decisive not in the sense that the subject learns by it whether
or not he has a real phallus, but in the sense that he learns that the
mother does not have it. (Lacan 1982b, p. 311) Thus, desire both has
general status and a specific status for each subject. In other words,
it is not just the mirror that produces the subject and its investments,
but the desire and sets of proxy objects that cover over this original
gap. As Easthope puts it: Lacan is sure that everyone's desire is
somehow different and their own lack is nevertheless my lack. How can
this be if each of us is just lost in language \... passing through
demand into desire, something from the real, from the individual's being
before language, is retained as a trace enough to determine that I
desire here and there, not anywhere and everywhere. Lacan terms this
objet petit a \... petit a is different for everyone; and it can never
be in substitutes for it in which I try to refind it. (Easthope 2000,
pp. 9495) [The point of this disposition is to bring the subject to a
point where they might 'recognize and name' their own desire, and as a
result to become a political subject in the sense of being able to truly
argue for something without being dependent on the other as a support
for or organizing principle for political identity]{.underline}. [This
naming is not about discovering a latently held but hidden interiority,
rather it is about **naming a practice of political subjectivization**
that is **not solely oriented towards or determined by** the **locus of
the demand**, determined by the contingent sets of coping strategies
that orient a subject towards others and a political order]{.underline}.
As Lacan argues, this is the point where a subject becomes a kind of new
presence, or in the register of this essay, a new political possibility:
'That [the subject should come to recognize and to name his desire; that
is the efficacious action of analysis. But it isn't a question of
recognizing something which would be entirely given \.... In naming it,
the subject creates, brings forth, a new presence in the
world']{.underline} (Lacan 1988, pp. 228229). Alternatively, [subjects
can stay fixated on the demand, but in doing so they forfeit the
possibility of desire,]{.underline} or as Fink argues: 'later, however,
Lacan comes to see that an analysis \... that \... does not go far
enough in constituting the subject as desire leaves him or her stranded
at the level of demand \... unable to truly desire' (Fink 1996, p. 90).
What does this have to do with hysteria? **[A politics defined by and
exhausted in demands is definitionally a hysterical
politics]{.underline}**. [The hysteric is defined by incessant demands
on the other at the expense of ever articulating a desire which is
theirs.]{.underline} In the Seminar on the Ethics of Psychoanalysis, for
example, Lacan argues that the hysteric's demand that the Other produce
an object is the support of an aversion towards one's desire: 'the
behavior of the hysteric, for example, has as its aim to recreate a
state centred on the object, in so far as this object, das Ding, is, as
Freud wrote somewhere, the support of an aversion' (Lacan 1997, p. 53).
[This economy of aversion explains the ambivalent relationship between
hysterics and their demands. On one hand, the hysteric asserts their
agency, even authority over the Other. Yet, what appears as unfettered
agency from the perspective of a discourse of authority is also
simultaneously a surrender of desire by enjoying the act of figuring the
other as the one with the exclusive capability to satisfy the
demand.]{.underline} Thus the logic of 'as hysterics you demand a new
master: you will get it!' [At the register of manifest content, demands
are claims for action and seemingly powerful, but **at the level of the
rhetorical form of the demand** or in the register of enjoyment,
**demand is a kind of surrender**.]{.underline} As a relation of address
hysterical **[demand is more a demand for recognition and love from an
ostensibly repressive order than a claim for change]{.underline}**. The
limitation of the students' call on Lacan does not lie in the end they
sought, but in the fact that [the]{.underline} hysterical [address never
quite breaks free from its framing of the master.]{.underline} Here [the
fundamental problem of democracy is not in articulating resistance over
and against hegemony, but rather the practices of enjoyment that sustain
an **addiction to mastery and a deferral of desire.**]{.underline} The
difficulty in thinking hysteria is that it is both a politically
effective subject position in some ways, but that **[it is politically
constraining from the perspective of organized political
dissent]{.underline}**. If not a unidirectional practice of resistance,
hysteria is at least a politics of interruption: [imagine a world where
the state was the perfect and complete embodiment of a hegemonic order,
without interruption or remainder, and the discursive system was
hermetically closed. Politics would be an impossibility, with no site
for contest or reappropriation and everything simply the working out of
a structure]{.underline}. Hysteria is a site of interruption, in that
hysteria represents a challenge to our hypothetical system, refusing
straightforward incorporation by its symbolic logic. But, [stepping
outside this hypothetical non-polity, hysteria is net **politically
constraining because the form of the demand, as a way of organizing the
field of political enjoyment requires that the system continue to act in
certain ways to sustain its logic**]{.underline}. Thus, **[though on the
surface it is an act of symbolic dissent, hysteria represents an
affective affirmation of a hegemonic order, and therefore a particularly
fraught form of political subjectivization.]{.underline}**

### Link -- Productivity

#### **Attempts to render their politics productive buy into the intrinsic value of labor which cements infinite capitalist dissatisfaction**

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 180-183, 20 September 2016,
MG)

The victory of capitalism over traditional societies is a victory over
the ideals of historical continuity and community. [In order for
capitalism to rule the world, markets and private property are not
enough. It requires a **new ideal** to gain ascendency over the
sedimented ideals of traditional societies. This new ideal is
**productivity** and its]{.underline} [maximization]{.underline}. As
Joyce Appleby points out, [capitalism became the **ruling economic
system** at the moment when "**the ideal of productivity finally became
dominant**."1 Once this ideal takes hold, even capitalism's detractors
accept it as their starting point. A capitalist world is a world where
productivity is implicitly--- and often explicitly---the highest
value.]{.underline}

[Productivity orients capitalist subjects around an end to be
accomplished, and this end promises to **exhaust the means used to
achieve** it. That is, the means are important only for the end that
they accomplish.]{.underline} This is a defining capitalist idea[, and
the devaluing or erasing of means is essential to capitalism. Labor is
important not for its own sake but for what it produces---for the
capitalist and the consumer]{.underline}. The end may be the realization
of profit or the enjoyment of a commodity. But in both cases the actions
done to make this end possible lose all importance.

[Capitalism's focus on ends spares the subject from the encounter with
the trauma of means]{.underline}. The means involve work and the effort
that it demands. But [the **real trauma of means** as opposed to ends is
that they are never over and done with. When we think in terms of the
end product and the accumulation of capital, we don't have to consider
the perpetual process required to create the product and the capital.
The goal of the end replaces the **repetition of the means** and enables
us to believe in the possibility of concrete and lasting accomplishments
that will ultimately deliver us from incessant]{.underline} repetition.
Capitalism directs subjects toward ends that they can achieve and
obscures means that no amount of productivity will allow them to escape.

At the same time, however, the capitalist system relies on means to
accomplish its ends. The capitalist and the worker must devote
themselves to the actions that will bring about productivity. [The
system even **requires moments** in which the means **disrupt
productivity** in order to reenergize it. Capitalism uses means for the
sake of expanding its productive ends, but it never permits subjects to
**invest themselves in means** while remaining in the capitalist
universe. Capitalist subjects can think about the goals they want to
fulfill without recognizing that they can never really leave the terrain
of means, which inheres in subjectivity itself. The degradation of means
is central to capitalism's **psychic appeal**]{.underline}**.**

In this sense, there seems to be a natural affinity between capitalism
and utilitarian philosophy. Though there are prominent utilitarian
philosophers (like Peter Singer) who struggle for a more ethical version
of capitalism or even for socialism, the philosophy itself, with its
focus on ends rather than means, fits the capitalist a priori structure.
In other words, the fact that John Stuart Mill is a prominent theorist
of both capitalism and utilitarianism should not surprise us. At the
beginning of his treatise on utilitarianism, Mill foregrounds the
overriding importance of ends. He claims, "All action is for the sake of
some end, and rules of action, it seems natural to suppose, must take
their whole character and colour from the end to which they are
subservient."2 This idea that the end drives our actions emerges out of
capitalism's privileging of productivity. 3

Of course, the idea that we act to realize ends does not originate with
capitalist modernity or with utilitarian philosophy. One finds this
emphasis on ends throughout Aristotle's thought, especially when he
begins the Nicomachean Ethics with the claim that all our actions aim at
the realization of some good. But there is a key difference between
Aristotle and capitalism. The former views ends as an engine for our
actions, but ends don't exhaust our actions or extirpate the means used
to attain them. This is what occurs with capitalism. Its emphasis on
productivity precludes every attempt to value means on a par with ends.
The result is that [all affirmations about the **intrinsic value of
labor** have an inherently anticapitalist hue to them.]{.underline}

[To put it in the terms of psychoanalysis, capitalism focuses the
attention of the subject not on the lost object that causes its desire
but on the object that it desires. The capitalist subject is always
looking forward to new objects that might attract its desire. In the
capitalist universe, objects of desire proliferate and are highly
visible]{.underline}. Just walking down the street forces multiple
encounters with these objects in the form of advertisements, the cars
that people drive, even the clothes that others wear. But the visibility
of objects of desire in the capitalist system corresponds to the
invisibility of the object that causes our desire.

[The object of desire obscures the object-cause of desire or lost
object]{.underline}. As we saw in chapter 1, the object of desire is an
empirical object, existing in the everyday world, that one can obtain in
the form of a new car, a new dress, or a new boyfriend. [The lost object
that causes desire, however, has no substantial existence and causes the
subject's desire only insofar as it is lost. The lost object is loss as
such and functions to **animate the subject** as a being capable of
acting in the world. We act---we take an interest in the world---
because we begin with loss, with the loss of what we never
had.]{.underline} This initial loss defines us as subjects. Thinking
about desire in terms of the object of desire makes desire much easier
to contemplate. [Instead of being doomed to failure, it becomes a
**worthwhile investment**. This realignment]{.underline} of our
experience of desire [constitutes an essential part of capitalism's
charm.]{.underline}

[Though capitalism succeeds in deflecting attention from the lost object
to the object of desire, it **cannot make the object of desire
satisfying** when the subject obtains it. In fact, capitalism relies on
the dissatisfaction that follows from obtaining the object of desire to
stimulate]{.underline} [consumption]{.underline}. If the commodity
proves disappointing, the subject will have to buy another, more
improved version. The eightyinch television will surely provide the
satisfaction that the fifty-five- inch one didn't. The older wine will
prove more enjoyable than the newer (and cheaper) vintage. But
eventually subjects grow wary of this perpetual game of dissatisfaction.
[Though the commodity always promises a complete satisfaction, **it
never delivers on this promise**. No television can ever be large
enough.4]{.underline}

### Link -- Russia Cyberwar

#### Their fear of Russian cyberattacks links [paranoid anxiety]{.underline} from cyberattacks to a [familiar paradigm]{.underline} of securitization against the threat of Russia -- cybersecurity discourse is [not neutral]{.underline} but rather creates [anxious subjects]{.underline} in a [constant state of expectant dread]{.underline} and makes their impacts inevitable through [misattribution]{.underline} and [orientalist lash-out]{.underline}.

3\. Hybrid warfare as anxiety geopolitics: learning from the Czech case
We will now further develop our conceptual argument by discussing hybrid
warfare as a case of anxiety geopolitics. Some have already shown that
[**[HW plays an ontological security role at the level of NATO]{.mark}**
and EU,]{.underline} [as [it 'links the **uncertainty**]{.mark}
**emanating** [from]{.mark} the **[hybrid]{.mark} nature** of the **new
[threats]{.mark}** [to the **known**]{.mark} **and routine**
[relationship **with**]{.mark} **its traditional
antagonist'**]{.underline}, that is **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Malksoo, ¨ 2018, p. 380). Following this argument, [[Russia's
aggression]{.mark} suddenly [gave meaning to a range of]{.mark} hitherto
[unconnected]{.mark}, yet omnipresent, and]{.underline}, therefore,
[anxiety-inducing [problems]{.mark} that [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, EU
[[and]{.mark} their [member states were facing]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Polarisation]{.underline} and the rise of [populism]{.underline},
widespread [distrust]{.underline} in institutions, [erosion of
international norms, [cyberattacks]{.mark}, propaganda [and]{.mark}
[disinformation]{.mark}]{.underline} campaigns [**[suddenly]{.mark} all
'[made sense']{.mark}**[, if they could be discursively linked to Moscow
as]{.mark} instances of '**[Russian hybrid war]{.mark}fare'**.
[HW]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[provided NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and
EU, wit[h [the]{.mark} **elusive ['security']{.mark}** [of knowing one's
enemy]{.mark}]{.underline} (also Browning, 2018). Similarly, in Czechia,
the HW discourse arrived at a time of intense social anxieties emerging
from a range of different cultural, economic or geopolitical factors.
For many in Czechia (and Central Europe more broadly), [post-Cold War
sense of ontological security had been provided through a civilisational
geopolitical imagination of 'the West', which Central Europe supposedly
(re)joined]{.underline} after 1989 (Cadier, 2019; Kuus, 2007; Todorova,
2009). Best captured by the slogan of a 'return to Europe', [the vision
of embracing liberal democracy, capitalism and Euro-Atlantic political
structures was seen as a panacea that would resolve all big
(geo)political questions once and for all]{.underline}. However,
[these]{.underline} very [principles and structures]{.underline}
arguably [started crumbling precisely at the time that the Central
Europeans were finally admitted in EU and NATO]{.underline}. The Iraq
War laid bare the rifts within the West, calling in question its further
relevance as a coherent geopolitical entity (Browning & Lehti, 2010;
Jackson, 2006). [Resurgent Russia challenged Western hegemony in Europe
and led 'an influential part of the]{.underline} Czech [political and
intellectual elite \[to\] succumb\[...\] to anxiety']{.underline}
(Drulak, ´ 2012, p. 79). [Central European countries were hit
particularly hard by the economic crisis and further hurt themselves by
the (foreign- or self-imposed) 'Western' medicine of
austerity]{.underline} (Tooze, 2018, pp. 220--238). In the Czech case,
this led to one of the longest periods of economic recovery in Europe,
accompanied by a free-fall in public trust in institutions, with only
one in ten Czechs expressing trust in the government (11%) and the
Chamber of Deputies (10%) at the lowest point in 2012/2013 (CVVM, 2013).
Add to this the rise of illiberalism at home and increasing divides
between the 'old' and 'new' EU member states, laid bare especially
during the so called 'refugee crisis' of 2015--2016. As a consequence,
you end up with a region that is not so sure about its feeling about and
towards 'the West' any longer (Kazharski, 2018; Krastev & Holmes, 2019).
Put differently, by mid-2010s, the Czech society was already in a state
of anxiety and uncertainty about its own geopolitical identity and in
search for ontological fixes.3 This is where the [[HW discourse clicks
in following Russia's aggression against Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} in
2014. [[To]{.mark} the **[liberal voices]{.mark}** [that **dominate
security debates**, hybrid war]{.mark}fare [could]{.mark} be used to
[put a name on]{.mark} this [anxiety]{.mark} and thereby attempt to
suppress it [by]{.mark} the [construction of **familiar**]{.mark}
**geopolitical [narratives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [By invoking the
prism of a conflict between a liberal-democratic West and an
authoritarian Russia, all sorts of problems -- spread of
[misinfo]{.mark}rmation, return of nationalism, [tech]{.mark}nological
[transformations]{.mark} or global [power shifts -- could be]{.mark}
[reduced to]{.mark} the logic of [civilisational
confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is the conventional
ontological security part of the story,]{.underline} to which we add
another step by showing how [this promise of security is never actually
fulfilled]{.underline}. Due to the supposed invisibility and
omnipresence of hybrid threats and the insecure position the Czechs
occupy in their own East/ West geopolitical imagination, [there is a
surplus of anxiety that cannot be successfully managed.]{.underline} The
case study is structured according to the two 'faces' of the Janusfaced
politics of anxiety. First, we show how [hybrid warfare was used as a
sense-making device promising to manage anxiety by providing a
conceptual link between a broad range of social issues and anchoring
them within the **familiar East/West geopolitical
imagination**]{.underline}. [This linking could simultaneously make
hybrid warfare meaningful by geopoliticising it, and reinforce the
crumbling East/West geopolitical imagination by showing its renewed
relevance in facing hybrid warfare.]{.underline} Second, we show how
[the fleeting sense of ontological security achieved via this
articulation gets undone by the recurring re-emergence of surplus
anxiety]{.underline} and how [HW ends up **reproducing and
perpetuating** the sense of **insecurity and anxiety** it was supposed
to resolve]{.underline}. The analysis is grounded in a range of
empirical materials from 2014 to 2020, including official documents,
media articles, popular books and parliamentary debates. Two caveats are
in order. First, both Czech government and civil society have responded
to the perceived threat of HW in many ways, including creating new
official institutions and informal initiatives tailored to deal with it
(Daniel & Eberle, 2018). In this article, we focus on the discourse that
made these responses possible. Second, as shown elsewhere (Daniel &
Eberle, 2021), the Czech HW discourse is not monolithic and includes
different understandings of what exactly constitutes a threat to whom,
ranging from military operations targeting public infrastructures all
the way to individual citizen's struggles with media literacy. In this
article, though, we downplay these differences and instead focus on the
commonalities that tie these different notions together as parts of
ostensibly the same problem of Russia's 'hybrid warfare'. 3.1.
Repressing anxiety: making sense of hybrid warfare through East/ West
geopolitics Starting with [the **[repression]{.mark} side [of]{.mark}
[anxiety geopolitics]{.mark}**]{.underline}, this can be [observed inthe
successive steps through which ontological security [is sought
by]{.mark} associating a range of issues with hybrid warfare and then
[**pinning HW** onto the **familiar map** of]{.mark} **[East/West
geopolitical imagination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This consists of four
interrelated discursive moves: [identifying the supposed 'origin' of
societal unease, putting a name of the problem, [localising it in
space]{.mark}, and endowing it with broader geopolitical
meanings]{.underline}. In this particular case, [Russia's invasion of
Ukraine in 2014 serves as the supposed original moment and 'cause' of
anxiety, hybrid warfare is the name presented to make sense of what is
going on, Russia is constructed as the threat, and civilisational
East/West geopolitics is used to give the situation broader
meaning.]{.underline} Let us now discuss each of these steps in turn.
First, a certain event needs to be constructed as a supposed point of
origin of the perceived unease, a 'crisis' that dislocates the symbolic
order (Nabers, 2015). [This is the first move in the repression of
anxiety, one in which an 'actually existing' empirical event is
discursively presented as the apparent cause of the deeper ontological
crisis that is affectively experienced as anxiety]{.underline}. In the
HW discourse in Czechia, [Russia's aggression against
Ukraine]{.underline} of 2014 [is presented as such profoundly shocking
and dislocating event]{.underline}. As the otherwise rather
down-to-earth and matter-of-fact military intellectual, Karel Rehka, ˇ
puts it: 'the Russian Federation shocked the whole world. The
unimaginable was broken into.' (Rehka, ˇ 2017, p. 199) 'Shock' and
'helplessness' are words used also by a high-ranking Czech diplomat
(personal interview, Prague, August 4, 2020). A leading Czech
think-tanker then recalls how 'surprised' he was by Russia's invasion
and how 'disorganised and fragmented' the security debates were in the
months that followed (Janda, 2017). The affective experience is captured
well also in a widely cited and circulated popular book, which vividly
describes how 'we are walking on the edge of a cliff' and
'\[u\]ncertainty is the only thing that you can count on these days'
(Alvarov´ a, 2017, p. 20). Therefore, 2014 was constructed as a radical
breakthrough into a much more insecure world. Yet, this move of
identifying the supposed origin of these dizzying feelings of anxiety in
one particular event was at the same time already the first step of
seeking ontological security by making sense of it. A second step is
putting the name on the problem. It is only the performative and
affect-laden performance of naming that connects disparate phenomena
together and creates a discursive 'object' that can be then dealt with
politically (Laclau, 2005). In our case, this leads to the creative
appropriation of the concepts of 'hybrid warfare' and 'hybrid threats',
which were virtually non-existent in the Czech public discourse prior to
2014 (Daniel & Eberle, 2018), and using them as a linchpin that connects
all sorts of societal problems. For an authoritative Czech security
document, 'hybrid threat' is a 'way to wage a confrontation or a
conflict', one that is characterised by an extraordinarily broad
spectrum of measures: 'a wide, complex, adaptable, and integrated
combination of conventional and unconventional means, overt and covert
activities, characterised primarily by coercion and subversion'
(Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016, p. 127). The
range of actors that can execute such methods is similarly broad,
including 'military, paramilitary, and various civilian actors' (ibid.).
Similarly, an overview of a 'Russian hybrid strategy' provided by the
counterintelligence service includes 'interpretation of modern history',
different ways of 'information warfare', 'networking/infiltration'
across the fields of politics, economy, crime, espionage, culture and
education, and military/guerrilla operations alike (Security Information
Service, 2018, p. 7). In statements like these, hybrid [warfare is
stretched so as to incorporate almost anything that can be understood as
a hostile activity]{.underline}. A such, [it becomes an universal object
of fear, broad enough to be used as a placeholder for all sorts of
anxieties.]{.underline} In the third move, [[hybrid war]{.mark}fare [is
**territorialised** by pointing to **Russia as its ultimate
source**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The 'postmodern' geopolitical
imagination of hybrid warfare in terms of flows, clouds and
infrastructures, is backgrounded in favour of the 'modern' territorial
East/West geopolitics of a Russian threat]{.underline}. In certain
cases, this means little more than merely pointing out that it is indeed
Russia that 'has executed hybrid operations \[ ...\], including targeted
disinformation activities and cyber-attacks', as the Defence Strategy
(Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic, 2017, p. 7) puts it
explicitly and other documents hint at implicitly (e.g. Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, 2015). More interesting are the
[instances]{.underline} which [present Russia not only as one source of
threats, but as an orchestrator coordinating all possible means and
actors.]{.underline} In such cases, [the 'postmodern' geopolitical
imagination of networks is used and reproduced,]{.underline} yet with a
key twist: suc[h networks are seen as hierarchical, with centre in
Moscow. In this logic, different domestic actors -- 'alternative news'
websites spreading anti-Western narratives, right-wing populists, even
contrarian intellectuals -- can ultimately be tied to an overall
Russia's masterplan]{.underline} (for an example see Janda & Kundra,
2016). The counterintelligence agency reports are an example of this
'puppet-master' approach. One of them lists 'covert infiltration of
Czech media and the Internet' and 'foundation of puppet organizations,
covert and open support of populist or extremist subjects' among the key
activities of Russia's 'information operations' (Security Information
Service, 2016, p. 9). Another outlines this logic in colourful detail,
claiming that 'Russia is creating a structure in Europe drawing on the
concept of the Comintern (the Communist International; the Third
International) founded by the Soviet Union' (Security Information
Service, 2015, p. 11), an organised network of all sorts of actors 'with
pro-Russian stances or fighting against the system' (ibid., 12).
However, [different actors can be labelled as agents or instrument of HW
and then geopoliticised and linked to Russia]{.underline} not only by
direct association, but also [because they are merely voicing opinions
that can be somehow qualified as 'pro-Russian'.]{.underline} As a more
recent counterintelligence report puts it, actually an 'overwhelming
majority of disinformation websites in Czech are the work of Czech
\[...\] citizens, who are not supported by Russian entities.' (Security
Information Service, 2018, p. 8) Nevertheless, [this]{.underline} still
[makes them a part of a broader geopolitical threat, as 'these people
and their internet projects are misused by Russia to spread propaganda
or support other components of the hybrid strategy]{.underline}.'
(ibid., 8) It is this imagination of a Russian-orchestrated networked
threat that enables a leading Czech journalist to blankly dismiss the
prominent disinformation website, Aeronet. cz, as 'writing for Putin'
(Kundra, 2016b), without any evidence of links to the Russian state
known at that point and with his own subsequent investigations showing
that this is most likely not the case. [It also makes it possible to
deal with anxieties by externalising the problem]{.underline}, such as
when a popular book argues that 'Furious hate \[...\] is not Czech, it
is something new, foreign. It came from the outside and 'somehow'
entered into us.' (Alvarov´ a, 2017, p. 88). In the fourth and final
move, [this '**[hybrid' struggle]{.mark} with Russia** [is **endowed
with meaning**]{.mark} [by]{.mark} [being **inserted into the**]{.mark}
**whole [symbolic structure ]{.mark}**[of **East/West**]{.mark}
**civilisational [geopolitics]{.mark}**[, in which]{.mark} '\[i\]ssues
of **[security and geopolitics]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} \[...\]
**[reframed in cultural terms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They become
simultaneously geographical, cultural and strategic concepts, and they
diffuse into ever more spheres of political life.']{.underline} (Kuus,
2007, p. x) [The societal anxieties that are managed via the narrative
of hybrid warfare emanating from Russia, are now also made part of an
eternal struggle between the East and the West]{.underline}. [[This
reactivates]{.mark} the '**[mental]{.mark} [maps',]{.mark}** in which
'[the West' functions as a **desired point of identification**]{.mark}
and a **[promise of security]{.mark} and prosperity**, whereas 'the
[East' is]{.mark} seen as '[an **abyss'**]{.mark},]{.underline} a notion
'[which]{.underline} in the Czech political discourse [refers less to a
geographical space than to ontological categories]{.underline} defining
the alienated past of the Czech Republic.' (Cadier, 2019, p. 84) As one
member of parliament, Jan Bartoˇsek, put it, the Czechs are left with an
unequivocal choice: 'either we will be part of NATO as a firm ally of
our pro-Western orientation, or we will be just one of Russia's many
colonies. There is no third way.' (in Chamber of Deputies, 2018a). In
statements like these, [[Russia is presented as]{.mark} a fundamentally
different entity, a quintessentially Oriental actor, belonging to [a
different 'universe']{.mark} that 'until nowadays has not met' with the
European one]{.underline} (Alvarova, ´ 2017, p. 70). [[Echoing]{.mark}
classical [Orientalist tropes]{.mark}, Russians supposedly rely on
'\[m\]ysticism, irrationality, associational instead of logical thinking
-- thus, a model of thinking that is of different civilisation, the one
we know rather from the Orient']{.underline} (Alvarova, ´ 2017, p. 193).
The potentially catastrophic consequences of allying with Russia are
then often presented through references to the past, reinforcing the
notion that what is at stake in HW is in fact yet another instance of a
historical struggle between civilisations. 'Many of us probably know our
modern history, from 1945 through 1948, Russian advisers, death of
\[foreign minister\] Jan Masaryk, occupation in 1968. The Russian
influence, which simply broke us away from the West, ripped us from
\[our\] democratic development, and has incalculable economic
consequences stretching to this day.' (Helena Langˇsadlov ´ a ´ in
Chamber of Deputies, 2018b). This idea that issues like propaganda,
misinformation or rise of populism are instances of a dramatic
geopolitical confrontation, is finally driven home also by the notion
that it is the West as a whole that is under attack, not just any
individual country. According to a counterintelligence report, 'the goal
of the Russian hybrid campaign' is 'primarily to weaken NATO and the EU
internally, e.g. by weakening individual member states' (Security
Information Service, 2018, p. 7). Therefore, should the Czechs fail to
defend themselves, they are supposedly endangering something much
bigger. According to a member of parliament, Jan Lipavský, what the
Russians want is 'to break European unity' (Chamber of Deputies, 2018b).
[Such ideas connect hybrid warfare squarely to the Messianistic
undertones of the East/West geopolitical imagination, in which the
Central Europeans serve as guardians defending the West at its
limit.]{.underline} To paraphrase Milan Kundera's (1984) foundational
essay on Central European civilisational geopolitics, by fighting hybrid
warfare, the Czechs are risking 'dying for Czechia and the West', which
indeed gives a sense of deep purpose and meaning to their cause and
produces a strong anxiety-repressing narrative. To sum up this part, one
important aspect of [the anxiety geopolitics of hybrid
warfare]{.underline} lies in the way how it allows
[channel]{.underline}ling [deeper anxieties by using the East/West
geopolitical imagination to produce **familiar storylines, identities**
and **objects of fear**]{.underline}. Despite being constructed as
multifaceted, broad and difficult to detect, [hybrid warfare is made
legible by being projected on a familiar 'mental map']{.underline},
where it becomes merely the most recent instance of long-lasting
struggle between the West and a fundamentally different, antagonist
Russia. However, the relationship between the discourses of hybrid
warfare and East/West geopolitics goes both ways: [HW is]{.underline}
not only [territorialised by, but also gives broader meaning to
and,]{.underline} in a way, [promises to reinforce the East/West
civilisational geopolitic]{.underline}s. It is in and [through
HW]{.underline} that [Russia is constructed as fundamentally different
and the West presented as a coherent entity under attack, as well as
something worth defending against the potentially tragic
alternatives]{.underline}. [Through the discourse of hybrid warfare,
doubts about the relevance or resilience of a Westcentric geopolitical
order are]{.underline} seemingly [brushed away and old geopolitical
identities are hardened]{.underline}. [This is precisely the logic of
ontological security that makes the ideas of a 'return of geopolitics'
and the 'new Cold War' so appealing]{.underline}, as shown by Guzzini
(2012, 2016) and Browning (2018). 3.2. Reproducing anxiety: danger is
everywhere and the East is already within [The HW discourse]{.underline}
arguably [succeeds on the level of meaning, that is in 'making sense' of
the new threats by geopoliticising them in East/ West
terms.]{.underline} In contrast, [its **success is only fleeting** at
best as an]{.underline} **[anxiety-repressing ontological
fix]{.underline}**. In this section, we focus on the other face of
anxiety geopolitics, showing how [the [HW discourse]{.mark} also
[contributes to]{.mark} the **[reproduction of
anxiety]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The argument that [security discourses
end up perpetuating the very insecurity they promise to deal
with]{.underline} is not new (e. g. Campbell, 1998). More recently,
Heath-Kelly (2018) and Jacobsen (2020) have advanced it from an
explicitly Lacanian perspective and shown how [the discourses of
terrorism and cybersecurity are inherently bound to disappoint the
underlying desire for security]{.underline}. [The endurance of these
discourses is made possible by the way how they pre-emptively
incorporate an explanation for their own failure. Terrorism and
cyberthreats are constructed in such a broad, complex and omnipresent
manner that no individual achievement can lead to the resolution of the
problems presented by these discourses.]{.underline} [There are always
new risks and vulnerabilities, as the destruction or neutralisation of
no actually existing objects of fear]{.underline} (e.g. Osama bin Laden)
[can ultimately satisfy the underlying ontological anxieties. There is
always something else to worry about.]{.underline} Building on
Heath-Kelly and Jacobsen, our final argument is that [hybrid
warfare]{.underline} works exactly like their examples, as HW, too, is a
discourse that is simultaneously anxiety-repressing and
anxiety-reproducing. In fact, we argue that the [**[linking]{.mark} of
[HW and East/West]{.mark}** [geopolitics produces]{.mark} a particularly
**strongly [anxiety-ridden discourse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [While
[hybrid war]{.mark}fare [presents]{.mark} [threats as
**invisible**]{.mark} **and [omnipresent]{.mark}** [due to]{.mark} their
**[covert]{.mark} and [networked nature]{.mark},** the East/West
imagination further raises the stakes and salience of such threats by
painting them as parts of a titanic civilisational
struggle]{.underline}. [The **[subjects]{.mark} produced by such
discourse [can never rest]{.mark}**, as what may be going on right
behind their noses is not just one particular cyber-attack,]{.underline}
a single conspiracy theory that has gained traction on Facebook, [or
merely one instance of information stolen by a spy]{.underline}.
Instead, [it is a battle for the future of 'the West']{.underline} and
the Czech belonging to it, one where the alternative option is the most
tragic one: a descent deep into the 'abyss' of 'the East' (Cadier,
2019). We will now illustrate these arguments by focusing on the
unfathomability of HW, the shifting nature of the threats it produces,
and the anxieties inherent in the East/West geopolitics that underpin
it. First, [the 'failure to secure']{.underline} (Heath-Kelly, 2015) [is
pre-emptively incorporated in the HW discourse by its portrayal of the
looming dangers as insidious, invisible and even impossible to
detect.]{.underline} As a key security document states, '\[t\]he
principal risk to which a subject attacked by a hybrid campaign is
exposed lies in the fact that they will not be able to identify the
hybrid campaign -- in time, in its full scale, or at all' (Ministry of
the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016, p. 129). According to the
deputy Helena Langˇsadlov ´ ´ a, what we are supposedly facing are
highly dangerous, yet 'creeping threats', which we 'cannot see on a day
by day basis' (in Chamber of Deputies, 2019). This leads some to claim
that 'at no point in history was it so extremely difficult to decide, if
we are at war, or not' (Taborský, ´ 2019, p. 164). While there may be
little drama on the surface, **[no one can ever rest in this
logic]{.underline}**. [An attack may be already underway, one that can
even be approximated to war, literally at any minute.]{.underline} As
the Special Forces general, Karel Rehka, ˇ put it at a conference
organised in the Czech parliament: 'In a way, we are already at war, we
just do not realise it or are not able to admit it.' (Lang, 2015)
[[This]{.mark} is a mode of thinking that [produces **highly anxious
subjects**, in a **constant sense** of]{.mark} the '**[expectant
dread']{.mark}** that is anxiety]{.underline} (Hook, 2015, p. 117), [one
not yet having a clear referent and directed towards all possible yet
still unknown dangers that may materialise at any time.]{.underline} It
is in these notions that [an **[unspecified existential]{.mark}
[threat]{.mark}** [may be hidden behind mundane events]{.mark} that the
otherwise backgrounded 'postmodern' geopolitical imagination of HW
suddenly kicks back in]{.underline}. If the 'modern' East/West
geopolitical imagination 'made sense' and provided at least some
fleeting ontological security by pointing to Russia, [[this
is]{.underline}]{.mark} frustrated by **[the [surplus
anxiety]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[produced via]{.mark} this
'**postmodern' [imagination]{.mark}** [of insidious]{.mark}, **hidden
[networks]{.mark}** operating [in]{.mark} physical and
[cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline} alike. In fact, as the discourse
postulates, we may not even know that it really is Russia in the first
place that is behind a particular incident, as hybrid attackers seek to
create 'an environment where responsibility for these activities cannot
(at least formally) be attributed to them, or at least only
speculatively and with great difficulty' (Ministry of the Interior of
the Czech Republic, 2016, p. 127). We may ultimately never know if this
or that mundane event is actually not a part of something much bigger,
as it is the very aim of the attacker to 'prevent a clear interpretation
of events and the discovery of their interconnectedness' (Ministry of
the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016, p. 127). Therefore, [while the
prevalent 'modern' geopolitical reading of HW enables channelling
anxiety by constructing Russia an object of fear, it still remains far
from the manageable fear of 'fight or flight']{.underline} (Kinnvall &
Mitzen, 2020, p. 241). [This is because these supposedly known aspects
of the danger are constantly being accompanied and disrupted by the
surplus anxiety of the 'unknown unknowns' stemming from the partial
inclusion of the 'postmodern' geopolitical reading. This effectively
pre-empts the HW discourse from ever solving the problems it is
supposedly designed to tackle, as it is wholly unclear how to act upon
threats that we are not yet aware of or do not know how to make sense
of.]{.underline} Second, [this oscillation between the known and the
unknown and between fear and anxiety manifests itself in the constantly
shifting construction of what is supposed to be the exact nature of the
threat coming from Russia]{.underline}. This is best illustrated in the
wording of the annual reports of the Czech counterintelligence agency
(SIS), which reinforce the notion that Russia is indeed a severe threat,
yet the precise character and shape of this threat appears to be
changing year after year. As already mentioned, in first annual public
report reflecting on the situation after Russia's aggression against
Ukraine, the SIS warned that their assessment showed the formation of
what was spectacularly labelled as the 'New Reincarnation of the
Comintern' -- a loose network of allied actors, similar to the Cold War
Soviet-controlled network of ideologically affiliated political parties,
agitators and agents. The danger was portrayed as a new version of this
tried and tested strategy, which Russia supposedly employs to connect
different groups dissatisfied with the Western liberal democracy
(Security Information Service, 2015, pp. 11--12). However, the spectre
of the Comintern was a one-off, never to appear again. Instead, SIS
later concluded that the threat resided in a much looser combination of
often uncoordinated actions of Russian intelligence, authentic Czech
individuals not in any way linked to Moscow but 'only' spreading their
own 'pro-Russian' worldviews, and finally, even in the lack of education
about modern history in schools (Security Information Service, 2018, pp.
6--8). This trend of diffusing the danger from a Kremlin-coordinated
network to seeing the threats in mere ideological resonances further
continued. The most recent report notes that there is a 'transition from
state-controlled or directed activities to spontaneous actions' of
like-minded actors. 'When Russian state officials express what they
desire to happen (for instance by spreading manipulative information),
proxy actors without any links to the Russian state proceed to action on
their own initiative and based on what they think the officials might
want' (Security Information Service, 2020, p. 9). Through this move,
[**the [spectre]{.mark}** [of '**Russian hybrid war**]{.mark}**fare'**
[can]{.mark} now **[encompass]{.mark} virtually [anything]{.mark}**
[that can be]{.mark} **somehow [interpreted]{.mark}** [as
matching]{.mark} with the **[desires]{.mark} or interests** [of the
Kremlin]{.mark}, [without]{.mark} any need for **proving direct
[links]{.mark}**,]{.underline} as these are no longer considered
necessary. The construction of 'a threat' now includes even situations
when 'a foreign power does not engage in any direct action and keeps its
distance, while using various ways (PR, instigating statements,
propaganda etc.) to inspire individual persons to take action' (Security
Information Service, 2020, p. 9). Put differently, [Russian threat can
be present even where there is no direct Russian hand
whatsoever]{.underline}. [Literally any individual with views somehow
similar to those of the Russian state can be seen as part of it, which
makes the idea that security can ever be achieved virtually
impossible]{.underline}. Instead, [this logic contributes to the
**reproduction of an anxious society**, defined by 'the **constant
presence** of **the possibility of that threat,** and with it, the sense
that government cannot fully protect the people and that danger resides
in the everyday']{.underline} (Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020, p. 247). Third,
[this notion that the possibility that something 'Russian' may be
insidiously present]{.underline} deep within the Czech society then
[**[revives also]{.mark} the [old anxieties]{.mark}** [inherent in
the]{.mark} 'modern' [East/West]{.mark} geopolitical
[imagination]{.mark} itself]{.underline}. Central Europeans'
self-positioning in East/West geopolitics is highly ambivalent (Kuus,
2007; Todorova, 2009). On the one hand, being or becoming part of 'the
Western civilisation' is a source of ontological security. On the other
hand, this [security is never quite complete or permanent]{.underline}.
This is because Central Europeans locate themselves at the very limit of
the West, as 'European edge-men' (Ma¨lksoo, 2010, p. 5), whose
membership in the civilisation must constantly be proved as it can
always be taken away -- especially by the forces of the 'East'. The 'old
shadow of Yalta', the feeling that the region's 'freedom could yet again
be expendable in times of crisis' is constantly present (Ma¨lksoo, 2010,
p. 75). Put differently, East/West geopolitics equips the Czech
'pro-Western' security intellectuals with a 'mental map, where the
country is depicted as being on the "edge" of Europe and constantly
risking to "fall" into an abyss \[...\] traditionally characterised as
the "East"' (Cadier, 2019, p. 84). While [the **East/West geopolitical
imagination**]{.underline} can succeed in [spatialis]{.underline}ing
[[the **threat in the Russian 'other'**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the
position it grants to the self [is **always**]{.mark} **potentially
[insecure]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Therefore, [it is also East/West
geopolitics itself that produces **subjects that are constantly on
alert,** facing the constant 'possibility of loss of one's
soul']{.underline} (Balaska, 2019, p. 8) [that defines the experience of
anxiety. Such fragile geopolitical self-positioning further fuels the
search for new and new sources of hybrid threats, as failing to uncover
and face them may have existential consequences,]{.underline} especially
given that 'Easternness' may have already infiltrated and compromised
the Czech social body. This notion of 'East within' links to the above
discussed unfathomability and invisibility of HW and manifests itself in
multiple ways. For one counterintelligence report, it takes the form of
smuggled ideas and narratives, presented 'in a way leading Czech
citizens to believe they are recipients of opinions held by fellow
citizens not of Russian propaganda' (Security Information Service, 2015,
p. 11). Similarly, a popular book on 'fake news' geopoliticises social
attitudes en bloc by identifying them along East/West axis, presenting
the 'disappointed' part of society as 'seeing a model in Russia, or
perhaps China' (Gregor, Mlejnkova´, & Zvolsi.info, 2018, p. 62). For
others, the 'East within' takes the form in the physical presence of
'Putin's agents' who supposedly 'quite likely teach your children at
universities, you meet them for a coffee in your favourite caf´e or work
in normal jobs.' (Kundra, 2016a, p. 88). [The anxiety geopolitics of
hybrid warfare is thus also about creating the normatively highly
disturbing '"red under every bed" mentality']{.underline} (Fridman,
2018, p. 3) [and applying 'the ethics of total war]{.underline} \[...\]
even to the smallest skirmish' (Galeotti, 2019, p. 8). Therefore,
[viewing security threats through the prism of hybrid warfare reproduces
a highly anxious society and perpetuates the justification for those
'intellectuals of statecraft']{.underline} (O ´ Tuathail & Agnew, 1992)
that would not hesitate to provide the sort of geopolitical fixes that
were discussed in the previous sections. Thereby, the discourse ends up
reproducing itself, as the two faces of anxiety geopolitics not only
disrupt, but also dialectically reinforce one another: [geopolitical
discourse emerges to repress anxiety and provide ontological
security]{.underline}, yet [the anxiety inherent in the discourse
disrupts ontological security and]{.underline}, to come full circle,
[creates the need for geopolitical discourses.]{.underline} [The result
is a society oscillating between its desire to avoid anxiety and the
repeated frustration thereof; an affective pulsation that has arguably
been elevated to a dominant mode of politics of (in)security in our
present time]{.underline} (Eklundh et al., 2017), of which hybrid
warfare is a prime example. As similar patterns of anxious over-reaction
and securitisation of broad areas of social life have been recognised by
authors writing about HW in different empirical contexts (Fridman, 2018;
Galeotti, 2019; M¨ alksoo, 2018; Ord ¨ ´en, 2019), we believe that the
problem with 'hybrid warfare' is of a more general nature and the
relevance of our analysis reaches beyond the Czech case. 4. Conclusion
Introducing anxiety geopolitics as a conceptual linchpin between
disparate arguments from debates on critical geopolitics, ontological
security, and politics of anxiety, this article made two central
contributions. First, we have theorised the relationship between
geopolitics and anxiety, moving beyond the existing accounts above all
by pointing out the Janus-faced character of anxiety geopolitics, in
which anxiety is both repressed and reproduced. Second, using the case
of Czechia, we have argued that [**[hybrid war]{.mark}fare** is a
**[discourse]{.mark}** that **constantly [oscillates]{.mark}**
[between]{.mark} [**repressing anxiety** by **geopoliticising**]{.mark}
**the source of [danger]{.mark}** [in **East/West terms**, and
**subverting**]{.mark} **its own [constructions]{.mark}** [by
**presenting**]{.mark} **the [threats ]{.mark}**[as]{.mark} **insidious,
[invisible, ]{.mark}**[and]{.mark} **constantly
[shifting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Therefore, we contend that the [HW
discourse is structured in a way that cannot achieve its purported
ambition to secure populations against 'hybrid threats' and instead ends
up **producing more insecurity and anxiety.**]{.underline} Our argument
has clear normative implications that expand the existing criticisms of
HW by putting the underlying civilisational geopolitics in spotlight.
[This should help us challenge the technology-centred presentism of the
HW discourse, showing that many of the ostensibly unprecedented concerns
are in fact reheated versions of narratives that date back decades if
not centuries]{.underline}. More importantly, [it enables us to point to
the presence of some of the highly problematic aspects of **[East/West
thinking]{.mark}**, especially those that [have been]{.mark} rightly
criticised as **[Orientalist, chauvinist or]{.mark} even
[racist]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see e.g. Said, 1978; Todorova, 2009).
Realising the presence of civilisational geopolitics makes it possible
to ask whether [certain [portrayals of Russia]{.mark} in HW
debates]{.underline} -- e.g. [as barbaric, irrational,
irredeemable]{.underline} -- may not [[represent narcissistic]{.mark}
[projections]{.mark} [of the 'Western' self]{.mark}]{.underline},
[rather than credible threat assessments]{.underline} (Chernobrov,
2019). Importantly, these are not scholastic matters of concern just for
ivory-tower peaceniks, as the proponents of HW sometimes like to put it.
Instead, [these criticisms have clear implications for security
policy]{.underline}. As recognised even among NATO's own analysts and
officials (Caliskan & Li´egeois, 2020; Rühle, 2019), [[adopting the
prism of HW and labelling Russia as an]{.mark} **inherently irrational
[enemy]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} **[detrimental to]{.mark} leading a
[productive debate]{.mark}** [on the]{.mark} exact nature of the
[challenges]{.mark} that [Putin's regime]{.mark} [poses and formulating
appropriate]{.mark} and efficient [strategies to **respond**]{.mark}
**to it.**]{.underline} We add to it by highlighting that the [HW
discourse]{.underline} not only '[undermines strategic
thinking']{.underline} (Caliskan & Li´egeois, 2020), but [also never
actually manages to provide security and creates highly concerning
societal side-effects]{.underline} ([perpetuation of anxiety,
proliferation of Orientalist images).]{.underline}

#### Policy debate's [paranoia]{.underline} towards Russian cyberattacks is informed by [anxiety geopolitics]{.underline} -- in order for the West to create a sense of ontological security and [stabilize]{.underline} it's self-image, despite new domains of threats, we map the modern world over a familiar symbolic structure of an East/West divide -- rather than providing security, the discourses of hybrid warfare [oscillate]{.underline} between a move to repress anxiety and repeated failure in doing so.

Apart from being a highly relevant problem, [HW]{.underline} also
[presents]{.underline} a particularly fitting case to be analysed as [an
instance of anxiety geopolitics]{.underline}. First, [the close link
between HW and anxiety has been explicitly recognised]{.underline} by
Maria Malksoo, ¨ who shows how [HW triggers 'anxiety about the
difficulties of concretising unknown and indeterminate
threats']{.underline} (Malksoo, ¨ 2018, p. 378). Second, [the relation
between HW and geopolitics is at the same time strongly pronounced and
marked by a profound tension.]{.underline} On the one hand, HW
ostensibly departs from a 'modern' geopolitical imagination based on
territorial states and borders (O ´ Tuathail, 1998). After all, [it is
about information operations in deterritorialised spaces of the
globalised public sphere, unattributable cyberattacks]{.underline}
carried out by non-state groups, [or the incitement of horizontal
protest movements]{.underline} discontent with the present political
order. On the other hand, [this '**postmodern' geopolitical
imagination**]{.underline} (ibid.) [has been very often subdued to the
much more traditional and 'modern' vision of a '**new Cold War'**
between Russia and 'the West']{.underline} (for critical analyses of
this discourse see Browning, 2018; Ciuta ˘ & Klinke, 2010; Toal, 2017).
Thereby, [[HW has been incorporated into]{.mark} the **civilisational
mode of [geopolitical]{.mark} [thinking]{.mark}** [that **divides the
world along**]{.mark} an **[East/West axis]{.mark}.** Approaching HW as
a case of anxiety geopolitics allows us to analyse this tension and
unpack the underlying puzzle: Why is it that the ostensibly novel,
networked and deterritorialised phenomena associated with hybrid warfare
get so easily submerged under such an old, static and territorial
geopolitical imagination?]{.underline} We argue that [the **allure of
[East/West]{.mark} [geopolitics]{.mark} lies in its familiarity**, as it
[provides a **well-worn map**]{.mark} that **promises [to 'make
sense']{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the **[anxiety-inducing]{.mark}**
**manifestations of '[hybrid war]{.mark}fare'**]{.underline}. Yet, we
also show that [these attempts eventually fail and the **[HW
discourse]{.mark}** **ends up [perpetuat]{.mark}ing** the
**[insecurities]{.mark} and anxieties**]{.underline}, which it was
supposed to resolve. As such, [it serves well to 'a 'hybrid-industrial
complex' of government agencies, think-tanks, nongovernmental
organizations]{.underline} (NGOs) [and pundits']{.underline} that
emerged around it (Galeotti, 2019, p. 11). By [pointing out to the role
of anxiety geopolitics in this economy of power/knowledge that emerged
around HW]{.underline}, this article [provides both an analysis and a
political intervention]{.underline}. The article proceeds as follows.
First, we start by a theoretical discussion, crafting the notion of
anxiety geopolitics by developing and connecting insights of the
literatures on critical geopolitics, ontological security, and politics
of anxiety. Second, we argue that [the [**amalgamation** of]{.mark} the
**[hybrid war]{.mark}fare [discourse]{.mark}** [and **East/West
geopolitics** presents]{.mark} a particular case of **[anxiety
geopolitics]{.mark}**, [which **oscillates** between]{.mark} the
[**promise to repress anxiety** and]{.mark} the **[repeated
failures]{.mark} in doing so**]{.underline}. This is illustrated by
examples from Czechia, a country considered as playing a pioneering and
outsized role in the European HW debate (Daniel & Eberle, 2021;
Jankowicz, 2020), which offers plenty of empirical material for
developing our theoretical argument and drawing some more general
implications. By way of conclusion, [[we discuss]{.mark} the [broader
take-aways for]{.mark} **critical geopolitics and IR**, as well as for
[**policy debates** on **how (not) to address the threat posed by
Russia**]{.mark}.]{.underline} 2. Anxiety geopolitics: space, affect,
and ontological insecurity Our research is located in critical
geopolitics, from which we borrow the understanding of geopolitics as
discourses and practices through which [people ''spatialize'
international politics and represent it as a 'world' characterized by
particular types of places, peoples and dramas']{.underline} (O ´
Tuathail & Agnew, 1992, p. 192). Critical geopolitics focuses on how
political events are articulated as somehow related to or driven by
geographic phenomena, or how issues are 'geopoliticised', that is
constructed as geopolitical problems (Cadier, 2019, p. 71). These ideas
are best captured by the concept of geopolitical imagination:
'[[Geopolitical]{.mark} [imaginations]{.mark} are the result of
subjects' attempt to make sense of the world by associating political
values with various parts of that map.]{.underline} [They can also be
spoken of in the collective sense, in which a group can be said to have
similar]{.underline} (if ultimately unique) [visions of the
world]{.underline}.' (Dittmer & Dodds, 2008, p. 447) More recently,
critical geopolitics has paid increased attention to affects and
emotions (Go¨karıksel & Secor, 2020; Laketa, 2019; Müller, 2013; Pain,
2009).1 Such affective geopolitics explores how [affects [are an
indivisible part of social construction of space]{.mark}, as they are
**intimately [entangled]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} [languages]{.mark} and
images [through which]{.mark} our '[mental maps' are produced]{.mark}
and disseminated.]{.underline} Summarising this broader argument, Laketa
argues that [geopolitics should be understood 'both as socially produced
and intimately experienced' and, consequently, 'the emotional and the
affective become the site of the geopolitical' and vice
versa]{.underline} (Laketa, 2019, pp. 156, 160). Therefore,
[[international politics is **spatialised**]{.mark} also [by **engaging
subjects**]{.mark} [**at the affective level**, which is an **essential
part** of the **production of geopolitical imaginations**]{.mark}
through which subjects view the world and their place within
it.]{.underline} [This [links critical geopolitics
to]{.mark}]{.underline} a range of literatures that deal with the
relationship between [identity, [emotions]{.mark} and [affects]{.mark},
including]{.underline} the [[scholarship on]{.mark} ontological
[security]{.mark} and anxiety in IR.]{.underline} The rapidly growing
literature on ontological security is concerned with how
[subjects]{.underline} -- [individuals, groups, or states]{.underline}
-- [deal with the uncertainty of modern life without losing the
'security of the self, the subjective sense of who one is']{.underline}
(Mitzen, 2006, p. 344) that defines ontological security and makes life
bearable. Building mainly upon the work of Anthony Giddens (1991),
classical contributions agree that [[ontological security is sought
through a]{.mark}n active [process of]{.mark} [constructing the
self]{.mark} and [anchoring it in the social world,]{.mark} which
happens [through]{.mark} the [establishment of]{.mark}
routines]{.underline} (Mitzen, 2006), [creation of [biographical
narratives]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kinnvall, 2004; Steele, 2008; Suboti´c,
2016), [or maintenance of relationships]{.underline} (Berenskoetter &
Giegerich, 2010). [The key underlying purpose of ontological
security-seeking is to avoid anxiety]{.underline}, which Giddens,
following Freud, understands as an elusive and paralysing 'generalised
state of \[...\] emotions' that is different from fear (Giddens, 1991,
p. 44). Fear is 'a basic emotion directed at a specific object that
prompts an adaptive response: fight or flight.' (Kinnvall & Mitzen,
2020, p. 241). In contrast, '[anxiety is diffuse, it is free-floating:
lacking a specific object', which makes it possible to 'pin' it to
different things and concepts]{.underline} (Giddens, 1991, p. 44).
[Repressing]{.underline} the elusive [anxiety by this 'pinning', which
transforms it into]{.underline} the [manageable fear]{.underline} of
something, [is then one of the key motives of human
behaviour]{.underline}. As [anxiety is]{.underline} considered
overwhelming and paralysing; [the 'chaos' that 'threatens on the other
side of the ordinariness of the everyday conventions']{.underline}
(1991, p. 37), [subjects often prefer to deal with it through the
production of fear via the discursive construction of 'specific objects
and threats']{.underline} (Chernobrov, 2019, p. 39). This involves
reaching to well-worn [identity discourses]{.underline}, which [serve as
vehicles for '\[t\]ransforming the anxiety of the unknown into the
security of the known]{.underline} (recognizable, [even if
illusory]{.underline}) \[[that]{.underline}\] [affirms the identity of
the perceiving subject and enables it to confidently interact with the
international other.]{.underline}' (ibid.) These arguments have a direct
purchase for critical geopolitics, as [geopolitical imaginations are
good examples of how such sense-making and anxiety-managing discourses
can look]{.underline} like. Some have already recognised and developed
this link. For Guzzini, the '[revival of geopolitical
thought']{.underline} in Europe [is directly linked to ontological
insecurity stemming from 'the sense of disorientation and foreign policy
identity crises]{.underline} which followed 1989.' (Guzzini, 2016, pp.
14--15) Making a more explicit link between anxiety and fear, Browning
develops a very similar argument: 'The attraction of [tropes of a new
Cold War and a return of geopolitics]{.underline} is precisely that they
[solve anxiety about current events by fitting them into clearly
established systems of meaning, though doing so entails reducing anxiety
by emphasising a world of threats and fears']{.underline} (Browning,
2018, p. 113). Both Guzzini and Browning are critical of using
[[geopolitics as a tool of anxiety management]{.mark},]{.underline}
citing its adverse [[effects]{.underline}]{.mark} both in normative
terms ([[creation of enemy-images,]{.mark} building an exclusionary
'Fortress Europe']{.underline}), [and]{.underline} in the consequential
[[decrease]{.underline}]{.mark} in [physical
[security]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. [[as a result of escalating
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} between antagonists locked-in in their
hardened identities). However, both also appear to ground their argument
in the assumption that anxiety ultimately can be managed (more or less)
successfully, one that is shared by the Giddensian mainstream of
ontological security studies. While scholars making such arguments would
consider the price of anxiety-management via geopolitics as too steep,
they still accept that such a trade-off can be made in the first place
and that one's ontological security can in fact be gained at the expense
of physical security or the well-being of others. As some of the most
recent debates in ontological security scholarship recognise (Browning,
2019; Cash, 2020; Gustafsson & Krickel-Choi, 2020; Kinnvall & Mitzen,
2020; Rumelili, 2020), these issues stem from Giddens' problematic
conceptualisation of anxiety that is adopted by most ontological
security work in critical geopolitics and IR. To sharpen the analysis of
the role of anxiety in geopolitics and deepen the critique made by
Guzzini and Browning, an additional theoretical step is needed. For this
purpose, we reach to the literature on the politics of anxiety drawing
mainly on the work of Jacques Lacan, a psychoanalyst whose ideas have
been increasingly prolific in IR (for an authoritative overview see
Zevnik & Mandelbaum, 2021), and, to a lesser extent, critical
geopolitics (Klinke, 2016; Laketa, 2019; Müller, 2013). Our approach
shares the Giddensian notion that anxiety is an inarticulable, traumatic
and potentially paralysing affect that subjects attempt to avoid and
repress. However, instead of seeing it as merely something that 'lurks'
behind as the dark other of normal life, anxiety is understood as a
durable affective condition interwoven in everyday experiences as well
as social processes and political institutions. It doesn't just lurk, it
is always already there, as it is present in the key mechanisms that
hold society together: in the production of social subjects and the
creation of rules through which these are regulated and bound together.
In this reading, [anxiety is correlative to the very emergence and
existence of the subject]{.underline} as such. [It is 'a type of
expectant dread' or 'a crushing experience of 'out of placeness'' that
arises 'when the subject, unable to ground themselves in either a
functional horizon of values or a reliable social or subjective
identification, fears that they might be somehow swallowed up,
devoured']{.underline} (Hook, 2015, pp. 117, 119). [It is less about the
disorientation and uncertainty caused by one particular
crisis]{.underline} ([e.g. Russia invading Ukraine,
Covid]{.underline}-19 arriving) [and more about being reminded of the
ultimately irreducible fragility of all things]{.underline}, including
human lives and social orders. In this sense, anxiety is an affect
linked to experiencing the limit of one's own existence as a subject,
something that signifies the encounter with 'the real', to use the
Lacanian term for the internal limit of social order and/or the
biological limit of human existence. Anxiety can never be fully managed
or repressed, as it is a reaction to being confronted with what is for
Lacan the ultimate reality of human existence: the fundamental
'groundlessness of meaning' (Balaska, 2019, p. 25) and, therefore, the
impossibility of ever achieving a coherent and stable identity. In this
sense, anxiety is the affect that 'does not deceive' (Lacan, 2014, p.
160), as it does not cover over the void at the heart of every social
identity, but rather confronts us with it at the level of bodily
sensation. To put it differently, [subjects are always ultimately
ontologically insecure, as no narratives, routines or relationships --
personal or geopolitical -- can ever fully deal with the omnipresent
possibility that things may not make sense and everything can break down
any minute. Anxiety emerges as the affect that signifies 'the need for
the stabilisation of the subject']{.underline} (Burgess, 2017, p. 29),
yet this [stabilisation is **doomed to fail** in the longer
term.]{.underline} Therefore, in contrast to readings that see it as an
aberration, anxiety is omnipresent, even though it clearly varies in its
intensity across time and space. Sometimes it is experienced more often
and more strongly, while there may be other, less anxious times
(Solomon, 2012 makes this argument with respect to affects in general).
The current social condition is arguably one when anxiety is on the
high; leading some authors to argue that we are now living in an
'anxious society', 'a society on constant alert, despite having no
identifiable existential threat. Instead, there is the constant presence
of the possibility of that threat, and with it, the sense that
government cannot fully protect the people and that danger resides in
the everyday' (Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020, p. 247, emph. added; Eklundh et
al., 2017). Such (highly) anxious society was created by the congruence
of a range of factors. Some point to the effects of neoliberalism and
austerity that produce the widespread feelings of powerlessness and loss
of control (Hirvonen, 2017). Others focus on the social media economy
that requires users who are constantly obsessively checking for news
updates, notifications and the affective gratification coming from
'retweets' and 'likes' (Davies, 2019). For yet others, the proliferation
of anxiety is connected to the societal changes linked to gender, race
and immigration (Ali & Whitham, 2018; Klinke, 2016; Zevnik, 2017b), or
the 'security creep' perpetuated by discourses and practices of
counterterrorism and cybersecurity (Heath-Kelly, 2018; Jacobsen, 2020).
This extended understanding of anxiety as ontologically conditioned and
socially circulated 'nervous states' (Davies, 2019) without a clear and
concrete referent object opens the possibility to think (geo)politics of
anxiety in broader and arguably more critical terms than in conventional
ontological security literature. On the one hand, the Lacanian approach
broadly agrees with the Giddensian ontological security framework with
respect to how [[subjects]{.mark} **try to [deal]{.mark}** [with
anxiety]{.mark}]{.underline}[: [by 'pinning' it]{.underline}
]{.mark}[on[to an object]{.mark} and [transforming it into a]{.mark}
**more [tangible]{.mark}** **[fear]{.mark} of something**]{.underline}.
In this manner, 'fear becomes a way of easing anxiety; of [[attaching a
**signifier**]{.mark} **(an object of fear**) to what is otherwise an
unfounded experience of unease']{.underline} (Zevnik, 2017a, p. 237).
[Such 'politics of fear' then transforms the crushing and paralysing
experience of anxiety into the management of 'concrete objects that we
have invented']{.underline} (Hirvonen, 2017, p. 261), [such as the
geopolitically coded 'Muslim terrorists' or 'Russians
hackers'.]{.underline} In this step, [anxiety is]{.underline} ostensibly
eased or [repressed by the production of (geopolitical) narratives that
'make sense' of the unpleasant experience by giving it a name and
placing it on a map]{.underline}.2 On the other hand, however, the
Lacanian take allows us to account also for the politics that is
imminent in the failure of these anxiety-managing attempts. As we have
argued, [all narratives built around particular objects of fear,
including geopolitical ones, are eventually failing, as these objects
are ultimately 'false targets']{.underline}. [They are merely temporary
discursive vessels functioning as placeholders for expressing deeper
ontological anxiety, which is bound to strike back]{.underline}.
Consequently, [attempts to make societies (feel) more secure, habitually
end up making them]{.underline} (feel) equally, or even [more, insecure
and anxious]{.underline}, [regardless of how much effort is invested
into fighting this or that particular threat]{.underline}. As
Heath-Kelly (2015, 2018) and Jacobsen (2020) have shown, successful
[[security discourses like]{.mark} counter-terrorism or
**[cybersecurity]{.mark}** have actually managed to
**[internalise]{.mark} this '[failure to secure']{.mark}**]{.underline}
[(]{.mark}Heath-Kelly, 2015) [by incorporating it into their very
structure.]{.underline} According to them, [[counter-terror]{.mark}ism
[and cybersecurity are constructed as]{.mark} dangers [so
slippery]{.mark} and multifaceted [that once we resolve one]{.mark}
problem]{.underline} (by killing Osama bin Laden, [resolving a
particular [cyberthreat]{.mark}]{.underline}), [[a whole]{.mark} [new
range of]{.mark}]{.underline} terrorist groups or [[cyber issues
**emerges**]{.mark} **to occupy their place**.]{.underline}
Consequently, and in contrast to conventional ontological security
literature, [politics of anxiety]{.underline} is not only about managing
and repressing it through narratives, routines and relationships. It is
also about other ways of manipulating anxiety for political purposes,
including [[reproduc]{.underline}i]{.mark}ng, nurturing and spreading
[[it via]{.mark} the [construction of threats so]{.mark} **opaque and
widespread** that [they **cannot be**]{.mark} **possibly**
[resolved]{.mark}, [like]{.mark} **terrorism, [cybersecurity]{.mark} --
[or hybrid war]{.mark}fare.**]{.underline} [By its **repeated failure to
secure**, such [discourses hold societies in]{.mark} the anxious
'**[state of constant]{.mark} and heightened
[alertness']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Davies, 2019, p. xii), [making them
ready to accept a range of **pre-emptive security measures** across all
possible areas of social life.]{.underline} Bringing the argument
together, by the notion of anxiety geopolitics we conceptualise the
politics of dealing with anxiety by linking it to objects and issues
spatialised through the means of geopolitical imaginations. By
references to geographical categories, such as states, regions,
continents or civilisations, [this type of affective geopolitics
promises to transform the amorphous and ambiguous anxiety stemming from
range of different issues into tangible and manageable objects of fear
taking the form of geopolitical threats]{.underline}. Yet, as all [such
narratives and images are ultimately bound to fail to resolve the
underlying anxiety]{.underline}, the analytical focus must be extended
also to how these failures are accounted for and how [anxiety is being
further reproduced with the help of geopolitical
imaginations]{.underline}. Therefore, [anxiety geopolitics is ultimately
about the oscillation between repressing anxiety through the
geopoliticisation of both the 'threat' and the self, as much as it is
about dealing with the recurring failures to secure the subjects
produced by such geopoliticisation, which result in reproduction of
social anxiety]{.underline}.

### Link -- Society

#### The toll for societal acceptance is sacrifice of the object of your desire -- that installs the death drive into the subject and endlessly repeats the process until the subject's death drive has been domesticated

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 146-148, 1 July 2013, MG)

Just as the sacrifice of what the subject doesn't have constitutes the
subject as such, the shared sacrifice of an impossible pleasure gives
birth to social living. [The sacrifice that subjects make in order to
enter society repeats the earlier sacrifice, but what occurs is
**repetition with a difference**. While the initial sacrifice of the
privileged object **installs the death drive** in the subject and
thereby constitutes the individual as a subject, the repetition of this
sacrifice marks an attempt to **domesticate the death drive** at the
same time as it follows the death drive's logic. That is, the death
drive leads us to this repetition, but the repetition attempts to solve
the impossible bind that the death drive creates for us. Society is an
attempt to solve the problem of subjectivity itself.6]{.underline}

Of course, the idea that subjectivity in the psychoanalytic sense exists
prior to society is absurd, since [subjectivity only becomes possible
through the imposition of a societal demand on an animal being. But
within society, the process of subjectivization occurs in two steps: an
initial loss occurs that constitutes the subject, and subsequently the
subject makes an additional sacrifice in order to commemorate the first
loss and to join the social order]{.underline}. It is only through the
repetition of loss that the social order really gets a hold on the
subject because the second loss involves an investment through sacrifice
in the good of the social order as a whole. [In this sense, subjects do
exist prior to their entrance into the social order, and properly
socialized subjects are only those who have **sacrificed** for the sake
of the social good.]{.underline} The subject who would refuse to make
this sacrifice for the sake of society would not participate in the
social bond and would exist as an outsider within the social order. This
is the position that the ~~psychotic~~ occupies.

B[ecause the originary sacrifice of the privileged object creates this
object, we can never have what we've lost, which means that **we desire
an impossibility**. The turn to society, however, allows us to envision
possibility at the site of this impossibility]{.underline}. When we
repeat the sacrifice in order to enter the social order, we do so in
response to a demand made by social authority. [Social authority
prohibits the ultimate enjoyment, and this prohibition functions to
disguise its]{.underline} [impossibility]{.underline}. The transition
from the initial sacrifice that constitutes subjectivity to its
repetition that constitutes the social bond is the transition from
impossibility to prohibition. [We are willing to accept societal
prohibition readily because it has the effect of making our **impossible
object seem possible**. In this sense, joining society offers the
subject the recompense of eliminating impossibility --- replacing
impossibility with a never- to-be-realized possibility]{.underline}.

But for the demand that society makes on me, the thinking goes, I would
have the enjoyment that constantly eludes me. While the originary
sacrifice involves the subject depriving itself of nothing, [the
repetition of the sacrifice when the subject enters society
retroactively transforms this earlier sacrifice and allows the subject
to believe that it has lost a substantial object rather than the
embodiment of nothing]{.underline}. The socialized subject can no longer
see the nothingness of what it has sacrificed. [Thus, **the turn to
society is a deceptive turn**. At its foundation, socialization imparts
a lie to the subject. The social bond results from a shared lie and
appeals to us because it permits a retreat from an unbearable
impossibility to a frustrating]{.underline} [prohibition]{.underline}.

We exist as members of a society and enjoy ourselves in this capacity
through the shared sacrifice that gives us something held in common.
What we hold in common is not a positive object; it is nothing but the
act of sacrifice. [For the subject itself, sacrifice provides a way of
returning to **its original genesis**, and for society, sacrifice offers
an opportunity for returning to the point at which the social order
constituted itself. Organized rituals of sacrifice have an enduring
place in society because they accomplish this type of
return]{.underline}. To an extent that has not been adequately
emphasized, psychoanalytic thought allows for a unique reappraisal of
the origin and persistence of sacrifice within societies.

The prevalence of sacrifice presents a problem for political and social
theorists because it is an act that seems to work against individual and
social self-interest. The great thinkers of sacrifice have thus tried to
reconcile it with an end that its appearance belies. For instance,
Marcel Mauss sees sacrifice as the foundational form of the social bond.
As he points out in his discussion of potlatch among the Indians of the
American Northwest, "[The purpose of destruction by sacrifice is
precisely that it is an **act of giving that is necessarily
reciprocated**."7 Sacrifice engenders reciprocity (with another
individual, another tribe, a god, or whatever), and it thus has the
result of producing a bond where none had hitherto existed. Rather than
constituting a loss for one sacrificing, the act redounds upon the one
who performs it and bestows the profit of a desired relationship. By
interpreting sacrifice (and gift giving) in this way]{.underline}, Mauss
sidesteps its counterintuitive appearance and reveals how it remains
within the realm of interested behavior. But by doing so, he also raises
the question of why bonds or relationships require the act of sacrifice
rather than mere verbal or contractual agreement. [Sacrifice seems like
**too much trouble for societies to endure** if they simply want to
establish relations. In short, the excess implicit in the phenomenon of
sacrifice remains]{.underline} despite the explanation that Mauss
provides.

### Link -- Surveillance

#### Their desire and attitudes towards surveillance premise their subjectivities only in terms of privacy which is a capitalist trick to privatize the conscious

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 83-85, 20 September 2016, MG)

In this sense, [totalitarianism is not the reverse side of liberalism's
insistence on sustaining the private world at all costs, but instead the
**ultimate end point** of this insistence. The more one seeks to
safeguard privacy and clear the path for capitalist relations of
production, the more one also leaves space for the rise of
totalitarianism]{.underline}. The totalitarian leader might eliminate
privacy but is able to do so because a commitment to privacy
predominates. One cannot imagine the rise of totalitarianism without
capitalism's destruction of the public world.

Still, concern about capitalism's destruction of the public world seems
misplaced in the context of contemporary events. [The greatest threat
today seems to be the **elimination of privacy**, not the destruction of
the public world. There may be whistle-blowers who come forward to
expose secret assaults on the public, but they are in prison or exile
for bringing the evisceration of privacy to light. Our privacy appears
imperiled in the face of assaults from both the state and from the
corporate world]{.underline}. It has become increasingly difficult to
exist off the capitalist grid, to find a private place in which one
might challenge the dominance of the capitalist system.

[We live today in a surveillance society in which there is increasingly
less space where subjects can act without being observed. If capitalism
ushers subjects into a private world, it is also developing a **system
of surveillance** that appears to eliminate the possibility of
privacy]{.underline}. Though we can be reasonably sure that no one
surreptitiously opens our letters and reseals them, we can be also be
reasonably certain that some system is actually monitoring our email and
cell phone communications as well as observing us for much of the day.
Surveillance has become the norm in contemporary capitalism.

But widespread surveillance doesn't have the effect of eliminating our
investment in privacy and our private worlds. [Instead,
surveillance---and **knowledge about that surveillance**---has the
effect of heightening our **commitment to privacy**. When surveillance
threatens the private world, we respond by identifying **entirely as
private beings**, which is precisely the response the surveillance aims
to trigger. The ideological function of surveillance is not the
elimination of privacy but the **creation of subjects who see themselves
only in terms of privacy**. Surveillance leads one to think of oneself
as an essentially private being whose private life threatens to become
visible.27]{.underline}

[Whether one responds to surveillance with outrage or acquiescence, the
fact of thinking about oneself as a being subjected to surveillance
already indicates a **turn away from the public and toward the
private**. In this sense, surveillance ipso facto privatizes
us]{.underline}. This is clearest in those who see increasing
surveillance as an existential threat that they must defend themselves
against. They retreat into enclaves of privacy and erect more and more
barriers to any public contact in order to preserve their private
worlds. But by doing so, they play right into the hands of the structure
they believe they are opposing. They accept that they have a private
world and a private being to treasure. But one cannot defeat the
privatization of the world by retreating into privacy.

[Those who simply accept surveillance often do not escape its
ideological hold either, though their investment in privacy is not as
easy to see. Surveillance ensconces subjects in a self-relation built
around privacy, and going about one's daily existence under surveillance
tends to focus one's attention on one's private interests]{.underline}.
This is evident in many consumer interactions with companies on the
Internet. On the Internet, surveillance is even more thoroughgoing than
it is in London, the city with the most surveillance cameras in the
world.

As everyone who has ever made an online purchase knows, companies track
the electronic behavior of individuals in order to know how best to
market to them. They keep records on the websites individuals visit, the
products they purchase, and contacts they make on social networks. Most
individuals tacitly appreciate this tracking because it facilitates the
act of consumption. Amazon.com knows which coupon to send to one
customer, and Nike knows which shoe to advertise to another. Everyone
comes out ahead. Surveillance facilitates the consumption process by
eliminating barriers to the object of desire. It is easier to find what
one wants on Amazon.com because the company has tracked previous
purchases and browsing activity. When one accepts this easy access to
the object, one has adopted the attitude toward desire that capitalist
society constantly encourages in its subjects.

[Other acts of surveillance, however, have no direct bearing on subjects
accessing their objects of desire. Surveillance of private phone calls
in the United States by the National Security Agency or the millions of
surveillance cameras placed throughout Great Britain observing the
minutiae of individual activity do not make it easier for me to
accumulate. But these apparatuses do function as **evidence** for the
essentially **private nature of existence**. They constantly remind us
that we have something to hide, something that belongs to us
alone.]{.underline}

[The premise that animates the surveillance society is that the subject
is an essentially private being]{.underline}. In public interactions the
subject dissimulates and obfuscates its true desire, but in private that
desire becomes evident. When I'm in public, I alter my actions according
to the expectations of the Other, but when I'm in private, no such
barrier exists. I'm free to be myself, which is why the system of
surveillance focuses on the private sphere and increasing our investment
in it.

[In the face of an almost ubiquitous surveillance perpetuated by both
state and corporate forces, it seems ludicrous to lament the decline of
the public world. And yet, our **satisfaction depends on this public
world** and the obstacle to desire it erects]{.underline}. Threats to
privacy are not threats to the subject's mode of satisfaction. Privacy
itself is the threat. [Surveillance is only a danger insofar as it
convinces us that we have an essentially private being that might be
subjected to surveillance. The subject's essence is always outside of
itself and **readily visible to the public**]{.underline}. For the
subject that recognizes the necessity of the obstacle, there is nothing
for the surveillance camera to see. [The subject necessarily **exposes
itself in the form of its subjectivity**.]{.underline}

### Link -- Terrorism

#### The specter of terrorism the affirmative attempts to destroy is rooted in the belief of ceasing anxiety -- that solely begets more violence and disappointment

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 108-111, 1 July 2013, MG)

While most contemporary subjects don't smash rocks over the heads of
those who provoke anxiety in them, the conclusion of Short Cuts is
nonetheless revelatory. [Much (physical and psychic) violence today
occurs in response to the **anxiety of the encounter with the enjoying
other**. Both the violence of the fundamentalist suicide bomber and the
violence of the **War on Terror** have their origins in the experience
of anxiety. Suicide bombers target sites of decadent Western enjoyment
--- bars, clubs, discos, the World Trade Center, and so on --- in order
to create a world where this enjoyment would return to the shadows and
thereby **cease to provoke anxiety**]{.underline}. The true
fundamentalist dreams about being able to desire once again with some
respite from the proximate object and the anxiety it creates. [But the
actions of the suicide bomber, for their part, produce anxiety in the
Western subject that leads directly to the phenomenon of the War on
Terror.19]{.underline}

[The anxiety that suicide bombers create does not stem from the purely
existential threat that they pose. Unlike the Western subjects that they
threaten, suicide bombers appear to enjoy through their belief. They
believe so fervently that they are willing to sacrifice themselves: they
have full confidence that they will receive an eternal reward of
seventy-two virgins for their sacrifice. Confronted with this seemingly
authentic belief, the cynical Western subject for whom belief is always
belief at one remove almost inevitably experiences anxiety]{.underline}.
After the September 11 attacks, the focus on the eternal reward that the
suicide bombers believed they would receive indicates the relationship
between anxiety about terrorism and anxiety generated by the encounter
with the enjoying other. The suicide bomber enjoys --- both through
unquestioning belief and through the anticipation of the eternal reward
--- and it is this enjoyment that struck the towers on September 11,
2001. [The War on Terror, which aims to **wipe out all suicide
bombers**, has as its ultimate goal the **elimination of this enjoyment
and the anxiety** that follows from it.]{.underline}

[Both the suicide bomber and the perpetuators of the War on Terror make
the same mistake that Jerry does in Short Cuts when he watches his
spouse work as a phone sex operator. They see an enjoying other where
there is nothing but the image of enjoyment]{.underline}. The suicide
bomber sees Western women in revealing clothes and believes that the
bare skin promises an opening to enjoyment, but this represents a
failure to understand that enjoyment operates through limitations and
barriers rather than through revelations and transgressions. One can
never go far enough in the direction of transgression to reach real
enjoyment. It is the veil, not the miniskirt, that is the true garment
of enjoyment.20 The enjoying Western other is the enjoying other of the
suicide bombers themselves, not the enjoying other in itself. No number
of successful attacks will dissipate this enjoyment because they can
never hit its real source within the attacking subject itself.

[The perpetuators and supporters of the War on Terror view suicide
bombers as true believers in pursuit of the ultimate enjoyment. This is
why the idea of the seventy-two virgins receives so much attention as
the reason for the fundamentalists' willingness to die for their
cause]{.underline}. Though the reward of the seventy-two virgins for the
martyr has almost no basis in the Koran or in Islamic theology, [people
in the West **repeat this justification** for the suicide bombing
because it fits within the fantasy of the enjoying other, a fantasy also
furthered by the common perception that the Islamic fundamentalists,
unlike most of us in the West, are true believers]{.underline}.

Belief constitutes the source of their danger and their enjoyment. But
the act of blowing oneself up for a cause in no way testifies to the
completeness of one's belief. As Pascal sees, acting as if one believes
functions as a way of securing the belief of one who is not certain. The
dramatic act is almost inevitably an attempt to prove to oneself that
one believes rather than evidence for that belief. The subjects who have
to sacrifice themselves for the cause most often have to do so in order
to avoid losing faith in the cause. In short, the danger lies not in the
true believer --- the authentically enjoying other --- but in the one
who wants to believe but cannot. [The violence of the War on Terror
strikes out at the **wrong target** insofar as it aims at the true
believer. The suicide bomber is not so different from the typical
Western subject: both experience enjoyment assaulting them from the
outside in the form of the enjoying other, and both seek ways of
eradicating this enjoyment with violence before it becomes
overwhelming.]{.underline}

[The problem with violence as a solution to anxiety is not just that it
would **beget more violence** and lead to a war of all against all but
that it doesn't work. Violence can kill the other, but it can't destroy
the other's enjoyment]{.underline}. In fact, often the death of the
other has the effect of appearing to increase the level of enjoyment
rather than destroying it, which is why violence never provides a
definitive solution for the one who perpetuates it. Not only does the
idea of the enjoying other persist for the subject aft er the other's
death, but this same enjoyment often proliferates and manifests itself
elsewhere. This occurs in David Lynch films such as Lost Highway (1997)
and Mulholland Drive (2001), though it appears most pointedly in the
Twin Peaks (1990--91) television series.

### Link -- War

#### The desire to restrict the worst instances of war is part and parcel of the unconscious' enjoyment of sacrifice -- they introduced it into this space because they secretly enjoy its trauma

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 150-151, 1 July 2013, MG)

[Like religion, **war continues in modernity**, even though we
understand and declaim its wastefulness. The typical modern subject can
watch an antiwar film]{.underline} like Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory
(1961) [and feel convinced that **war is hell** and completely
unnecessary. After leaving the theater, however, this same subject can
come to believe that there is **no alternative** but to send troops to
Vietnam to stop the potential spread of Communist
aggression.]{.underline}

[**War appeals to even modern subjects because it mobilizes our
enjoyment**. Wars are not fought only for the sake of expanding or
defending reigns of power but also in order to enact a social sacrifice.
By fighting a war, a social order sacrifices its soldiers, and this
sacrifice constitutes a great part of war's appeal. Supporting the
troops necessarily implies supporting and celebrating their sacrifice,
which is why antiwar movements that proclaim "Support the troops, bring
them home" fail to arouse the masses to action. By bringing the troops
home, one eliminates the possibility of their sacrifice, which is the
source of the society's libidinal investment in them. Bringing the
troops home renders it **impossible to continue to enjoy
them**.]{.underline}

[The problem with an antiwar film like Paths of Glory that depicts
senseless sacrifice is that this sacrifice adds to rather than subtracts
from war's appeal]{.underline}. This is why, as Sheila Kunkle has
pointed out, every war film is a prowar film.13 [No matter how
negatively]{.underline} a film [depicts a war, the carnage inevitably
links to **war's hidden appeal**. Of course, by showing war's utter
meaninglessness]{.underline}, Kubrick's film [impairs to some extent our
ability to enjoy the sacrifice, but he doesn't eliminate it
altogether]{.underline}.

A film like Saving Private Ryan (Steven Spielberg, 1998), on the other
hand, shows the suffering of war leading to a meaningful end, which is
why it is even more directly a prowar film. Saving Private Ryan [allows
us to enjoy the sacrifice of the soldiers in World War II and to
**dissociate enjoyment from sacrifice.** We watch the film believing
that we accept the sacrifice for the sake of the pleasure we experience
in the end]{.underline} (with the rescue of Private Ryan or with the
victory of the Allies) [rather than for its own sake. We need a reason
to sacrifice not because we otherwise aren't willing to sacrifice but
because a reason allows us to **disavow the traumatic nature of our own
enjoyment**. We can tell ourselves that we are sacrificing not for the
sake of our enjoyment but for the sake of what we gain from that
sacrifice. In this way, reasons for our sacrifices have the effect of
accommodating sacrifice to the modern demand for utility.]{.underline}

### Impact - Death Drive

#### The impact is extinction -- the death drive undergirds their notions of progress and causes inevitable masochistic repetition of the 1AC's impacts

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 13-15, 1 July 2013, MG)

Death at the Bottom of Everything

[The death drive is neither]{.underline} (contra Marcuse)
[aggressiveness nor an impulse to return to an inorganic]{.underline}
state (as Freud's metaphor in Beyond the Pleasure Principle might imply)
[but an impetus to return to an **originary traumatic and constitutive
loss**. The death drive emerges with subjectivity itself as the subject
enters into the social order and becomes a social and speaking being by
sacrificing a part of itself. This sacrifice is an act of creation that
produces an object that exists only insofar as it is lost. This loss of
what the subject doesn't have institutes the death drive, which produces
**enjoyment through the repetition of the initial loss**.]{.underline}

[Subjects engage in acts of self-sacrifice and self-sabotage because the
loss enacted reproduces the subject's lost object and enables the
subject to **enjoy this object**. Once it is obtained, the object ceases
to be the object. As a result, the subject must continually repeat the
sacrificial acts that produce the object, despite the damage that such
acts do to the subject's]{.underline} self-interest. From the
perspective of the death drive, [we turn to violence not in order to
gain power but **in order to produce loss**, which is our only source of
enjoyment. Without the lost object, life becomes bereft of any
satisfaction. The repetition of sacrifice, however, creates a life worth
living, a life in which one can enjoy oneself through the lost
object.]{.underline}

The repetition involved with the death drive is not simply repetition of
any particular experience. [The repetition compulsion leads the subject
to repeat specifically the experiences that]{.underline} have
traumatized it and [disturbed its stable functioning. The better things
are going for the subject, the more likely that the death drive will
derail the subject's activity]{.underline}. According to the theory
implied by the death drive, [any movement toward the good --- **any
progress** --- will tend to produce a reaction that will undermine it.
This occurs both on the level of the individual and on the level of
society]{.underline}. In psychoanalytic treatment, it takes the form of
a negative therapeutic reaction, an effort to sustain one's disorder in
the face of the imminence of the cure. We can also think of individuals
who continue to choose romantic relationships that fail according to a
precise pattern. [Politically, it means that progress triggers the
**very forms of oppression** that it hopes to combat and thereby
incessantly **undermines** **itself**]{.underline}. There is a backlash
written into every progressive program from the outset.

[The death drive creates an essentially **masochistic structure within
the psyche**]{.underline}. It provides the organizing principle for the
subject and orients the subject relative to its enjoyment, and this
enjoyment remains always linked to trauma. This structure renders
difficult all attempts to prompt subjects to act in their own
self-interest or for their own good. [The death drive leads subjects to
act contrary to their own interests, to sabotage the projects that would
lead to their good]{.underline}.

Common sense tells us that sadism is easier to understand than
masochism, that the sadist's lust for power over the object makes sense
in a way that the masochist's self-destruction does not. But for
psychoanalysis, masochism functions as the paradigmatic form of
subjectivity. Considering the structure of the death drive, masochism
becomes easily explained, and sadism becomes a mystery. Masochism
provides the subject the enjoyment of loss, while sadism seems to give
this enjoyment to the other.

This is exactly the claim of Jacques Lacan's revolutionary
interpretation of sadism in his famous article "Kant with Sade." Though
most readers focus on the essay's philosophical coupling of Kantian
morality with Sadean perversion, the more significant step that Lacan
takes here occurs in his explanation of sadism's appeal. Traditionally,
most people vilify sadists for transforming their victims into objects
for their own satisfaction, but Lacan contends that they actually turn
themselves into objects for the other's enjoyment. He notes: "[The
sadist discharges the pain of existence into the Other, but without
seeing that he himself thereby turns into an '**eternal object**.'"21
Though the other suffers pain, the other also becomes the sole figure of
enjoyment.]{.underline} What the sadist enjoys in the sadistic act is
the enjoyment attributed to the other, and the sadistic act attempts to
bring about this enjoyment. In this sense, sadism is nothing but an
inverted form of masochism, which remains the fundamental structure of
subjectivity.22 [Self-destruction plays such a prominent role in human
activities because the death drive is the drive that animates us as
**subjects**.]{.underline}

Unlike Herbert Marcuse, Norman O. Brown, another celebrated proponent of
psychoanalytically informed political thought, attempts to construct a
psychoanalytic political project that focuses on the death drive. He
does not simply see it as the unfortunate result of the repression of
eros but as a powerful category on its own. In Life against Death Brown
[conceives of the death drive as a self-annihilating impulse that
emerges out of the human incapacity to accept death and loss. As he puts
it, "The death instinct is the **core of the human neurosis**. It begins
with the human infant's incapacity to accept separation from the mother,
that separation which confers individual life on all living organisms
and which in all living organisms at the same time leads to
death."23]{.underline} For Brown, [we pursue death and destruction,
paradoxically, because we cannot accept death. If we possessed the
ability to accept our own death]{.underline}, according to Brown's view,
[we would avoid falling into the death drive and would thereby rid
ourselves of human violence and destructiveness.]{.underline}

Like Marcuse, Brown's societal ideal involves the unleashing of the
sexual drives and the minimizing or elimination of the death drive. He
even raises the stakes, contending that [unless we manage to realize
this ideal, **the human species**, under the sway of the death drive,
**will** **die out like the dinosaurs**]{.underline}. Despite making
more allowances for the death drive (and for death itself) than Marcuse,
Brown nonetheless cannot avoid a similar error: the belief that the
death drive is a force that subjects can overcome. For Freud, in
contrast, it is the force that revenges itself on every overcoming, the
repetition that no utopia can fully leave behind. [An authentic
recognition of the death drive and its primacy would demand that we
rethink the idea of progress altogether.]{.underline}

### Impact -- Fascism

#### Their mode of isolating enjoyment through fantasy scenarios is a tool out of the Fascist pocket -- it's an explicit attempt to eliminate the Other which destroys our relation to it

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 117-119, 1 July 2013, MG)

[How we comport ourselves in relation to the other's enjoyment indicates
our relationship to our **own**. What bothers us about the other --- the
disturbance that the other's enjoyment creates in our existence --- is
our **own mode of enjoying**. If we did not derive enjoyment from the
other's enjoyment, witnessing it would not bother us
psychically]{.underline}. We would simply be indifferent to it and
focused on our own concerns. Of course, we might ask an offending car
radio listener to turn the radio down so that we wouldn't have to hear
the unwanted music, but we would not experience the mere exhibition of
alien enjoyment through the playing of that music as an affront. [The
very fact that the other's enjoyment captures our attention demonstrates
our intimate --- or extimate --- **relation to it.**30]{.underline}

[This relation becomes even clearer when we consider the epistemological
status of the enjoying other. Because the real or enjoying other is
irreducible to any observable identity, we have no way of knowing
whether or not the other **really is enjoying**]{.underline}. A stream
of profanity may be the result of someone hurting a toe. The person
playing the car radio too loud while sitting at the traffic light may
have simply forgotten to turn down the radio aft er driving on the
highway. Or the person may have difficulty hearing. The couple's amorous
behavior in public may reflect an absence of enjoyment in their
relationship that they are trying to hide from both themselves and the
public.

[Considering the enjoyment of the other, we **never know whether it is
there or not**. If we experience it, we do so through the **lens of our
own fantasy**]{.underline}. We fantasize that the person blasting the
radio is caught up in the enjoyment of the music to the exclusion of
everything else; we fantasize that the public kisses of the couple
suggest an enjoyment that has no concern for the outside world. [Without
the fantasy frame, the enjoying other would never appear within our
experience.]{.underline}

[The role of the fantasy frame for accessing the enjoying other becomes
apparent **within Fascist ideology**. Fascism posits an internal enemy
--- the figure of the Jew or some analogue --- that enjoys **illicitly
at the expense of the social body as a whole**. By attempting to
**eliminate the enjoying other**, Fascism hopes to create a pure social
body bereft of any stain of enjoyment. This purity would allow for the
ultimate enjoyment, but it would be completely licit]{.underline}. This
hope for a future society free of any stain is not where Fascism's true
enjoyment lies, however. Fascists experience their own enjoyment through
the enjoying other that they persecute. The enjoyment that the figure of
the Jew embodies is the Fascists' own enjoyment, though they cannot avow
it as their own. More than any other social form, [Fascism is founded on
the **disavowal of enjoyment** --- the attempt to enjoy while keeping
enjoyment at arm's length.31 But this effort is not confined to Fascism;
it predominates everywhere, because no subjects anywhere can simply feel
comfortable with their own mode of enjoying.]{.underline}

[The very structure of enjoyment is such that we **cannot experience it
directly**: when we experience enjoyment, we don't have it; it has us.
We experience our own enjoyment as an **assault coming from the
outside** that dominates our conscious intentions. This is why we must
fantasize our own enjoyment through the enjoying other]{.underline}.
Compelled by our enjoyment, we can't do otherwise; we act against our
self-interest and against our own good. Enjoyment overwhelms the
subject, even though the subject's mode of enjoying marks what is most
singular about the subject.

[Even though the encounter with the enjoying other apprehends the real
other through the **apparatus of fantasy**, this encounter is
nonetheless genuine and has an ethical status. Unlike the experience of
the nonexistent symbolic identity, which closes down the space in which
the real other might appear, the fantasized encounter with the enjoying
other leaves this space open. By allowing itself to be disturbed by the
other on the level of fantasy, the subject **acknowledges the
singularity of the real other** --- its mode of enjoying --- without
confining this singularity to a prescribed identity]{.underline}

[The implications of privileging the encounter with the disturbing
enjoyment of the real other over the assimilable symbolic identity are
themselves **disturbing**. The tolerant attitude that never allows
itself to be jarred by the enjoying other becomes, according to this way
of **seeing things**, further from really encountering the real other
than the attitude of hate and mistrust. The liberal subject who welcomes
illegal immigrants as fellow citizens completely **shuts down the space
for the other in the real**]{.underline}. The immigrant as fellow
citizen is not the real other. The xenophobic conservative, on the other
hand, [**constructs a fantasy** that envisions the illegal immigrant
awash in a linguistic and cultural enjoyment that excludes
natives]{.underline}. This fantasy, paradoxically, permits an encounter
with the real other that liberal tolerance forecloses. Of course,
[xenophobes retreat from this encounter and from their own enjoyment,
but they do have an experience of it that liberals do not]{.underline}.
The tolerant liberal [is open to the other but **eliminates the
otherness**]{.underline}, while the xenophobic conservative is closed to
the other but allows for the otherness. [The ethical position thus
involves sustaining the liberal's tolerance within the conservative's
encounter with the real other.]{.underline}

### Framework\-\--2NC

#### Rigid plan focus skirts analyzing the constitutive failure of modern politics\-\--any other standard causes serial policy failure.

**Fotaki 10 (**Marianna, Organization Studies Group @ Manchester
Business School, *Why do public policies fail so often? Exploring health
policy-making as an imaginary and symbolic construction*, Organization
2010 17: 703, Sage, 713-716)

Therein also lies the paradox of public policy-making: the significance
of choice's imaginary foundations. The origins of the 'choice for all'
fantasy, and every other fantasy, are to be found in the need of the
subject to be 'recognized' in the symbolic Other in order to exist. Let
us not forget that [[the motivation]{.mark} and impetus [for the
Lacanian subject is always the desire to retrieve the illusory unity
that has been sacrificed upon entry into the symbolic order]{.mark} via
language]{.underline}. Language operates by signifying the object in its
absence and this is why desire always contains loss within it. Without
this loss of the sense of a unified identity and the fantasy it gives
rise to, there would be no signification and no symbolic life. In other
words, social reality is structured by our imaginary misperceptions, as
well as our unsymbolizable unconscious longings, which have been given
up (repressed) into the unconscious in the socialization process. Such
is, [for example, [the fantasy of effective policy]{.mark}, of
purposeful organization [and]{.mark} of [harmonious
society]{.mark}---[all stem]{.mark}ming [from an impossible desire for
unity.]{.mark} The Lacanian perspective unveils the imaginary nature of
such strivings which underpins various social and political
projects,]{.underline} including idealistic and idealized public
policies and dismisses them as vain attempts to counteract our
ontological and temporal finitude as human beings. It also reveals why
these unacknowledged imaginary and symbolic functions are indispensable
for bringing policies to life, even if they cannot be achieved. Such is
the example of pursuing *'Choice for All'* (see Milburn, 2003; Reid,
2003) in a public health system with finite resources and tangible
opportunity costs. It offers a stark testimony of the impossibility of
realizing the policy objectives it proclaims, despite or perhaps because
of its universalistic (and omnipotent) aspirations. Satisfac- tion of
all individual wants will not be possible without limiting someone
else's access to resources and therefore options. This contravenes the
founding collectivist principles of the NHS of offering equal access to
all according to need. The attempt to attain the fantasy of the
impossible can also explain policy recycling and repetition of the same
ideas, despite many documented failures.However, [[the desire to attain
the lost part of the self]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is the Lacanian
*objet petit á,* and which in the case of (freedom of) patient choice
stands in for freedom from the bounds of the human predicament,
[[instigates the articulation of]{.underline}]{.mark} such and other
[[improbable policies, only if]{.mark} and when [the opportune moment
arrives. Political expediency]{.mark}, a shift in dominant societal
discourses and other massive social changes [can]{.mark} all [prompt
such a move.]{.mark}]{.underline} Once policy makers are implicitly
entrusted with formulating aspirational rather than realizable policies,
their unworkable aspects are then further reinforced by psychological
processes such as organizational defences in health set- tings. These
involve separating off and denying unwanted reality (Heginbotham, 1999;
Obholzer and Zagier-Roberts, 1994; Vince and Broussine, 1996).The
illusory nature of many public health policies is evidenced whenever
they are being for- mulated in denial of their contextual reality. An
idealistic policy such as *Choice for All* must not be tested against
reality and must therefore remain exterior to the organizations that
will imple- ment it. Socially sanctioned defensive reactions such as
splitting between the idealized policy and its imperfect implementation,
and the projection of blame onto various organizational members, are
hence employed to protect against discarding this illusion. Object
relations theorists came up with various elaborate theories on how
social institutions enact psychodynamic mechanisms to defend individuals
and groups from existential anxieties (see De Board, 1978; Obholzer,
1994).^6^ I have also suggested, that health policy must be idealistic
to fulfil the impossible goal of the health care system, namely to
defend us against the anxiety about disease and dying, a defence it can
never fully accomplish (Fotaki, 2006). Although such defences might be
necessary to keep destructive fears of annihilation at bay, at the same
time they act as a dysfunctional barrier against attaining awareness of
our own constructs and ultimately against our attempts to acknowledge
fantasy and to survive its failure. To sum up, Kleinian analysis
suggests how splits between policy design and organizational real- ity
operate to 'protect' us from coming to terms with unrealistic policies,
but the Lacanian concep- tion of subjectivity explains why policies are
designed in such way and why the splits are there in the first place. In
a Lacanian perspective, while the policy tool can be seen to act as a
defence against societal anxieties, these anxieties are not simply
generated by the health risks themselves, but are sites in which the
already existing (subjective) anxiety is expressed collectively. Put
differ- ently, we are all anxious anyway as, for Lacan, anxiety is the
fear 'of the lack of lack' and this is why these symbolic manifestations
of extant general anxiety float from one public issue to another, as was
helpfully put by one reviewer.^7^This leads me now to the central claim
I make in this article, namely, that [[the imaginary construction of
policy-making, if unacknowledged, leads to multiple splits and]{.mark}
ultimately [underscores its failure]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}**
The example of patient choice is so evidently suffused with unrealizable
promises, as is chosen to highlight the undesirable effects of
unrecognized fantasies in the policy-making process and the difficulty
of translating value driven statements into organizational realities.
[[The use of abstract economic models simplifying human decisions and
devoiding them of real life messiness]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the
Labour government's belated enchantment with the market and competition
(Le Grand, 2006; Le Grand and Dixon, 2006) to solve the insoluble
efficiency/equity dilemma, [[ensures]{.mark} that [policy]{.mark}
formulation [is distanced from organizational
reality.]{.mark}]{.underline} When such realization of an intrinsic
conflict between fantasy and reality and the potential for failure is
absent from policy making, defensive mechanisms (projection and
splitting) cascade down into health care organizations. These are
necessary in order to maintain the splits between a good policy and the
flawed imple- mentation should the policy fail, as it must, and for
apportioning the blame towards those who must be held responsible for
policy failure. Politicians blame health professionals for not meeting
their impossible ideals, insisting that more managers are required in
order to police their choices. Vari- ous groups of health professionals
are pitted against each other (doctors versus managers or doc- tors
versus nurses for example) as they are simultaneously idealized and
denigrated, offering protection against the inevitability of failure of
the unworkable policies while better policies are awaited in the future.
Clearly, the process of articulating impossible policies and the
difficulties involved in implementing them are all underscored by the
idealization and defences around work- ing in health care, as the
seminal work of Menzies (1960) has illustrated.The alleged beneficiaries
of policies are subject to idealization too: patient choice is after all
introduced in the name of empowering the deserving users of services
against the dominance of all-powerful professionals who do not always
have their patents' best interest in mind.^8^ Yet those who do not
accept responsibilities for their health related choices are exempted
from the category of deserving users as they are stigmatized and refused
treatment (see the example of obese patients and smokers turned down by
some health authorities in England---BBC, 2005). Inherent in New
Labour's project of modernization is the assumption that the modern
citizen should be both mana- gerial and entrepreneurial (Scourfield,
2007). The price of greater autonomy and involvement is that users must
assume active responsibility for these activities, both for carrying
them out and for their outcomes. This new form of 'responsibilization'
corresponds to the new ways in which the governed are encouraged to act
freely and rationally while conducting themselves in accor- dance with
the appropriate (or approved) model of action (Burchell, 1993: 276,
cited in Scourfield, 2007). Their subordinated citizenship then becomes
doubly underlined by their 'choice' to have services arranged for them,
while they are required to acquire the flexibility of 'the person'
(Scourf- ield, 2007). Choice and independence are powerful concepts but
dependency and interdependency are part of all our lives, for some of us
more than others. It is clear that such policies invariably ignore the
reality of non-uniform patients, who are themselves fragmented and
divided subjects; more so in times of dislocation and stress Scourfield
(2007) reminds us.But the [[Lacanian analysis of policy
making]{.underline}]{.mark} does not simply suggest that the
glorification of choice would not have been possible in the absence of
an underlying fantasy. It [[gives us conceptual tools to explore how the
inherent idealization involved in articulating aspirational policy
objectives]{.underline}]{.mark} such as *Choice for All,* for example,
[[might enable policy capture by powerful political groups]{.mark} and/
or organized interests [for their own ideological]{.mark} and political
[ends.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is because various (conscious and less
conscious) [forms of [political exploitation are more likely]{.mark} to
occur [when policy content coheres with the imaginary longings of the
psyche.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The role of the judge is to be an analyst \-\-- we have the only coherent justification for why our argument requires a public space

[If psychoanalysis emerges out of the suffering that integration into
the social order causes, it also reveals how [the subject\'s
satisfaction depends on the public world that appears to thwart]{.mark}
this [satisfaction]{.mark}.]{.underline} This idea, as much as any
other, forms the basis for psychoanalytic practice. Unlike philosophers
like Descartes or Kant, [Freud doesn\'t believe that one can arrive at
the truth of one\'s being through private
introspection]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[[It is only when one is]{.mark}
in public and [talking to others that one reveals this truth. This is
why others know us better than we know ourselves]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
As Freud points out in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, \"It can in
fact be said quite generally that **[[everyone is continually practising
psychical]{.mark} [analysis on his neighbours and consequently learns to
know them better than they know themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\"16
[[No amount of introspection can replace public interaction]{.mark} for
the revelation of truth.]{.underline}

[Psychoanalysis eschews the possibility of self-analysis for precisely
this reason]{.underline}. Even though Freud claims to have performed a
self-analysis and even published the results, he doesn\'t develop this
as a general practice or possibility. In fact, Jacques Lacan often calls
Freud\'s self-analysis the \"original sin\" of psychoanalysis.
[**[Self-analysis is impossible]{.mark} [because it remains
within]{.mark} the domain of privacy[, a domain predominated by
narcissistic illusion and imaginary ideals]{.mark}**. In our private
worlds, we count the value of our conscious intentions far too highly,
and [we]{.mark} simultaneously [fail to grasp our unconscious
motivations]{.mark}. We pay attention to our conscious intentions rather
than to the signifiers that we employ unconsciously. [To psychoanalyze
oneself is to fall]{.mark} further [into one\'s **private
self-deception**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Psychoanalysis requires the
analyst to act as the point of connection to the public world.]{.mark}
This association of psychoanalysis with the public world places it at
odds with the demands of capitalism]{.underline}.

[**The psychoanalytic session**---and this distinguishes it, more than
anything else]{.underline}, from other forms of therapy---**[occurs in a
public space]{.underline}**. Even though psychoanalysts don\'t typically
go on television and give public accounts of their analysands private
lives, [**[the act of analysis itself is public in the sense that it
publicizes what the analysand would prefer to have remain
private]{.mark}**. In the act of analysis, the analysand confronts a
public and articulates its desire through this confrontation. [The
analyst stands in for the desire of the public, and the subject
discovers its desire through the encounter with this desire of the
Other]{.mark}]{.underline}.17 [By assisting the subject in discovering
and naming its own desire, psychoanalysis hopes to lead the subject from
desire to driv]{.underline}e. As theorist Alenka Zupancic sees it,
[analysis leads the subject from desire to drive by leading the subject
further down the path of its desire.]{.underline} She notes, \"[In order
to arrive at the drive, one must pass through desire and insist on it
until the very end]{.underline}.\"18 Subjects come to psychoanalysis
without knowing the truth of their desire, and they
leave---hopefully---with a commitment of fidelity to their desire that
places them in the drive, which involves a different sort of relation to
the object.

#### The aff's attempt to disavow suffering through presenting it backfires \-\-- the modern demand for utility falls prey to the subject's constitutive lack and compulsive repetition in pursuit of enjoyment 

**McGowan 13** \[Todd, Associate Professor of Film and Television
Studies at the University of Vermont, *Enjoying What We Don't Have: The
Political Project of Psychoanalysis*, Symploke, University of Nebraska
Press (Lincoln, NE): 2013, p. 146-51\]

Such rituals appear explicitly in premodern societies, which
consistently make public sacrifices of animals (or people) to please
their gods. [While sacrifices have the expressed intent of
gaining]{.underline} [good favor or warding off bad, their unconscious
function consists solely in enacting the sacrifice]{.underline} [itself.
Any pleasure that follows from the sacrifice]{.underline} --- [such as
abundant rainfall that produces]{.underline} good crops --- [is strictly
secondary to the enjoyment of the sacrifice itself. Societies sacrifice
for the sake of sacrifice, not for the end that it
produces.]{.underline} This [sacrifice]{.underline} for the sake of
sacrifice doesn\'t end with the onset of modernity but instead
[continues primarily in a disguised form]{.underline}. [What defines
modernity isn\'t so much a degree of enlightenment and rationality as a
fundamental refusal to avow the primacy of sacrifice]{.underline}.

Modernity replaces a regime centered around sacrifice and squander with
one centered around utility and accumulation. [**[Modern consciousness
directs itself toward the useful]{.underline}**: [one
justifies]{.underline}]{.mark} [technological [advances]{.mark}, medical
breakthroughs, [and]{.mark} economic [progress through their
**utility**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 1 1 Modern societies act with the
conscious intention of making the world run smoother and with the utmost
efficiency. And yet, [[at the same time, **wasteful behavior
endures**]{.underline}]{.mark} [--- most conspicuously in the form of
religion]{.underline}, which modernity\'s philosophy of utility has not
succeeded in extirpating.

Even though [modern religious observations]{.underline} tend for the
most part to avoid animal or human sacrifices, they [do nonetheless
represent one of the predominant arenas in which social sacrifice
occurs.]{.underline} Thought of in terms of the self-interest of
participants or the larger social good, religion constitutes a massive
sacrifice of time and resources. This is what renders it problematic for
evolutionary biology. According to the tenets of this science, natural
selection tends to eliminate waste rather than foster it. The
wastefulness of religion, combined with its continued wide appeal,
forces evolutionary biologists to explain its existence and persistence
as the by-product of another process that has evolutionary benefits
(which is, according to most prominent evolutionary biologists, the
tendency to trust authority figures). But what the evolutionary
biologist cannot see, because this science does not take enjoyment into
account, is the appeal of the sacrifice of resources for its own sake.
[Religious rituals persist in modernity ---even if in a completely
modified form, like the worship of a sports team]{.underline} ---
[because they provide an opportunity for the repetition of the original
shared social sacrifice.]{.underline}

[Not only do religious observations allow subjects to repeat the
original social sacrifice, but they also mask this sacrifice as the
source of enjoyment]{.underline}. Religions tell their adherents that
they must sacrifice freedom in their lifestyle choices, money that might
be spent for pleasure, and time otherwise left for leisure. The reward
for these sacrifices --- most typically, an eternal life of pure
enjoyment, or at least membership in a privileged community --- serves
to justify them. As a result, the sacrificing adherents of the religion
can believe that they are sacrificing for the sake of the future reward
rather than for the sake of the sacrifice itself. When we practice
religious sacrifice, we don\'t see where our true enjoyment lies - we
don\'t recognize the link between loss and enjoyment -and this deception
is crucial for religion\'s attractiveness. We cling to our enjoyment,
but we also cling to the illusion that it is something that we might
have rather than a loss that we must endure.

Like religion, [[war continues]{.mark} in modernity, [even
though]{.mark} we understand and [declaim its]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[wastefulness]{.mark}. The typical modern subject can watch an antiwar
film like]{.underline} Stanley Kubrick\'s [Paths of Glory]{.underline} (
1961) [and feel convinced that war is hell and completely
unnecessary]{.underline}. **[[After leaving the
theater]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[this same subject
can]{.mark} come to [believe that there is]{.mark} [no alternative but
to send troops]{.mark}]{.underline}** to Vietnam to stop the potential
spread of Communist aggression.

[[War appeals]{.mark} to even modern subjects [because it **mobilizes
our enjoyment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Wars are]{.underline}]{.mark}
not [[fought]{.underline}]{.mark} only for the sake of expanding or
defending reigns of power but also [in order [to enact a social]{.mark}
[sacrifice]{.mark}. [By fighting a war, a social order sacrifices its
soldiers]{.mark}, [and this sacrifice constitutes]{.mark} a great part
of [war\'s appeal]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Supporting the troops]{.mark}
necessarily [implies supporting]{.mark} and celebrating [their
sacrifice]{.mark},]{.underline} [[which is why antiwar movements that
proclaim]{.mark} \"Support the troops, [bring them home]{.mark}\" [fail
to arouse the masses to action]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[By bringing
the]{.mark} [troops home]{.mark}, [one eliminates the possibility of
their sacrifice]{.mark}, [which is the source of the society\'s
libidinal investment in them]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Bringing the troops
home renders it impossible to continue to enjoy
them.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The problem with [[**an antiwar** film]{.underline}]{.mark} like Paths
of Glory [**[that depicts senseless sacrifice]{.mark} is that this
sacrifice [adds to rather than subtracts from war\'s
appeal]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is why, as Sheila Kunkle has pointed
out, **[[every war film is a prowar film]{.underline}]{.mark}**.13
**[[No matter how negative]{.mark}ly a film depicts a war, the [carnage
inevitably links to war\'s hidden]{.mark} appeal]{.underline}**. Of
course, by showing war\'s utter meaninglessness, Kubrick\'s film impairs
to some extent our ability to enjoy the sacrifice, but he doesn\'t
eliminate it altogether.

[A film]{.underline} like Saving Private Ryan (Steven Spielberg, 1998),
on the other hand, [shows the suffering]{.underline} [of war leading to
a meaningful end, which is why it is even more directly a prowar
film]{.underline}. Saving Private Ryan allows us to enjoy the sacrifice
of the soldiers in World War II and to dissociate enjoyment from
sacrifice. [We watch the film believing that we accept the sacrifice for
the sake of the pleasure we experience in the end]{.underline} (with the
rescue of private Ryan or with the victory of the Allies) rather than
for its own sake. [[We need a reason to sacrifice]{.mark} not because we
otherwise aren\'t willing to sacrifice but [because a reason allows us
to disavow the traumatic nature of our own
enjoyment]{.mark}.]{.underline} We can tell ourselves that we are
sacrificing not for the sake of our enjoyment but for the sake of what
we gain from that sacrifice. In this way, **[[reasons for our sacrifices
have the effect of accommodating sacrifice to the modern demand for
utility]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### FW -- Analyst

#### The role of the judge is to be an analyst -- their intep locks them into self-analysis which is narcissistic and fails, but having the judge act as the public evaluating the desires of the plan solves

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 77-80, 20 September 2016, MG)

[If psychoanalysis emerges out of the suffering that integration into
the social order causes, it also reveals how the subject's satisfaction
depends on the **public world** that appears to thwart this
satisfaction]{.underline}. This idea, as much as any other, forms the
basis for psychoanalytic practice. Unlike philosophers like Descartes or
Kant, Freud doesn't believe that one can arrive at the truth of one's
being through private introspection. [It is only when one is in public
and talking to others that one reveals this truth. This is why others
know us better than we know ourselves, even when we try to maintain a
hidden inwardness that we reveal to no one. In order to interact with
others, we must constantly pay attention not to what they say
**explicitly** but to the **desire that their words express in the act
of concealing**.20 We constantly read the unconscious truth of those
with whom we interact]{.underline}. No amount of introspection can
replace public interaction for the revelation of truth.

[Psychoanalysis eschews the possibility of self-analysis for precisely
this reason]{.underline}. Although Freud claims to have performed a
self-analysis, and even published the results, he doesn't develop this
as a general practice or possibility. In fact, Jacques Lacan calls
Freud's self-analysis the "original sin" of psychoanalysis.
[Selfanalysis is impossible because it remains within the domain of
privacy, a domain predominated by narcissistic illusion and imaginary
ideals. Private analysis or self-reflection always obeys the
**restrictions of consciousness** and never allows the disturbance of
the unconscious to manifest itself.]{.underline} We might go so far as
to seek our unconscious introspectively, but it will always remain one
step ahead of our conscious self-reflection. A disturbance that we seek
is never a disturbance. [In public interactions, however, one often does
encounter the unconscious. It erupts all the time and forces us to
engage in a constant quasi psychoanalysis of each other just to navigate
our daily life]{.underline}.

When we practice self-reflection, we pay attention to our conscious
intentions rather than to the signifiers that we employ unconsciously.
[To psychoanalyze oneself is to fall further into one's private
self-deception. Psychoanalysis requires the analyst to act as the point
of connection to the public world.]{.underline} The lack of a
face-to-face encounter in the psychoanalytic session is simultaneously
an abandonment of private intimacy. The patient speaks to a public and
not a private desire. This association of psychoanalysis with the public
world places it at odds with the demands of capitalism.

[The psychoanalytic session---and this distinguishes it, more than
anything else, from other forms of therapy---occurs in a public
space]{.underline}. Even though psychoanalysts don't typically go on
television and give public accounts of their patients' private lives,
[the act of analysis itself is public in the sense that it **publicizes
what the patient would prefer to have remain private**. In the act of
analysis, the patient confronts a public and **articulates its desire
through this confrontation.** The analyst stands in for the desire of
the public, and the subject discovers its desire through the encounter
with this desire of the Other. 21]{.underline} By assisting the subject
in discovering and naming its own desire, psychoanalysis hopes to lead
the subject to a changed relation with its object.
[Subjects]{.underline} come to psychoanalysis without knowing the truth
of their desire, and they [leave]{.underline}, hopefully, [recognizing
that the satisfaction of desiring **derives from the obstacle** **rather
than from overcoming it.**]{.underline}

This is the recognition that the logic of capitalism spares the subject.
The capitalist subject views the trauma of the public encounter as a
temporary barrier on the path to an immersion in the complete
satisfaction of privacy. The capitalist subject enters the public
world---by, say, driving on public roads---in order to arrive at a
shopping mall where it can purchase a potentially satisfying object of
desire and then return to enjoy that object in private. Satisfaction,
for the capitalist subject, resides in the private realm because this is
a realm where one can have the object without the barrier that exists in
public.

Psychoanalysis provides a different relationship to the object. The
capitalist subject imagines itself dissatisfied because it imagines
itself constantly overcoming obstacles to arrive at the object, but in
fact the obstacles are the object. [If the subject can recognize its
satisfaction in its obstacle, then the public world undergoes a
**dramatic transformation**. Rather than seeking an object in this world
and retreating with the object into one's private oasis, one must
embrace the public world as the site of the obstacle]{.underline}.
Without the public qua obstacle, the subject would lose its ability to
satisfy itself, which is why capitalism's hostility to the public world
itself is not sincere. But the subject has the ability to recognize the
public obstacle to the realization of its desire as the source of its
satisfaction.22

[The changed attitude toward the obstacle permits the subject to find
**satisfaction** where it formerly saw only **dissatisfaction**. The
barrier to the satisfaction that capitalism posits transforms into the
source of the satisfaction for the subject.]{.underline} Satisfaction in
the obstacle replaces an unending and dissatisfying pursuit. [The
subject overcomes the constitutive dissatisfaction that capitalism
requires by transforming the relation to the obstacle]{.underline}. The
subject that finds satisfaction in the obstacle doesn't fit well into
the role of the capitalist producer or consumer.

### FW -- Fiat Bad

#### The affirmative's investment in fantasy scenarios is a ruse for the system to gain a psychic foothold and create trauma

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 58-60, 20 September 2016, MG)

[Since the desire of the Other can provide no concrete guidance for the
subject in its search for what to desire, it must have **recourse to
fantasy**. Here capitalism again comes to the subject's aid by providing
innumerable fantasies that direct the subject's desire both toward the
proper work and toward the proper commodity]{.underline}. Fantasy
provides the subject guidance about what the Other desires and thus
constitutes this desire as knowable. Without this guidance, there would
be no way of approaching this desire or beginning to make sense of it.
In some sense, the subject fantasizes this desire into existence: [the
fantasy gives coherence to the Other's desire by creating an **imaginary
scenario surrounding the Other**]{.underline}. Lacan offers an enigmatic
definition of fantasy in his seminar on The Logic of Fantasy. He says,
["**in the final accounting the fantasy is a** **sentence with a
grammatical structure."26**]{.underline} That is to say, fantasy gives
the desire of the Other a concrete form that it otherwise lacks. [Even
if fantasy imagines a traumatic desire---the Other wants to destroy us
---it nonetheless **provides the security** of an existing Other that
can guide our desire.]{.underline}

[We can see this dynamic in the way that the fantasy of the terrorist
functions for American society. Of course, there are actual terrorists
who want to kill Americans, but the power of the terrorist fantasy far
outstrips the danger that these actual terrorists
represent]{.underline}. Very few people fear driving in a car, and yet
one is exponentially more likely to die in this mode of transportation
than from a terrorist blowing up an airplane. The latter event occasions
dread because it touches on our fantasy space, whereas death in a
car---except as envisioned in David Cronenberg's Crash (1996), an
exploration of auto-eroticism---remains largely fantasy-free. The
fantasy of horrible death from terrorism is hardly a comforting one, but
it does give American society a concrete image of the Islamic believer.
The fantasy brings this believer into existence and renders his---almost
always his in the fantasy---desire knowable. The threat to American
society constitutes American identity as besieged and, at the same time,
envied, which is why, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
George W. Bush proclaimed that American freedom itself was an overriding
motive for the attacks. **[Even the most traumatic fantasy offers
assurance.]{.underline}**

The subject's subjection to the social order becomes complete through
the acceptance of the fundamental fantasy underlying that order.
Confronted with the impossibility of the Other's desire, the subject
faces its failure to belong. [The respite of fantasy is an image of
belonging to an order that seems to bar the subject's entry. It is the
password to a secret society. Even]{.underline} the subject who doesn't
belong to Skull and Bones at Yale effectively does belong to a larger
version insofar as it accepts the society's fundamental fantasy. 27 But
the subject can never exist wholly in the world that fantasy constructs.
[The status of the fantasy must always be **tenuous** in order for it to
work as a source of social cohesion]{.underline}. Capitalism utilizes
fantasy to a remarkable extent, but it also sustains fantasy's
tenuousness.

Under capitalism, [the desire of the Other both remains fundamentally
unknowable and appears accessible through fantasy]{.underline}. The
subject never knows exactly what commodity to produce or consume, and
yet the commodity itself provides a fantasmatic answer to this mystery.
The commodity presents itself at once as the unknown desire of the Other
and the fantasized solution to that desire. The fact that it maintains
these two contradictory positions gives capitalism great power in the
psyche[. It **rouses** us by showing the Other as mysterious while
comforting us with the idea that we might solve this purported enigma of
the Other. If capitalism just offered the mystery of the Other or the
fantasized solution of this mystery, it would fail to gain a **psychic
foothold**. The two positions must constantly play off each other, or
else the subject's disappointment---either in the irresolvable mystery
or the ultimately inadequate solution---will break the commitment to the
capitalist system]{.underline}. The fantasy constantly presents the
possibility of full belonging to the subject, but, at the same time, the
fantasy must remain an unrealized fantasy. The capitalist subject can
never experience a sense of belonging while remaining a capitalist
subject.

Of all previously existing economic systems, capitalism offers the most
evident fantasmatic solution to the problem of the desire of the Other.
That is to say, it offers the clearest path to social acceptance and
belonging. When we imagine societies with clear marriage rules or
entrance rituals, this claim seems clearly wrong. Their solution to the
problem of desire appears superior to that of capitalism.28 Traditional
societies don't have the desire of the Other hidden in fashion trends or
the production of electronics, but clearly spell it out in social
regulations. But [the psychic power of the commodity outstrips the most
**rigid societal structure** in its capacity for illuminating the
subject's path. The commodity form has the effect of **clarifying the
desire of the Other** by making it manifest in a concrete object. If I
doubt what the Other wants me to do, I need only follow the money. It
will provide a clear fantasized solution to the desire of the Other.
Traditional society, in contrast, offers regulations whose explicit
status prevents a complete psychic investment]{.underline}. Capitalism
forces the subject to interpret its way into the social order and in
this way attaches itself firmly to the subject's desire. At the same
time, it guides this interpretation through the commodity form and gives
the subject a sense of security in the path of its desire.

When I feel as if I must have a new product, at that moment I fully
immerse myself in the fantasy of what the Other desires. Often new
products fail---many times more products enter the market each year than
find a niche---because they do not manage to locate themselves within
consumers' fantasy space. The inventors of failed commodities such as
Pepsi Clear did not adequately carve out an appealing fantasmatic
position. The success of any product is inextricable from its capacity
to lodge itself within this space and to appear as if it completely
solves the question of the Other's desire. Even products that endure,
like Coke or Apple electronics, must constantly renew themselves in
order to remain within the prevailing fantasy. Once they become old,
once they are associated with an object that the consumer has already
acquired and has discovered to be lacking, they will lose their
fantasmatic power. This is why even successful brands have to continue
to develop new selling points and to advertise this newness. Apple must
produce a new version of the iPhone or the iPad or else consumers will
abandon Apple entirely. The company will find itself in the situation of
Zenith, a former leader in technological appliances and now a nonentity.
[We know that the old object does not respond to the desire of the
Other, but the new object allows us to **keep this fantasy
alive**.]{.underline}

#### The attempt to fantasize over imaginary scenarios is a form of traumatizing that shocks subjectivities with the endurance of the lack

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 132-134, 1 July 2013, MG)

[Fantasy defines a subject's subjectivity by providing it with a
**private narrative** that explains the public loss of the privileged
object.]{.underline}29 This loss, as we have seen, gives birth to the
subject: the subject and the object don't exist prior to the experience
of loss but emerge through it. But [when fantasy places the loss of the
privileged object into a **narrative structure** --- when it tells a
story about how the loss occurred and what caused it --- fantasy creates
the illusion that the lost object had some **substantial status prior to
being lost**. It is in this precise sense that fantasy functions as the
primordial lie that the subject tells itself]{.underline}. Because
fantasy imagines the lost object as substantial, it also envisions the
possibility of recovering the lost object and recovering a lost
satisfaction. [Subjectivity is **unthinkable** without the fantasmatic
lie. This lie gives the subject a reason for its suffering and permits
the subject to **endure its lack with the possibility of the restoration
of fullness**. Even psychoanalytic treatment doesn't enable the subject
to overcome its inherent proclivity toward and reliance on]{.underline}
fantasy (though psychoanalysis does permit the subject to become
reoriented relative to its fantasy life). [Without some recourse to
fantasy, no subject could go on. Fantasy gives the subject a **direction
for its desire**, a center around which to organize its enjoyment, and
it always has an obscene quality to it.]{.underline}

[The obscenity of fantasmatic enjoyment stems from its manner of
shortcircuiting the symbolic pact that constitutes the social bond. In
our fantasies, we imagine ourselves **pulling one over on society at
large**, enjoying in a way that no one else does. If ideology reduces
all subjects to the same level, fantasy singles out the subject as the
exception to every rule]{.underline}. The fantasmatic core of our
subjectivity is the key to our uniqueness as subjects.30 Fantasy
produces enjoyment for the subject by bypassing the constraints that
govern all our activity. Thus, [when our fantasies become exposed,
everyone can see the extent to which **we are not a part of society**,
the extent to which we don't belong. And at the same time, everyone can
see the **purely imaginary status** of our rebellion: rather than
actually acting to break from the social bond, we have merely fantasized
doing so. The subject with an exposed fantasy becomes visible as a
pathetic would-be outsider. Realizing one's fantasy involves the
ultimate shame]{.underline}.

To examine this dynamic in concrete terms we can return to the mail
clerk who fantasizes about being an executive. One of the benefits of
this example is its counterintuitive status: becoming an executive ---
unlike, say, being caught masturbating in one's bathroom --- does not
appear to expose anything other than a garden-variety ambition shared by
almost everyone within capitalist society. The mystification here occurs
because we assume that executives, or at least some of them, are former
mail clerks who have realized their fantasies. But the fantasizing mail
clerk never actually becomes the successful executive.31

Th e fantasy of the successful executive lies elsewhere than in being a
successful executive. (Perhaps it involves being a lowly mail clerk.)
Those who attain success in the business world or in any other domain
are not those who fantasize about this success. [They may plan their
actions or envision goals being met, but these plans and visions are
not, properly speaking, the domain of fantasy. Fantasy depends for its
**erotic power on a degree of unreality**. It provides enjoyment for
subjects because it allows them to cheat reality, and the enjoyment
derives directly from this sense of cheating, of escaping the
restrictions that bind others.]{.underline}

[The sense of cheating a reality that others must obey forms the
essential core of fantasy as such. It is for this reason that subjects
hide their fantasies from public view. All fantasies share a formal
hiddenness, and this hiddenness proclaims the subject's own belief in
the fantasy's transgressive nature]{.underline}. It is not what the
fantasy hides that threatens to traumatize the subject but the very fact
of the hiding itself. [The **form** of fantasy is shameful, not the
**content**. No act is in itself shameful without hiddenness attached to
it,]{.underline} which is why one of the most effective ways to avoid
shame involves broadcasting one's potentially shameful acts --- talking
about one's interest in pornography, explaining one's tendency to sweat
too much, and so on.32 [Self-exposure militates against having the
fantasmatically charged act exposed by others and thereby revealed in
its hiddenness. Exposing this hiddenness means exposing the subject's
privileged and seemingly unique mode of obtaining
enjoyment.]{.underline}

If the mail clerk who fantasizes about becoming an executive actually
does realize this fantasy, the effect would be shattering for this
clerk's erotic life and for her or his life as an executive. The
erstwhile mail clerk would have no respite from this symbolic position
--- no hidden reservation where the "real me" could dwell. As a result,
the clerk-become-executive would have to transform the position of
executive itself, struggling against the very nature of this symbolic
position. [Realizing the fantasy **traumatizes both the subject itself**
(depriving it of its treasured secret) **and the social reality**
(depriving it of the underside it needs in order to function), and it
leads to the transformation of both]{.underline}. It is in this sense
that we should understand Freud's statement defining success as the
realization of one's fantasies. It is far removed from how we usually
define the word, and in fact, the subject who becomes what Freud sees as
a success cannot be successful in the bourgeois sense of the term.

### FW -- Consequentialism Bad

#### Analysis of the "terminal impact" and "final cause" crowd out the ability to address immanent dangers and forecloses the possibility for enjoyment

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 151-153, 1 July 2013, MG)

An Absence of Final Causes

[The widespread failure to see that sacrifice occurs for its own sake
stems from the ubiquity of thinking from the **perspective of the final
cause**. The final]{.underline} [cause]{.underline}, as first defined by
Aristotle, [is the "end or that for the sake of which a thing is
done."14 It causes the action in the sense that it provides a motivating
purpose or a result that the action will effectuate. When we analyze an
action in terms of its final cause, we look for
purposiveness]{.underline}. This type of analysis doesn't necessarily
lead to an inability to identify other forms of causality. For
Aristotle, of course, the final cause is but one aspect of an overall
theory of causality that includes a formal cause, a material cause, and
an effective cause.

One can, in short, sustain a pluralistic theory of causality in which
the idea of the final cause does not eliminate other forms of causality.
For instance, recognizing that the final cause for the American Civil
War was the establishment of a unified industrial America with a basis
in wage labor rather than slavery does not interfere with recognizing
the development of modern war-making strategy as the formal cause, the
military might of both sides as its material cause, and the decision to
fire on Fort Sumter as the effective cause. But the dominance of the
final cause over our thinking does obstruct our ability to grasp what we
might call the immanent cause, the cause that inheres in an action done
for its own sake rather than for a larger purpose.15

[The perspective of the final cause **dominates** our thinking in the
form of privileging the good that we might obtain. Whether we define the
good as **avoidance of harm, physical pleasure, mastery of others,
knowledge, survival**, self-interest, or material goods, we nonetheless
almost inevitably see it as the **final cause motivating our
actions**.16 No one would act, so this thinking goes, in a way that did
not aim at producing some good]{.underline}. Most contemporary subjects
would conceive of the good in relative terms --- Henry's good would not
be Alexandra's good, and they might even be opposed to each other ---
but they would accept the privileging of the good itself.

Th e most common reigning conception of the good is identifying it with
power. [This line of thought, inherited ultimately from Nietzsche and
popularized in the contemporary intellectual universe by Michel
Foucault, analyzes actions in terms of the power that they provide for
those who embark on them: the executive chases power in the form of
capital; the lover chases power in the form of new romantic conquests;
the minister chases power in the form of a psychically submissive
congregation; and the parent chases power in the form of a
high-achieving child]{.underline}. Though this seems like a radical
subversion of the traditional idea of the good as the end that motivates
us, [the analysis of actions in terms of power simply **replaces one
idea of the good with another**]{.underline}. Even those who morally
question power as an end nonetheless think of it as the good --- that
is, the final cause --- that motivates actions. Power analysis remains
teleological in its conception of causality, and thus it suffers from
precisely the same limitation as traditional thinking about the good.17

[When we think from the perspective of the final cause or the good at
which our actions aim, we miss the possibility that **actions might be
ends in themselves**. To think of the actions of society in terms of the
enjoyment that they provide is not to simply replace power or happiness
or physical pleasure with another end]{.underline}. Enjoyment is not a
result that actions pursue and allow us to obtain but instead inheres in
the action itself. [This is why, in contrast to power or any other good,
**no one can possess enjoyment**. Enjoyment is irreducible to a good
that one pursues because, rather than benefiting the society, it
**deprives the society of something**]{.underline}. Enjoyment is
expenditure without the possibility of recompense. While we might pursue
pleasure, we never pursue enjoyment, though it can function as the
immanent cause of our actions, as that which drives us rather than
motivating us as a conscious goal.

When Freud discovered the death drive in 1920, he effectively theorized
enjoyment as the immanent cause of our actions. But with the onset of
the psychoanalytic method more than twenty-five years earlier, Freud
began his break with the dominance of the final cause. The
psychoanalytic method of free association takes as its point of
departure an attempt to put the final cause, which governs our conscious
interactions, to the side. [When the analysand speaks, the analyst
focuses on the signifiers themselves and what they say rather than on
the meaning that the analysand intends to impart with these signifiers.
The premise of psychoanalysis is that the analysand puts signifiers into
play for their own sake and that these signifiers do in fact **signify
on their own**, beyond the conscious intentions of the analysand. The
conscious meaning behind them --- what analysands believe that they are
trying to communicate --- functions precisely like the final cause. It
is the translation into consciousness of an unconscious desire, and it
obscures this unconscious desire just like the **final cause obscures
the immanent cause**]{.underline}. Psychoanalytic treatment involves
assisting analysands to arrive at the point where they can avow the
immanent cause, where they can adopt a different relationship to their
own enjoyment.

### FW -- Thesis

#### The aff's approach to the world is constituted under a veil of ignorance -- for every step they take towards the good in their imaginative politics, they take a corresponding step towards the bad

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 3-6, 1 July 2013, MG)

On the face of it, this claim appears counterintuitive: one can imagine,
for instance, a psychoanalytic understanding of the nature of desire
aiding political theorists in their attempts to free desire from
ideology, which is the recurring difficulty of leftist politics. There
are even historical examples of this theoretical assistance at work.
Louis Althusser develops his theory of ideological interpellation
through his acquaintance with Jacques Lacan's conception of the
subject's entrance into language, and Juliet Mitchell elaborates her
critique of the structural effects of patriarchy through her experience
with Freudian conceptions of masculinity and femininity. In each case,
[psychoanalysis allows the theorist to understand how a prevailing
social structure operates, and this provides a foundation for
**imagining a way** to challenge this structure. As Mitchell claims,
"Psychoanalysis is not a recommendation for a patriarchal society, but
an **analysis** of one]{.underline}. If we are interested in
understanding and challenging the oppression of women, we cannot afford
to neglect it."4 Precisely because she sees psychoanalysis as a useful
tool for political struggle, Mitchell here dismisses feminism's
longstanding quarrel with psychoanalysis for its complicity with
patriarchy.5

Underlying a position like Mitchell's (which almost all political
theorists who turn to psychoanalysis embrace) is the idea that the
political usefulness of psychoanalysis stems, ironically, from its lack
of a political commitment. That is to say, [psychoanalysis aims to
discover the **unconscious truth of the subject** and the society in
which the subject exists, not to change this truth. It is thus at the
most basic level a descriptive rather than a prescriptive art. Even the
psychoanalytic cure itself does not portend radical change for the
subject who accomplishes it. This subject simply
recognizes]{.underline}, in Jacques Lacan's words, ["I am that." The
cure is more a recognition of who one is rather than a transformation of
one's subjectivity. Though psychoanalysis does view this recognition as
the **most radical kind of revolution**, the revolution changes how the
subject relates to its activity, not the activity itself]{.underline}.
In this sense, psychoanalysis has no political axe to grind, which
allows it to devote its energies to the project of interpretation and
understanding. The understanding it produces can then form the basis for
the different sorts of leftist political contestation that may
appropriate it.

The problem with this appropriation is the point at which it arrests the
descriptive process of psychoanalytic interpretation. [Psychoanalysis
does not merely describe the structure of one culture or socioeconomic
formation (such as patriarchy or capitalism); it instead insists on a
**fundamental validity** across cultural and socioeconomic boundaries.
It also insists on this validity across different historical epochs. It
is, in short, a **universal theory** concerning the relationship between
the individual subject and society]{.underline}.6 Of course, Freud
discovered psychoanalysis in a particular historical situation that
shaped how he presented his insights and even the ideas he could
formulate. But one can separate the particular elements (like the
Oedipus complex or the labeling of homosexuality as a perversion) from
the universal ones (like the antagonistic nature of society or the fact
of castration as the requirement for entrance into society). The
challenge for the psychoanalytic theorist is discovering the
universality in Freud's discoveries, but it is this universality that
presents an obstacle for any political project. [If the antagonism
between the subject and the social order is irreducible, then the
stumbling block is not just capitalism or patriarchy but human society
itself.]{.underline}

[The insights of psychoanalysis, if valid at all, apply not simply to
the past and the present but also to whatever **future society we might
envision** or even realize]{.underline}. Though Freud developed the
insights of psychoanalysis in a particular historical situation, this
situation enabled him to discover universal structures of subjectivity
and of the social order, even if his way of conceptualizing these
structures initially reflected the constraints of his historical
situation. The insights apply not only to contemporary patriarchal
society but also, pace Juliet Mitchell, to the future society that frees
itself from patriarchy. This is not to say that we will always have the
same forms of neurosis and psychosis that we have now but that we will
not surmount the fundamental antagonism between the social order and the
individual subject that produces these specific disorders. [As a result,
for psychoanalysis **the good society becomes an unattainable
fiction.**]{.underline}

[You're No Good]{.underline}

[The great challenge that psychoanalysis poses for emancipatory politics
--- and for politics as such --- is its absolute rejection of the good
or the good society]{.underline}. In the opening of the Politics,
Aristotle describes the good as the basic aim of political activity, and
this aim has remained constant in the intervening 2,500 years.7
Aristotle never attempts to prove this constitutive remark in his
treatise but simply takes it as an unassailable postulate of political
thinking. For subsequent political thinkers, the question does not
concern Aristotle's claim about the good but in what the good consists.
There is unanimity about the political pursuit of the good not just
among political theorists but among almost everyone who thinks about
politics at all.

[From the perspective of psychoanalysis, however, **there is no good at
all.** The good society is unattainable not just as a result of the
competing desires of the individuals within the society. The theory that
aligns social conflict with the coexistence of competing individual
desires fails to go far enough in envisioning the antagonistic nature of
the social order. No matter how divergent individual desires are, one
could always imagine reconciling them with each other through some sort
of compromise]{.underline}. A thinker such as John Rawls can imagine a
just society despite positing a society divided by innumerable competing
desires on the level of the individual. Justice here would consist in
the idea of fairness --- [using **one's imagination to envision
society** through]{.underline} what Rawls labels [a "veil of ignorance"
that allows one to make decisions about justice without taking into
account one's individual interests or desires or social
position.]{.underline}8 This would facilitate a good society in which
any inequality would be socially justified, and it would thus reconcile
competing individual desires with each other.

[But the barrier to the good society runs deeper than this. It derives
from the very idea of the good, which Freud sees as fundamentally at
odds with itself. The good itself, not our failures to achieve it, is
the problem. This is the fundamental political insight that
psychoanalysis brings to the table. It is at once the challenge that it
poses to emancipatory politics and the basis for its implicit project
for emancipation. As we get closer to the ideal of a good society, we
simultaneously approach the **emptiness concealed** within the ideal.
The notion of the good does not emerge simply from moral reasoning and
speculation about the proper arrangement of society]{.underline}. We
develop this notion only through the experience of its prohibition. That
is to say, the prohibition of the good doesn't form an obstacle to a
preexisting ideal but constitutes the ideal as such.

[The good has no existence outside of the barriers that we erect around
realizing it]{.underline}. As Jacques Lacan points out in one of his
most important political statements, "The step taken by Freud at the
level of the pleasure principle is to show us that [there is no
Sovereign Good --- that the Sovereign Good]{.underline}, which is das
Ding, which is the mother, is also the object of incest, is a forbidden
good, and that there is no other good. Such is the foundation of the
moral law as turned on its head by Freud."9 The foundational link
between the good and prohibition renders its pursuit completely
contradictory. [Every step toward the good occasions a **corresponding
step away from it**. The closer we come, the more we undermine the
social stability that we hoped to achieve. This occurs not just among
the many utopian socialist projects that have failed but across all
types of social structures.]{.underline}

[For psychoanalysis, the good is not just an unrealizable ideal but a
deception **incapable of orienting a coherent and sustainable
politics**. This critique threatens to undermine the **very idea of a
political project** because political theorists write in order to help
bring about change, which means moving society in the direction of the
good (even if they admit that the ideal itself is not
realizable).]{.underline} Conservative theorists seem immune to this
critique, but they envision a return to the good or the creation of a
social stability that they associate implicitly with the good.10
Political theorists of all stripes write to change the world and assist
its progression (or its return to a better state), whereas
psychoanalysis interprets the world and uncovers the repetition at work
where it seems to be progressing.

#### Only psychoanalysis can explain the relationship between the social order and subjectivity

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 143-146, 1 July 2013, MG)

[It is impossible to divorce the **question of** **subjectivity** from
the question of the **structure of the social order**. How one
understands the relationship between the individual subject and society
definitively marks one's theoretical position. This is true for
psychoanalytic thought no less than for other theories. The
understanding of this relationship almost inevitably exists as a
theoretical presupposition or as a **starting point for whatever theory
one espouses**. The two predominant positions on the interaction between
individual and society see the isolated individual as the starting point
on the one hand or the social organization as the starting point on
the]{.underline} [other]{.underline}. In modernity, the former derives
from the tradition of British liberal philosophy, and the latter derives
from the tradition of German dialectical thought.

For a liberal thinker such as John Locke, society doesn't form the
individual; individuals come together to form society. In the tradition
of thinkers from Thomas Hobbes to John Stuart Mill to Ayn Rand, Locke
conceives the individual existing outside society as a clear and
distinct being. According to Locke, one can analyze the situation of the
individual removed from the fabric of societal construction. In this
natural state, the subject is free. As he puts it, "The Natural Liberty
of Man is to be free from any Superior Power on Earth, and not to be
under the Will or Legislative Authority of Man, but to have only the Law
of Nature for his Rule."1 Locke can deduce the inherent freedom of the
individual because he isolates the individual from the social production
of identity. Individual identity emerges apart from the socialization
process, which only affects it in an external fashion. Society
constrains the choices that the individual subject might make, but it
doesn't create the will to choose itself within the individual. This is
where someone like Karl Marx, coming from the opposed tradition, would
see a fundamental blind spot in Locke's philosophy.2

Marx's critique of individualism is as vehement as Locke's endorsement
of it. But rather than simply reducing the individual to the status of a
social construction, as one might expect, [Marx
historicizes]{.underline} even [the concept of the
individual]{.underline}. Prior to a specific historical epoch (that of
capitalist relations of production), the individual did not exist.
[Social forces constrain individuals to such an extent that they can
produce worlds that have no individuals at all, which is how Marx
envisions the **precapitalist universe**]{.underline}. In the Grundrisse
he states this directly: "Human beings become individuals only through
the process of history. . . . Exchange itself is a chief means of this
individuation."3 The very fact of a subject relating to itself in
isolation from the social order is a result of social processes that owe
nothing to the individual as such.

Beginning with either the individual or society, each position
encounters a difficulty trying to account for the emergence of its
opposite --- society or the individual. [Locke explains the societal
impulse from the **individual desire to protect property**]{.underline},
and [Marx deduces the development of the individual from structural
changes]{.underline} in the means of production that form the basis of
the social order. But each position runs aground on the power that the
opposing force amasses and wields. Locke's liberalism cannot properly
weigh the degree of social coercion in the individual's existence, and
Marx's communism cannot fully address the conflict between the
individual's desire and the social good.

In light of the limitations of the extreme positions, [most thinkers
take up a middle ground, seeing a struggle or tension in the
relationship between the individual and the social order]{.underline}.
For most, society shapes the individual profoundly, but individuality
emerges through the way that each subject responds to this shaping. If,
as Marx contends, there is no individual outside of society, there is
also no society without the array of individual difference, and these
differences can trigger changes in the social structure with which they
interact. This is probably the dominant position today because it speaks
to our sense that both the individual and society influence each other.4
It is close to the position implicit in psychoanalytic theory, but
[psychoanalysis formulates the interaction between the individual and
the social order in a very precise way that enables it to provide an
explanation for why each comes into existence out of the
other.]{.underline}

[According to psychoanalytic thinking, **neither the subject nor the
social order exists independently** but instead emerges out of the
**other's incompleteness**. The subject exists at the point of the
social order's failure to become a closed structure, and the subject
enters into social arrangements as a result of its own failure to
achieve self-identity. The internal contradictions within every social
order create the space for the subject, just as the internal
contradictions of the subject produce an opening to externality that
links the subject to the social order. Failure on each side provides the
**connective apparatus and constitutes the bond between the subject and
the social order.**]{.underline}

[To put it another way, the subject's entrance into a group or society
depends on the **originary loss** that gives birth to its
subjectivity]{.underline}. Without this loss and the desire that it
produces in the subject, no one would agree to enter into a social bond,
a bond that places a fundamental restriction on the subject's ability to
enjoy. The psychoanalytic name for this foundational loss is the human
animal's "premature birth," a condition that creates an undue dependence
not present in other animals. But whether or not one wants to defend the
idea of humanity's premature birth, [the idea of a foundational loss is
nonetheless **essential for theorizing the emergence of subjectivity**.
Without loss, there could be **no desire and no subjectivity.** This
loss leads the subject to society as the site where loss might be
redeemed.]{.underline}

[Once deceived by the lure of an imaginary complete enjoyment and
disappointed with all the enjoyment it experiences, the subject is ready
to agree to the entrance requirements of a society. The frustrated
subject accedes to societal restrictions on enjoyment as she/he sees
that others have also accepted these]{.underline} restrictions. A
society circumnavigates the antagonisms between its members by promoting
equality or justice among them all. This equality is an equality born
through self-denial. As Freud points out, "[Social justice means that
**we deny ourselves many things** so that others may have to do without
them as well, or, what is the same thing, may not be able to ask for
them. This demand for equality is the **root of social conscience** and
the sense of duty."5 The subject's individual frustration with the
inadequacy of every actual enjoyment measured against the anticipated
enjoyment finds an outlet in the societal demand for equality, a demand
that proscribes this enjoyment for all. The subject sacrifices a
complete enjoyment that it never attains for the equality that derives
from membership in society.]{.underline}

#### The Western order has become the de facto global symbolic order -- that means not only are structures constituted by the West, but so are their minds

**Kapoor 18** (Ilan Kapoor - professor of Critical Development Studies
at the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change at York University in
Toronto, "Psychoanalysis and the GlObal", University of Nebraska Press,
Page 23, 1 September 2018, MG)

Let me tackle the problem in two ways. First, I want to suggest that,
[for all intents and purposes, the Western symbolic order has become the
**de facto global symbolic order**]{.underline}. As suggested earlier,
[through processes of globalization and (neo)colonialism, the West's
dominant representational and knowledge systems are **all-pervasive**
(although not unchallenged).]{.underline} Ashis Nandy (1983, xi)
contends [in this regard that "colonialism colonizes minds in addition
to bodies and it releases forces within the colonized societies to alter
their cultural priorities once and for all. . . . The West is now
everywhere, within the West and outside; in structures and in minds."
Psychoanalysis is thus applicable in **non-Western cultures**, not
because of universal categories of mind but because of the history of
globalization/colonialism, which has ended up imposing a Western(ized),
and increasingly capitalistic, symbolic order.]{.underline}

And second, even putting aside this historically constructed
universalism, [the Lacanian viewpoint is notable for what can be called
a **negative universalism**, which is represented by the Real. The idea
here is that every symbolic order---Western or non-Western, contemporary
or historical---is undone by the Real]{.underline}. As Eisenstein and
McGowan put it, "[There are **no transcendent principles that every
society shares**, but there is a constitutive failure that marks every
society]{.underline}" (2012, 69). In the same vein, Žižek writes, ["What
all epochs share is not some trans-epochal constant feature; it is,
rather, that they are all answers to the same deadlock]{.underline}"
(Žižek and Daly 2004, 76). [The Real is, therefore, a contextualized
antagonism: it is not some unchanging and transcendental substance but
immanent to every social order, reflecting any such order's inability to
fully constitute itself.]{.underline}

[This is why Lacanian psychoanalysis can be seen as negatively (or
contingently) universal, and hence universalizable.2 It is sensitive to
sociohistorical specificities (e.g., to the different manifestations of
**patriarchy** or **perversion** across the world or to the predominance
of **racial** over **patriarchic** law in some contexts, or vice versa),
while pointing out the internal selfdivision of every social order
(e.g., **capitalist globalization and the glObal**; urban landscapes in
Singapore, Frankfurt, and Dallas; or popular **protest** movements in
Brazil and Egypt).]{.underline}

Outline of the Book

[An important implication of all this is that the traumatic Real that
psychoanalysis aims to uncover is **not simply destabilizing but
productive and creative**]{.underline}. That is, as Žižek intimates,
[social reality is constructed precisely as a response to trauma; it
comprises multiple repeated attempts at answering a
deadlock]{.underline} (see also Blum and Secor 2014). This is why
[psychoanalysis maintains that subjecthood would be impossible without
trauma]{.underline}. And it is also why it can be argued in this book
that the glObal is meaningless without reference to the Real or
unconscious (hence the formula, the GlObal = Globalization + the Real).
As the contributors contend, [diverse global phenomena---from capitalist
accumulation and gender programs to climate change, urbanization, and
social uprisings---are **specific responses to a constitutive loss or
lack**. So the ideology of mainstream globalization may well be averse
to its inherent castration, denying the lack at its core]{.underline},
but our goal in this volume is nonetheless to expose such disavowal,
probing a range of unconscious desires and deadlocks. The glObal, in
this sense, is an indicator of trauma, and the book's contributors aim
at revealing its unconscious underpinnings.

I argue that [these [three Lacanian orders relate to]{.mark} the basic
areas of [neural anatomy: the left and right neocortex]{.mark}, plus the
subcortical areas (from limbic system to brainstem).]{.underline}21
[[Humans share with all pre-existing animals]{.mark}, at least as far
back as reptiles, [a core brainstem]{.mark} that regulates internal
functions and processes instinctual responses to outside stimuli, such
as the body\'s instant, unconscious reaction to danger.]{.underline} [We
share with mammals a limbic system (including the temporal lobes at the
sides of the head) that evolved around the brainstem to process more
complex emotions and learned behaviors]{.underline}.22 Like other
primates, [we also have an expanded neocortex as the outermost layer of
our brain]{.underline} (with occipital lobes in the back of the head,
parietal lobes at the top rear, and frontal lobes).23 [[However, humans
evolved distinct functional areas on each side of the
neocortex.]{.underline}]{.mark} [The left neocortex has audioverbal,
linear, causal, executive, prosocial, routine functions, in contrast to
the right hemisphere\'s visuospatial, holistic, intuitive, devil\'s
advocate, anxiety- biased, novelty-detecting processes]{.underline}.25
[[Distinctive language systems]{.mark} (syntax and semantics) [are in
the left hemisphere]{.mark}, in Broca\'s and Wernicke\'s
areas]{.underline},2\' in nearly all right-handed people and most
left-handed.2. [[The right brain has further ties to the emotional
limbic system and instinctual brainstem,]{.mark} [but the left tends to
operate separately]{.mark}]{.underline} (especially in men28),
[[expressing or inhibiting limbic emotions]{.mark} and right-cortical
intuitions, through its rational language and executive
controls]{.underline}. Specifically regarding theatrical mimesis, the
left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) is used for recognizing \"pantomimes
executed by others\" because it stores the \"complex digrams\" or
schemas used in the \"higher level intentional planning\" of actions,
while the right IPL is used for interpreting spatial orientation (Jacob
and Jeannerod 253). [Thus, [certain left-cortical functions correlate
with Lacan\'s Symbolic order of language, rules, and social codes, the
right with the Imaginary, and the limbic system]{.mark} and brain- stem
areas [with the Real]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet [these three orders arc
\"inmixed\" dimensions]{.underline} (Ragland-Sullivan 190), as are the
corresponding areas of our brains. [The Symbolic order resides
primarily, but not solely within and between left brains, like the
Imaginary in and between right hemispheres, and the Real in limbic
systems and brainstems]{.underline}.2- I say \"primarily\" because there
are also aspects of Symbolic language, involving imagery and emotions,
in certain right-brain functions: making and interpreting metaphors,
contextual meanings, puns, prosody, and non- verbal gestures (Ornstcin
103-08; Cozolino, Neuroscience of Psychotherapy 109). Thus, the right
brain is used more for language, along with the left, by \"expert\"
readers (Wolf 162). While the right brains Imaginary order is crucial
for \"sell-image\" (Ornstein 132, 175-76), the spatial sense of ego also
depends upon the left brain\'s \"orientation area,\" as I will consider
in the first chapter [[The general correspondence of Real, Imaginary,
and Symbolic orders to the brainstem/limbic system, right hemisphere,
and left hemisphere is confirmed by research on developmental growth
spurts in the neocortex during childhood. As in Lacan\'s theory of the
mirror stage,]{.mark} with the infant\'s Imaginary ego initially
developing through preverbal communication with the (m)Other,
[neuroscience shows that right-brain to right-brain \"attunement\"
between the mother and child, during its first two years of life,
profoundly shapes its emotional and perceptual pathways,]{.mark}
especially its sense of self in relation to others]{.underline}
(Cozolino, Neuroscience of Human 38, 66-75, 84-85; Neuroscience of
Psychotherapy 191-92). [The \"prosocial self then shifts, through
language development, into the left brain, with its growth in subsequent
years]{.underline} (118; Wolf 185-88). [This relates to the Lacanian
Symbolic order of words and laws shaping the child more directly after
the initial mirror stage, at 6-18 months.]{.underline} [According to
neuroscience, the self as a \"distributed neural network that
encompasses shared self-other representations\" continues to be \"right-
hemisphere based]{.underline}\" (Deccty and Sommerville 527).
Recognition of one\'s own face can be lost when the right hemisphere is
anesthetized (529)---demon- strating that the Imaginary perception of
ego (or the Freudian \"imago\"), and its possible fading or Lacanian
\"aphanisis,\" is based in the right cortex.31 Regarding our potential
for therapeutic and theatrical catharsis, there appears to be a crucial
filter between Symbolic/Imaginary and Real orders (or superego /ego and
id) in the prefrontal area of the neocortex, at the edge of the limbic
system.3 [Neurologists locate a \"stimulus barrier\" between the
Freudian superego and id in the \"ventromesial \[or ventromedial regions
of the prefrontal lobe \[where it\] merges into the limbic system\" and
protects the ego \"from the incessant demands of instinctual
life\"]{.underline} (Kaplan-Solms and Solms 275-76).34 [Here, [cathartic
changes may occur in how remnant natural instincts are expressed]{.mark}
(or transformed through greater awareness), [from]{.mark} mostly
unconscious, [limbic, Real emotions, through right-brain, Imaginary
perceptions]{.mark} and fundamental fantasies, [to the Symbolic order of
language, rules, and self identity]{.mark} in relation to the social
Other.]{.underline} [Neurologists have also found four layers of the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) with distinctive, nested, hierarchical
functions]{.underline} (Koechlin et al.; Murphy and Brown 133-35[). The
premotor cortex, at the rear of the PFC, exerts sensory control,
selecting specific motor]{.underline} (bodily action) [responses to
stimuli]{.underline}. The caudal lateral PFC, [the next
layer]{.underline} moving forward, [adds contextual control]{.underline}
regarding the current situation when stimuli are received. The rostral
lateral PFC, [a further anterior layer, then exerts episodic control
over the other two, by tracking present and past information regarding
general behavior]{.underline}, thus allowing for changing contingencies.
(Murphy and Brown give the examples of answering the phone when it
rings, not answering it at a friend s house, or answering it there
because the friend IS in the shower and asks you to, as illustrating
these three levels of stimulus response.) A fourth area is posited in
the frontopolar cortex, used for cognitive branching and controlling the
shifts between different episodes of behavior, while exerting control
over the other three layers. Likewise, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
determines \"reward value\" choices, including the selection of
\"stimuli on the basis of familiarity and \[selection of\] responses on
the basis of a feeling of Vightness\" (Elliott et al. 308). The lateral
regions of the OFC arc involved with \"the suppression of previously
rewarded responses.\" [[Brain imaging studies find that these areas are
\"fundamental\" in behavioral choices,]{.mark} especially in
\"unpredictable situations.\" One might argue that the Lacanian Symbolic
and Imaginary orders of cultural rules and personal perceptions connect
with the Real of stimuli and actions through these areas of the
PFC]{.underline} (just behind and above the ventrome- dial). [The brain
responds to familiar or unpredictable stimuli with inner]{.underline}
theatrical representations and outer performances, through shifting,
time-bound, [contextual, sensory controls. Such controls are shaped in
each human brain through learned cultural experiences of the social
Other,]{.underline} which create further top-down constraints utilized
by the PFC\'s layered functions, in relation to bottom-up stimuli. And
yet, theatrical performances are ways that the Other, as well as the
individual, may change. A culture can explore extended possibilities of
Symbolic and Imaginary shifts in situation, context, and sensation,
using a collective dreamlike space. This may also involve divine and
demonic characterizations of top-down or bottom-up forces, experienced
in nature, in the body and brain, or in social networks. [[Lacan\'s
three orders relate not only to the brain\'s anatomy, but]{.mark} also
[to]{.mark} cognitive psychologist Merlin [Donald\'s theory
about]{.mark} the evolutionary stages of [cultural development in our
hominid ancestors]{.mark}.]{.underline} [About two million years ago,
early hominids evolved beyond the \"episodic\" experience of other
animals]{.underline} (and prior australopithecines)--- [with the
\"mimetic\" stage of human evolution]{.underline}.3 [Donald cites the
[evidence of increasing brain size in our hominid]{.mark}
ancestors]{.underline},-[\' the first stone tools, big game hunting, a
more group-oriented way of life, and thus \"a cultural strategy for
remembering and problem solving\"]{.underline} (Mind 261).\' [Instead of
being \"immersed in a stream of raw episodic experience,]{.underline}
from which they \... \[could not\] gain any distance[,\" [early hominids
developed a new cognitive capacity]{.mark}, \"mimetic skill, which was
an extension of conscious control into the domain of
action.]{.underline} It enabled playacting, body language, precise
imitation, and gesture\" (120, 261). This also included prosody, which
is processed today in the brain\'s right hemisphere: \"deliberately
raising and lowering the voice, and producing imitations of emotional
sounds. [About a half million years ago, archaic [Homo sapiens gradually
evolved a \"mythic\" stage of culture]{.mark} and brain
development]{.underline}, culminating with the emergence of our own
subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens, about 125,000 years ago (Donald, Mind
261). [The mythic stage is evidenced by a much higher rate of innovation
than in prior hominids: sophisticated tools, \"beautifully crafted
objects, improved shelters and hearths, and elaborate
graves\"]{.underline} (261-62). [This stage included oral traditions of
language and narrative thought --- beyond the gesture, mime, and
imitation of prior mimetic hominids, or the basic awareness and event
sensitivity of episodic primates]{.underline} (260).\" [[It thus
involved a fundamental change in the human brain (and vocal tract): an
\"invasion\" of the left parietal lobe by language]{.mark},]{.underline}
replacing spatial perception and movement, which then became a more
distinctive function of the right parietal lobe (LcDoux, Synaptic 303,
318).40 [[Donald\'s mythic stage shows the evolution of the Symbolic
order of mind and society]{.mark},]{.underline} as well as our current
left hemisphere functions. The mimetic stage correlates to right brain
processing and the Lacanian Imaginary. [[Today\'s human brains also bear
the remnant animal emotions and drives of primal episodic
awareness]{.mark} in the limbic system and brainstem, as a lost yet
disruptive Real]{.underline} or chora\*1 Indeed, [each child moves
through similar developmental stages, recapitulating hominid phylogeny:
from primal episodic awareness to the mimetic \"interlinking of the
infant\'s attentional system with those of other people\"]{.underline}
and then to narrative speech (Donald, Mind 255). Or, [in Lacanian terms,
a child moves from the Real of natural being to the Imaginary order of
mirrored illusions of ego in the (m)Others desires and then, through
verbal language, to the Symbolic order of superego incorporation, with
the Others discourse and social rules,]{.underline} via the Name and No
of the Father. This basic outline of Lacanian orders, brain anatomy, and
hominid evolution shows that \"theatre\" (and dance) in the most primal
sense --- as Imaginary, mimetic performance ---began about two million
years ago. At that time, our ancestors developed a new skill that
eventually became specialized in the visuospatial, prosodic, Imaginary
functions of the right hemisphere, with ties to the
emotional/instinctual Real of the limbic system and brain- stem. Later
hominids developed oral language and myth-making, as further Symbolic
orders, through distinct areas of the left brain about a half million
years ago. As with the modern child\'s development from primary to
higher- order consciousness, through the Real and Imaginary dimensions
of the mirror stage and the later Symbolic acquisition of language and
rules, these layers of the brain and of hominid culture continue to
interact today --- with each human being transformed by a particular
family and society. As Donald points out, primal mimesis in early
hominids relates not only to the current playacting of children (Mind
266), but also to the \"many institutionalized versions of pretend play
in theater and him, and \[to the\] imaginative role playing \[that\] is
integral to adult social life\" (263). A crucial aspect of this
evolutionary skill is emotional regulation, which involves the germ of
self-consciousness, through a \"mimetic controller\" in the brain, \"a
whole-body mapping capacity \... under unified command\" (269). Thus,
early hominids developed larger frontal lobes, setting the stage for the
later evolution of a distinctive left hemisphere (271).\'15 Like
children today (starting with the Imaginary dimension of the Lacanian
mirror stage), our hominid ancestors developed a \"kinematic
imagination\" with the physical \"image of self\" becoming an anchor to
experience and awareness (273). This involved rhythmic body movements,
expressing temporal relations, through the intersubjective medium of
performance, as a \"public theatre of convention\" (272-74). However,
the full emergence of theatre as narrative performance began with oral
storytelling during the hominid \"mythic\" stage, starting about a half
million years ago. Then, about forty thousand years ago, humans evolved
a further, \"theoretic\" stage, through the \"externalization of memory
\... \[using\] symbolic devices to store and retrieve cultural
knowledge\" (Donald, Mind2G2). During this current stage of hominid
evolution, the tradition of recorded theatre and drama developed, along
with other artistic technologies,44 a \"Symptom\" of being human that
has vastly expanded in recent centuries.45 Thus, theatre in the
theoretic sense may have started with Paleolithic cave art (as
considered in the first chapter). Eventually, the theoretic technologies
of theatre, externalizing and interconnecting the performance elements
of the human brain, developed in various ways through different cultures
--- culminating in the current globalism 01 virtual media screens, often
dominated by Western paradigms. Our theoretic stage with its evolving
technologies continues to reshape the skills of prior stages and
\"liberate consciousness from the limitations of the brains biological
memory systems\" (305). However, such an external memory field can also
be a \"Trojan Horse,\" Donald warns, \"a device that invades the
innermost personal spaces of the mind. It can play our cognitive
instrument, directing our minds toward predetermined end states along a
set course\" (316). Such a Trojan Horse potential, with good and evil
effects, becomes even more significant through divine characters and
godlike ideals, at various points in Western history, from stage to
screen performances, as explored throughout this book. Donald\'s stages
of cognitive psychology match with Stephen Mithens archeological
theories and research.4fl According to Mithen, the early hominid social
intelligence of Homo erectus\> 1.6 million years ago, involved the
communication of \"contentment, anger or desire\" through a \"wide range
of sounds (Prehistory 144) ---as with the mimetic prosody theorized by
Donald. Human verbal language with \"a vast lexicon and a set of
grammatical rules\" began 500,000 to 200,000 years ago, with
Neanderthals and archaic Homo sapiens, as evidenced by brain and throat
structure, indicated in fossils of their bones (140-42, 208). This
corresponds to Donald\'s mythic stage of hominid evolution. Mithen also
cites archeological evidence that a dramatic shift occurred 40,000 years
ago. Early humans in the Upper Paleolithic period changed from having
separate types of intelligence---natural history intelligence (such as
interpreting animal hoofprints), social intelligence (with intentional
communication), and technical intelligence (producing artifacts from
mental templates) --- to a new cognitive fluidity between them, creating
artifacts with \"symbolic meanings \... i.e. art\" (163-65).47 This
shows the begin- ning of Donald\'s theoretic stage and relates to the
possible shamanic visions and performances evidenced by Paleolithic cave
art.48 The evolutionary stages, neurological layers, and psychoanalytic
orders of self and Other awareness, developing through shared cultural
performances, reflect what might be called an \"inner theatre\" of the
brain.49 By this, I do not mean a \"Cartesian theatre\" with the mind
inside the brain as a single ghostly spectator watching the machinery of
inner scenes, or as a play-wright-homunculus inhabiting a central
control area (the pineal gland, according to Descartes. 400 years ago).
This theory has been fully critiqued by cognitive philosophers, from
Gilbert Rylc to Daniel Dennett, as well as by current neurological
evidence. However, cognitive scientist Bernard Baars uses theatrical
terms in other ways to explain the global workspace of human
consciousness. [[Less than 10 percent of brain activity is
conscious,]{.mark} like a \"spot- light\" on the visible actors and
scenery]{.underline} (Theater 46-47).5 [[The rest involves unconscious
agents,]{.mark} like a legislative \"audience,\" competing and
collaborating to focus attention on particular perceptions and ideas
onstage.]{.underline} There are Deep Goal and Conceptual Contexts, like
\"backstage\" workers, as well as immediate expectations and intentions,
forming an unconscious sense of self as \"director\" of the brains inner
theatre (144-45).52

Grunbaum, in 1984, published a book which took issue with the positivist
attack upon the un-falsifiablity of psychoanalysis Grunbaum \" argues
that, [although perhaps more difficult to study than in the physical
sciences, cause-effect principles apply just as strongly in psychology
as in physics]{.underline}. He also shows that many **[[psychoanalytical
postulates are falsifiable]{.underline}]{.mark}** \...\" A, Bateman, &
J, Holmes claim that [[repression, unconscious awareness]{.mark},
identification [and internalization are **scientifically
proven**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now despite Grunbaum\'s apparent
demonstration of the falsifablity of psychoanalysis some theorists claim
that the external validation of psychoanalysis is doomed to fail. These
theorists follow Ricoeur in claiming a hermeneutic understanding of
psychoanalysis. They claim that instead of a correspondence with
reality, as being the criteria upon which to assess psychoanalysis, they
claim that \". internal coherence and narrative plausibility as the
basis for settling disputes.\" Thus we see [there are those, like
Grunbaum, who argue that [psychoanalysis can be tested against]{.mark}
the facts [of reality and]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[its
postulates can be falsified by reality. On the other hand there are
those]{.mark}, like Ricoeur, [who advocate a hermenutical approach where
it is]{.mark} not a correspondence with reality that matters but
[whether the]{.mark} psychoanalytic [theory is internally consistent and
its interpretations]{.mark} or narratives [satisfying]{.mark} or not. A
theory is falsifiable]{.underline}, in the correspondence theory of
\'truth\' if it does not agree with reality. In the coherence theory of
\'truth\' a theory is falsifiable ifit is inconsistent in terms of the
system. I will argue that both criteria are flawed and lack
epistemological support. In this regard we see that [the debate on the
falsifiablity of psychoanalysis is a debate between correspondence and
coherence theorists]{.underline}. Now [the]{.underline} correspondence
and coherence [[theories of \'truth\' are philosophically
flawed]{.underline}]{.mark}. I will show how they are flawed [and lack
epistemological support]{.underline}. [[What I will draw from this
is]{.underline}]{.mark} my claim [[that **it does not matter whether
psychoanalysis is falsifiable**]{.underline}]{.mark} or not either in
terms of the correspondence or coherence theories of \'truth\' because
both lack epistemological support. A way of looking at a theory is to
see at as a set of statements which say something about a state of
affair about reality. Under this viewpoint [[the issue is what is the
relation between]{.mark} the [statement and reality]{.mark} that makes
it \'true\' or \'false\']{.underline}. [O\'Hear notes \'true\'
statements correspond or picture reality . But [the problem with this is
that \" how can]{.mark} a statement- [something linguistic - correspond
to a fact]{.mark}]{.underline} or state of affairs. Certainly it cannot
be a replica of a state of affairs , nor does it fit with it in the way
a nut might be said to correspond with a nut. Further, even if we could
make some sense of a simple affirmative factual statement \.... There
are considerable problems with knowing just what it is other statements
are supposed to correspond to.\" [What about negative statements that
say something is not or does not exist? What aboutcounterfactural
statements? Do mathematical and moral statements correspond
to]{.underline} something in [reality? Are there universal statements
that correspond to reality?]{.underline} The correspondence theory of
\'truth\' that sees statements as corresponding to reality is thus
problematic. The problems are such that, as O\'Hear notes \" \... the
correspondence relation are simply shadowy reflections of statements we
regard as true for other reasons rather than as generally
mind-independent realities.\" When we realize that there is no
non-conceptual view about reality we realize that **[[even \'reality\'
is a value-laden conceptual laden term]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As some
argue all theory is value laden there are no facts uncontaminated by
epistemological, metaphysical, other theories, and ontological views.
The result of all this is to undermine the claims of the correspondence
theory such that \"\... [there is something futile in thinking that what
we know is achieved by direct access to a mind-independent reality,
which would suggest that a naive correspondence view of
truth]{.underline}, at least, [is likely to be able to give us little
guidance in our actual inquiries and researches.\"]{.underline} We shall
see that the coherence theory of \'truth\' fares no better in guiding
our research or acessing our actual statements about \'truth\' or
falsidity. In the coherence theory of \'truth\' the criteria of
\'truth\' is that a statement does not contradict other statements.
O\'Hear notes that \"systems here are regarded as being governed by
nothing more mysterious than normal relations of implication and
contradiction.\" But as has been pointed out it is quite easy to avoid
contradiction by dropping inconsistent statements . If a statement is
inconsistent with theory or observation we can just drop either the
theory or observational statement. Also many scientific theory suffer
from empirical counter-evidence which we nevertheless still accept. What
happens when two or more theories i.e. Kleinian, Lacanian, Freudian,
ego-psychology etc, are lets say coherent but contain mutually
contradictory statements in regard to each other. In other words what
about the situation when theories are coherent but contradict each
other. O\'Hear points out \" that many would regard this as a conclusive
objection to the coherence theory of truth, for surely whether a
statement is true or not depends on the facts and not on the systems we
are using to interpret the facts.\" But here is the big problem. We
showed above that facts are themselves value conceptual laden. The
correspondence theory of \'truth\' in fact is not epistemologically or
metaphysically etc neutral- we see the facts through other theories. But
we have just seen that in seeing the facts through other theories
assumes that the theories are coherence, but coherence theories of
\'truth\' as we have seen are epistemologically flawed. Thus we see that
epistemologically both the correspondence and coherence theories of
\'truth\' are flawed. This to my mind say that [it does not matter
whether psychoanalysis is falsifiable. Whether it is, or is not is based
upon a particular theory of \'truth\' that has no epistemological
support]{.underline}. Now [regardless of these philosophical
investigations I will show that in terms of each theory there is
evidence that even though their criteria are not met for some theories
these theories are still used with ongoing validity. This evidence will
also lend weight to my claim that it does not matter whether
psychoanalysis is falsifiable or not, it can still have validity. [There
are examples from physics where]{.mark} correspondence with [reality has
not resulted in]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[abandonment]{.underline}]{.mark} of the theory[. [A theory has been
falsified yet]{.underline}]{.mark} [nevertheless it [is still used. A
classic example is]{.mark} that of [Newtonian
physics]{.mark}]{.underline}. Newtonian prediction of black-body
radiation failed -this was left to quantum physics to do. Also Newtonian
physics failed to predict the motion of three bodies in combined
gravitational motion i.e. planets . Kuhn points out that no one denied
that Newtonian physic was not as science because it could not predict
the speed of sound, or Newton\'s laws of gravitation failed to predict
and account for the perigee of the moon or the motion of the moon; as he
states \" no one seriously questioned Newtonian theory because of the
long recognized discrepancies between predictions from the theory and
both the speed the speed of sound and the motion of Mercury.\" [Thus we
see that even if psychoanalysis is falsified in terms of the
correspondence theory of \'truth ,the case of Newtonian physics shows us
that it need not matter]{.underline} in the least. [[In this regard
there is truth in Freud\'s]{.mark} provocative [idea, when he states, \"
even if psychoanalysis showed itself as
unsuccessful]{.mark}]{.underline} in every other form of nervous and
psychical disease as it does in delusions, [[it would]{.mark} still
[remain completely justified as an]{.mark} irreplacable [instrument of
scientific research]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is true that in that case
we should not be in a position to practice it.\" Now [[even in science
and mathematics there are un-falsifiable entities but this does not stop
them being used]{.mark} in those disciplines. At the very core of
science and mathematics there are un-falsifiable entities. Such things
as [matter, the mathematical point, anti-matter
force]{.mark}]{.underline} etc. [[are
unfalsifiable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Freud notes the presence of
un-falsiable objects in psychoanalysis when he states \" too it will be
entirely in accord with our expectations if the basic concepts and
principles of the new science (instincts, nervous energy, etc) remain
for a considerable time no less indeterminate than those of the older
sciences (force, mass, attraction, etc).\" Thus we see that even if
psychoanalysis is not falsifiable, in terms of the correspondence theory
of \'truth\'. just like in mathematics and science, it does not matter
for a theories validity. The coherence theory of \'truth\'s says that if
a theory or statement is inconsistent then it is false. But there are
examples where this is the state of affairs but nevertheless the
theories are still used.

#### Reject their appeal to expertise. 

**McGowan 13 **(Todd, Ph.D. professor of English at UVM, Enjoying What
We Don't Have: The Political Project of Psychoanalysis, 2013)

Psychoanalytic thought provides a way of understanding the role that
enjoyment plays in structuring individual subjectivity and the social
order. But it also allows us to see how [enjoyment shapes the field of
political contestation, which has undergone a fundamental historical
shift in parallel with a similar shift in the location of
authority.]{.underline} [The onset of capitalism inaugurates a
significant change]{.underline} [not just in the structure of the
economy and of social relations but also]{.underline} [in the nature of
social authority.]{.underline} As Michel Foucault and many others have
documented, [power relocates at the time of capitalism's
emergence:]{.underline} [diffuse networks]{.underline}** **[of
power]{.underline}** **[replace a central social
authority.]{.underline} [The point is not simply that rule by royalty
gives way to representative government, in which power is shared among a
wider spectrum of people, but that the location and foundation of
authority in society undergoes a revolution.]{.underline} [Even when
monarchs or despots persist in the capitalist epoch, they become
fundamentally changed figures, no longer embodying the position of
ultimate authority, which instead multiplies throughout the social
fabric.]{.underline} [A unified law becomes a hodgepodge of rules and
recommendations.]{.underline} Or one might say that [the master
controlling social relations from a transcendent position gives way to a
variety of experts]{.underline}** **[caught up within the very relations
of power in which they exert their influence.]{.underline} [In the
absence of a central law uniting the social field,]{.underline} [these
experts provide rules]{.underline} [to live by]{.underline} [and
guidance]{.underline} [for the variegations of
life.]{.underline} According to Anthony Giddens, [what emerges is a
universe ruled by "expert
systems,"]{.underline} [which]{.underline} [are]{.underline} ["systems
of technical accomplishment]{.underline}** **[or professional
expertise]{.underline}** **[that organise large areas
of]{.underline}** **[the material and
social]{.underline}** **[environments]{.underline}** **[in which we live
today."]{.underline} [Knowledge, not mastery,]{.underline}** **[becomes
the source of social authority.The reign of expert systems is the
denouement of the process that originates when, at the dawn of the
capitalist epoch, "all that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is
profaned."]{.underline} [This famous description of bourgeois society
from the Communist Manifesto attempts metaphorically to chronicle the
radical social leveling process that a capitalist economy
entails.]{.underline} [An economy based on exchange, like that of
capitalism, demands that the objects exchanged have an equivalent
value.]{.underline} [If the exchange did not involve equivalents or, to
say the same thing, involved cheating on one side, the system could not
sustain itself. A system of unequal exchange is not a viable system of
exchange.]{.underline} [The equivalence of all objects under the rubric
of the commodity implies the equivalence of all subjects as well: if one
entity is excepted from universal equivalence, the entire system would
cease to function because its logic would no longer hold
true.]{.underline} [One of Marx's great insights consists in recognizing
the transformative effect of the dominance of universal equivalence that
capitalist society necessarily institutes. But]{.underline} [ironically,
this process, as Marx and Engels describe it, ends up ultimately
undermining the project that Marx and Engels themselves undertook to
topple it.]{.underline} [Marx]{.underline} [composed the three volumes
of Capital and a multitude of other writings in order to supply
knowledge about capitalist relations of production that leftist
militants could use to change those relations. He]{.underline} [fought
capitalism with knowledge, with expertise, even as he hoped that it
would not remain merely theoretical but become
practical.]{.underline} [Early on in his career, Marx tried to theorize
in a practical way, to create a mode of thinking that actively engages
in the world rather than reflecting on it (which is the position that
knowledge, he claims, has historically occupied).]{.underline} This is
apparent throughout The Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 and
in the "Theses on Feuerbach." In the former, Marx claims: ["The
resolution of the theoretical antitheses is only possible in a practical
way, by virtue of the practical energy of men. Their resolution is
therefore by no means merely a problem of understanding, but a real
problem of life, which philosophy could not solve precisely because it
conceived this problem as merely a theoretical one." Marx orients his
theory toward praxis not because he is wary of knowledge's complicity
with power (as Foucault is) but because he worries about its historical
fecklessness.]{.underline} As the final thesis on Feuerbach
indicates, [Marx wants to intervene and change the world rather than
comment on it after history has already been made. But the problem of
knowledge in the epoch in which Marx wrote lies
elsewhere.]{.underline} [The danger isn't that knowledge will be
powerless but that it will be too powerful]{.underline}** **[and act as
a form of social authority. As a purveyor of knowledge concerning how
the capitalist system actually works, Marx cannot escape being an
expert. And yet, within the process that capitalism unleashes, the
expert functions as a figure of authority. In this sense, the
transmutation of Marxism into Stalinism, though it is not inevitable,
follows from the change in the structure of authority that capitalism
triggers. Stalin is the ultimate figure of expert knowledge, tightly
controlling Soviet society in order to develop its productivity to the
maximum potential. Stalin is the bureaucratic counterpart to Henry
Ford,]{.underline} [the expert of the free market.]{.underline} [By
establishing his doctrine as a system of expertise, Marx inadvertently
succumbs to the logic that he aims to contest and makes someone like
Stalin possible, though it is not clear that there is an alternate
solution. Marx is an Enlightenment thinker.]{.underline}** **[At the
beginning of the Enlightenment, knowledge was a force for
liberation]{.underline}** **[and revolution. Someone like Galileo
represents a danger to the authority of the Catholic Church because this
authority rests on the power of the master signifier rather than on the
power of knowledge.]{.underline} In Bertolt Brecht's play depicting
Galileo's recantation, the church's philosopher upbraids Galileo for
seeking knowledge that might bring upheaval to the established order,
but Galileo himself insists that the true scientist seeks knowledge
without considering where it will lead. His advice to those thinkers who
fear shaking the foundations of the church's authority is emphatic: "Why
defend shaken teachings? You should be doing the shaking."7 The position
of the scientist or knowledge seeker, as Galileo sees it here, is
unequivocal. The pursuit of knowledge involves one in a combat against
the power of authority, and it represents a power that authorities fear,
which is why the Inquisition targeted Galileo. In actual history and in
Brecht's play, Galileo's courage to defy authority wanes. He recants and
capitulates to the power of the church, which deals a temporary blow to
the Enlightenment project and its liberating potential. Descartes, for
one, withheld the publication of his treatise *The World* out of fear
that he might become a target of the Inquisition, as Galileo
did. [But]{.underline}** **[the power of the Enlightenment
and]{.underline}** **[knowledge wins its historical
struggle]{.underline}** **[with the authority of the master signifier.
When this occurs and knowledge becomes a source of social authority,
knowledge loses its connection to the Enlightenment project of universal
emancipation. Knowledge]{.underline}** **[becomes a force for
subjugation rather than freedom, and the Enlightenment is transformed
into its opposite.]{.underline} [When experts become the voice of
authority, the political landscape undergoes a dramatic change, the
ramifications of which have become increasingly visible in the last few
decades.]{.underline} [The transformation of authority that began in the
seventeenth century realized itself at the conclusion of the twentieth,
and the result has been a reversal of traditional political alignments.
This social revolution strips the forces of social change of their
favorite weapon --- knowledge --- because use of this weapon has the
effect of turning subjects against social change, despite the fact that
that change is clearly in their best interests.]{.underline} [In today's
world,]{.underline} [expert
knowledge]{.underline} [necessarily]{.underline} [confronts the subject
as an external imperative laced with the power of prohibition. The rise
of the expert corresponds to the]{.underline} [increasing
complexity]{.underline} [and treacherousness of everyday life;
contemporary existence seems to demand expert analysis to render it
navigable. In]{.underline} his account of the emergence of what he
calls [a "risk society,"]{.underline} Ulrich Beck notices the politics
of expert knowledge changing sides. He points out: ["The non-acceptance
of the scientific definition of risks is not something to be reproached
as 'irrationality' in the population; but quite to the contrary, it
indicates that]{.underline} [the cultural premises of acceptability
contained in scientific]{.underline} [and
technical]{.underline} [statements]{.underline} [on
risks]{.underline} [are wrong.]{.underline} [The technical
risk]{.underline} [experts are mistaken in the empirical accuracyof
their implicit value premises, specifically in their assumptions of what
appears acceptable to the population."]{.underline} [Experts provide
guidelines that allow subjects to navigate the contours of contemporary
society, in which risk confronts us everywhere,
but]{.underline}** **[the experts perform]{.underline}** **[this
function]{.underline}** **[with
no]{.underline}** **[proper]{.underline}** **[sense
of]{.underline}** **[what the
population]{.underline}** **[desires.]{.underline}** **[In this process,
experts inevitably assume the role of authority figures.]{.underline} As
Beck's statement above indicates, [from the perspective of the general
population itself, the relationship between the expert and the
population is adversarial.]{.underline} Through psychoanalytic thought,
we can gain insight into the ramifications of the rise of the expert
authority and the decline of the master. The emergence of the expert as
the figure of authority fundamentally changes the political terrain, and
our political thinking must adjust to this transformation.
Psychoanalytic thought represents a privileged vehicle for making the
adjustment. [Combating the expert is much more difficult than combating
the master: the knowledge that would subvert mastery becomes part of the
power that the expert wields and thus loses its subversive
power.]{.underline}** **[A different political program --- one that
focuses on enjoyment]{.underline}** **[rather than knowledge
---]{.underline}** **[becomes necessary]{.underline}** **[because the
master and the expert take up radically different positions relative to
enjoyment. Unlike the master, the earlier form of social authority, the
expert not only prohibits enjoyment but also appears to embody this
enjoyment through the act of laying down regulations. The expert enjoys
informing subjects about the dangers they face or the ways they should
alter their behavior, and it is this enjoyment that subjects rebel
against.]{.underline}** **The enjoyment that the expert derives from
providing counsel is the explicit focus of Peter Segal's Anger
Management (2003), which finds comedy in the abuse that an anger
management therapist heaps on his client. The film recounts the travails
of a timid businessman, Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler), who is sentenced to
anger management therapy after a misunderstanding occurs between a
flight attendant and him while he is traveling. His therapist, Dr. Buddy
Rydell (Jack Nicholson), practices an aggressive treatment that involves
intimidating Buznik, screaming at him, and even invading his personal
life. At the end of the film, rather than helping Buznik, Rydell appears
to have wooed Buznik's girlfriend away from him and basically destroyed
his life. Here we see all the ways that the expert enjoys deploying
knowledge, and this enjoyment occurs at the expense of the subject
receiving the advice. But in the last instance Anger Management remains
fully ensconced in the regime of the expert, despite the comedy it tries
to create at the expense of this regime. The film's ending reveals that
Rydell has set up the entire experience --- including the incident with
the flight attendant and the sentencing by the judge --- in order to
impel Buznik to express himself, especially to his girlfriend. Rather
than a course in anger management, Rydell has actually been offering a
course in self-expression. This denouement transforms the film's (and
the viewer's) relationship to the expert: rather than impugning the rule
of expertise and knowledge, the film becomes an affirmation of it. The
ending of the fi lm doesn't simply spoil an otherwise trenchant critique
of expert rule but infects the critique throughout the fi lm. The
critique --- and the comedy, unfortunately --- never go far enough
because the idea that the expert really knows and really has the best
interests of the client at heart informs the entirety of the film. The
film's investment in the expert that it appears to critique portends the
film's failure as both comedy and critique. [The rule of the expert has
such a degree of hegemony today that it is difficult to think of any
films, novels, and other artworks that attempt to contest it or expose
the expert's enjoyment without ultimately partaking of it. On the other
hand, the works that allow audiences to enjoy along with the expert
multiply throughout the culture. Television shows such as csi: Crime
Scene Investigations and House M.D. display this dynamic in its most
open form: the shows present a problem that appears utterly unsolvable
to the viewer, and then they reveal the expert's genius at finding a
solution.]{.underline} [Expert knowledge]{.underline} [--- a knowledge
not accessible to the ordinary subject ---]{.underline} [has all the
answers and thus becomes the undisputable]{.underline} [locus
of]{.underline} [authority. The popularity of these shows derives from
their ability to allow audiences to share in the expert's enjoyment, an
enjoyment that typically is the site of trauma for the
subject.]{.underline} [Contact with expert authority has a traumatic
effect on the subjectbecause of the proximity of the expert. While the
old master remained at a distance, the expert is always in the subject's
face]{.underline}, like Dr. Buddy Rydell in Anger Management, [never
allowing the subject room to breathe.]{.underline} As Anger Management
shows, [this proximity has the effect of stimulating the subject. Under
the rule of the expert, subjects experience]{.underline} what Eric
Santner calls ["a sustained traumatization induced by exposure to, as it
were, fathers who \[know\] too much about living human beings." Exposure
to this type of authority, to "this excess of knowledge," produces "an
intensification of the body \[that\] is first and foremost a
sexualization."]{.underline} [Instead of emancipating the subject,
knowledge traumatizes and plays the central role in the subjection of
the subject to the order of social regulation.]{.underline}

 

#### Psychoanalysis is both falsifiable and accurate.

**Grant & Harari '5** (Don and Edwin, psychiatrists, "Psychoanalysis,
science and the seductive theory of Karl Popper," Australian and New
Zealand Journal of Psychiatry 39)

Attacks on psychoanalysis and the long-term therapies derived from it,
have enjoyed a long history and much publicity \[1-4\]. Yet, the
justification for such attacks has been challenged on many grounds,
including their methodology \[5\] and the empirically demonstrable
validity of core psychoanalytic concepts \[6,7\]. Also, [burgeoning
neuroscience research]{.underline}, some of which is summarized
below, [indicates likely neurological correlates for many key clinically
derived psychoanalytic concepts]{.underline} [such
as]{.underline} [self-coherence]{.underline} \[8\], [repression]{.underline} \[9\] [and
projective identification]{.underline} \[10\].

Furthermore, [the effectiveness of psychoanalysis]{.underline} [and its
derivative therapies]{.underline} [has been supported by empirical
research]{.underline}\[11,12\], particularly for patients with DSM axis
II pathology. Despite this evidence, the attacks on psychoanalysis
continue unabated, not only from some psychiatrists \[13,14\] but also
from the highest levels of politics and health bureaucrats \[15\],
although what exactly is being attacked is often unclear.

 

#### Drives are verified too.

**Guterl '2** (Fred, "What Freud Got Right," Newsweek, Nov
11, <http://www.neuropsa.org.uk/what-freud-got-right>)

But a funny thing happened to Freud on the way to becoming a trivia
question: [as researchers looked deeper into the physical structure of
the brain, they began to find support]{.underline} for some of his
theories. Now a small but influential group of [researchers are using
his insights as a guide to future research;]{.underline} they even have
a journal, Neuropsychoanalysis, founded three years ago. "[Freud's
insights]{.underline} [on the nature of consciousness]{.underline} [are
consonant with the most advanced contemporary
neuroscience]{.underline} [views,"]{.underline} [wrote]{.underline} [Antonio]{.underline} [Damasio,
head of neurology at]{.underline} [the University
of]{.underline} [Iowa]{.underline} [College of Medicine]{.underline}.
Note that Damasio did not refer to psychoanalysis or the Oedipus
complex. Instead [the work is going on at the fundamental level where
emotions are born and primitive passions lurk in the shadows of
dreams]{.underline}.

HOW THE MIND WORKS

       Beyond the basic animal instincts to seek food and avoid
pain, [Freud identified two]{.underline} sources of psychic energy,
which he called ["drives":]{.underline} aggression and libido (the
latter encompasses sexuality but also had a more expansive meaning,
involving the desire for stimulation and achievement). The key to his
theory is that these were unconscious drives, shaping our behavior
without the mediation of our waking minds; they surface, heavily
disguised, only in our dreams. The work of the past half-century in
psychology and neuroscience has been to downplay the role of unconscious
universal drives, focusing instead on rational processes in conscious
life. Meanwhile, dreams were downgraded to a kind of mental static,
random scraps of memory flickering through the sleeping brain.
But [researchers have found evidence that Freud's drives
really]{.underline} [do]{.underline} [exist,
and]{.underline} [they]{.underline} [have]{.underline} [their]{.underline} [roots
in the limbic system, a primitive part of the brain that operates mostly
below the horizon of consciousness]{.underline}. Now more commonly
referred to as emotions, the modern suite of drives comprises five:
rage, panic, separation distress, lust and a variation on libido
sometimes called seeking. [Freud presaged this finding in 1915, when he
wrote that drives originate "from within the organism" in response to
demands placed on the mind "in consequence of its connection with the
body."]{.underline} [Drives, in other words,]{.underline} [are primitive
brain circuits that control how we respond to our
environment]{.underline}---foraging when we're hungry, running when
we're scared and lusting for a mate.

The seeking drive is proving a particularly fruitful subject for
researchers. Although like the others it originates in the limbic
system, it also involves parts of the forebrain, the seat of higher
mental functions. In the 1980s, Jaak [Panksepp, a neurobiologist at
Bowling Green State University in Ohio, became interested in a place
near the cortex known as the ventraltegmental area]{.underline}, which
in humans lies just above the
hairline. [When]{.underline} Panksepp [stimulated]{.underline} the
corresponding region [in a mouse, the animal would sniff the air and
walk around, as though it were looking for something.]{.underline} Was
it hunger? No. The mouse would walk right by a plate of food, or for
that matter any other object Panksepp could think of. This brain tissue
seemed to cause a general desire for something new. "What I was seeing,"
he says, "was the urge to do stuff." Panksepp called this seeking.

[To
neuropsychologist]{.underline} [Mark]{.underline} [Solms]{.underline} [of
University College in London, that sounds very much like libido. "Freud
needed some sort of general, appetitive desire to seek pleasure in the
world of objects]{.underline}," says Solms. "[Panksepp discovered as a
neuroscientist what Freud discovered
psychologically.]{.underline}" Solms studied the same region of the
brain for his work on dreams. Since the 1970s, neurologists have known
that dreaming takes place during a particular form of sleep known as
REM---rapid eye movement---which is associated with a primitive part of
the brain known as the pons. Accordingly, they regarded dreaming as a
low-level phenomenon of no great psychological interest. When Solms
looked into it, though, it turned out that the key structure involved in
dreaming was actually the ventral tegmental, the same structure that
Panksepp had identified as the seat of the "seeking" emotion. Dreams, it
seemed, originate with the libido---which is just what Freud had
believed.

        [Freud's psychological map]{.underline} may have been flawed in
many ways, but it also [happens to be the most coherent
and]{.underline}, from the standpoint of individual
experience, [meaningful theory of the mind there is. "Freud should be
placed in the same category as Darwin, who lived before the discovery of
genes," says Panksepp. "Freud gave us a vision of a mental apparatus. We
need to talk about it, develop it, test it."]{.underline} Perhaps it's
not a matter of proving Freud wrong or right, but of finishing the job.

#### They have placed an emphasis on the final status of truth -- real science proceeds not through a pursuit of truth but through a sense of incompleteness which it relies on to test itself. Their writing out of psychoanalysis makes them the unscientific ones.

[Until recently most, but by no means all, philosophical work in
connection with Freud has been concerned with the question whether
Freud's work was scientific- whether it was testable, verifiable, or
falsifiable, in accordance with accepted scientific
procedure]{.underline}. Grünbaum (1984; 1993); Erwin (1996; 1993);
Macmillan (1997); Cioffi (1988; 1985); and others (cf. Robinson, 1993)
have been far less concerned with the significance and wide-ranging
philosophical implications of psychoanalytic theory, or even with the
truth of such theory, than with the nature and methods of science. (4)
[But arguably the scientific status of psychoanalysis has always been a
problem for the philosophy of science in general, rather than having any
intrinsic connection to psychoanalysis]{.underline}. [[What constitutes
a scientific theory]{.underline}]{.mark} (cf. Lear 1990: 216ff)? What
are appropriate scientific inductivist canons? (5) Furthermore, [**even
if psychoanalysis is not a "science"** given some agreed upon scientific
inductivist canons, **it may nevertheless be more or less true.**
**[Since a theory can be true without being scientific it is a mistake
to see psychoanalysis as false if not scientific]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Its support may come from various sources and considerations- both
theoretical and empirical. [Grünbaum's account of Freud's "Tally
Argument" shows that Freud himself was responsible for focusing so much
attention on the scientific status of his theories. Freud says that,
"After all, his \[the patient's\] conflicts will only be successfully
solved and his resistances overcome if the anticipatory ideas \[i.e.,
psychoanalytic interpretations\] he is given tally with what is real in
him. Whatever in the doctor's conjectures is inaccurate drops out in the
course of analysis. .it has to be withdrawn and replaced by something
more correct" (1917, XVI: 452). Grünbaum interprets this "as a
conjunction of the following two causally necessary conditions. (p. 1)
Only the psychoanalytic method of interpretation and treatment can yield
or mediate for the patient the correct insight into the unconscious
causes of his neuroses. (p. 2) The patient's correct insight into the
conflictual cause of his condition and into the unconscious dynamics of
his character is in turn causally necessary for the durable cure of his
neuroses" (1988:14). He refers to the conjunction of these claims as the
Necessary Condition Thesis. (6) Such claims appear subject to inductive
assessment in accordance with scientific (inductivist) canons, and
Freud's apparent adherence to the Necessary Condition Thesis suggests
that he agrees. (7)]{.underline} No doubt Freud believed his theories to
be scientific and testable to a degree. However, it should not be
overlooked that, whether or not he had sound and/or ulterior motives in
claiming scientific status for psychoanalysis, it was probably a good
thing for psychoanalysis that he did. It is unlikely that psychoanalysis
would have received the attention it did had it not associated itself
early on with the mystique of science in a scientistic age. [At any
rate, even a cursory reading of [Freud]{.mark} suggests that his
[theories were not]{.mark} [based solely on clinical data and
"evidence]{.mark}," [but also, and perhaps even more so, on his
observations of everyday life]{.mark}]{.underline}. He understood only
too well the presence of mitigating factors, and the difficulty of
achieving a psychoanalytic cure. Textual evidence notwithstanding, he
never strictly adhered to the Necessary Condition Thesis. Freud carried
his couch around with him. In psychoanalysis, like anything else, too
selective a reading-or too close a reading-can at times be as misleading
as the alternatives. What then is the evidence for the validity of
psychoanalytic theory? According to Hopkins, psychoanalytic explanation
is an extension of common sense or folk psychology. (8) The relevance of
thematic affinity (e.g., dreaming of drinking water when one is
thirsty)-how it supports Freud's theory-is crucial to Hopkins' defense
of psychoanalysis. He says that Grünbaum objects to the idea that claims
as to a causal connection between mental items can be cogently supported
by a connection in content-a "thematic affinity"-between them. He speaks
of "what might be dubbed 'the thematic affinity fallacy'," and appears
to reject the basing of causal claims on connection in content "no
matter how strong the thematic affinity." For, he stresses, "thematic
affinity alone does not vouch for etiologic linkage in the absence of
further evidence" \[34 \].(9) Grünbaum has made no case against the
view.that much of Freud's reasoning can be regarded as cogently
extending commonsense psychology. If Grünbaum has missed something about
connection between content and wish-fulfilment \[i.e., the significance
of thematic affinity\], and if what he has missed constitutes reason to
accept Freudian claims, then his conclusions systematically understates
the support for Freudian theory. (1988: 59) In addition and related to
instances of thematic affinity found in dreams and neurotic symptoms,
ordinary experience of the kinds Freud relied upon should not be
discounted in support of psychoanalysis. [Thus, [the view that our
strongest denials are often]{.mark} [affirmations]{.mark}; that [slips
of the tongue are (often) meaningful]{.mark}; that [individuals
regularly deploy]{.mark} a variety of [ego defence mechanisms]{.mark} at
their disposal- all are [Freudian insights]{.mark} that have now become
commonplace]{.underline}. [They [can ]{.mark}]{.underline}jointly [[be
taken as]{.mark} part of the [evidence for the truth of psychoanalytic
theory]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Together, they allegedly support
the inference that psychoanalytic explanations of these phenomena
are]{.underline} often [the most plausible ones]{.underline} (see Freud
1901). When judged against alternative explanations, psychoanalytic
explanations of phenomena like racism and sexism can also allegedly
support fundamental psychoanalytic truths. (10) Whether or not Woody
Allen's psychoanalysis reaches a successful conclusion is-except for
Woody- relatively unimportant. Prince states that "the primary and to my
mind insurmountable problem with basing general theories of
spectatorship on psychoanalysis is that such theories must remain
unsupported because psychoanalysis is a discipline without reliable
data" (1996: 72-73). However, [just as the hard science's notion of
falsifiablity is too narrow as applied to psychoanalysis), so too is
Prince's notion of "reliable data." They are too narrow given the kind
of "science" psychoanalysis is]{.underline}. Prince endorses Colby and
Stroller, who claim that "psychoanalytic evidence is hearsay, first when
the patient reports his or her version of an experience and second when
the analyst reports it to an audience. Reports on clinical findings are
mixtures of facts, fabulations, and fictives so intermingled that one
cannot tell where one begins and the other leaves off" (1988: 3, 29).
[This [charge of unreliable data is]{.mark} just [another way of
systematically rejecting the kinds of support for psychoanalysis that
are in fact available.]{.mark} The criticism falsely assumes that what
constitutes reliable and accurate psychoanalytic data and interpretation
is up for grabs- that there are no criteria for judging what is and is
not correct in psychoanalysis. Of course there is going to be
disagreement amongst theorists as to what those criteria are, both
generally and in specific cases. And of course those criteria are going
to be very different than the criteria for theoretical adequacy in, say,
the physical sciences. But the idea that psychoanalytic practice and
theory necessarily employ "unreliable data" is a roundabout way of
[failing to recognize what does constitute psychoanalytical data and
why]{.mark}]{.underline}. (11) [[Far from regarding his work as
final,]{.mark} Freud frequently reiterated that psychoanalysis has a
bright future regarding "further discoveries" about the individual,
civilization, and the connections between them. [Freud constantly
revised his theories in view of]{.mark} theoretical concerns and [new
data]{.mark}. Perhaps the most notorious example (recently notorious) is
[his revision of the seduction theory.]{.mark} Freud first claimed that
actual childhood seductions were the cause of various
neuroses]{.underline}. He later claimed that imagined seductions could
suffice in terms of the aetiology of neuroses- given all the other
conditions of susceptibility, instinctual endowment, etc. Wishful
phantasies of various sorts came to be considered important, including
phantasies of seductions (e.g., phantasies of parental intercourse).
Both the original and altered positions were heavily and vehemently
criticized, though for different reasons. Another example is [[Freud's
introduction of the death instinct]{.mark} in 1920 [to supplement
the]{.mark} sexual ([libidinous]{.mark}) [instinct]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The conflict between libido and ego-instincts becomes a conflict between
eros and the death instinct. There is also his revision of the account
of anxiety in 1926: first he thought that anxiety was transformed
libido; then he realized that (signal) anxiety was a reaction to threat
from the external world, the superego, and instinctual forces. [And then
there is Freud's change in topography from Uc.-Pcs.-Cs. to id, ego and
superego in 1923. Such revision-and the extent to which he revised truly
is striking-goes hand in hand with the falsification of earlier theory
and interpretation. So [aspects of Freud's theory were (and are) not
only falsifiable, but were indeed falsified, and recognized by Freud as
such.]{.mark} Subsequent developments in psychoanalysis build on aspects
of Freud's views without regarding those earlier views as sacrosanct.
The work of Melanie Klein, for example, and David Winnicott, accept as
well as revise aspects of Freud. The ongoing development of
psychoanalysis is indicative of the fact that it continues to be
revised, refined, and in many cases corrected. By its own light,
**aspects of psychoanalysis-even key aspects-are
falsifiable.**]{.underline} [**[The standards or criteria for
falsification are different for psychoanalytic theory]{.mark} than they
are, e.g., for physics. But even those in psychoanalysis who claim that
it is science have never claimed the standards to be the same**- or if
they did, they were confused and mistaken. If the demand for criteria of
falsification is a demand for criteria of the falsification of
psychoanalysis in its entirety, then this is different kind of demand
and standard. It is more akin to asking for criteria of falsification
not just for a theory or aspect of physics, but for physics per se. And
**it would seem that [there is no more readily acceptable standard of
falsification for physics]{.mark} per se [than there is for
psychoanalysis]{.mark} as such.**]{.underline}

[Psychoanalysis has developed greatly since Freud's time, producing
substantial research and productive connections to other branches of
science]{.underline}. [Many basic psychoanalytic propositions have been
widely accepted, such as the formative impact of early childhood
relationships on adult personality. Some of Freud's specific
propositions have been eclipsed by later formulations]{.underline} -- as
you would expect for bodies of knowledge evolving for more than a
century, and certainly for any science. [The basic idea of a dynamic
unconscious that actively shapes conscious experience and relations with
others has made productive connections with disciplines such as
neuroscience. Psychoanalysts have been testing the outcomes of
psychoanalytic therapies for decades, using randomised controlled trials
and systematic follow-up studies]{.underline}, as called for by Bunge in
his article. [Most trials have found **good evidence of the
effectiveness** of psychoanalytic therapies, when tested in the same way
as other approaches.]{.underline} Contrary to Bunge's assertion, studies
included in Jonathan Shedler's review of meta-analyses of therapeutic
outcomes of psychoanalytic therapy did, of course, have control groups
(American Psychologist, vol 65, p 98). The [54 signatories to this

[Anyone inclined to]{.underline} credit Bunge's [claim that
psychoanalysts are "foreign to the scientific community" should consider
examples. The psychoanalyst John Bowlby founded the burgeoning field of
attachment research partly to test hypotheses inspired by psychoanalysis
about the role of parents. The psychoanalyst Mark Solms has contributed
to the neuroscience of dreaming with research indicating that REM sleep
and dreaming are dissociable, and that dreams are caused not by the REM
mechanisms themselves but by basic motivational systems]{.underline}
which are common to all mammals and which arguably form the core of
emotion and emotional experience in human beings. **[Programmes linking
psychoanalysis and neuroscience]{.underline}** [were initiated by
analysts 20 years ago, and the journal Neuropsychoanalysis was
established in 1999 with an editorial board including leading
neuroscientists, cognitive scientists and psychoanalysts.]{.underline}
[For the past 10 years there have been yearly conferences at which
neuroscientists and psychoanalysts have presented research and discussed
areas of overlapping interest]{.underline} (video proceedings and other
information available at neuropsa.org.uk/npsa). [Psychoanalytic journals
publish contributions involving psychoanalysts and neuroscientists.
Leaders in neurophysiological research on depression have recently put
forward an explicitly Freudian model in the Annals of General
Psychiatry]{.underline} (vol 7, p 9). This year in Brain,
[neuroscientists Karl Friston and Robin Carhart-Harris undertake to
"demonstrate consistencies between key Freudian ideas and recent
perspectives on global brain function that have emerged in imaging and
theoretical neuroscience" to show "construct validity" for Freudian
concepts and enable "dialogue between psychoanalysts and
neurobiologists"]{.underline} (vol 133, p 1265). [Such
collaboration]{.underline} may, of course, contradict rather than
confirm psychoanalytic hypotheses, but it [is **enough to
falsify**]{.underline} Bunge's [claim that psychoanalysis should be seen
as pseudoscience]{.underline}. Or rather, it would be enough, if Bunge's
claim itself were subject to evidence, rather than abuse masquerading as
philosophy.

#### Even if we're unfalsifiable, who cares -- as long as we can develop some empathy or there's any possibility we can help each other, it's a reason why our method solves and is good

**Benvenuto 19** (Sergio Benvenuto - researcher for the Institute of
Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of the Italian National Research
Council in Rome and Professor Emeritus in Psychoanalysis at the
International Institute of Depth Psychology in Kiev, "CONVERSATIONS WITH
LACAN Seven Lectures for Understanding Lacan", Routledge, 6 December
2019,
<https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780429053757/conversations-lacan-sergio-benvenuto>,
MG)

[Today the key signifier of this syrup is "**empathy**]{.underline}."
Even in everyday life, we no longer say of someone that they're
"rotten," but that they "lack empathy." I think that deep in the
background, the success of "empathy" is the proof of a powerful return
of a certain type of philosophical phenomenology, also relaunched by a
particular variety of neuroscientific research (Francisco Varela, mirror
neurons, and so on). [This is often a vulgarized phenomenology,
summarized, for the benefit of psychotherapists, as follows: the
analyst, like anyone who offers herself as helper, must be **empathic**
towards patients, in the sense of trying to "**step into their shoes**."
The analyst must "understand" the other in the plain sense of the term,
like when we say "I understand why you want a divorce," meaning by this:
"if I were in your shoes, I'd want to send that whoremonger of a husband
of yours to hell too!"]{.underline} If we focus entirely on "stepping
into the patient's shoes," practically nothing distinguishes analysis
from a good friendship, and it just becomes something like an occasional
get-together between two friends at the pub to chat about their woes.
[In fact, we tend to prefer talking to "empathic" people, who somehow
respond to our joys and pains. Today the most successful psychoanalysis
is a "**pub get-together" psychoanalysis**.]{.underline}

I think that this kind of psychoanalysis, even when theorized with great
subtlety, is the symptom of a sort of disintegration of mainstream
psychoanalysis. With the term mainstream I refer to the most important
psychoanalytic institutions, excluding the Lacanian.

[For decades, scholars who don't believe in psychotherapies have said:
"When a psychotherapy does have curative effects, this is not due to the
psychotherapeutic theories themselves, but to the fact that a subject
has found someone who is haloed with the prestige of the specialist who
is actually listening to them and giving them empathy, attention, and
suchlike."]{.underline}

[In other words, all psychotherapies are a placebo, as there is no
"**active substance**" apart from this conviviality "that pleases." And,
indeed, it could be helpful to **systematically increase placebo effects
in medicine**. For example, with a little more empathy we could increase
the number of people recovering from illnesses thanks to plain water
from 40% to 50%. Why not?]{.underline}

Now, it seems to me that these relational and interpersonal currents
have fully accepted these criticisms. It's as if they were saying:
["**we admit it, there's nothing 'real'** at the basis of
psychoanalysis; it is merely an empathic relationship between two human
beings, in which one may help the other."]{.underline} We are witnessing
a placebation, if you will forgive me the horrendous neologism, of
analysis. This is why I believe that [relationism -- so popular today --
is a sign of the crisis of traditional psychoanalysis, under fire by the
scepticism towards any talking cure .]{.underline}

[I believe that this insistence on relation and empathy is a **sort of
return to where psychoanalysis began: hypnosis**]{.underline}. Before
psychoanalysis, Freud practiced the "cathartic method," with the use of
suggestion. "Hypnosis" and "empathy" are apparently opposites: [Hypnosis
is based on the fact that the curing subject imposes his will on the
hypnotized subject, whilst empathy is based on the fact that all of the
patient's feelings and life experiences are imposed on the
healer]{.underline}. The analyst embraces all of the former's
desiderata. [It's as if psychoanalysis has come full circle, capsizing
on itself. But hypnosis and empathic effects have one thing in common,
namely: that **one of the two subjects adapts to the will or feelings of
the other.**]{.underline}

Now, Lacan would have shown contempt for the "relational" approach,
though he was sometimes empathic himself; at the beginning of an
analysis a dose of empathy is a fine stimulus. [But real analysis begins
when this specific understanding between analyst and patient makes room
for something else]{.underline}. Allow me to give an example.

Some time ago I followed a young man who had embarked on a university
career in Italy. He would continuously condemn the pettiness, dullness,
and frauds of the Italian university world, which he considered
responsible for his failure to obtain tenure. Now, being quite
well-acquainted with Italian academic environments, I felt in total
empathy with what he was saying. I too had gone through the ordeal he
was describing. Like most when they start a psychotherapeutic
relationship (before becoming analysands), in me he was looking for a
conniving "specialist" who would say to him: "you're quite right! You're
dealing with some abominable characters!" [Most people "go into therapy"
wanting to buy your empathy; this is their demand. The wholesalers who
copiously supply the goods the patients are asking for -- approval,
solidarity, often even fondness -- remain at the level of connivance.
Whilst for Lacan, analysis begins when one moves from the reiteration of
the demande to a **sometimes unpleasant level,** that of désir.
Unpleasant, because according to Freud, we are truly horrified by our
desire.]{.underline}

Lacan conceptualizes this passage in Hegelian terms, as a dialectical
overcoming of the "beautiful soul," die schöne Seele. I shan't delve
into the full dialectics of the beautiful soul, but limit myself to what
is of interest to us here, [i.e. at a certain point **the analyst must
confront the patient** -- the client, in today's terminology, who has
come to purchase empathy from you -- with the following observation:
**"what was your own contribution to the decay you are
decrying**?"]{.underline} But this means the suspension of empathy at
the risk of being disliked by the patient.

[Now, it was precisely by abandoning my empathy towards the aspiring
tenured professor that I gradually began to help him realize that the
academic defeats he kept falling victim to were somehow of his own
making. That he was basically doing everything he could to make the
powerful reject him. Why? The analysis had now begun to focus on this
question. But for it to emerge, I had to set my empathy aside -- my
knowledge that all the Italian academic decay he complained about was
perfectly true.]{.underline}

In addition to empathy, another somewhat opposite prescription is
popular today, particularly in Italy: Bion's "suspension of memory and
desire" by the analyst. A slogan that seems to me to be just as dubious
as the appeal to empathy. Because if analysts completely suspended
memory and desire, they would become like a camera -- according to
Freud, [we are human because **we desire and remember**. It's true that
analysts should suspend certain desires and certain memories, but **not
all.** It's crucial that analysts burn with a specific desire: the
desire to analyze. It is thanks to the fact that patients are infected
by this desire that they connect in transference and become analysands.
And analysts should have memories of certain aspects, for example, of
everything that keeps repeating itself in the lives of their
analysands.]{.underline}

[Psychoanalysis works when it steers clear of **both the Scylla of
reducing analysis to an empathic relationship and the Charybdis of
stripping its own flesh**, which relegates the analyst to being outside
the world of desirers and rememberers.]{.underline}

There should also be "empathic" phases of course, because analysis is
never pure, it is always seasoned with a dose of psychotherapy, i.e.
with relations of favouritism. [But analysts, if they can really call
themselves that, hope something else will emerge **beyond the
"relation**," i.e. the structure of the symptom, which for Lacan is
everyone's specific way of enjoying.]{.underline}

**[[Conclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}** What have we gained in our
assessment of the Lacanian idea of racism as enjoyment? Well,
[[we]{.mark} have **been able to [offer]{.mark} a series of [responses
to the]{.mark} [four]{.mark} basic [critiques]{.mark}** highlighted in
the opening sections of this paper]{.underline}. [[In **respect of the
first** ]{.mark}**critique** (of psychological reductionism), [we
have]{.mark}]{.underline}, I hope, [[taken]{.mark} a **series of
decisive [steps]{.mark}** [away from thinking jouissance]{.mark} [within
the]{.mark} **domain of the [psychological]{.mark}**.]{.underline} I
have asserted that in its varying social formations [[jouissance
is]{.underline}]{.mark}---paradoxically enough---[[more]{.mark} a
[sociological]{.mark} [than]{.mark} a [psychological]{.mark} concept.
Once we grasp that enjoyment does not float free of the socio-historical
context and that it is necessarily grounded in a particular
socio-Symbolic matrix of laws and social ideals, then we have to reject
the idea that enjoyment is reducible to a psychological dynamic of
resentment]{.underline}. [Any viable analytical reference to the notion
of jouissance should then of necessity be tied to the Symbolic domain
from within which it has arisen.]{.underline} It is however true that
the "racism as theft of enjoyment" thesis is often deployed in ways
(this is typical of Žižek's work) that are glaringly inattentive to
socio-economic and historical detail. This much I concede: such
[illustrative descriptions of the concept should entail more by way of
nuance and empirical texture]{.underline}. Analytical application should
particularize these concepts, investigate how they might appear in
highly distinctive fields of analysis, rather than summarily generalize
across empirical contexts. That being said, I have nevertheless
suggested that [[the]{.mark} "[formalist" quality]{.mark} of this
Lacanian thesis [may]{.mark} in fact [be **viewed an analytical
asset**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, [as a variable of a social
analysis, enjoyment must surely remain empty of essential contents
precisely because of the malleability of jouissance in differing
historical and cultural contexts?]{.underline} Indeed, [[this
was]{.mark} one of the **[response]{.mark}s [to]{.mark} [the
second]{.mark} of the critiques** offered above (enjoyment as
conceptually under-differentiated, over-inclusive]{.underline}): yes,
jouissance can refer to virtually any object or activity, so long as it
has taken on libidinal value. We can argue that this [**apparent
[over-inclusiveness]{.mark}** [proves a crucial]{.mark}
anti-essentialist [dimension]{.mark} of the concept of
jouissance]{.underline}. The racism as (theft of) enjoyment thesis
should, accordingly, be used as an empty thesis that must of necessity
be anchored in empirical detail. So, rather than operating as an
all-subsuming, "one size fits all" trans-historical formula, [the [idea
of racism as]{.mark} (the [theft of) enjoyment should be]{.mark}
treated]{.underline} precisely as hypothetical, [as an
[exploratory]{.mark} device that focuses our attentions on specific
facets of the analytical field]{.underline}. [One prospective use of the
thesis is precisely as a heuristic device, a provisional analytical
frame that challenges the analyst of racism to identify the various
interconnected components of a prospective libidinal
economy]{.underline} (the superegoic functioning of law, the narrative
frame of ideological fantasy, various instantiations of object petit a
such as the threatened libidinal treasure, the presumed "thief of
jouissance," etc.). [**[Moving]{.mark} on [to the third]{.mark} of my
critiques**, [I have distinguished between **different modes**]{.mark}
**of enjoyment** ([jouissance as bodily intensity]{.mark}, [libidinal
treasure, and surplus vitality]{.mark} of the other) and
explained]{.underline}, via the concept of object petit a, [how
jouissance can at once refer to presumed narcissistic]{.underline} (and,
indeed, phallic) [possession and to a fantasy of dispossession by a
thieving other]{.underline}. **[[Responding to the fourth]{.mark}
critique]{.underline}** noted above ([that jouissance is often used in a
conceptually decontextualized manner]{.underline}) [[I have linked the
idea of jouissance to]{.mark} a set of [related psychoanalytic
concepts]{.mark}]{.underline} (the drive, fantasy, castration, the
phallus, object a[), [placing it]{.mark} thus [on a conceptual horizon
that allows us to apply the term]{.mark} in a way that is]{.underline}
more [rigorous]{.underline}---and arguably more nuanced---than is often
the case. [A number of [associated qualifications]{.mark} ([such
as]{.mark} that [enjoyment]{.mark} must be conceived [in]{.mark}
[relation to the **law**]{.mark}**/superego**, [that jouissance arises
from the signifier]{.mark}) [have]{.mark}]{.underline}, furthermore,
[[lent definition]{.mark}2 to the concept of jouissance as an analytical
tool.]{.underline} For many of course, analytical problems persist.
[Some would claim that even such an empty and ostensibly
"de-essentialized" exploratory thesis presumes too much. We can
anticipate the argument: the pattern of libidinal dynamics implied by
this thesis (]{.underline}the resented thief of jouissance, the precious
stolen object, the robbed subject, etc.) inevitably [impedes the work of
a more textured sociological analysis.]{.underline} Such is the position
of Engelken-Jorge (2010) who argues that [Lacanian theories of enjoyment
involve a recurring "psychologistic bias that impoverishes the
sociological imagination"]{.underline} (69). While I have tried to show
that this need not necessarily be the case, I nonetheless appreciate
Engelken-Jorge's point. This line of critiques suggest that Lacanian
theorizations of enjoyment may not suffice without additional
methodological and theoretical resources, without greater
sociohistorical and empirical contextualization. True enough. Let me add
just this: [[if it is the case that libidinal enjoyment]{.mark} is what
most powerfully [binds subjects to]{.mark} a given
[ideology]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dean 2006; Stavrakakis, 2007; Žižek
2002)---[[then **to neglect this variable**]{.mark} in favor of
apparently more detailed and contextualized historical or socio-economic
analyses **[is to make a serious error of
omission]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More bluntly put[**, [to]{.mark}
[omit]{.mark} analytical [attentions to jouissance]{.mark}** is to
**[risk not having understood]{.mark}** the **[psychical and historical
tenacity of racism.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### AT: No Scale-Up

#### There's difference between structuralism and essentialism \-\-- realism and positivist theories of IR reduce the social to the individual level far more than psychoanalysis 

**Epstein 10** \[Charlotte Epstein, Government and International
Relations at the University of Sydney, NSW, Australia, "Who speaks?
Discourse, the subject and the study of identity in international
politics," *International Relations*: 17(2), p. 327--350, 2010\]

A non-essentialist social theory of identity that accounts for the role
of agency [How]{.underline}, then, [is Lacan's understanding of identity
non-essentialist? The key distinction here is between 'structuralism'
and 'essentialism'. Lacan's thought is structuralist, insofar as he
develops an understanding of the human psyche as a dynamic, symbolic
structure]{.underline}.6 [It is not, however, grounded in some quest for
the true human essence or nature]{.underline}. In the words of Yannis
Stavrakakis (1999: 36) '[the object of Lacanian psychoanalysis is not
the individual, it is not man]{.underline} \[sic\]. [It is what he is
lacking]{.underline}.' **[Consequently]{.underline}**, **[Lacan also
avoids the 'essentialist reductionism of the social to the individual
level']{.underline}** (Stavrakakis, 1999: 3). In other words, [Lacan
steers clear of the methodological individualism that characterizes most
attempts at developing social theories that are premised]{.underline}
[on the possibility of a cohesive, pre-social self, including that
of]{.underline} Alexander [Wendt]{.underline} (see also Wight, 2004).
Notwithstanding Wendt's (1999: 227) claim that his recourse to role
identities, in particular, allows him to 'take the dependency on culture
and thus Others one step further', his insistence on a core self
underlying the different social roles thus taken (professor, student)
places important limits on being able to capture the centrality of
self--other relations to the making of identities. Lacan's analysis, by
contrast, goes the full length towards showing how the dependence on the
Other, that is, on the social or symbolic order, is central to the
making of the self.

To return to the core question of this article, how to study identity in
international politics, Laca[n's ontology undermines the constructivist
approach insofar as it uproots the notion of a pre-social self on which
that approach is premised.]{.underline} In that sense, then, it
validates post-structuralist analyses that foreground identity just as
centrally without harbouring essentialist assumptions. However,
rehabilitating post-structuralist approaches alone is insufficient if it
is only to ignore constructivism's valid criticism regarding the
question of agency. What remains valid in particular is Wendt's
injunction to develop a structurationist social theory of international
politics, that is, one that can also account for the ways in which the
actors shape the structures that in turn shape them. Thus an important
advantage of the [Lacanian perspective is that his analysis of
subjectivity does not evacuate agency, because of the central role he
grants to desire, that other pillar of individual identities, alongside
language. In this sense it adds an important corrective to the
Foucauldian understanding of the ways in which the subject is created
through subjection to power]{.underline} (see also Butler, 1997).

### AT: Permutation

#### Give us the ballot as payment for services rendered -- the Aff must pay to make passage to the Act possible

**Zizek 8** \[Slavoj, International Director of the Birkbeck Institute
for the Humanities at University of London, Senior Researcher at the
Institute of Sociology at University of Llubljana, the Elvis of cultural
theory, former candidate for Slovenian presidency, *For They Know Not
What They Do*, p.xxxviii-xlii\]

Here, however, Lacan\'s statements on psychoanalysis and money, and on
the anticapitalist nature of psychoanalysis, are to be taken
seriously.41 Consider Jacques-Alain Miller\'s joke about how, in
psychoanalytic treatment, exploitation works even better than it does in
capitalism: in capitalism, the capitalist pays the worker who works for
him, and thus produces profit; while in psychoanalysis, the patient pays
the analyst in order to be able to work himself\... In psychoanalysis,
therefore, we have an intersubjective money relationship in which all
parameters of exchange break down. The key point is: [why does the
patient pay the analyst?]{.underline} The standard answer (so that the
analyst stays outside the libidinal circuit, uninvolved in the imbroglio
of passions) is correct, but insufficient. We should definitely exclude
\"goodness\": [if the psychoanalyst is perceived as good, as doing the
patient a favour, everything is bound to go wrong.]{.underline} We
should, however, tackle a further question: how does the patient
subjectivize his paying? This is where the logic of exchange breaks
down: if we remain within the parameters of \"tit for tat\" (so much for
an interpretation of a dream, so much for the dissolution of a symptom),
we get nowhere. \"Paying the price for services rendered\" contains the
analysis within the limits of avarice (it is easy to imagine a further
acceleration of this logic: pay for two interpretations, and get a third
one free\...)• What is bound to happen sooner or later is that the
analysis gets caught in the paradigmatic obsessional economy in which
the patient is paying the analyst so that nothing will happen - so that
the analyst will tolerate the patient\'s babbling without any subjective
consequences. On the other hand, [there is nothing more catastrophic
than a psychoanalyst acting out of charity (\"goodness\") to help the
patient]{.underline}; if anything, [this is the most effective way of
turning a \"normal\" neurotic into a paranoiac psychotic.]{.underline}
Is the answer to be found, then, in the shift from having to being,
along the lines of Lacan\'s definition of love as an act in which one
gives not what one has, but what one doesn\'t have - that is to say,
what one is? The gesture of giving one\'s being can also be a false
(megalomaniac or suicidal) one - witness Nietzsche\'s final megalomaniac
madness, whose structure is strictly homologous to the suicidal passage
a I\'acter. in both cases, the subject offers himself (his being) as the
object that fills, in the Real, the constitutive gap of the symbolic
order - that is, the lack of the big Other. That is to say, the key
enigma of Nietzsche\'s final madness is: why did Nietzsche have to
resort to what cannot fail to appear to us as ridiculous
self-aggrandizing (recall the chapters tides in his Ecce homo: \"Why I
am so wise\", \"Why I am so bright\", up to \"Why I am a destiny\")?
This is an inherent philosophical deadlock, which has nothing whatsoever
to do with any private pathology: his inability to accept the
nonexistence of the big Other. Within these co-ordinates, suicide occurs
when the subject perceives that the megalomaniac solution does not
work.4 2 As Lacan emphasized, one cannot analyse the rich, for whom
paying does not matter. So [there has to be payment, a price paid - it
must hurt.]{.underline}4 3 What, however, does one get for it? The
analysis proper begins when one accepts the payment as a purely
arbitrary expenditure. [By paying for nothing, by engaging in pure
expenditure, the patient gets back that for which there is no price -
the objet petit a, the cause of desire, that which can emerge only as a
pure excess of Grace.]{.underline} The vicious circle of thrift is thus
doubly broken: the patient does something totally meaningless within the
horizon of the capitalist logic of consumption/accumulation, and
receives in exchange the pure surplus itself. [The Lacanian name for
this gesture of breaking the vicious cycle of the superego is
act]{.underline}, and the lack of a clear elaboration of the notion of
act in its relation to fantasy is perhaps the key failing of The Sublime

#### The perm is the purest form of ideological disavowal, functionally saying "I know very well that the Aff links, but nevertheless I'll act as if it doesn't." Even if the perm is technically true in the sense that it is hypothetically possible to do the Aff and the K, the perm is still a lie because it is a rationalization that is unable to incorporate into its symbolic universe the implication of the critique.

[This predominance of the superego over the law disturbs the
relationship of knowledge and belief that determines our everyday
ideological horizon]{.underline}: the gap between (real) knowledge and
(symbolic) belief. We can illustrate it with the well-known
psychological experience of [when we say]{.underline} of something (as a
rule terrible, traumatic) [\"I know that it is so, but nevertheless I
can\'t believe it\": **the traumatic knowledge of reality remains
outside the Symbolic, the symbolic articulation continues to operate as
if we do not know**, and the \"time for understanding\" is necessary for
this knowledge to be integrated into our symbolic
universe.]{.underline}2 3 [This kind of gap between knowledge and
belief]{.underline}, in so far as both are \"conscious\", [attests to a
psychotic split, a \"disavowal of reality\"]{.underline}; propositions
of this type are what linguistic analysis calls \"pragmatic paradoxes\".
Let us take, for example, the statement \"I know that there is no mouse
in the next room, but nevertheless I believe that there is a mouse
there\": this statement is not logically irreconcilable - since there is
no logical contradiction between \"there is no mouse in the next room\"
and \"I believe there is a mouse in the next room\" - the contradiction
comes only on the pragmatic level, in so far as we take into account the
position of the subject of the enunciation of this proposition: the
subject who knows that there is no mouse in the next room cannot at the
same time, without contradiction, believe that there is a mouse there.
In other words, the subject who believes this is a split subject. [The
\"normal\" solution to this contradiction is of course that we repress
the other moment, the belief, in our unconscious]{.underline}: in its
place enters some spare moment which is not in contradiction to the
first - [this is the logic of so-called \"rationalization\". Instead of
the direct split \"I know that the Jews are guilty of nothing, but
nevertheless\... (I believe that they are guilty)\" comes the statement
of the type \"I know that the Jews are guilty of nothing; however, the
fact is that in the development of capitalism, the Jews, as the
representatives of financial and business capital, have usually profited
from the productive labour of others\"]{.underline}; instead of the
direct split \"I know that there is no God, but nevertheless\... (I
believe that there is)\" appears a statement of the type \"I know that
there is no God, but I respect religious ritual and take part in it
because this ritual supports ethical values and encourages brotherhood
and love among people.\" [Such statements are **good examples of what
might be called \"lying by way of the truth\": the second part of the
statement, the claim which follows the syntagm \"but nevertheless\...
\", can on a factual level be largely accurate but nevertheless operates
as a lie because in the concrete symbolic context in which it appears it
operates as a ratification of the unconscious belief** that the Jews are
nevertheless guilty]{.underline}, that God nevertheless exists, and so
on - without taking into account these \"investments\" of the
unconscious belief, the functioning of such statements remains totally
incomprehensible. [One of the greatest masters of this was the Stalinist
\"dialectical materialism\", the basic achievement of which, **when it
was necessary to legitimize some pragmatic political measure which
violated theoretical principles, was \"in principle it is of course so;
nevertheless, in the concrete circumstances\... \": the infamous
\"analysis of concrete circumstances\" is basically nothing other than a
search for rationalization which attempts to justify the violation of a
principle.** This gap between]{.underline} (real) [knowledge
and]{.underline} (symbolic[) belief determines our everyday ideological
attitude: \"I know that there is no God, but nevertheless, I operate as
if]{.underline} (I believe that) [he exists\"]{.underline} - the part in
brackets is repressed (belief in a God whom we witness through our
activity is unconscious).

### AT: Psychoanalysis Bad---Eurocentric

#### The claim that psychoanalysis is Eurocentric links to itself -- it reestablishes the authority of the speaking subject. The "diversity" of the other is becomes a fetish object that preserves the identity of our own subjective position.

**Zizek 08** \[Slavoj, International Director of the Birkbeck Institute

This kernel of the Real encircled by failed attempts to
symbolize-totalize it is radically non-historical: history itself is
nothing but a succession of failed attempts to grasp, conceive, specify
this strange kernel. This is why, [far from rejecting the reproach that
psychoanalysis is non-historical, one has to acknowledge it fully and
thus simply transform it from a reproach into a positive theoretical
proposition]{.underline}, therein consists the difference between
hysteria and psychosis: hysteria/history is more than a trivial word
game - hysteria is the subject\'s way of resisting the prevailing,
historically specified form of interpellation or symbolic
indentification. Hysteria means failed interpellation, it means that the
subject in the name of that which is \"in him more than himself\" - the
object in himself - refuses the mandate which is conferred on him in the
symbolic universe; as such, it falls conditional with the dominant form
of symbolic identification - that is, it is its reverse; while
psychosis, the maintenance of an external distance from the symbolic
order, is "unhistorical\" - that is, on the level of psychosis it is not
difficult for us to pose equality between psychotic outbursts reported
in classical sources, and contemporary clinical cases. The act qua
\"psychotic\" in this sense is ahistorical. However, [an ahistoric
kernel of the Real is present also in history]{.underline}/hysteria:
[the ultimate mistake of historicism in which all historical content is
\"relativized\", made dependent on "historical
circumstances\",]{.underline} - that is to say, of historicism as
opposed to historicity - [is that it evades the encounter with the
Real.]{.underline} Let us take the usual attitude of the university
discourse towards the great \"Masters of Thought\" of our century -
towards Heidegger, towards Lacan: its first compulsion is to carry out
an arrangement of their theoretical edifices into \"phases\": Heidegger
I (Being and Time) in contrast to Heidegger II (\"thought of Being\");
phenomenologically Hegelian Lacan of the 1950s, then structuralist
Lacan, then the Lacan of the \"logic of the Real\". In such an
arrangement there is of course some pacifying effect, the thought is
rendered transparent, properly classified\... but we have nevertheless
lost something with such a disposition into \"phases\": we have actually
lost what is crucial, the encounter with the Real. We have lost (with
Heidegger) the fact that Heidegger\'s various phases are only so many
attempts to grasp, to indicate, to \"encircle\", the same kernel, the
\"Thing of thought\" which he constantly tackles, dodges and returns to.
2 The paradox is thus that historicity differs from historicism by the
way it presupposes some traumatic kernel which endures as \"the same\",
non-historical; and so various historical epochs are conceived as failed
attempts to capture this kernel. [The trouble with the alleged
\"Eurocentricity\" of psychoanalysis is homologous. Today it is a
commonplace to draw attention to the way]{.underline} Freud\'s myth in
Totem and Taboo is based on the Eurocentric anthropology of his time:
[the anthropologies on which Freud relied were \"unhistorical\"
projections of the modern patriarchal family and society into primeval
times]{.underline} - it was only on this basis that Freud could
construct the myth of the \"primeval father\". A breakthrough was only
later achieved with Malinowski, Mead, and others who demonstrated how
sexual life in primitive societies was organized in a completely
different way, how we cannot therefore talk about an \"Oedipus
complex\", how inhibition and anxiety were not associated with
sexuality. [Things thus appear clear, we know where we are, where the
\"primitives\" are; we have not reduced the Other, we have preserved its
diversity,.. nevertheless such historicizing is false: in the simple
distinction between our own and past societies we avoid calling into
question our own position, the place from which we ourselves speak. The
fascinating \"diversity\" of the Other functions as a fetish by means of
which we are able to preserve the unproblematic identity of our
subjective position: although we pretend to \"historically relativize\"
our position, we actually conceal its split; we deceive ourselves as to
how this position is already \"decentred from within\".]{.underline}
What Freud called the \"Oedipus complex\" is such an \"unhistorical\"
traumatic kernel (the trauma of prohibition on which the social order is
based) and the miscellaneous historical regulations of sexuality and
society are none other than so many ways (in the final analysis always
unsuccessful) of mastering this traumatic kernel. [To \"understand the
Other\" means to pacify it, to prevent the meeting with the Other from
becoming a meeting with the Real that undermines our own position. We
come across the Real as that which \"always returns to its place\" when
we identify with the Real in the Other]{.underline} - that is to say:
when we recognize in the deadlock, hindrance, because of which the Other
failed, our own hindrance, that which is \"in us more than ourselves\".3
[Much more subversive than \"entering the spirit of the past\" is thus
in contrast the procedure by which we consciously treat it
\"anti-historically\", \"reduce the past to the present\".]{.underline}
Brecht made use of this procedure in The Affairs of Mr Julius Caesar,
where Caesar\'s rise to power is presented in twentieth-century
capitalist terms: Caesar is concerned with stock market movements and
speculation with capital he organizes Fascist-style \"spontaneous\"
demonstrations of the lumpenproletariat, and so on. Such a procedure
could be brought to self-reference when the contemporary image of the
past is projected into the past. So, today, pre-Socratic times are known
only in fragments which have survived a turbulent history; we thus
inadvertently forget that Heraclitus and Parmenides did not write
\"fragments\" but long, verbose philosophical poems. So it would really
be some kind of subversive philosophical humour if we were to represent
Heraclitus, let us say, as saying: \"I can\'t write any good fragments
today!\" (or, on another level, the unknown sculptor of Milos saying: "I
can\'t break the arm off my Venus today!\"). Relying on a similar
"reductionist\", \"unhistorical\" procedure, Adorno\'s and Horkheimer's
Dialectic of Enlightenment4 reads The Odyssey retroactively, from the
experience of contemporary technical-instrumental reason: of course,
such a procedure is \"unhistorical\"; however, precisely through the
feeling of the absurd which it awakens in us, it opens actual historical
distance to us (just as with Hegel\'s claim \"the Spirit is a bone\",
where the real effect of the absurd contradiction is the discord that it
awakens in the reader).

#### Universal openness is rooted in Western modernity

This notion of civility is at the very heart of the impasses of
multiculturalism. A couple of years ago, there was a debate in Germany
about Leäkultur (the dominant culture): [against abstract
multiculturalism, conservatives insisted that every state is based on a
predominant cultural space which the members of other cultures who live
in the same space should respect. Although liberal leftists attacked
this notion as covert racism]{.underline}, one should admit that, if
nothing else, [it offers an adequate description of the facts. Respect
of individual freedoms and rights]{.underline}, even if at the expense
of group rights, [full emancipation of women, freedom of religion (and
of atheism) and sexual orientation, freedom to publicly attack anyone
and anything, are central constituent elements of Western
liberal]{.underline} Leitkultur [\[culture\], and this can be used to
respond to those Muslim theologians in Western countries who protest
against their treatment, while accepting it as normal that
in]{.underline}, say, [Saudi Arabia, it is prohibited to practice
publicly religions other than Islam. They should accept that the
same]{.underline} Leitkultur [\[culture\] which allows their religious
freedom in the West, demands of them a respect for all other
freedoms.]{.underline} To put it succinctly: [freedom for Muslims is
part and parcel of the freedom for Salman Rushdie to write what he wants
---you cannot choose the part of Western freedom which suits you. The
answer to the standard critical argument that Western multiculturalism
is not truly neutral, that it privileges specific values, is that one
should shamelessly accept this paradox: Universal openness itself is
rooted in Western modernity.]{.underline} And, to avoid any
misunderstanding, [the same applies to Christianity itself.]{.underline}
On May 2, 2007, L'Osservatore Romano, [the Vatican\'s official
newspaper, accused]{.underline} Andrea Rivera, [an Italian comedian, of
\"terrorism\" for criticizing the pope.]{.underline} As a presenter of a
televised May Day rock concert, Rivera attacked the pope\'s position on
evolution (\"The pope says he doesn\'t believe in evolution. I agree, in
fact the Church has never evolved.\") He also criticized the Church for
refusing to give a Catholic funeral to Piergiorgio Welby, a victim of
muscular dystrophy who campaigned for euthanasia and died in December
2006 after a doctor agreed to unplug his respirator (\"I can\'t stand
the fact that the Vatican refused a funeral for Welby but that wasn\'t
the case for Pinochet or Franco\"). Here is the Vatican\'s reaction:
\"This, too, is terrorism. It\'s terrorism to launch attacks on the
Church. It\'s terrorism to stoke blind and irrational rage against
someone who always speaks in the name of love, love for life and love
for man.\" [It is the underlying equation of intellectual critique with
physical terrorist attacks which brutally violates the West
European]{.underline} Leitkultur [\[culture\], which insists on the
universal sphere of the \"public use of reason,\" where one can
criticize and problematize everything]{.underline}--- in the eyes of our
shared Leitkulture, Rivera's statements are totally acceptable. Civility
is crucial here: multicultural freedom also functions only when it is
sustained by the rules of civility, which are never abstract, but always
embedded within a Leitkidtur. Within our Leltkultur, it is not Rivera
but L\'Osservatore Roimino which is \"terroristic\" with its dismissal
of Rivera\'s simple and reasonable objections as expressions of \"blind
and irrational rage. \" [Freedom of speech functions when all parties
follow the same unwritten rules of civility telling us what kind of
attacks are improper, although they are not legally
prohibited;]{.underline} civility tells us which features of a specific
ethnic or religious \" way of life\" are acceptable and which are not
acceptable. [If all sides do not share or respect the same civility,
then multiculturalism turns into legally regulated mutual ignorance or
hatred. One of the Lacanian names for this civility is the
"Master-Signifier,\" the set of rules grounded only in
themselves]{.underline} (\"it is so because it is so, because it is our
custom\")---and it is this dimension of the Master-Signifier which is
more and more threatened in our societies.

### AT: Psychoanalysis Bad---Racist

#### Lacanian psychoanalysis provides critical and unique insights into the production of racialized identity -- critiques of Lacan's failures as an individual do not indict the value of his critical toolbox for understanding and critiquing racism.

**Seshadri-Crooks 2000** \[Kalpana, Assistant Prof of English at Boston
College, *Desiring Whiteness: A Lacanian Analysis of Race*, p.2-3\]

I suggest that [Lacan's theory of subject constitution provides us with
cognitive landmarks]{.underline} or positions [by which to bring the
subject of race into representation. Lacan's provocative
thesis]{.underline} that the unconscious is structured like a language
and the general precision of his "anti-system" seemed to [provide the
requisite tools and a language with which to explore and delineate the
subject's acquisition of racial identity.]{.underline} My use of
Lacanian psychoanalysis is not a passive "application of Lacanian
concepts to issues of race." I have tried to work with the richest
aspects of the theory, and in the process have found it necessary to
wrestle with it, and to exert considerable force in inducing it to
address race. However, [the "appropriation" of Lacan that follows does
not take the expected form of ideological revision. I have deliberately
avoided the customary ideological "critique" of Lacan, nor do I press
the obligatory charge against him for neglecting the all-important issue
of race]{.underline} in a France that was, at the moment of his
theoretical elaboration, involved in a bloody colonial and racist war
against the Algerians. [Attention to the person of Lacan and his
political responsibility in failing to detail a theory of race is not
relevant to my project.]{.underline}2 [It seems much more important to
stay focused on the question of race itself, and to derive some insight
into the issues rather than to be distracted by an essentially academic
argument about the "politics of psychoanalysis."]{.underline} The
evident fealty I demonstrate to Lacanian psychoanalysis derives from my
belief that first, in its consistency and precision[, Lacanian theory
offers a vocabulary of linguistic deciphering in relation to subject
constitution that is simply unavailable elsewhere]{.underline}; and
second, it is important to remain tenacious in one's intellectual
pursuit, here the interrogation of the mystique of "race." Where race is
concerned too much energy is spent on talking about how we talk about
race; thus with the clamor of voices sounding off on political
correctness, hate speech, the rights of representation, etc., very
little attention is devoted to analyzing what race is and why we need
it.3

#### Despite the racist history of psychoanalysis, there can and should be a productive dialogue between black scholarship and the psychoanalytic account of visibility

**Tuhkanen 09** \[Mikko, Prof of English and Africana Studies at Texas
A&M, The American Optic, p.xi-xxii\]

[This study argues for the benefit of psychoanalysis in rethinking
race]{.underline} as a visible category. Engaging African American
literary and theoretical texts with Jacques Lacan's work, [it asks what
happens when we interrogate "the American optic"]{.underline} (Baldwin,
"Last" 210) [through what Lacanian theory teaches us about the role of
the visible and the scopic drive in the constitution of the human
subject.]{.underline} Subsequently, it proposes a shift in race theory,
arguing that [the visibility of race does not merely assign the subject
a social category or discipline one's mobility in society but may have
an ontological status]{.underline}: in certain symbolic configurations,
the subject's emergence, taking place through the visible, may involve
"racialization." The benefit of such a shift is twofold. First, [with
the psychoanalytic understanding of the visible, one can better
delineate not only the ways in which racialization functions, and is
contested, in historically specific symbolic orders but also why race
remains an indelible category of identification]{.underline} and
politics even after critical race theory has demonstrated the
groundlessness of most racial categorizations.2 Second, [by engaging
psychoanalysis in a dialogue with African American literature and
culture, we can open]{.underline} what Houston Baker, Jr., identifies as
[the "scholarly double bind"]{.underline}---our being constrained by
questions and paradigms that, with teleological predictability, guide
our work to certain conclusions (Modernism 12--13)---[and locate "a
signifying device sufficiently unusual in its connotations to shatter
familiar conceptual determinations"]{.underline} (Blues 144). That is,
[through the dialogue between psychoanalytic and African American texts,
we are able to revisit, to cast an awry look on, moments in African
American literary history that may have been evacuated of their
potential for newness.]{.underline} I suggest that Richard Wright's work
is one such site.3 What we know of Wright's biography supports a
psychoanalytic approach to his work. His association with the
psychoanalysts Frederic Wertham and Benjamin Karpman, as well as the
texts found in his library---among them books by Karl Abraham, Helene
Deutsch, Otto Fenichel, Sandor Ferenczi, Anna Freud, Sigmund Freud,
Ernest Jones, Melanie Klein, Th eodor Reik, and Géza Roheim---attest to
his familiarity with psychoanalysis.4 According to one biographer, he
remained "intensely Freudian"---indeed, "obsessed with psychoanalysis"
(M. Walker 286, 245)---throughout his literary and philosophical
career.5 Yet, proposing a dialogue between Wright and psychoanalysis
invokes inevitable methodological problems. [Given that psychoanalysis
often comes to us as yet another one of the master's tools, is it
possible to approach questions of race from a psychoanalytic
perspective?]{.underline} More specifically, considering
psychoanalysis's historical ties to the discourses of the unprecedented
colonial expansion of late-nineteenth-century Europe, as well as the
seeming irrelevance of late-twentieth-century Lacanianism to the
concerns of African American culture, how are we to open a dialogue
between Lacan and Wright, to introduce Jacques to Richard, as I propose
to do here? In terms of psychoanalysis's relation to Wright's work,
nothing may be more decisive than the fact that his writings have been
seen as a precursor to the militant black movements of the 1960s and was
adopted by numerous Black Panthers and Black Muslims as the emblem of
black male rage.6 That psychoanalysis was among the "white" solutions to
be rejected in favor of more authentic African American approaches is
mediated by Eldridge Cleaver, who recalls his encounters with a prison
psychiatrist in Soul on Ice (1968): I had several sessions with a
psychiatrist. His conclusion was that I hated my mother. How he arrived
at this conclusion I'll never know, because he knew nothing about my
mother; and when he'd ask me questions I would answer him with absurd
lies. What revolted me about him was that he had heard me denouncing the
whites, yet each time he interviewed me he deliberately guided the
conversation back to my family life, to my childhood. That in itself was
all right, but he deliberately blocked all my attempts to bring out the
racial question, and he made it clear that he was not interested in my
attitude toward whites. This was a Pandora's box he did not care to
open. (11) Suggesting the bad faith that informs psychoanalysis's
encounter with politics, Cleaver articulates African American writers'
and thinkers' distrust of such white disciplines. In the prison
psychiatrist, he offers us the stereotypical image of a (psycho)analyst
who imposes family romances on everything and hears repressed Oedipal
secrets in every word communicated by the analysand, while remaining
stubbornly blind to the life-and-death concerns of the latter's everyday
existence. As Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari write, there remains "a
fundamental relation to the outside of which the psychoanalyst washes
his hands, too attentive to seeing that his clients play nice games"
(Anti-Oedipus 356). Consequently, psychoanalysis appears for Cleaver not
only irrelevant but directly oppressive: concertedly disregarding
cultural and political specificity, it ignores the reality of
disenfranchisement. Cleaver makes a telling comparison in that,
immediately before recounting the above dismal scene, he writes of his
first encounter with Wright's work: "In Richard Wright's Native Son, I
found Bigger Thomas and a keen insight into the problem \[of black men's
desire for white women\]" (10). Whereas the psychiatrist will not listen
to Cleaver, the problems with which the latter is struggling are brought
into relief through an encounter with two "authentic" black men, Bigger
Thomas and Richard Wright; the issues that take Cleaver to prison and to
the psychiatrist are in fact better illuminated by Wright than by
psychoanalysis. Contrasting the psychiatrist's myopic impositions to
Wright's "keen insight," he effectively disassociates the two and
implies that Wright, as a black man, can speak of African American
experience where psychoanalysis remains impotent, blind, and oppressive.
Cleaver's example illustrates the argument that psychoanalysis is either
impervious to the urgency of political questions or directly racist in
its basic assumptions. For example, a number of writers point out
psychoanalysis's colonial loyalties by referring to its analogy between
"savagery" and infantilism. While examples abound in Freud, this is
perhaps best evidenced by Octave Mannoni's Prospero and Caliban (1950),
whose theorization of colonialism as a response to the psychic
"dependence complex" (40) of the natives has become, fairly or unfairly,
an exemplary case of the political misappropriation of psychology and
psychoanalysis.7 Already in 1955, Aimé Césaire notes that the
Eurocentric investment in these disciplines is evident in their
insistence on depicting "Negroes-as-big-children" (40).8 In addition to
Mannoni's work, psychoanalytic anthropology has produced numerous other
case studies that have elicited vehement criticism.9 In Deleuze and
Guattari's famous estimation, "Oedipus is always colonization pursued by
other means" (Anti-Oedipus 170). At worst, psychoanalysis is seen as
"conceal\[ing\] realities and legitimiz\[ing\] oppression" (Hartnack
233; qtd. in Seshadri-Crooks, "Primitive" 183), while Freud is identifi
ed as "the great colonizer of psyches" (Torgovnick 198).10 Wright
himself offers similar reservations, writing that any discussion of
psychology of the colonized is usually rejected by enlightened
commentators because it carries "an air of the derogatory" (White 41).
Yet, [the last two decades have seen the emergence of studies that,
without "exonerating" psychoanalysis, complicate these
charges.]{.underline} In Freud scholarship, two trends have developed:
one exploring questions of racialization in Freud, the other
appropriating (aspects of) Freudian psychoanalysis to read "black"
texts. For a number of scholars, Freud's anthropological texts, such as
"Moses and Monotheism," "Totem and Taboo," and the early "cocaine
papers," suggest "the historical importance of racial categories in
Freud's work" (Marez 68).11 Focus is placed on the significance of
Freud's own racialized position in fi n-desiècle Europe, where, as
Sander Gilman points out, the Jewish "race" was associated with eff
eminacy, disease, and "criminal perversions" ("Sigmund" 47).12 Daniel
Boyarin similarly argues that Freud's shift from the so-called seduction
theory to the theory of oedipalization was precipitated by the
racialization of the Jew, the invention of the homosexual, and the
acceleration of racism and homophobia at the end of the nineteenth
century (Unheroic 189--220).13 While Gilman and Boyarin tease out the
historical complexities in psychoanalysis's emergence, others have
accused Freud of purposefully utilizing the representations of the
"savage," widely circulated in the rapidly expanding colonial Europe, to
escape his own racially stigmatized position. In contradistinction to
the "primitive," the argument goes, Freud could claim the privileges of
whiteness and civilization, much like Jewish entertainers in early
twentieth-century Hollywood could disappear, according to Michael
Rogin's thesis, into racial unmarkedness by donning blackface.14 Thus
the significance of Freud's "race" to the formation of psychoanalytic
knowledge is generally acknowledged, but its implications remain
contested. While Marianna Torgovnick, for example, finds in Freud a more
or less self-serving mechanism of displacement (199),15 for Boyarin the
necessity for such negotiations suggests Freud's "postcolonial anguish,"
making him "both the object and the subject of racism" ("Jewish" 42,
40). Jacqueline Rose similarly remarks that, because of his own racial
markedness, Freud could not "unproblematically or unequivocally embody
the master narrative of the West" (50), and Barbara Johnson locates in
Freud's position something akin to the Du Boisian "double consciousness"
(Feminist 10). Apart from considering Freud's racialized status, or the
repression of racial difference in other early psychoanalytic texts,16
[critics have involved psychoanalysis in their readings of African
American texts and culture, thereby attempting to redress "the poverty
of language offered by psychoanalysis for addressing issues of race and
culture"]{.underline} (Luciano 158). A number of biographies of African
American literary figures, for example, are allegedly "quite Freudian"
(Murray 163).17 Similarly, given the psychoanalytic emphasis on family
relations, it is not surprising that slavery's violent disruption of
familial ties has been discussed in psychoanalytic terms. Without
explicitly engaging psychoanalysis, Hortense Spillers's influential
essay "Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe" (1987) pointed the way for subsequent
theorists to explore the forms of relatedness that African slaves
created during their captivity.18 In Mastering Slavery, for example,
Jennifer Fleischner considers women's slave narratives as examples of
the self-narration that psychoanalysis, according to her, solicits from
the analysand with the hope of his or her "liberation" from childhood
traumas (5 and passim).19 The question that more immediately concerns me
in this study, however, is the precise way we can engage Lacanian
psychoanalysis with African American literature. While Freud's
anthropological texts have provided an obvious starting point for a
consideration of his implication in colonialism, Lacan's possible
contribution to an investigation into race is harder to tease out: as
opposed to issues of sexual diff erence, there is very little in Lacan's
writing that explicitly relates to questions of race or seeks to explain
racism. Nevertheless, [the recent turn in Lacanian criticism to politics
suggests an opening for this investigation.]{.underline} Antonio
[Viego]{.underline}, for example, [reads Lacan's abhorrence of ego
psychology's adaptive models]{.underline}, especially their prevalence
in the United States, [in terms of a critique of "North American
coercive assimilatory imperatives working on ethnic-racialized subjects
. . . that demand of them a certain mandatory adjustment and adaptation
to North American 'reality'"]{.underline} (5) [and suggests an "overlap"
between Lacan's anti-assimilatory critique]{.underline} in the 1950s
"[and the similar critique of assimilation crafted by early Chicano
movement activists"]{.underline} (25). Ernesto Laclau and Slavoj Žižek
have similarly suggested some ways in which we can approach politics
from a Lacanian perspective.20 [Recent examples of Lacanian scholarship
that engage questions of race and colonialism include]{.underline} the
collection The Psychoanalysis of Race (1998), edited by Christopher
Lane, Kalpana [Seshadri-Crooks's theory of racialized
subjectivity]{.underline} in Desiring Whiteness: A Lacanian Analysis of
Race (2000), Abdul [JanMohamed's study of Wright]{.underline}, The
Death-Bound Subject: Richard Wright and the Archaeology of Death (2005),
[and]{.underline} Viego's psychoanalytic reading of Latino/a cultures
and literatures, Dead Subjects: Toward a Politics of Loss in Latino
Studies (2007). Seshadri-Crooks, and some contributors to Lane's
volume21 may be seen as "the New Lacanians" of [psychoanalytically
inflected critical race theory]{.underline}, given their "emphasi\[s
on\] Lacan's late notions of drive, jouissance, and the real at the
expense of his early concepts of desire, the imaginary, and the
symbolic" (Mellard 395).22 Perhaps because of the vagaries of Lacan
translations into English, the question of the real, with which Lacan
was increasingly concerned in the late 1960s and 1970s, has until
recently been neglected in Anglo-American scholarship. If the impact of
this shift in Lacanian theory from the imaginary and symbolic aspects of
subjectivity to the nonhuman, asubjective realm of the real "has not yet
fully registered with \[Anglo-American\] psychoanalytic theorists of
gender" (Dyess and Dean 738), its ramifications for psychoanalytic
theories of race has remained similarly unexplored. It is this question
that Lacanian race theory needs to concern itself with. The current
study is a contribution to this emergent field of scholarship. Yet, the
specter Cleaver evokes---of psychoanalytic arrogance that dismisses the
concerns of African American subjects or texts---is not completely
exorcised by the proliferation of these psychoanalytic studies of race
and racialization. Given the history of psychoanalysis and race, any
attempt to read Wright psychoanalytically will conjure up the threat of
infl icting on him the reductive readings to which Cleaver was
subjected. Predictably enough, this has been the exact outcome of many a
psychoanalytic attempt at Wright scholarship. Two examples of this are
Margaret Walker's psychobiography Richard Wright, Daemonic Genius (1988)
and Allison Davis's chapter on Wright in Leadership, Love, and
Aggression (1983): both demonstrate the necessity of relentless
suspicion in the face of psychoanalytic approaches to questions of race.
Apart from the many inaccuracies Michel Fabre points out in his
"Margaret Walker's Richard Wright," Walker stands as a representative of
a reductive tradition in psychoanalytic criticism that misreads not only
the literary (or \[auto\]biographical) texts under consideration but
also psychoanalysis.23 Similarly, Davis's reading of Wright's
autobiography exemplifi es an elision of the social and political
specifi city of the "analysand's" situation. Davis writes that while
"Wright may have allowed his public to believe that his character and
behavior were formed by the impact of racial oppression by Mississippi
whites," "\[o\]ne only needs to read his Black Boy . . . to understand
that Wright considered his family the primary source of his anger and
his hatred." In a reading that is both authoritarian and misogynist,
Davis insists that Wright's revolt and anger were not primarily directed
against his racist environment, or even that the family structures might
have been determined by or mediating such oppressive social structures.
Instead, Wright, like his father, was rebelling against his maternal
family, "a long, grim line of puritan matriarchs," which "consisted of a
clan of obsessively religious and sadistic women" (156--58). At the very
least, Davis fails to realize that "\[r\]acism becomes a part of the
subject's unconscious because the parents consciously and unconsciously
refl ect the racist values of the culture onto the subject from the fi
rst moment of life" (Tate, Psychoanalysis 133). We may approach the
thorny relation between race and psychoanalysis by noting how it echoes
many other interdisciplinary encounters in which the latter has been
involved. Discussing its relationship with feminism, Jane Gallop writes:
"the worst tendency, the inherent constitutional weakness of
psychoanalysis, is to be apolitical (which is to say, to support the
institutions in power)" (Daughter's 101). "One of psychoanalysis's
consistent errors," she continues, aptly describing Cleaver's situation,
"is to reduce everything to a family paradigm. Sociopolitical questions
are always brought back to the model father-mother-child. Class confl
ict and revolution are understood as a repetition of parent--child
relations. Th is has always been the pernicious apoliticism of
psychoanalysis" (144).24 Interrogating the link between literature and
psychoanalysis, Shoshana Felman suggests that, to avoid such traps of
psychoanalytic application---in which, according to her, psychoanalysis
stands as the Hegelian master over the bondsman of literature ("To Open"
5)---we must "engage in a real dialogue between literature and
psychoanalysis." We begin this by reversing the master--slave positions
and by "consider\[ing\] the relationship between psychoanalysis and
literature from the literary point of view" (6). Th e objective in
establishing this dialogue, Felman continues, is not, however, simply to
overturn the positions, but, rather, "to disrupt this monologic,
master--slave structure" (6) altogether so that one can "avoid both
terms of the alternative" and "deconstruct the very structure of
opposition, mastery/ slavery" (7). Yet, skeptical about the possibility
of nonreductive psychoanalytic approaches to other disciplines,
Françoise Meltzer, in her introduction to Th e Trial(s) of
Psychoanalysis (1988), sees psychoanalysis as an inherently colonial
project, a form of "empire-building"---what Deleuze and Guattari in
Anti-Oedipus call "the analytic imperialism of the Oedipus complex"
(23)--- that seeks to incorporate all other disciplines within its own
paradigm and assumptions (Meltzer 7). According to her, Felman's
attempted reversal of the master--slave relationship of psychoanalysis
and literature betrays the constitutive reductiveness and "totalizing
teleology" of the psychoanalytic approach. For what guarantees that such
a reversal has any deconstructive eff ects on the dialectic hierarchy?
According to Meltzer, Felman's unstated assumption is that the positions
of the master (for psychoanalysis) and that of the slave (for
literature) are so "natural" that any role reassignment would, by its
sheer absurdity, quickly abolish the structure itself (3). At bottom,
Felman's argument is a mere variation of psychoanalytic narcissism in
which all other disciplines are but mirroring surfaces for
psychoanalysis to discover its inalienable and unchangeable truths: "Not
content to see itself as one in a number of enterprises, the
psychoanalytic project has at its foundation a vision of itself as the
meaning which will always lie in wait; the truth which lies covered by
'the rest'" (2). According to Meltzer, psychoanalysis must be reduced
from its position of metadiscursive arrogance: "Psychoanalysis is not on
trial in order to be attacked," she writes, "but in order to be put back
into its place---or, at least, into a place" (5). For her, the only way
to bring psychoanalysis and other disciplines together is to return the
violence of the previous encounters in the exact same form onto
psychoanalysis. Meltzer's response to Felman indicates the diffi culty
in engaging ethically and productively with any constellation of
discourses contaminated by histories of violent hierarchies. (And we may
suspect that all such encounters are marked by a certain degree of
violence.) She correctly admonishes us that, rather than applying
psychoanalytic theory to other disciplines, we must interrogate it. Th
is does not mean primarily that we are to criticize it---rather, we must
not assume that we are already familiar with its insights, which can
then be applied to other fi elds of knowledge. Yet, what should give us
pause is Meltzer's desire to repeat the dialectic of violent reduction
of which psychoanalysis stands accused. Here we should ask, what is the
ethics of a justice that announces the defendant's incarceration and
confi nement to "its place" in the opening statement of the trial?
Moreover, wanting to "put \[psychoanalysis\] back into its place"
(emphasis added), Meltzer assumes that we already know what this place
is. In this, we are reassured that nothing unexpected will be uncovered
during the trial, nothing new unearthed. Th e testimony will not
complicate notions of guilt or responsibility; the whole procedure is
committed to a rigid politics of foreseeability. It is precisely an
opening to the unexpected that Gallop points to as ethical engagement in
analysis. She suggests that, as a way to negotiate the difficult
division between psychoanalysis and politics---which Cleaver's example
perfectly illustrates---we must involve the analyst in the scene of
interpretation: "Analysis, if it is not to be a process of adapting the
patient to some reigning order of discourse, must include the risk of
unseating the analyst" (Daughter's 102; emphasis added).25 For Frantz
Fanon and James Baldwin, for example, the adaptive aims of psychiatry
and psychoanalysis reveal the disciplines' colonialist and racist
allegiances.26 Always insisting on what may be called the maladaptive
aims of treatment, Lacan, too, refers to the dangers of misdirected
analysis when he writes that "the inability to authentically sustain a
praxis results, as is common in the history of mankind, in the exercise
of power" ("Direction" 216). Yet, while critics such as Deleuze and
Guattari condemn psychoanalysis tout court---"It is certain that
psychoanalysis pacifies and mollifies, that it teaches us resignation we
can live with" ("Deleuze" 229)---[Lacan identifies the adaptive methods
of ego-psychology as inauthentic practice. Hence, while observing the
reductive approaches in the history of psychoanalysis--- where
psychoanalytic knowledge appears as an uncontested master interpreting
its objects---we should note with Lacan that such a rigid postures of
self-identity belong to the unethical subject whose relationship to the
other is characterized by imaginary misrecognition.]{.underline} The
ethical subject, for Lacan, is the mobile subject of desire or,
increasingly in his later work, of the drive. [That the institution of
psychoanalysis is often characterized by rigid, masterly interpretative
ambition should not prevent us from seeing what remains unfixable and
mobile---that is, inherently ethical---in psychoanalytic discourse. Our
inability to rest in one position long enough for it to materialize into
a master's throne or the voyeur's keyhole constitutes the ethics of
psychoanalysis. In this]{.underline} ethical perspective, moreover,
[lies psychoanalysis's availability for political work.]{.underline}
["Psychoanalysis,"]{.underline} as Tim Dean writes, ["is political
precisely to the extent that the position of the analyst diametrically
opposes that of the master"]{.underline} (Beyond 108). Correspondingly,
Meltzer's assumption of already knowing what psychoanalysis can do and
her ambition to firmly locate psychoanalysis---to "be actively reductive
with psychoanalysis" (7) and to "put \[it\] back into its place"
(5)---appear in this context as decidedly unethical. As Adam Phillips
observes, "the fact that psychoanalysis is difficult to place . . . may
be one of its distinctive virtues" (3). One should nevertheless remain
doubtful about all claims to "good-natured" exchanges between discursive
fields. Edward Said argues that the seemingly neutral setting of
"discursive situations" usually masks the fact that "far from being a
type of idyllic conversation between equals, \[these situations are\]
more usually of a kind typefied \[sic\] by the relation between
colonizer and colonized, the oppressor and the oppressed" ("Text"
181--82; see also Gandhi 28). [Like all exchanges established across
disciplines, discourses, and knowledges, the dialogue between African
American and psychoanalytic literatures is inevitably marked by
disparities.]{.underline} Establishing such encounters is an effort
where we find our "good intentions" always compromised and endlessly
betrayed. However, [while violence may indeed be unavoidable in these
encounters, we must resist letting this violence solidify into a
structure.]{.underline} Furthermore, [in all their inherent dangers and
pitfalls, such dialogues are precisely what psychoanalysis is all about.
Through its engagement with an other, psychoanalysis]{.underline}---
and, importantly, other disciplines participating in this
dialogue---[retains the mobility characteristic of the ethical subject
of desire.]{.underline} I am not the first to see such troubled
encounters as potentially productive. The editors of Female Subjects in
Black and White: Race, Psychoanalysis, Feminism (1997) observe in the
intersection of race and psychoanalysis (and, in their project, of
feminism) as many "transformative possibilities" as "stubborn
incompatibilities" (Abel et al. 1). [Encounters that take place or erupt
in this treacherous middle-ground, they warn, must not be considered
entirely reconcilable.]{.underline} Yet, through such implication we can
avoid, however momentarily and without any guarantees of success,
reductive psychoanalytic readings that, in their insistence on
"reduc\[ing\] everything to a family paradigm" (Gallop, Daughter's 144),
bypass sociopolitical questions of power and disenfranchisement. It is,
exactly, this reductive analytical reading to which Cleaver objects in
his account of his sessions in prison---not the fact that analysis
implicates the family: "each time \[the psychiatrist\] interviewed me he
deliberately guided the conversation back to my family life, to my
childhood. That in itself was all right, but he deliberately blocked all
my attempts to bring out the racial question" (11; emphasis added).
(Psycho)analysis's emphasis on the familial is not necessarily
oppressive; Oedipus becomes "the fountainhead where the psychoanalyst
washes his hands of the world's inequities" (Deleuze and Guattari,
Anti-Oedipus 128) only when the analyst refuses everything outside the
family, turns a blind eye to the possibility that the family may be
imbricated in society and its politics. Thus, [if psychoanalysis has
participated in the Western projects of colonialism, Fanon's example
clearly shows that its historical role in anti colonial and antiracist
struggles is anything but negligible.]{.underline} Similarly, in African
American thinking, [Du Bois's disillusionment with the ability of
objective, scientific knowledge to fight race prejudice coincides with
his discovery of racism's unconscious support.]{.underline} In his
autobiographical texts, he suggests that this "twilight zone" of
"stronger and more threatening forces" that remain in excess of
"conscious and rational" motivation behind race prejudice can be
explored through Freud's insights (Dusk 282, 283, 296). I thus suggest
that the question, [What can psychoanalysis do?, can and must be
answered only through the future encounters in which it will be
engaged.]{.underline} One way to think about the transformative
potential of these encounters is to give the term its Deleuzian specifi
city. Th at is, we can think of the dialogue between psychoanalytic and
African American texts as an encounter between bodies, as an opening
onto an unforeseeable becoming that may transform the encountering
bodies beyond recognition---with all the violence that this phrase
suggests.27 Deleuze teaches us that, unlike what Meltzer assumes in her
trial scenario, encounters cannot be legislated. For him, bodies are
always defi ned by their relations to other bodies, by their ability to
be transformed by the "resonance" that exists between their internal and
external relations. Our regarding bodies as autonomous betrays the fact
that we have misunderstood their interimplication, have missed their
profound resonance. Bodies, consisting of smaller bodies and their
relations to one another, are separable yet interconnected: separable in
the specifi city of their internal relations, yet connected through the
bodies they inevitably share with other bodies, in which they enter into
a diff erent relation. In their encounter, bodies are never completely
compatible, never pieces of a puzzle that snugly complement one another,
but are always held together by a certain friction, gravitational pull,
or violent harmony. Our success in joining two separate bodies (of work)
seamlessly cannot but betray the fact that we have dismissed their true
complexity. I suggest that the Deleuzian understanding of bodies'
interimplication, eschewing any notions of harmonious compatibility,
characterizes the most productive work emerging from the encounter
between psychoanalysis and race. Conversely, the understanding of the
necessary transformation that takes place in all encountering bodies
reveals some problems in the recent studies on psychoanalytic and
African American texts. I take Claudia Tate's Psychoanalysis and Black
Novels as an example: her work warrants detailed attention because of
the centrality it accords to Wright and the largely favorable reviews it
has drawn as a timely opening between psychoanalysis and African
American writing.28 As Tate notes in her introduction, many
commentators, "demanding manifest stories about racial politics," have
marginalized African American texts that engage questions not directly
dealing with society's racial and racist structuring. Texts that "focus
on the inner worlds of black characters without making that world
entirely dependent on the material and psychological consequences of a
racist society" (5) have been rejected for neglecting to interrogate and
critique racism and, consequently, considered "not black enough" (4).
Tate counters this critical history by reading a number of novels that,
from the perspective of the African American canon, have appeared
"anomalous" in the output of their authors. She argues that these texts
in fact reveal what has been implicit in the more canonical works:
according to her, they are central to their authors' oeuvre and the
concerns of the black canon in that they "not only inscribe\[\] but
exaggerate\[\] a primary narrative, an 'urtext,' that is repeated but
masked in the canonical texts" (8). Tate in eff ect proposes that,
rather than continuing what Henry Louis Gates, Jr., calls the "curious
valorization of the social and polemical functions of black literature"
that has stunted black literary criticism ("Criticism" 5--6),29 critics
of African American texts should pay attention to the workings of
unconscious processes, which can neither be explained as eff ects of a
(racist) environment nor contained by the authors' or readers' political
designs. In her impressively researched readings, she shows how black
texts are amenable to analyses that pay attention to what she calls
"textual subjectivity . . . structured by the mediation of desire and
prohibition" (25) or the "implicit narrative fragments of desire and
pleasure inscribed in the rhetorical organization and language of the
text" (27). Her range of references in psychoanalytic theory is
similarly ambitious: she draws from Lacan, Freud, and Melanie Klein
while gesturing to Karen Horney's and Marie Bonaparte's theories of
femininity. Although demonstrating her familiarity with the fi eld of
psychoanalysis, however, Tate does not extend to its theories the kind
of detailed investigative eff ort with which she reads African American
texts. Th is is a conscious choice: she writes in her introduction that,
because her audience consists mainly of scholars and readers of African
American literature, she is "not interested in consolidating and
privileging the theoretical demands of individual schools of
psychoanalysis" (12). For her, the numerous psychoanalytic theories
"facilitate \[her\] analysis of unconscious textual desire in the novels
as unacknowledged fantasies of lost and recovered plenitude" (13). What
she ends up doing, however, is not merely refusing to take sides in
intra-disciplinary debates around diff erent psychoanalytic approaches.
Rather, her neglect of critical engagement with psychoanalysis leads not
only to a reductive theoretical understanding, but also to
psychoanalysis's approximating the kind of "narcissistic," "ubiquitous
subject, assimilating every object into itself," that Meltzer sees it
as. In the mode of psychoanalytic "facilitat\[ion\]," where what is
being read are the black novels, not the psychoanalytic texts, Tate
unwittingly perpetuates a familiar hierarchy between literature and
psychoanalysis: their potential dialogue is reduced to an application
where our understanding of psychoanalysis is not aff ected by its
encounter with African American writing. Similarly, in Mastering
Slavery, Fleischner, while sympathetic to a psychoanalytic approach to
slave narratives, ultimately fails to achieve (what Deleuze would call)
an encounter between, or (in Felman's terms) the implication of,
psychoanalytic and literary texts.30 For Tate and Fleischner,
psychoanalysis never emerges as a body of text to be read; rather, it
surfaces as received theory, "enabl\[ing\] an approach" to literature
(Fleischner 4). Immobilizing psychoanalysis as a body of texts with
transparent meaning, texts that need not be read, such an approach
reduces the "mutually illuminating and interpenetrative" (Spillers,
"'All'" 77) encounter to an application. A failure to engage
psychoanalysis allows it to function as a master discourse through which
the meaning of other texts can be glossed. Such a dynamic can be
discerned in the history of the institutionalization of psychoanalysis:
psychoanalysis becomes most oppressive and normative precisely when it
congeals into institutions with a received and well-understood canon; at
the moment of institutionalization and canonization psychoanalysis loses
its capacity for the kind of self-interrogation that I argue marks
psychoanalytic approaches proper. It is to avoid the kind of
unintentional reduction that Tate and Fleischner exemplify that I will
spend a fair amount of time considering psychoanalytic texts in this
study, beginning with the fi rst chapter, which outlines in detail
Lacan's theory of the visible. [Lacan allows us to understand how the
process of racialization, in immobilizing the racial(ized) subject, also
enables the "imaginarization" of the white symbolic
order]{.underline}---a concept I will explicate as the study
progresses---[whereby the symbolic is rendered blind and vulnerable to
challenges. Understood psychoanalytically, subject formation is not
predetermined by societal or historical contingencies but opens a space
for the subject's "incalculability"]{.underline} (Copjec, Read 208),
[premised on the unpredictable interventions of the unconscious and the
real. Mobilizing such incalculability]{.underline}, Bigger Thomas--- the
protagonist of Wright's debut novel, Native Son (1940)---disappears from
the disciplinary radar of the white symbolic order. Even though he is
soon arrested in and by his own strategies of subversion, his "flight,"
in repeating the dynamics of dissemblance and performance familiar from
African American history, [opens the possibility of understanding
contingency and unpredictability as politically salient
strategies.]{.underline}

#### Even if they're right that psychoanalysis enacts some of the dynamics of racism, it is precisely for this reason that the psychoanalytic frame is critical to understand our cultural symbolic of whiteness

**Winnubst 06** \[Shannon, Professor of Women's, Gender and Sexuality
Studies at Ohio State, *Queering Freedom*, p.58-9\]

In "Love Thy Neighbor? No, Thanks!" Slavoj Zizek (1998) begins with some
general musings on the bad press that psychoanalytic approaches to
racism enjoy these days. Arguing against these critiques of
"psychological reductionism" and an "abstract-psychologistic approach,"
Zizek persuades us in his ever-entertaining ways that [the
psychoanalytic frame is exactly the lens that can diagnose the
machinations of racism in northern-western cultures and, by exposing
their internal inconsistencies]{.underline}, presumably [help us to
disrupt them.]{.underline} I agree with Zizek and much of the recent
work in the intersections of psychoanalysis and race1 that [the dynamics
of psychoanalysis have much to offer to readings of race and racism in
contemporary settings of Eurocentric cultures---particularly the
dead-end, circular readings of social constructionism.]{.underline}2
However, I also suggest that [these lenses of psychoanalysis have much
to tell us about white inhabitants of these cultural symbolics of
phallicized whiteness and]{.underline}, more particularly, [some of the
silent assumptions about space and embodiment which constitute that
whiteness. Psychoanalysis may be an appropriate lens for diagnosing our
cultural racism exactly because it enacts some of the central dynamics
which sediment that racism.]{.underline} Of course, in carving out a
space that I refer to as 'our cultural symbolic,' I am already at odds
with most Lacanians' understandings of 'the symbolic.' While I
understand that Lacan was attempting to unravel the structures of
signification and dynamics of subjectivation that occur within the
symbolic, I wish to speak of this symbolic as a historicized and
particular phenomenon. Referring to 'our cultural symbolic,' I am
referring more specifically to the symbolic that dominates cultures of
phallicized whiteness and structures signifiers in a way that gives
disproportionate and abusive power to some persons--- some bodies---over
others. Following out Lacanian dynamics of signification and
subjectivation, I am reading ['our cultural symbolic']{.underline} as a
process that [signifies some bodies as more powerful, more valuable, and
more meaningful than others---namely, those white male straight
Christian propertied bodies that we have already encountered in the
emergence of the neutral liberal individual.]{.underline}

### AT: Robinson

#### Robinson's arguments are beyond comprehension -- all their indicts are inevitable, unfactual, and don't preclude our theorization of the world

**Thomassen 04** (Lasse Thomassen PhD -- PhD in Ideology and Discourse
Analysis as well as Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at the University of
Copenhagen and Professor of Politics and Queen Mary University of
London, "Lacanian Political Theory: A Reply to Robinson", The British
Journal of Politics and International Relations, 1 November 2004,
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-856X.2004.00157.x>,
MG)

[The first issue I would like to raise in this regard concerns the
relation between ontology and politics]{.underline}. Robinson writes:
'The books discussed here thus tend to suggest that it is not possible
to derive an original, distinct and attractive political agenda from
Lacanian politics' (p. 268, emphasis added). And: 'since Lacan's work
deals with politics only very occasionally, the entire project of using
Lacan politically is fraught with hazards' (p. 261). Hazards indeed, but
[not quite in the way that Robinson thinks]{.underline}. What would be
the condition of possibility of deriving a political agenda from a
political theory or ontology? Such derivation would presuppose that one
could move in a necessary fashion from a set of theoretical or
ontological assumptions to a set of political conclusions applicable to
a concrete context. Ontology, theory and political agenda would have to
be part of the same homogeneous whole comprising ontological,
theoretical and political elements linked by necessity. [Clearly, if one
subscribes to a post-structuralist viewpoint, there can **be no such
homogeneity**, whether between ontological, theoretical and political
elements or whether within a particular political agenda, for
instance.]{.underline} This is a recurring theme in post-structuralism.
[The impossibility of this sort of derivation may be a 'hazard', but one
that we will **just have to live with.**]{.underline}

[Robinson believes that, since Lacan did not provide a specific theory
of politics, but only a more abstract ontology, all the political
appropriations of Lacan can do is to subsume politics to pregiven
Lacanian categories (p. 261). This is obviously a potential danger, and
one that must be avoided.]{.underline} One must insist that analytical
categories are always rearticulated when applied; as Wittgenstein has
shown, there is no application that leaves intact the rule being
applied. [But this **does not preclude the theorisation of politics**
through categories that were not originally thought to apply (directly
or indirectly) to politics. This would assume a regional conception of
politics: politics as determined as a particular region with particular
(essential) limits and requiring a theory only applicable to this
region. This, in turn, would require a theory **transcending all
regions** and thus capable of delimiting the specifically political
region---again **not a feasible alternative** from a post-structuralist
viewpoint.]{.underline} It is the merit of, among others, the theorists
considered by Robinson, that they have introduced a distinction between,
on the one hand, politics as the region of practices usually referred to
as politics and, on the other hand, the political as the moment of the
contingent institution of politics and the social. The political cannot
be reduced to a specific region, but instead refers to a logic
permeating society in its entirety, even if in some places more than
others. [Since the political understood as contingency permeates
politics, we can use the political as a principle of analysing politics.
This is]{.underline} one of the contributions of post-structuralist
(including **[Lacanian) political theory.]{.underline}**

[(3) According to Robinson, Lacanian political theory is inherently
conservative]{.underline}. 'Lacanians', Robinson writes, 'urge that one
reconcile oneself to the inevitability of lack. Lacanian politics is
therefore about coming to terms with violence, exclusion and antagonism,
not about resolving or removing these' (p. 260). And, about Mouffe, he
writes that, 'as a Lacanian, Mouffe cannot reject exclusion; it is, on a
certain level, necessary according to such a theory' (p. 263). [Such
assertions are only possible if we believe in the possibility of
opposing exclusion to a situation of non-exclusion, which is exactly
what post-structuralists have challenged. Moreover, the
post-structuralist (and Lacanian) view **does not necessarily preclude
the removal of any concrete exclusion**. On the contrary, the
acknowledgement of the constitutivity of exclusion shifts the focus from
exclusion versus non-exclusion to the question of which exclusions we
can and want to live with. Nothing in the poststructuralist (and
Lacanian) view thus **precludes a progressive politics**]{.underline}.
Of course, this is not to say that a progressive politics is
guaranteed---if one wants guarantees, post-structuralist political
theory is not the place to look.

There are similar problems with Robinson's characterisation of i ek's
'nihilistic variety of Lacanianism': 'the basic structure of existence
is unchangeable \... \[ i Zˇ zˇek's\] Lacanian revolutionism must stop
short of the claim that a better worldcan be constructed' (p. 267[).
This, according to Robinson, 'reflects an underlying conservatism
apparent in even the most radical-seeming versions of Lacanianism' (p.
268). Again, the constitutivity of exclusion and violence **does not
necessarily mean** that '**the new world cannot be better than the
old'** (p. 268). The alternative to guaranteed progress is not
necessarily conservatism or nihilism, and the impossibility of a perfect
society does not exclude attempts at improvement---with the proviso that
what counts as improvement cannot be established according to some
transcendental yardstick.]{.underline}

[Thus, while Robinson raises many interesting points, there are **also
some problems** with his position]{.underline}. Here, I have focused on
some misunderstandings of the status of the claims made by
post-structuralist political theorists, but there are also some simple
misreadings of the texts under review. For instance, when dealing with
Mouffe's view that antagonism is ineradicable, Robinson links this to a
Hobbesian statism: 'the exclusionary and violent operations of coercive
state apparatuses must be accepted as an absolute necessity for any kind
of social life. This is Hobbesian statism updated for a post-modern era'
(p. 261). [How Robinson is able to move from the ineradicability of
antagonism and exclusion to 'the exclusionary and violent operations of
coercive state apparatuses \... as an absolute necessity' and 'Hobbesian
statism' is **beyond comprehension**. There is certainly nothing to
suggest such an interpretation in the pages referred to by Robinson
(Mouffe 2000, 43, 105, 129--132)]{.underline}

### AT: You Want Ballot Too

#### Gotta be negative 

**Zupančič 8** \[Alenka, researcher @ Institute of Philosophy of the
Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts and a Visiting Prof. @ European
Graduate School, *Why Psychoanalysis? Three Interventions*,
"Intervention 2: Freedom and Choice" p. 52-54\]

The big question, the \'million dollar question,\' that necessarily
arises here is, of course, this: can this singular type of tie function
as the ground of any social tie, or is the latter always based on the
repression of the former? I will not answer this question here, but will
say something else instead. [[If there is any intrinsic politics of
psychoanalysis, it consists in insisting on its work of unbinding and of
separation]{.underline}]{.mark} (in the sense sketched out above), [[and
in not succumbing to the following criticism]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
is becoming louder and louder: [[psychoanalysis only disintegrates,
dismantles, separates, it is obsessed with negativity and lack, it never
amounts to any affirmative, positive project]{.mark} (be it political or
simply \'human\'). [The politics of psychoanalysis today should be to
not yield to this]{.mark} (by trying to \'nevertheless\' propose
something \'positive\'), but [to pursue its work of analysis which has
always had an intrinsically social character.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Does this mean that psychoanalysis has to abstain from passing any kind
of social judgment and to uncritically accept]{.underline}, if not even
actively support, [the contemporary disintegration of social
ties]{.underline}, the crumbling of solidarity [and of collective
projects]{.underline}, the spectacle of the social tissue breaking into
tiny pieces, small individual islands of enjoyment? [I believe that it
has to do something else, namely to critically examine this diagnosis
itself]{.underline}, the diagnosis [that should raise suspicion already
on account of its being so gladly embraced by everybody]{.underline}, by
those [on the right and those on the left]{.underline}, by the [rich
and]{.underline} the [poor]{.underline}, the religious and the not
religious, the [exploited and the exploiters. Do we really live in the
times of an accelerated dissolution of the social ties and of the
emergence of an untied multitude of individuals as solipsistic islands
of enjoyment?]{.underline} [What if this diagnosis itself is a form of
repression]{.underline}, a \'compromise formation\' [fiercely
criticizing a certain content]{.underline} (the criticism of which is
utterly acceptable) [in order to avoid the real source of the
problem?]{.underline} What we could say, for example, is this: the
existence of the multiplicity of individuals as solipsistic islands of
enjoyment is precisely the form of existence of the contemporary *social
link*. [The socio-economic mobilization of lndividuals may not take the
same form as 100 or 200 years ago, yet this is not to say that it does
not take place and that we are not]{.underline} - as individuals with
our own way of enjoyment - [very much engaged in \'feeding\' the present
social link]{.underline}, which binds us to itself, and to each another.
Here we should stress again what we have already indicated: that perhaps
[the crucial mistake lies in the fact that we are too fast and too
willing to understand enjoyment as something essentially \'atavistic,\'
solipsistic]{.underline}, or simply [a-social]{.underline}, cut off from
the field of the Other. Contrary to this, [we should recognize the point
where]{.underline} - through the dialectics of repression and its
maintenance - [enjoyment is very much linked to the Other and is
always-already social.]{.underline} More precisely: the subject of
enjoyment does not need the Other, except at the point where the latter,
with its \'bare\' existence, guarantees the repression that the
enjoyment \'needs\' in order to emerge as enjoyment.

[When we think of therapy of any kind]{.underline}, including
psychoanalysis, [we usually think of a trajectory moving from
dissatisfaction to some degree of satisfaction.]{.underline} Subjects
enter therapy with a psychic ailment causing dissatisfaction, and if the
treatment succeeds, they leave with the ability to lead a more
satisfying existence.3 If subjects didn\'t feel dissatisfaction, they
wouldn\'t enter into any therapy, and if they didn\'t attain some
satisfaction as a result, therapy would cease to be a viable practice.

[But despite its commonsensical appearance, this model does not apply to
psychoanalytic therapy]{.underline} - or, rather, psychoanalysis is not
therapy in this sense. Rather than effectuate a qualitative change in
the subject by transforming dissatisfaction into satisfaction,
[psychoanalysis attempts to intervene]{.underline} - and finds the
justification for its intervention - [on a quantitative level. Rather
than attempting to cure dissatisfied subjects, psychoanalysis confronts
subjects who are satisfied but who spend too much psychic
effort]{.underline} or who take a path that is too circuitous [for the
satisfaction they obtain.]{.underline} In this sense, [psychoanalysis is
fundamentally an economic theory of the psyche.]{.underline}

The death drive and the repetition that it installs in the subject
follow a self-satisfying course. [The death drive finds a path to
satisfaction or enjoyment despite]{.underline} - or because of -
[whatever obstacles the external world might erect.]{.underline} The
satisfaction of the subject is the one constant in psychoanalytic
thought, and it leads Freud to postulate the existence of the drive as
the source of that satisfaction.4 The satisfaction that the death drive
produces stems from its circular structure: [rather than trying to
attain satisfaction through an external aim, the drive produces that
satisfaction through the process of the repeated movement
itself]{.underline}.

The self-satisfied quality of the drive differentiates it from
physiological need: needs undergo fluctuation from a state of
dissatisfaction to one of satisfaction when they achieve their aim. [The
drive]{.underline}, on the other hand, [never fluctuates.]{.underline}5
[Unlike biological need]{.underline} (which might be satisfied or not,
depending on whether it discovers its object), [the drive]{.underline}
(which has an absent object) [always involves satisfaction. Thus,
psychoanalysis]{.underline}, a practice oriented around the drive,
[cannot intervene by way of offering a missing satisfaction or providing
a helping hand to those down on their luck.]{.underline}6

[The psychoanalytic intervention must be]{.underline} strictly economic,
that is, [involving the quantity of psychic effort expended by the
analysand. The aim of the psychoanalyst]{.underline} -- the analyst\'s
desire -- [must be to remove the detours that the analysand has placed
along the path of the drive]{.underline} in order [to allow the
analysand to take up completely her or his position in the
drive.]{.underline} In Seminar XI, Lacan lays out the situation
confronting the analyst: \"What we have before us in analysis is a
system in which everything turns out all right, and which attains its
own sort of satisfaction. If we interfere in this, it is only in so far
as we think that there are other ways, shorter ones for example:\'7 In
submitting to analysis, the analysand submits, albeit unknowingly, to
this desire for shortening or economizing the path of the drive. [This
shortening is the analytic cure]{.underline}, and Freud first comes to
understand it as such in the 1895 Project where he emphasizes the costs
of psychic detours that the subject erects to the flow of psychic
energy.

[[We might think of this change of perspective in terms of the way that
athletes and fans view their devotion to sports.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[The increasing importance of sport]{.mark} in the contemporary world
[testifies]{.mark} in one sense [to the dominance of commodity logic and
its narcotizing effect. Sports figures]{.mark} and their fans [associate
the ultimate enjoyment with victory, and their focus]{.mark} on victory
[provides an escape from the dissatisfaction that inheres in everyday
life]{.mark}]{.underline} under capitalism. [But [the focus on victory
hides where the real enjoyment lies]{.mark} both for the athletes
themselves and for the fan. Though one finds fleeting pleasure in
winning, [enjoyment derives from the sacrifice of
time]{.mark}]{.underline} and the effort [that go into making victory
possible.]{.underline}

[Both the athlete and the fan make this sacrifice to different
degrees]{.underline} -- the athlete through long hours of difficult
training and the fan through giving up free time to follow the
trajectory of the individual athlete or team -- [though the prevailing
commodity logic obscures the role that this sacrifice plays as the
source of enjoyment in both cases. [According to this logic, the
pleasure of the victory justifies the sacrifice, when in fact pleasure
functions as an alibi for the enjoyment of sacrifice.
Psychoanalysis]{.mark}]{.underline} [[allows us]{.underline}]{.mark} to
turn the tables on commodity logic and [[to place the emphasis on the
act of sacrifice.]{.mark} One strives for]{.underline} or roots for
[victory only in order to sustain the sacrifice that makes it possible.
[This shift in emphasis represents a radical transformation that stems
from recognizing how we already enjoy]{.mark}]{.underline}, not from
changing the nature of our enjoyment.

[Though a simple shift in emphasis hardly seems likely to transform
society]{.underline} in a fundamental way, [this is precisely
what]{.underline} Giorgio [Agamben suggests]{.underline} in a stunning
passage from *The Coming Community*. Agamben cites a story that Walter
Benjamin purportedly told to Ernst Bloch describing the kingdom of the
messiah. [In the messianic kingdom]{.underline}, Benjamin says,
[\"everything will be as it is now, just a little
different."]{.underline}29 Agamben sees the image of the halo as the
indication of this slight difference that Benjamin identifies, but we
might equally view the halo as a different way of approaching the
commodity -- a capacity for seeing the commodity as an object of
sacrifice rather than as an object of accumulation.

[[Though capitalist ideology focuses the attention of subjects
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the process of accumulation and on [[having the
object]{.mark} rather than experiencing it as lost,
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} as a mode of production [[continually
forces subjects to endure the object in its
absence.]{.underline}]{.mark} In this sense, capitalist ideology and the
practice of capitalism are completely at odds with each other, and this
discrepancy is crucial for the functioning of capitalism. [The
accumulative logic doesn\'t allow one to recognize oneself as a subject
of loss or identify one's enjoyment with the object\'s absence. But
nonetheless capitalism delivers enjoyment to the subject through a
process of securing this absence.]{.underline}

This contradiction is pivotal for the reproduction of capitalist
relations of production. [[The satisfaction]{.mark} that [capitalism
provides sustains subjects]{.mark}, while the desire that capitalist
ideology provokes [pushes them to expand the system]{.mark}, which is
what it requires]{.underline} in order to survive. [Because capitalism
forces subjects to endure perpetually the absence of the privileged
object, it does offer enjoyment to the subjects who invest
themselves]{.underline} in its ideology. [However, [this ideology never
allows these subjects to locate the actual source of their
enjoyment.]{.mark} Through the act of relocating our
enjoyment]{.underline} -- of exposing the link between enjoyment and
loss or absence -- [we undermine the ability of capitalist ideology to
seduce contemporary subjects.]{.underline}

### Alt -- Anxiety

#### Both cynicism and law are wrong moves -- only an embracement of anxiety can endure an encounter with the Other and create the experience of enjoyment

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 115-117, 1 July 2013, MG)

But as theorists of contemporary cynicism have shown, [cynical subjects
don't really sustain a thoroughgoing cynicism relative to enjoyment.
While they disbelieve in the possibility of enjoyment or authentic
commitment, they do believe in belief]{.underline}. That is, they
believe that there are others who really believe. Despite the cynical
knowledge that this belief is false, the cynical subject does believe in
the enjoyment that comes from belief, and as a result, [cynicism
**doesn't** offer the respite from anxiety that it initially
promises.]{.underline}

[Unlike cynicism, the opposite strategy --- the attempt to restore
prohibition and paternal law --- involves an avowal of the lost object
and its ability to deliver enjoyment]{.underline}. We try to create the
requisite distance from enjoyment through our various efforts to
resurrect prohibition, to return to the reign of traditional symbolic
authority. These efforts most often take the form of various
fundamentalisms. One of the chief appeals of fundamentalism is its
promise to reintroduce a barrier to enjoyment into the experience of
contemporary subjectivity. By reintroducing this barrier, fundamentalism
promises to keep anxiety at bay, to allow us to attain some distance
from the enjoying other.

[But like cynicism, efforts to restore prohibition end up **returning
the subject to the situation of anxiety** rather than providing relief.
Contemporary fundamentalism derives its energy not from the idea of
restricting enjoyment but from the idea of unleashing it. It promises
increased enjoyment through restriction, and it delivers on this
promise, though in doing so it produces even more anxiety]{.underline}.
As fundamentalism restores prohibitions, it creates more intense sites
of enjoyment. Whereas the cynical subject sees no enjoyment in the
revelation of an almost-naked body, the fundamentalist subject sees
enjoyment proliferating with the baring of a small patch of skin. [In a
world of anxiety, even the attempt to create distance has the effect of
**creating more enjoyment**. Both cynicism and fundamentalism emerge in
response to the contemporary subject's anxious proximity to the present
object. Both see distance from the enjoyment of the other as the only
possible solution to the experience of anxiety.]{.underline}

[**The alternative** --- the ethical path that psychoanalysis identifies
--- **demands an** **embrace of the anxiety that stems from the
encounter with the enjoying other**. If there is a certain ethical
dimension to anxiety, it lies in the relationship that exists between
anxiety and enjoyment]{.underline}. Contra Heidegger, the ethics of
anxiety does not stem from anxiety's relation to absence but from its
relation to presence --- to the overwhelming presence of the other's
enjoyment. In some sense, [the encounter with absence or nothing is
easier than the encounter with presence. Even though it traumatizes us,
absence allows us to **constitute ourselves as desiring subjects**.
Rather than producing anxiety, absence leads the subject out of anxiety
into desire. Confronted with the lost object as a structuring absence,
the subject is able to embark on the pursuit of the enjoyment embodied
by this object, and this pursuit provides the subject with a clear sense
of direction and even meaning]{.underline}. This is precisely what the
subject lacks when it does not encounter a lack in the symbolic
structure. When the subject encounters enjoyment at the point where it
should encounter the absence of enjoyment, anxiety overwhelms the
subject.

[In this situation, the subject **cannot constitute itself along the
path of desire**. It lacks the lack --- the absence --- that would
provide the space through which desire could develop. Consequently, this
subject confronts the enjoying other and experiences
anxiety]{.underline}. Unlike the subject of desire --- or the subject of
Heideggerean anxiety --- [the subject who suffers this sort of anxiety
actually experiences the other in its real dimension.]{.underline}

[The real other is the other caught up in its obscene enjoyment, caught
up in this enjoyment in a way that intrudes on the subject. There is no
safe distance from this enjoyment, and one cannot simply avoid
it]{.underline}. There is nowhere in the contemporary world to hide from
it. As a result, [the contemporary subject is necessarily a **subject
haunted by anxiety** triggered by the omnipresent enjoyment of the
other. And yet, this enjoyment offers us an ethical
possibility]{.underline}. As Slavoj Žižek puts it, ["It is this
excessive and intrusive jouissance that we should learn to tolerate."27
When **we tolerate the other's "excessive and intrusive jouissance**"
and when we endure the anxiety that it produces, we **acknowledge and
sustain the other** in its real dimension]{.underline}.

Tolerance is the ethical watchword of our epoch. However, [the problem
with contemporary tolerance is its insistence on tolerating the other
only insofar as the other **cedes its enjoyment** and accepts the
prevailing symbolic structure. That is to say, we readily tolerate the
other in its symbolic dimension, the other that plays by the **rules of
our game**. This type of tolerance allows the subject to feel good about
itself and to sustain its symbolic identity. The problem is that, at the
same time, **it destroys what is in the other** more than the other ---
the particular way that the other enjoys]{.underline}.

It is only the encounter with the other in its real dimension --- the
encounter that produces anxiety in the subject --- that sustains that
which defines the other as such. [Authentic tolerance tolerates the real
other, not simply the other as mediated through a symbolic structure. In
this sense, it involves the experience of anxiety on the part of the
subject]{.underline}. This is a difficult position to sustain, as it
involves enduring the "whole opaque weight of alien enjoyment on your
chest."28 The obscene enjoyment of the other bombards the authentically
tolerant subject, but this subject does not retreat from the anxiety
that this enjoyment produces.

Whose Enjoyment?

If the embrace of the anxiety that accompanies the other's proximate
enjoyment represents the ethical position today, this does not
necessarily provide us with an incentive for occupying it. [Who wants to
be ethical when it involves **enduring anxiety** rather than finding a
way --- a drug, **a new authority**, or something --- to alleviate it?
What good does it do to sustain oneself in anxiety? In fact, anxiety
does the subject no good at all, which is why it offers the subject the
possibility of enjoyment]{.underline}. When the subject encounters the
other's enjoyment, this is the form that its own enjoyment takes as
well. [To endure the anxiety caused by the other's enjoyment is to
experience one's own]{.underline} simultaneously. As Lacan points out,
when it comes to the enjoyment of the other and my own enjoyment,
"nothing indicates they are distinct."29 Thus, [not only is anxiety an
**ethical position**, it is also the key to embracing the experience of
enjoyment. To reject the experience of anxiety is to **flee one's own
enjoyment**.]{.underline}

The notion that the other's enjoyment is also our own enjoyment seems at
first glance difficult to accept. Few people enjoy themselves when they
hear someone else screaming profanities in the workplace or when they
see a couple passionately kissing in public, to take just two examples.
In these instances, [we tend to recoil at the **inappropriateness of the
activity** rather than enjoy it, and this reaction seems completely
justified. The public display of enjoyment violates the social pact with
its intrusiveness; it doesn't let us alone but **assaults our senses**.
It violates the implicit agreement of the public sphere constituted as
an enjoyment-free zone. And yet, recoiling from the other's enjoyment
deprives us of our own.]{.underline}

### Alt - Satisfaction

#### The alternative is to interpret the 1AC and turn it towards total satisfaction -- only by uncovering what is hidden in the psyche can the banality of the everyday and capitalism be addressed 

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 267-271, 20 September 2016,
MG)

[Capitalism bombards us with the **image of our dissatisfaction**.
Challenging capitalism today doesn't depend on focusing subjects on how
dissatisfied they are with capitalist relations of production. This type
of response plays **into the hands of the capitalist** system and the
promise of a better future that it employs]{.underline}. This is the
response that manifested itself in the nineteenth-century critique of
capitalism's injustice and in the twentieth-century critique of
capitalism's repressiveness. Despite the vast differences between these
two lines of critique, they share an emphasis on the dissatisfaction
that capitalism produces, and this line of attack does fully uncover
capitalism's real psychic appeal.

[Though dissatisfaction with capitalism seems necessary for any critique
of the system, dissatisfaction as such **inheres within the capitalist
economy**. Capitalist subjects remain capitalist subjects because they
see themselves as dissatisfied beings in pursuit of satisfaction and
thereby misrecognize the satisfaction they have found. The critique of
capitalism must begin out of our **satisfaction with capitalism** and
not our dissatisfaction with it]{.underline}. But the capitalist system
never avows this satisfaction. [Recognizing it requires the most radical
act today---that of **interpretation**.]{.underline}

[It is important never to take a system at its]{.underline}
[word]{.underline}. This is especially true in the case of an economic
or political system, in which the workings of the system aren't
self-evident to anyone. [Even when leaders are caught revealing the
machinations that take place behind the scenes, we should not assume
that they are giving away the keys to the kingdom. Freud's discovery of
the unconscious implies that the **subject knows what it's doing but
cannot articulate this knowledge**. As a result, others, from the
perspective of interpretation, have more insight into the subject's
designs than the subject itself]{.underline}. This is just as true for
an economic or political system.

[The secrets of every system are present in what the system says about
itself, but these **statements require interpretation**. They cannot be
taken at face value. This imperative to interpret exists for the
analysts of capitalism, despite the system's apparent
obviousness.]{.underline} Capitalism deceives us as to its structure and
appeal by laying its cards on the table. The proponents of capitalism
readily avow that it speaks to our baser instincts, to human
selfishness, and to the desire for more. The most extreme of [these
proponents translate selfishness into a virtue, but even those who don't
see how an inducement to selfishness among individuals might create a
more prosperous and thus happier collective]{.underline}. Greedy
individuals produce a wealthy and secure social order.

[This interpretation of capitalism fails because **it never
interprets**. It simply accepts how capitalists characterize themselves
and how the laws of the system explicitly structure the
economy]{.underline}. Within the capitalist system, self-interest seems
pervasive, and the benefits of the pursuit of self-interest are plain
for everyone to see. But [the act of interpretation requires seeing
**what is hidden amid obviousness**. What seems self-evident must itself
become subject to interpretation]{.underline}, and this is what Marx
does in the move from the first volume of Capital to the second.

In the first volume of Capital, Marx explores how capitalism views
itself. He famously points out that capitalism operates according to a
single imperative. In the place of any religious duty or Kant's
categorical imperative, [capitalism proclaims, "**Accumulate,
accumulate! That is Moses and the prophets**!"1]{.underline} Even manual
laborers who are just trying to survive must, according to this
transcendental imperative, concern themselves with accumulation in order
to survive and possibly prosper in the future. [Capitalist subjects
cannot get by simply by getting by but must always concern themselves
with tomorrow. One always accumulates with an eye to future prosperity,
but this capitalist imperative has a superegoic dimension to it, which
means that one can never accumulate enough]{.underline}. The imperative
to accumulate doesn't permit capitalist subjects to feel as if they no
longer have any need to accumulate. According to the morality of
capitalism, too much is never enough.2

The first volume of Capital is an exploration of the dynamics of a
system in which everyone tries to obey the imperative to accumulate.
Though Marx is critical of this imperative, he doesn't articulate an
alternative. In this sense, he remains proximate to the defenders of
capitalism. [For the defenders of capitalism, accumulation is the first
and last word. There is no other motivation for our action than
accumulation or the advancement of self-interest]{.underline}. The
structure of the capitalist economy itself seems to reveal the accuracy
of this claim: [it rewards those who try to accumulate and punishes
those who refuse to engage in this activity.]{.underline}

[But accumulation is only what capitalism and its defenders claim moves
the system. It is **not the real engine driving
capitalism**]{.underline}. It functions ideologically to ~~blind~~ us to
the role that satisfaction has in structuring our subjectivity. Even
when we are fully bent on accumulating, it is satisfaction that provides
the basis for our accumulation. [Capitalism survives because we find
**our accumulation satisfying**, but our focus on accumulation at the
expense of satisfaction short-circuits the recognition of this
satisfaction. The political task today is to wrench **satisfaction from
the hold of accumulation** by exposing the deception involved with
accumulation.]{.underline}

The problem with the model of accumulation is that it hides its own
manner of producing satisfaction. [While the accumulating subject aims
at obtaining the ultimate satisfaction in the future, this subject
satisfies itself in the present through the sacrifices that it makes to
obtain the object it seeks. Accumulation serves as a **cover for
sacrifice**---the sacrifice of time, of energy, of resources, of
freedom, and so on. In doing so, it obscures the role that loss plays in
all satisfaction]{.underline}. We don't find satisfaction in having or
obtaining a privileged object through acts of accumulation but rather
enjoy the object in its loss or absence. The sacrifice that accumulation
demands provides satisfaction because it recreates our experience of
loss, but no one who is bent on accumulation can recognize the role that
loss plays.

Capitalism's privileging of accumulation obscures the role that
traumatic loss plays in our satisfaction. [There is no satisfaction
without loss. Or to put it in other terms, we are not subjects who might
obtain a satisfying object but subjects who can find satisfaction only
through the necessity of the object's loss. Even when we are right next
to someone we love, we enjoy what is **absent in the beloved**, not what
is present: that part of the beloved that we can't
decipher]{.underline}. Capitalism's success derives from shielding our
psyches from this necessary loss and its intrinsic connection to our
satisfaction. But we can recognize the disappointment that accompanies
accumulation.

Whenever we accumulate enough to obtain what we desire, we inevitably
find that this is not what we desire. This transformation of the object
that occurs when we obtain it derives from the difference between the
lost object that animates our desire and the actual objects of desire.
No object of desire can ever be the lost object (which exists only
insofar as it is lost), but we nonetheless inscribe this lost object
within a series of empirical objects of desire that we pursue. Obtaining
the object reveals the difference and thus produces disappointment and
renewed pursuit of a new object of desire.

The functioning of capitalism depends on our mistaking the object of
desire for the lost object. This inability to see the central role of
the lost object in our desire creates subjects of accumulation who
believe in the promises of the logic of accumulation. [We invest
ourselves psychically (and financially) in **new commodities** with the
hope that they will provide the satisfaction that the previous commodity
failed to provide, but no commodity can embody the lost object. Every
object of desire and every commodity will fail. Capitalism **thrives on
this failure**, and we can never escape its perpetual crises without
recognizing this link. Only the turn from **the logic of accumulation to
the logic of satisfaction**---with an acceptance of the lost status of
the object---can move us **beyond the crisis of
capitalism**.]{.underline}

Capitalism is not the worst economic system that the world has produced,
and it is not the cause of all our woes. Its effects are not universally
doleful. Capitalism has provided the economic background for a
widespread easing in the struggle to survive, the creation of vast
material wealth, the political emancipation of women, the elimination of
serfdom, and so on. But its triumphs have exacted an incredible toll
that we do not have to continue to pay.

The turn from accumulation to satisfaction portends the abolition of
capitalism. Of course, [the end of capitalism requires a political act,
but **a change in the psyche must inform this act**. Satisfaction is
traumatic, but the attempt to avoid this trauma merely results in its
diffusion in the form of a crisis, not in its evasion. The attempt to
bypass trauma inevitably leads back to it. The more we enrich ourselves
in order to escape trauma, the more crises we produce.]{.underline}

This way of understanding the turn from accumulation to satisfaction
finds support in an unexpected location, a place where Marx writes a
single sentence that conveys the foundation of capitalism and the
possibility for emancipation from it. In all of Marx's writing on
capitalism, there are innumerable insights into how capitalism plays on
the psyche of those who fall under its spell. Marx hopes, of course, to
break this spell, especially as it infects the proletariat. But Marx's
greatest insight into capitalism and its continued survival lies buried
in an obscure part of his work, as if he wanted to enact formally the
point he makes: [it is through the **banality of the everyday**, not in
the promised satisfaction of the future, that one discovers the
sublime.]{.underline}

### Alt -- Jokes!

#### The 1AC wasn't funny, vote negative to joke over the 1AC's desire

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 76-78, 1 July 2013, MG)

[In contrast, economy in the drive results in an excess of enjoyment
through the enjoyment of excess. When subjects eliminate the detours
that sidetrack the death drive, they experience this enjoyment of
excess. This is the kind of excess that one cannot find within the
capitalist system]{.underline}. Capitalism uses excess in order to
create thrift ; the economy of the drive uses thrift to unleash excess.
This dialectical relationship between thrift and enjoyment becomes
apparent in Freud's analysis of the economy of the joke, an analysis
that leads to the conclusion that [**the ultimate problem with
capitalism is that it isn't funny**.]{.underline}

In Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious Freud makes clear that
[the satisfaction coming from a joke derives from an act of saving or
economizing. Puns **exemplify** this saving process]{.underline}: the
pun makes a direct connection between two disparate ideas, ideas that
otherwise we would be able to connect only indirectly, through a
circuitous path of related signifiers. By shortening the path, by
eliminating the excessiveness of the detours leading from one idea to
another, the pun [creates an economical path between two ideas. This
saving in turn manifests itself as an excess enjoyment in the response
to the pun.]{.underline} If I say, for instance, that "Jerry Garcia is
now among the dead," I link two different senses of the word "dead" ---
not being alive and being a member of the band the Grateful Dead. We
have the capacity for laughing at this type of pun (even if we don't
actually laugh) because the pun has economized through the connection it
makes apparent.

[Other jokes also work according to the logic of the pun, allowing us to
connect what would otherwise be disparate or to grasp connections that
we didn't otherwise see.]{.underline} When Babe Ruth said that he had a
better year than the president aft er being confronted with the fact
that he earned more than the country's leader, people laughed because
the joke linked the presidency, an occupation that we typically consider
above comparison, with another occupation, that of a baseball player,
that we think of as insignificant in the larger scheme of things. [It
also made evident the underlying connections at work in the economic
system itself, revealing how this system links everyone. Connections
such as these are at the root of our ability to enjoy the joke as such.
As Freud says, "Enjoyment is . . . to be attributed to economy in
psychical expenditure."34 Because it economizes the **unconscious
connections in psyche**, the joke produces an **excess or remainder**,
which is precisely what the subject enjoys.]{.underline}

Though Freud himself never did, [we can translate Freud's analysis of
the joke back into the terms of the death drive. The joke functions to
shorten the drive's path: it allows us to **abandon the detours or
side-cathexes** that interrupt the direct path of the drive. When we
laugh at the joke, it is as if we are momentarily recognizing our
satisfaction and escaping the sense of dissatisfaction that stems from
these detours. But capitalism lacks a sense of humor and works at every
turn to minimize joking --- or at least the economic effect of the
joke.]{.underline}

[The joke is anathema to capitalism because its functioning depends on
**severing connections** between ideas rather than facilitating them.35
For]{.underline} proper capitalist subjects, amoral behavior in the
marketplace has nothing to do with private life at home; the products we
buy have no relation to the labor that created them; and there is no
link between economic hardship and politics. [Of course, jokes
proliferate within the capitalist system, and many capitalist subjects
tell jokes constantly.36 But in its essence the **joke performs a
function** --- connecting ideas that appear quite different --- that in
general **subverts the functioning of the capitalist
economy**]{.underline}. Capitalism demands thrift in matters of
enjoyment, but it abhors the thrift that facilitates connections and
clears the path of the drive. [Only by insisting on this type of thrift
can we escape the sense of dissatisfaction that hides the underlying
satisfaction of the death drive.]{.underline}

[Psychoanalytic thought]{.underline} can't offer a precise prescription
for a particular form of social organization beyond the capitalist one.
But it [can reveal the importance of embracing the **economics of the
joke**. By doing so, one economizes in order to enjoy rather than
economizing in order to accumulate (and enjoy in the future).
The]{.underline} economic model of the psyche that
[psychoanalysis]{.underline} develops [points toward the possibility of
**enjoying our excess instead of profiting from it.** A society in which
we enjoyed excess would not be the Promised Land, but it would be a
place where enjoyment occurred without so much trouble precisely because
we recognized the trouble for what it was. Our trouble is what we
enjoy.]{.underline}

### Alt -- Genuine Fool

#### The alternative is to play the part of the Genuine Fool, the fool who defies the good and acts on its own enjoyment -- it cannot be combined with any desire or identity, or else it will fail

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 136-139, 1 July 2013, MG)

[By enjoying in a public way, the subject becomes what we might call a
**fool**. The fool is a subject who **ceases to court the social
authority's approbation** and becomes immune to the seduction of social
recognition or rewards]{.underline}. Recognition has a value for the
subject only insofar as the subject believes in the substantial status
of social authority --- that is, insofar as the subject believes that
the identities that society confers have a solid foundation. [The fool
grasps that no such foundation exists and that no identity has **any
basis whatsoever**. The only possible foundation for the subject lies in
the subject itself --- in the fantasy that organizes the subject's
enjoyment. Such a subject becomes a fool because it constantly acts in
ways that **make no sense to the social authority**. It acts out of the
nonsense of its own enjoyment.]{.underline}

[This does not mean that the fool acts at random]{.underline}.
Nonsensical enjoyment is not arbitrary enjoyment but enjoyment
irreducible to the symbolic world of signification. In fact, [the fool,
having embraced its own mode of enjoying, acts with considerable
regularity. This type of subject clearly acts against its own
self-interest and in **defiance of any good at all**]{.underline}**.**
The paradigmatic instance of the fool is the subject pursuing the lost
cause or the subject continuing to act when all hope has already been
lost. [The pursuit of the lost cause reveals that what motivates the
subject is **not a potential reward** but purely the enjoyment of the
pursuit itself. The authentic fool doesn't pursue the lost cause with
resignation but with the knowledge that **there is no other cause but
the lost one**]{.underline}. Rather than ~~paralyzing~~ the subject,
this recognition emboldens it, as [the example of Hamlet
demonstrates.]{.underline}

[When Hamlet receives his charge from his father's ghost and determines
that he must kill Claudius in order to revenge his father's murder, he
believes in the possibility of justice]{.underline}. For Hamlet at the
beginning of Shakespeare's play, there is an order in the world that his
act might restore, even though he laments that this burden has been
placed on his shoulders. He tells us, "The time is out of joint. O
cursed spite, / That ever I was born to set it right."35 This couplet
testifies to Hamlet's belief in distributive justice, which tacitly
presupposes a social authority with a solid foundation that could
distribute justice. [This attitude undergoes a radical transformation,
however, when he see Ophelia's grave. At this point in the play, Hamlet
recognizes the **groundlessness of all authority** and the hopelessness
of his own cause]{.underline}.

At Ophelia's grave, Hamlet confronts the power of death to dissolve
every symbolic bond. Justice and honor become meaningless in the face of
an all-conquering death. [He realizes that even if he revenges himself
on Claudius, **nothing will be accomplished**: order will not be
restored, and the time will remain out of joint. And yet, it is
precisely at this moment that Hamlet devotes himself to the completion
of his project. He realizes his fantasy --- avenging his father's death
--- when he grasps that it is its own end]{.underline}. Once his cause
becomes a lost cause, Hamlet can act.

[As long as Hamlet hopes that his act might accomplish something
substantial, the **moment will never be right for** it. Once he ceases
to believe in the possibility of restoring justice and understands the
act only in terms of his own fantasmatic enjoyment, he frees himself
from the search for the proper moment. Subjects who hope to make an
impact on social authority never act because they **cannot calculate how
the authority will respond to the act**. Such subjects]{.underline},
like Hamlet at the beginning of the play, [spend their time **probing
the authority's desire** and waiting for the moment when the act will
make the **proper impact on the other**. But that moment never comes.
When one adopts the position of the fool, the moment for the act is
always at hand because the fool's act has nothing to do with the
readiness of the social authority for it.]{.underline}

[There is a danger in advocating the subjectivity of the fool, however.
Many adopt the position of the fool as a **symbolic identity** that
provides **meaning** for their lives. Such subjects perversely act out
rather than accomplishing genuinely successful acts. The difference
consists in how the subject relates to the position of the fool. The
perverse fool acts in order to provoke the social authority into a
response, while the genuine fool acts for the sake of its own enjoyment
regardless of the authority's response]{.underline}. The former derives
a sense of identity from the position; the latter does not.

[The difference]{.underline} between the perverse subject and the
authentic fool [is visible within the character of Hamlet. After he
first hears of his father's murder at the beginning of the play, Hamlet
feigns madness; he literally plays the part of the fool. But he takes up
this position in order to provoke authority, not in order to realize his
own enjoyment]{.underline}. Hamlet uses his ~~madness~~ in an attempt to
trigger a reaction in Claudius that will offer definitive proof of the
latter's guilt. But even when Claudius reacts in the way that Hamlet
wants to the performance of the provocative play that Hamlet has
produced, Hamlet still does not act but continues to act out.

[It is only well after the play ends, after he has realized the absence
of any order in the world or any guarantee for his action in social
authority, that Hamlet is able to act. When he acts, he acts **not on
the basis of laws** or justice but on the basis of his own fantasy
frame]{.underline}. In act 5 he becomes the authentic fool, one no
longer playing to the crowd but determined to follow his fantasy
regardless of authority's response. In so doing, he provides a model for
successful subjectivity, for how the subject might act to change the
world.36

[Publicly insisting on one's fantasy hardly seems like a prescription
for changing the world in any substantive fashion. If this is the
political attitude advanced by psychoanalysis, the indictment of
psychoanalysis on political grounds appears to have a great deal of
merit. But this would be to move too quickly. We might think of the
relationship between **embracing one's own fantasy** **and politics** as
a twisted version of]{.underline} the line from the Talmud that
characters repeat in Schindler's List (Steven Spielberg, 1993):
"[**Whoever saves one life saves the world entire**." Translated into
our terms this would become: "Whoever publicly insists on her or his own
fantasy opens this path for the world entire." By doing this, the
subject institutes a fundamental change in the structure of its symbolic
world.]{.underline}

[When one subject opts for the nonsense of its own enjoyment over the
blandishments of recognition, this act exposes the groundlessness of
social authority --- the emptiness around which the social order is
structured. A collective awareness of the groundlessness of social
authority would produce a **different sort of social order**, one in
which subjects would be unable to rely on authority and would have to
assume responsibility themselves for the social order]{.underline}. They
would lose the sense of authorization for their acts. [The freedom
inherent in social existence would become evident in light of
authority's evanescence.]{.underline}

### Alt -- Specifics

#### Psychoanalysis is the only way to approach capitalism

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 183-184, 20 September 2016,
MG)

[Psychoanalysis owes its existence to **capitalist modernity**. It
emerges in response to the sense of dissatisfaction that capitalism
produces through its incessant focus on the object of desire. Whereas
capitalism privileges the object of desire to the exclusion of the lost
object, psychoanalysis **reverses this valuation** and identifies the
lost object as the central force within the subject.
Psychoanalysis]{.underline} doesn't make existence fully satisfying for
the subject by giving it a fully satisfying object. Instead, it [turns
the subject's attention to the **integral role** that loss has in its
satisfaction and reveals the inexistence of a fully satisfying
object.]{.underline}

[The psychoanalytic cure involves leading the subject to the point where
it can embrace the partial satisfaction that the lost object provides.
It is a satisfaction of **not having rather than having**---and thus
radically opposed to capitalist productivity]{.underline}. The idea is
not one of accepting the necessity of some dissatisfaction by acceding
to the reality principle. Instead, the subject grasps that it already
has the satisfaction that it seeks. The partial satisfaction of not
having always trumps the illusory total satisfaction associated with
having the object of desire. This is the lesson of psychoanalysis in a
nutshell.

[The combat that psychoanalysis wages against capitalism is **not a
frontal assault**. Instead, it works to transform the **subject's
attitude toward loss and thus render the subject incapable of
investing** itself in capitalist productivity and
accumulation]{.underline}. Thus, if one leaves psychoanalysis and
continues to struggle for enrichment or for accumulating additional
commodities, the psychoanalysis has functioned as productive therapy
rather than as psychoanalysis. This is the verdict that we can
unequivocally render on the analysis that Tony Soprano (James
Gandolfini) undergoes in the television series The Sopranos. Though it
disturbs his ability to continue his accumulation (of money, of women,
of power), it never seriously throws this project into question. This
represents a perfect image of psychoanalytic failure. Instead of helping
subjects like Tony Soprano to accumulate with a good conscience,
[psychoanalysis aims at creating a recognition that loss is inextricable
from satisfaction.]{.underline}

[The rarity of psychoanalytic practice actually working to reconcile
subjects with the lost object as the source of satisfaction testifies to
the triumph of the ideal of productivity within capitalist society
**even at the site most diametrically opposed to this
ideal**]{.underline}. By and large, nonproductive psychoanalysis---that
is, psychoanalysis as such--- becomes productive therapy. Practices that
don't accede to the productive ideal either die or quickly transform
themselves. The fate of psychoanalysis in capitalist society bespeaks
the near omnipotence of this ideal. Despite its emphasis on the
nonproductivity of the lost object, psychoanalysis primarily functions
as an ideological handmaiden to the productive ideal.

[But the victory of the productive ideal is not, for all that, entirely
secure. Its vulnerability does not only reside in workers who experience
their labor devalued but also in subjects who become dissatisfied with
the dissatisfaction necessarily created by the focus on ends. Attention
to the means lurking within capitalist ends leads to the possibility of
a **different economic system**. Capitalism depends on an investment in
productive ends, but its dependence on means opens the door to the
recognition of **satisfaction that it cannot tolerate**.]{.underline}

### Nuclear Reps K Alt\-\--2NC

#### The alternative is a politics of the sublime -- rather than attempt to calculate and describe nuclear war, understand it through its sublime aspects, as something the stands in a place outside the symbolic order, thus revealing its cracks and reconfiguring desire towards more productive ends. 

**Matheson 15** \[Calum Matheson, PhD is Associate Professor of Public
Deliberation and Civic Life and the incoming Chair of the Department of
Communication at the University of Pittsburgh.; "Desired Ground Zeroes:
Nuclear Imagination and the Death Drive"; 2015;
https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/210598703.pdf\]//eleanor

[It is in this place of despair from which we should understand the
politics of the sublime. Because it is an inevitable byproduct of
discontinuous subjectivity, the death drive cannot be wished away. We
will probably always desire continuity that we cannot have and the
object from which we are rent by our separation from the world as a
whole. **What the sublime offers is a reconfiguration of
desire**]{.underline}. [We defer enjoyment questing after objects and
ignore sacrifices in the meantime, whether it is global
poverty]{.underline} tolerated for the sake of a middle-class material
comfort or [radioactive contamination]{.underline} for the sake of
peace-through-strength. Todd McGowan argues that [a recognition of the
death drive might not remake the material structure of society---at
least not immediately---but that it could have a profound effect on the
way we understand enjoyment]{.underline}. [Instead of seeking to
overcome every limit as an obstacle to enjoyment]{.underline} (as I have
argued we do with the limits of language in the Real), we have to enjoy
the limits themselves as obstacles to the movement of the drive. [Desire
may be inevitable, but we can change the way we orient ourselves towards
the frustrations and repetitions of the drive, learning to enjoy the
partial challenges of our limits instead of deferring enjoyment for the
achievement of some utopian state that we will never reach]{.underline}
(McGowan, conclusion). Some of this enjoyment can already be identified
in survivalism, for example, when preppers camp in the wilderness,
practice skills they imagine using, or grow their own food. The problem
is essentially temporal. What makes survivalism coalesce around violence
is the understanding that the world needs to end for society to be
remade. Suddenly prepping becomes just work, utility in Bataille's
sense, means to an end. Although there is obviously enjoyment in the
sense of affective investment in the practices and tropes of survival,
[it remains organized around the "big payoff" of a world-shattering
disaster, and thus enjoyment is mostly deferred and attachment forms to
the disaster itself, fabulously textual as it may be. **What ruins the
game of fort-da is the same thing that ruins other rule-bound
games.**]{.underline} As Roger Caillois argues, **[the assumption that
games must then result in something else, some "real world" benefit,
turns them into work.]{.underline}** To avoid the "corruption" of games,
play must be an end in itself, something useless in the sense of
Bataille's sovereign poetry (Caillois 44). [**The sublime is a language
suited for this change**. The sense of **being in the presence of
silence,** an **active force that exceeds language**, **breeds both
terror and fascination,** but what results from this desire might be
otherwise. Instead of deferring enjoyment for the eventual mastery of
all contingent experience in mediation, the sublime draws a limit to the
value of language used for productive work. That limit can be a source
of enjoyment instead of (solely) frustration. Realizing that the Real
cannot be mediated into the Symbolic does not have to mean that our
attempts to do so have failed.]{.underline} Bataille's distinction
between poetry and other language revolves around the basic observation
that poetry, in his sense, does not aim to do anything by organizing the
world differently. It is expression without utility ("Hegel, Death, and
Sacrifice" 25). **[The sublime]{.underline}** is not a sufficient
principle for any politics. It **[is useful]{.underline}** instead **[to
reveal the investments that cause political solutions to fail and repeat
themselves serially]{.underline}**. Ned O'Gorman's argument that the
sublime can have no politics because it cannot make practical
differentiations is correct if one understands politics to be about the
allocation of scarce resources and rhetoric to be about this conception
of politics ("Political Sublime" 889). As Bataille defines it, politics
is concerned with the handling of excess, not scarcity (Accursed Share
24-26). [The teratology of rhetoric I suggest as a supplement is
directed towards excess rather than scarcity. Nuclear war is a problem
of excess in a double sense: the excess of reality that is the Real, and
the excess of energy that thermonuclear processes provide for warfare.
Concern for the sublime should lead us to seek the places where the
excess of the general economy tears through the scarcity of the
particular economy]{.underline}. [Doing so, and **observing the
distortions that appear in the Symbolic**, is a **step towards tracking
the motions of desire** that **stitch together the tropes of nuclear
myth.** Sublime language will not help much in figuring out the details
of nuclear arms verification measures---or which Russian ICBM fields to
target]{.underline}, for that matter. Instead, [it should help us to
**accept the limits** of **our ability to map the world** and
**reincorporate its breakdowns,** and to **appreciate these inevitable
failures** for what they are]{.underline}. An often overlooked theme in
Longinus's On the Sublime is the futility of accumulation for its own
sake. Longinus decried what he saw as the decline of rhetoric into
something meant to achieve specific goals rather than be admired for its
own sake. [The pursuit of wealth, power, and pleasure are not the only
goals of rhetoric, and cannot be its only aim. We must **enjoy sublime
language for its own sake**, not only for what it can get
us]{.underline}. [This is not desire without restriction, for "surely if
our selfish desires were altogether freed from prison, as I were, and
let loose upon our neighbors, they would scorch the earth with their
evils," because we perpetually desire something more beyond our grasp
and thus cannot be satisfied]{.underline} (58).
[Words]{.underline}---[mediation in general]{.underline}, we might now
say---[must be something to be enjoyed as artifice because "they are in
truth the mind's peculiar light]{.underline}" (41). **[The sublime's
most dangerous manifestations occur in attempts to control contingency
with rational order and calculate the incalculable]{.underline}**. [The
**political implication of teratology** is that we should sometimes
**resist this violent recuperation** and **leave some mysteries alone.**
To **change our relationship towards the death drive** means to **accept
that artifice can be enjoyed for its own sake, not just as a promissory
note for the absent Real**. There **may be no ultimate, objective
value** for the human species that we can discover in the Real, but this
**does not need to be a council of despair**. Instead of inventing
reasons that the species must survive, we should admit that we have no
good reason at all to do so. We don't need one. If all values are
arbitrary, then there is no reason not to live, assuming that we want to
do so. **To live without a reason** is precisely the kind of sovereignty
Bataille **seeks through poetry**, a **sovereign life rather than a
commitment to individual survival** as a **means to a perpetually
deferred end**]{.underline}. [**Learning to accept limits,**
even]{.underline} **[enjoy their impediment to the drive]{.underline}**,
[is]{.underline} perhaps **[necessary]{.underline}** but not sufficient
**[to change our orientation towards nuclear warfare and the imagination
of human extinction. To require rational answers to the ultimate
questions raised by the Bomb is to play the wrong kind of
game.]{.underline}**

#### The silence of Trinity was the ultimate triumph of the real -- nuclear war can only be understood through metaphor, futile attempts to calculate the gap in the symbolic order -- trying to make nuclear war present through language sustains investment in those very myths and tropes in the first place .

**Matheson 15** \[Calum Matheson, PhD is Associate Professor of Public
Deliberation and Civic Life and the incoming Chair of the Department of
Communication at the University of Pittsburgh.; "Desired Ground Zeroes:
Nuclear Imagination and the Death Drive"; 2015;
https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/210598703.pdf\]//eleanor

I would like to conclude by outlining the implications that I see in
this project for communication studies and the politics of anti-nuclear
activism. [The significance of the Real suggests that omissions,
breakdowns, and silence are important objects of study. We should not
think of the inability to capture and translate something just as the
failure of mediation but also the triumph of excess. The former centers
the Symbolic order of human mediation as the key agent. The latter
acknowledges that the universe outside our ken sometimes evades our
grasp. **The silence of Trinity was not just an absence of speech. It
was the triumph of the Real, silence as its own revelation**---**an
affirmative force.** It is not necessary to ascribe agency to the Real
to recognize that it is more than the space left outside of language.
Neither should we ignore it because it is beyond our ability to
translate. Its deformations alter the Symbolic, **giving us outlines for
speculation**, **even if we can never truly see what is behind the
curtain**]{.underline}. [A theory of communication]{.underline} thus
[should]{.underline} at least [speculate about what exceeds
mediation.]{.underline} The word theory itself presents an opportunity.
Nicolas of Cusa claimed that the word derived from theoro, "I see,"
which is also the origin of Theos, "God" (213). God "looks on all
things," and thus does theory (Nicolas 237)." Theoria is the gaze that
lights 182 the shadows to reveal the world. This understanding of theory
is Bataille's Sun of reason and truth, that rational source of
enlightenment figurative and literal. But the Sun is also rotten, a
harbinger of mania for those who stare at it too intensely (Bataille,
Visions of Excess 57-8). It can be supplemented with another tradition,
one derived from téras and later therion, the Greek origins of our word
"monster." Monster, related to "demonstrate" was once a disruption, a
revelation, an apocalypse in its original sense of unveiling. Theory
should not only trace the order of the world. It should be a teratology
of the Real, an acknowledgment that the monstrous world "bites back."
Teratology was once the "account of marvels" ("Teratology"). It was once
pejorative: "when bold writers, fond of the sublime, intermix something
great and prodigious in everything they write," not altogether a
positive thing (Bailey). The word evokes the sublime in a rhetorical
sense, linked with "prodigious monsters" of thought and desire (Shipley
197). [The importance of the Real establishes the significance of the
death drive for theories of communication.]{.underline} While the drive
has generally been considered an aspect of the Symbolic order---the
subject, formed through the alienation of the mirror phase, is driven to
invest in objects (signifiers) that stand in for something lost that
could make it whole. The formulation of the death drive here is somewhat
different, drawing also from Bataille's concept of continuity. The
subject's initial formation marks it as discrete from everything else,
which is the necessary condition for death, since a change in state of a
part of the whole does not destroy said whole. Eros, exemplified in
copulation, momentarily merges the self with another, as does Thanatos
more permanently in the state of death. [The Symbolic is necessarily
always mediated, and the Real is not. The emergence of the Real hints at
a world beyond mediation, and thus towards continuity. Since the Real
cannot be adequately captured, subjects cathect to whatever seems to
represent it, and thus the drive does operate in the Symbolic, which is
often misrecognized as real. Identifying the death drive as a desire to
move beyond mediation shows the necessity of a broad view of
communication. The connections that form between sites of investment for
Lacan either proliferate meaning by referencing outwards (metonymy) or
condense meaning by establishing a particularly saturated connection
defines the sites involved by this strong relation
(metaphor]{.underline}). These rhetorical tropes are typically used to
analyze language, but they can be reframed to apply to mediation more
generally, including the material aspect of individual media. This is
not to say that everything is a text. Instead, [it is a call to explore
how concepts developed for language might be adapted to other media, and
also how they must be changed to do so.]{.underline} In their canonical
book Remediation, Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin identify a seeming
paradox in media. There are "contradictory imperatives for immediacy and
hypermediacy...a double logic of remediation. [Our culture wants both to
multiply its media and to erase all traces of mediation: ideally, it
wants to erase its media in the very act of multiplying
them"]{.underline} (Bolter and Grusin 5, emphasis in original). Both
immediacy and hypermediacy have a long history---the first in the
evolution of Western European painting, for example, and the second in
illuminated medieval manuscripts (Bolter and Grusin 11-12). [The death
drive enriches this observation by underpinning it with a theoretical
explanation: we desire the Real (immediacy), but are frustrated in
achieving it,]{.underline} as detailed in Chapter 1. [Instead, we enjoy
our seeming ability to control presence and absence, latching on to our
own subjectivity and misrecognizing the Symbolic for the Real---hence
the enjoyment of hypermediacy]{.underline}. These imperatives are
contradictory in a sense, but they follow from one another according to
the logic of the death drive. Recall that Lacan's argument for the
primacy of the death drive is partly that all drives seek their own
extinction. [In the desire for immediacy, media also seek their own
extinction. In its failure, it is redirected back on itself in
hypermediacy]{.underline}. Bolter and Grusin define a medium as "that
which remediates. [It is that which appropriates the techniques, forms,
and social significance of other media and attempts to rival or
refashion them in the name of the real"]{.underline} (65-66). This
definition essentially makes various media metaphors for one another,
containers that reference other containers. [If metaphor is remembered
as metapherein, then this process can be thought of as material
metaphor. To say that remediation is the defining aspect of
media]{.underline} as Bolter and Grusin do [is consistent with metaphor
as the "archetrope" of language]{.underline}, as Miller names it. The
common element is mediation itself. [Remediation is metaphor, in which
significance is transferred from one container to another,]{.underline}
as in Lacan's pots, [with the relationship of the two configuring the
importance of the connection. Metaphor is also a kind of remediation.
The importance of the vehicle is transferred to the tenor and vice
versa, and both use language to stand in for something else---a concept,
an object, a person, place. The dynamic of the death drive should
suggest a different, more porous, theory of metaphor. One term does not
replace another and simply suppress it. Rather, it allows its users to
enjoy the absent term which is always still present in the metaphor. The
vehicle "countervalue," for example, stands in for the tenor "nuclear
attack against civilians." This sense is not lost, but
displaced]{.underline}. **[Metaphor is a dynamic process rather than a
one-way substitution.]{.underline}** [One aspect is the replacement of
one term by another, but this is not the end: the point of metaphor is
that there is an cathectic investment in the relationship between two
terms, the trait that enthymematically connects them. Concealment is one
part of the process, but making the principle that connects the
concealed tenor to the expressed vehicle present is another, a fort-da
dynamic. It is the mediation between terms which serves to anchor
enjoyment. The sublime aspect of metaphor is the charge of the Real
which makes a particular connection so bright as to conceal
others.]{.underline} At the same time, [a broad understanding of
mediation has implications for metaphor and metonymy. The trope is
stunted when it is confined to language: not only does language stand in
for other things, but different media create different conditions for
investment.]{.underline} The simulated globe of First Strike stands in
for the conglomeration of matter that constitutes the Earth itself, but
the media of choice that videogames allow permits a different kind of
investment. For a subject to read about the radioactive wasteland of a
post-nuclear Earth is one thing, but for that subject to simulate its
creation is quite another. [Metonymy, the proliferation of meaning that
gestures from one trope out towards others, is mediated in different
ways by changing technology.]{.underline} As the example of survivalist
online communities shows, some of the labor of connection is now done by
automated systems based on aggregated data. An Amazon review of
Farnham's Freehold leads to a reviewer profile that leads to One Second
After, where targeted ads lead to survival equipment, where reviews lead
to message boards and message boards spin out across the Internet. Some
of these selections are made by readers, while others are automatically
generated, smoothing the paths between one thing and another.
Communities form in part around these shared spaces, connected not
directly but by their shared relationship to a message board, a
particular electronic text, or a lifestyle. Users of Survivalist Singles
are connected in part by electronic means. The electronic connections of
the Internet make possible an itinerary that begins with Farnham's
Freehold and ends with a marriage proposal made in a bunker. [The death
drive as a desire for the Real]{.underline} also [implicates
anti-nuclear politics]{.underline}. As detailed in the Introduction,
[much anti-nuclear scholarship adopts the "concealment thesis," the
assumption that the nuclear weapons complex persists as it does because
there is insufficient public deliberation. Deliberation is constrained
in part because the language of nuclear war conceals its "reality," the
horror of destruction]{.underline}. Thus Jonathan Schell graphically
imagined destruction in Fate of the Earth, Hilgartner et al. decry
"nukespeak," and what Carol Cohn calls "[technostrategic discourse" is
the subject of thorough critique for its use of euphemism and
mind-numbing arcane terminology]{.underline}. If the terms were changed,
if "God terms" were replaced with "devil terms," as Brummett suggests,
then unimpeded debate might occur, and as Schippa argues, nuclear forces
might be constrained. However, anti-nuclear scholarship in this vein has
an uncanny resonance with the sublime discourse of the Bomb. It too
seeks an appointment with the Real and makes nuclear imagination a site
of enjoyment. Bataille argues that a taboo is necessary in language only
because we desire to cross it in the first place, and the existence of
the taboo is in itself enjoyable because it creates the possibility of
forbidden, exciting transgression. This helps to explain the link
between sex and death in strategic terminology, which is the subject of
Cohn's work on the language of defense intellectuals. Many nuclear
euphemisms have a sexual connotation---"deep penetration," "spasm war,"
"hardening," and "bang for the buck" (Cohn 693). These [terms certainly
reflect a particular exercise of violent masculinity. What they also
share with terms like "countervalue" is the attraction to a forbidden
Real, the continuity represented by both sex and death. A concept of the
death drive as the desire for unmediated experience suggests that
changing the language of expression for this taboo---perhaps even
changing the patriarchal terms through which taboo and desire were
expressed in the nuclear age---would not automatically change the
investments that pin together nuclear warfare as a cultural
technology]{.underline}. Instead, **[critique aimed at making the
reality of nuclear war present in language contributes to the movement
of desire that sustains our investment in the myths and tropes of
nuclear war in the first place]{.underline}**. **[Metaphor operates like
the cycle of fort-da]{.underline}**, [where changing one signifier to
make the signified term absent can itself be a source of enjoyment, a
sense of power over presence and absence.]{.underline} We like to have
our yellowcake and eat it too. [The danger of seeking the Real of
nuclear warfare in language is that the inevitable failures of this
project have already proven to have uncanny consequences]{.underline}.
The fear of human extinction that struck George Kistiakowsky at Trinity
and was developed by Schell's "infinite risk" formulation was a message
inverted several times. All sacrifices are made acceptable by it.
Survivalists took the supreme value of human life as an injunction to
live at all costs, and communities formed around the fruits of this
(affective) labor. The Real of nuclear warfare became a challenge and
the promise of a new frontier, a strangely mediated means of escaping an
overly mediated society. The themes of EMP novels show a prominent trend
of anti-state sentiment in right-wing survivalism. Rather than inspiring
revulsion, [the imagination of nuclear horror has been met with
anticipation and no small amount of enthusiasm. Instead of democratic
engagement, it has resulted in a turn towards libertarian self-reliance,
hostility to outgroups, and a refusal to engage in the fallen politics
of a demos fated to burn when Armageddon comes. Even when the horror of
nuclear war inspires political engagement, there is no guarantee that
anti-nuclear initiatives result.]{.underline} That Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative was justified on these grounds should be a warning,
according to Jan Nolan, because "the public's concern about nuclear
weapons can be readily turned to fear. And this kind of public sentiment
helped spawn the industry of nuclear deceit...[Calls to public activism
with unspecific objectives may thus not be the best
approach]{.underline}. Frightened Americans looking for solace are a
great constituency for clever political strategists" (283). Project
Plowshare and its more contemporary echoes suggest that [fear can also
be transformed easily into a promise of salvation. The valence of the
Bomb switches easily for those beholden to its power; our reverence for
it does not]{.underline}.

### Thesis -- Race as Fantasy

#### This is a debate first and foremost about desire -- race as social structure exists not as an absolute truth but rather as a product of fantasy, of the unconscious construction of a racialized other as the barrier to the subject's enjoyment. We must challenge race as a signifier on the level of the unconscious or we do not challenge it at all.

The structure of the fantasy [The racist fantasy is a structure that
operates **regardless of the actual identity of those occupying the
various positions within the fantasy.**]{.underline} [It is a shared
social structure rather than the product of a certain individuals.
Although individuals are necessary to sustain the fantasy, it is a part
of the basic social structure that forms individual existence within the
society. In this sense, **while it is possible for individuals to opt
out of or reject the racist fantasy, these individual victories are
insignificant as long as the fantasy remains foundational for the
society.** **To say that a society is racist is to say that a racist
fantasy underlies its social order.**]{.underline} [Fantasy provides a
structure through which subjects can envision a path to obtaining the
fantasy object, whatever that object is. The fantasy object might be a
particular commodity, a lifestyle, or even a type of social status. But
whatever it is, it promises unrestrained enjoyment for the subject. For
the fantasizing subject, the object appears to have the utmost
importance.]{.underline} It seems as if it is the nodal point of the
fantasy. But despite this belief, the actual fantasy object can be
anything at all. The specific object is insignificant. [What is
important is the position that this object has in the fantasy, not what
the object is. In order to be a fantasy object, the object need only be
unattainable.]{.underline} [**The unattainability of the object is the
source of its value.** Because it is unattainable, the fantasy object
appears to hold within it the secret of a perfect
enjoyment.]{.underline} **[If one could attain it, one would quickly
recognize that it is an object like any other and cannot provide the
enjoyment that it promises insofar as it remains
unattainable.]{.underline}** It is with the object that the fantasy
performs its magic for the subject's prospects of enjoyment. [Fantasy
has the effect of rendering an inherently unattainable object attainable
and thereby making an unrestrained enjoyment seem possible.]{.underline}
Even if the fantasy shows the subject deprived of the object, it
nonetheless depicts the object as possible. [Outside the fantasy
structure, the subject simply confronts the traumatic impossibility of
its desire.]{.underline}10 [Fantasy doesn't just make the impossible
possible. It does so]{.underline}, ironically, [by placing a barrier
between the subject and its object.]{.underline} [**The fantasy object
is possible only insofar as something blocks the subject's access to
it.** By prohibiting the impossible object, fantasy creates the illusion
that the object is attainable but for the prohibition.]{.underline}
[This barrier enables the subject to avoid encountering the
disappointment of actually obtaining the object and thus plays the
pivotal role in the fantasy.]{.underline} [As the fantasy stages it, if
the subject were to attain this object, it would achieve an enjoyment
without any restriction.]{.underline} As a result, [the fantasy must
place an obstacle in the way of the object.]{.underline} [The obstacle,
not the object, is the crucial ingredient.]{.underline} [The fundamental
task of fantasy is to transform an impossible satisfaction that no one
could attain into a prohibited satisfaction that becomes unattainable
due to the fantasized obstacle that prevents the subject from having its
object. **There is no such thing as complete satisfaction. But complete
satisfaction comes to appear possible through the erection of an
obstacle to it.**]{.underline} [This]{.underline} operation [enables
subjects to believe that if they eliminate the obstacle they can attain
the impossible and overcome their status as lacking
subjects.]{.underline} **[Fantasy allows one to imagine an enjoyment
without lack, but it does so only by creating an obstacle who bears
responsibility for the failure to attain this enjoyment.]{.underline}**
[In the racist fantasy]{.underline}, as in any fantasy, [the object is
unimportant. The only significance that the object of the racist fantasy
has is that it is unattainable. The object can be any unattainable
object.]{.underline} [But what characterizes the racist fantasy and
differentiates it from other forms of fantasy is that the obstacle to
the object]{.underline}---[what bars the subject's access to
unrestrained enjoyment]{.underline}---[is the racial other.]{.underline}
[The fantasy's key player is the racial other because this figure makes
the object unattainable. **As the obstacle to complete enjoyment, the
racial other is responsible for all the subject's---and the
society's---failures.**]{.underline}11 [This figure gives the racist
fantasy its racist hue. The fantasy defines the subject through the
racial other that threatens it, which gives the subject a wholly
secondary and insignificant status within the structure.]{.underline}
[The racial other bars the subject from enjoying the object by
monopolizing the object for itself. The illegitimate enjoyment of the
racial other occurs at the expense of the fantasy's
subject.]{.underline} [This other enjoys in the subject's
stead]{.underline}, [triggering resentment for the racial other. The
racist fantasy produces a different and privileged relationship to
enjoyment in the racial other that provides the basis for what we see as
racial difference.]{.underline} [It is not that racial difference first
exists and then brings with it different relationships to enjoyment.
Instead, **we establish racial difference on the basis of how we
distribute the relationships to enjoyment.**]{.underline}12 In Trauma
and Race, [Sheldon George notes the primacy that enjoyment or jouissance
has in establishing racial difference.]{.underline} He claims, "it is
ultimately jouissance that grounds difference, establishing this
difference through its circumscription of the fantasy object."13 **[The
fantasy always depicts the racial other's enjoyment as illegitimate, as
a violation of the law, of morality, or of social mores.]{.underline}**
[The racial other becomes enshrined as racial as a result of the
position of obstacle that this figure has in the racist
fantasy.]{.underline} In the American version of the racist fantasy,
[the racial other is often a black man who enjoys white women at the
expense of white men.]{.underline} The black man's superior sexual
prowess renders him more able to please white women. [The fantasy
produces this figure of blackness]{.underline}, as Frantz Fanon has
theorized in Black Skin, White Masks. 14 [Against such a challenger, the
white man has no chance to measure up.]{.underline} In this sense, [the
racist fantasy does not clearly and simply establish the white man's
superiority in all domains]{.underline}. As a sexual being, [the black
man, the racial other, thoroughly dominates the white man, which is why
he is an unsurmountable obstacle to the white man's complete
enjoyment]{.underline} of white women. The fantasy is racist insofar as
it grants the black man an inherent sexual superiority that leads to the
victory over white men with white women. **[The racist fantasy
attributes absolute enjoyment to the racial other in order to give the
subject an obstacle that makes its own full satisfaction seem hindered
rather than impossible.]{.underline}** [The white man's
failures]{.underline} with women [thus become the fault of the black
man, not the white man. The racial other, not the very structure of
subjectivity, is the bar preventing the subject from enjoying the way it
imagines it might.]{.underline} [**The racial other always has an
enjoyment advantage deriving from its fantasized racial
inheritance**.]{.underline} It is a genetic gift, like athletic ability
or intelligence. [But what makes possible its victory over the subject
in the fantasy is not just this inheritance but also the other's
willingness to bypass the Symbolic restrictions that the subject
observes.]{.underline} In other words, on the terrain of sex, the racial
other cheats. [**The figure does not obey the constraints of civilized
society that the subject abides by.** The racial other uses seduction
and ultimately has recourse to violence in order to enjoy the object in
a way that the subject cannot. According to the fantasy, he is savage
and unrestrained by civilization in the way that the white man is
not.]{.underline} [This fantasy produces the belief in black criminality
in the American cultural imagination.]{.underline} The association of
blackness with illicit sexual enjoyment provides the lens through which
black men appear as inherently criminal. This criminality then helps to
explain how the black man bests the white man in the competition for
white women. Without resorting to his inherent criminality, the black
man would not be able to beat out the white man on the terrain of sexual
competition. In the fantasy, sexual prowess alone is usually not enough.
Criminality often comes in support.15 [**The inherent criminality of the
racial other points to an additional figure in the fantasy.** The third
party in the fantasy is the figure of authority that the racial other
dupes in order to enjoy the object. The racial other gets around the
barrier that the authority poses in a way that the subject cannot by
breaking the law or using subterfuge to evade the constraints that
govern everyone else. The ability of the racial other to evade the
restrictions of the law has a direct link to this figure's lack of
morality. Even though the fantasy portrays the racial other as lacking
the intelligence of the subject, this figure nonetheless has superior
skills in manipulation. Within the fantasy, the fecklessness of legal
authority against the racial other's stratagems require extraordinary
measures.]{.underline} **[This is the justification in American society
for the intervention of an extralegal force to contain the racial
other.]{.underline}** Entities such as [the Ku Klux Klan arise directly
from this fantasy formation as a response to the image of a black
evasion of traditional social authority.]{.underline} The bungling white
sheriff cannot prevent the black man from surreptitiously absconding
with white women. [The Klan sees itself as a necessary expedient for
disciplining black enjoyment that the white legal structure cannot
succeed in disciplining.]{.underline} L[aw is never enough for the
excess that black enjoyment represents. **Within the American version of
the racist fantasy, legitimate authority cannot successfully police
illicit black enjoyment.**]{.underline}16 Only the supplemental army of
whites that come together as the Ku Klux Klan can bring this excess back
into the confines of the social order through their disciplining
mechanisms, including the extraordinary measure of lynching. [**The Klan
is a supplementary police force that targets unrestrained black
enjoyment.**]{.underline} The inadequacy of the traditional authority
figures speaks to the vast difference that separates white and black in
the racist fantasy. [Traditional authority effectively contains white
enjoyment because it operates within the socially defined limits, but
the extreme sexuality and criminality of blackness places it beyond the
reach of the normal functioning of this authority.]{.underline} The
extraordinary status of a group like [the Klan testifies to the
extraordinary nature of black enjoyment.]{.underline} But [this
enjoyment exists only within a racist fantasy that posits its existence.
**Without this underlying racist fantasy and the outsized part that it
grants to black enjoyment, the Klan would be
unimaginable.**]{.underline} [The aim of the fantasy is the production
of enjoyment, which it accomplishes through its vision of the racial
other.]{.underline} [The racist fantasy locates enjoyment in the figure
of the racial other that both accesses the fantasy object and blocks the
subject's path to this object. Thus, **despite reviling this racial
other, the racist subject must unconsciously identify with this figure
in order to access the enjoyment that it hoards for
itself.**]{.underline} The supreme irony of racism is that the only
enjoyment available to the racist subject derives from the racial other
whom this subject reviles. [The racist enjoys through the target of the
racism, an action that is only possible through the mechanism of
fantasy.]{.underline} The primacy of the fantasy in relation to the
legal and social forms of racism becomes apparent when we take stock of
the effectiveness of trying to ameliorate racism by changing the legal
apparatus. [The emancipation of slaves in the United States at the end
of the American Civil War didn't lead to the gradual elimination of
racism but paved the way for the racist separatism of Jim Crow laws that
lasted until the 1960s.]{.underline} [The Civil Rights laws of the 1960s
finally did away with the legal discrimination of Jim Crow but left the
racist fantasy fully intact.]{.underline} Despite these measures and
those that followed after the 1960s, [racism remained ensconced in
social practices, workplace opportunities, policing methods, housing
allotments, and overall cultural attitudes. The waning of legalized
racism had the effect of sustaining or even exacerbating racism in these
extralegal channels.]{.underline} [**The persistence of racism depends
on an intractable underlying fantasy.** Racism endures because the
fantasy endures, not because we have failed to come up with the proper
legal remedy or the most enlightened educational methods.]{.underline}
**[The racist fantasy remains the same while the legal and social
structure changes.]{.underline}** Even proposals like slave reparations,
which seem like a radical remedy to racism, do not threaten the fantasy
and actually risk strengthening it by solidifying the image of the
racial other who illegitimately enjoys in the stead of the nonracial
subject. **[The fight against racism must target the enjoyment that
racism provides by disrupting the racist fantasy structure. As long as
the fantasy endures, racism will remain insoluble. Responding to racism
requires first understanding how the fantasy relates to desire and
enjoyment.]{.underline}**

### Thesis -- Anti-Anti-Oedipus

#### Subjectivity has only ever been defined by the ontological crack between the representational and the machinic, self-awareness and the neural wiring of the brain. In contrast to their machinic ontology of "becoming," "deterritorialization," and "quantum flux," we adopt an ontology of the Lack, one that forefronts the inevitable linguistic split at the heart of the subject. Despite their affective calls to militarize subjectivity, their politics of differential ontology can only ever blow apart the rift in subjectivity, leaving behind a desubjectified humanity in the wake of becoming. Only a politics that begins from the position of the void can ever hope to provide freedom for the subject. 

**Weatherill 17** (Rob Weatherill, master's degree in psychotherapy from
St. Vincents Univesity Hospital as well as the European Certificate in
Psychotherapy, "THE ANTI-OEDIPUS COMPLEX: Lacan, Critical Theory, and
Postmodernism," pgs. 91-96)//JRD

The reduction of the postmodern subject from the high Renaissance
estimation of man at the pinnacle of creation is almost complete:
through Copernicus, Darwin, Freud, Marx and Nietzsche, to the emergence
of the subject as pure immaterial void. [Notwithstanding the turn
towards appearances with phenomenology]{.underline} (albeit without
substantial realities "behind" them), [notions such as autopoeisis, the
"emerging properties" of systems, events e-venting themselves,
self-organising phenomena, quantum phenomena and the autonomy of pure
flux events, the ontology of pure becoming]{.underline} -- [these are
all part and parcel of the de-substantialised "reality," which barely
recovers some last flickers of subjectivity as the not-quitenothing of
contemporary theory. The brain--machine interface implies devices that
can realise Orwellian thought control, surveillance, communication, and
so on, the prospect of post-human "undead" virtual entities, the
blurring of the distinction between hardware]{.underline} (brain) [and
software]{.underline} (mind), [with the latter being able to detach from
the former completely and enter the virtual.]{.underline} [Of particular
fascination is the parallax between brain chemistry and
consciousness.]{.underline} Everything experienced has
neurophysiological correlates. For instance, brain processes accompany
intense religious experiences. However, [the question of causality
remains unresolved]{.underline}. Taking an ecstasy pill creates in the
user a feeling of ecstatic love towards the other. How does this
short-cut compare to a religious training and spiritual devotion over a
lifetime that might produce "naturally" similar experiences? Consider,
for instance, the dour father, melancholic most of his life, who, on his
deathbed is given morphine to relieve pain and seems cheerful,
good-humoured and loving, for the first time in his life! Does the
morphine neurophysiologically transform the father on his deathbed into
this "loving" man, or does it merely facilitate a very moving loving
last gesture ("choice") at the final moment, that was always buried
within this depressed man? Žižek cites Taylor's "skating" analogy of
consciousness.[20 Taylor understands consciousness as a relational
phenomenon where past memories, representations, emotions are used to
fill in and inform present sensory imputs.]{.underline} [This triggers a
host of related activities endowing the mental process with
substantiality, which, at some critical point, "lifts" the original
input into a new arena]{.underline}, like the skater who having launched
himself onto the ice glides off effortlessly. [Thus, consciousness
emerges released from the "friction" of the processing stages.
Consciousness floats free when a threshold is crossed. Therefore, there
is no consciousness without selfconsciousness.]{.underline} [The "I"
emerges as the self-relating interaction between present input and past.
The "self" is this escape into the fluid field of awareness and
de-centring, creating the impossibility of the I's immediate
self-presence.]{.underline} [Consciousness spins off from the substrate
that created it. 'A new quasi-object thus emerges']{.underline} (213),
[the final states of which involve "attractor nets" which attract
initial activity to become similar to their own, but remain
insubstantial as they were created, posited and generated by the very
substrates which react and interact to them in endless feedback loops.
So subject and object]{.underline} (attractor) [are almost
one.]{.underline} [The all-important minimal "gap" is also the
programmed space for freedom. Thus, there is no subject prior to neural
activity; no top-down, only bottom-up effects.]{.underline} Žižek
emphasises, '[cognitive scientists repeat again and again how our mind
does not possess a centralised control structure which runs top-down ...
it is rather a bricolage of multiple agents who collaborate
bottom-up']{.underline} (241). [The self is its own self-ing,
unaware]{.underline}21 [of the steps towards its own emerging, for good
evolutionary reasons to do with the necessity of rapid autopoietic
information processing.]{.underline} So when Žižek concludes that 'as
true Freudians, we should reject the notion of "Me" as a substantial
background of the ego' (217), he is following Lacan and indeed
Winnicott, whose understanding of "aliveness" is a similar process of
emergence via relating and "primary illusionment."22  [This is thinking
the unthinkable to Western minds -- a self-less world, living as being
no one -- forgetting that for two and a half millennia]{.underline},
Buddhist enlightenment has been practising the assumption of non-being.
[How do we get from passive primary illusionment, or the assumption of
"non-being," to something more active to do with subjectivity? Or how
does self-consciousness arise amidst and minimally separate from being
potentially overwhelmed by billions of neural data?]{.underline} [The
answer seems to be by some process of negation or by some malfunction or
fault in the nature of the smooth running of the system, otherwise we
would be no more than passive processing machines. Maybe
self-consciousness is stumbled upon through an "ontological
crack"]{.underline} (242) [in "reality" itself, which enables one to
say: YES, I AM HERE, over and against being a passive]{.underline}
[(unconscious) recipient of neuronal impulses.]{.underline} [Žižek
dramatises this crack by reference to a traumatic excess, through an
"error" that creates a measure of freedom.]{.underline} [The Cartesian
consciousness of pure reflection that gets caught up in emotion is the
price the mind has to pay for being lumbered with a body.]{.underline}
[Consciousness emerges through the disturbance of the organism's
homeostasis. Consciousness is the activity of dealing with
disturbances.]{.underline} For Damasio, for instance, 'the core you is
only born as the story is told, within the very story itself ... You are
the music while the music lasts'.23 In Lacanian terms, [the subject is
the 'answer of the Real']{.underline} (225). [The subject has the
possibility of answering for the Real.]{.underline} Žižek recalls the
joke about the patient in a large hospital ward who complains to the
doctor about constant noise and crying from the other patients. The
doctor replies that nothing can be done to prevent these suffering
people from expressing their despair, since they know they are dying.
The patient then asks why they cannot be put in a separate room for the
dying. And the doctor replies that this is the separate room for the
dying. However, [Žižek believes]{.underline} that Damasio leaves out of
consideration [the 'proper empty core of subjectivity', radically
exposed as it is, not to mere life experience, but also to affects such
as anxiety and horror; 'anxiety as correlative to confronting the Void
that forms the core of the subject; horror as the experience of
disgusting life at its purest, "undead" life']{.underline} (227). Here
again, Žižek is asserting the Lacanian void. [Not life experience as it
teems forth with Deleuze and Guattari to blow apart the constraining
Symbolic, but more like]{.underline} Badiou's '[from nothing to
nothing', the awareness of the raw flesh and blood body.]{.underline}
When the subject is violently attacked, for instance, the emotional
response is such that the cortical areas of the brain focus on the
stimulus and inhibit interest in sex and food. Such [stressors over
evolutionary time have acted to accelerate the development of our
cognitive and behavioural capacities, not least our acquisition of
language, "placed" as it is between these higher capacities and our
emotional sub-systems.]{.underline} Žižek emphasises this all-important
structural "gap" in connectivity between cognitive systems and language
on the one hand, and emotional abilities on the other. [This gap, or
point of "failure," where emotions lag behind cognition, defines our
humanity. In the absence of the gap humans would be
machines.]{.underline} To be specific and crucial for our argument[,
human emotions (like anxiety) arise when the human animal loses its
footing in biological functioning, requiring this loss to be
supplemented inadequately 'by the symbolically regulated emotions qua
man's "second nature"']{.underline} (228). Or to put it another way:
[imagine that our emotions and cognitive abilities precisely coincided,
with no lag or gap: was this not our central concern with the desiring
machines in their machinic-ness?]{.underline} [Rather than being human,
representational and failing, they seemed inhuman, presentational --
perfectly functioning monstrosities, incapable of anxiety and concern,
because the subject was reduced to a vestigial parasite of no
consequence.]{.underline} In addition, animals themselves are not
machines, because of a similar but narrower gap between their biological
instincts and cognitive abilities. The gap indeed may be a measure of
our evolutionary ascendancy, with lowly insects, for instance, being
more or less indistinguishable from machines, with their robotic
creepy-crawliness capable, for that reason, of inspiring fear and
anxiety. [This gives a new significance to the gaps or lacks of the
analytic session, the space to speak, the creation of silence,
punctuation and so on, in order to lessen the machinic automaticity of
alienated speech/action, and to increase "human" qualities for
reflection which can occur only in the division of the
subject.]{.underline} It is no exaggeration to say that Freud's
invention of the psychoanalytic space therefore is linked to
civilisation itself. [Without this reflective-gap-pause between the
drives and manifest behaviour, there is no civility.]{.underline} As
Damasio says, 'Memory, language, and intelligence make the difference,
not emotion'.24 This subject, Descartes' cogito, Kant's transcendental
subject, is exposed to the drive per se; to affects -- potentially, raw
anxiety, panic and horror. As suggested, [all "human" suffering rests in
this void of the pure subject. In this gap between the pre-Symbolic Real
of the biological machinery of emotion and the Symbolised feelings of
the autobiographical self lie everything that must be defended in this
work: the sense of the tragic, the melancholic, the human -- pity,
empathy and compassion, followed by the critical necessity for the
elaboration of language]{.underline} (the treasure house of signifiers)
qua containing and subjectivising of affect, the telling of dreams,
stories, narratives, etc. [All the contemporary trends,]{.underline} as
we have stressed, [point in the reverse direction towards the inhuman --
core unmediated machinic "experience"]{.underline} -- paroxysms of sex,
[convulsions of violence]{.underline}, pitilessness, autism, [jouissance
and the death drive.]{.underline}

### L -- Anticapitalism

#### Their vision can't take down capitalism because it begins with a vision for justice not freedom -- they'll result in unfreedom of subjects

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 80-82, 1 July 2013, MG)

[In contrast to Marxism and]{.underline} left -wing theories, [which
take justice as the point of departure in arguing against class society,
psychoanalysis begins with freedom --- or, more precisely, with the
**lack of freedom** that exists under capitalism. In other words,
psychoanalysis shares with Marxism a critical attitude toward capitalism
(though this is predominantly implicit in the former), but
psychoanalytic thought sees the problems that capitalism engenders in
other terms than Marxism does. It poses a different critique, and, as a
result, it implies a **different response**, a response that insists on
freedom as the fundamental value rather than equality]{.underline}.
Political philosophers constantly wrestle with the seemingly opposed
poles of freedom and justice. Isaiah Berlin famously characterizes
freedom and justice as positions that must constantly be measured
against each other in order to construct a good society. He claims: "The
extent of a man's, or a people's, liberty to choose to live as he or
they desire must be weighed against the claims of many other values, of
which equality, or justice, or happiness, or security, or public order
are perhaps the most obvious examples. For this reason, it cannot be
unlimited."4 [Most political philosophers who stress
freedom]{.underline} ( John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Friedrich Hayek,
and so on) [are implicitly or explicitly **procapitalist**, or at least
antisocialist, because socialism demands a restriction on individual
liberty.]{.underline}

[The thinkers who reject capitalism in the name of freedom, like
Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger, most often do so from the
**right** rather than the left]{.underline} ; they yearn for freedom
from the leveling tendencies of capitalist reification that produce an
equality of spirit if not of material wealth. They advocate for
aristocratic figures who transcend merely mercantile relations and
achieve self-overcoming or authentic being-toward-death, states of being
that the relative equality of capitalism works to prevent. According to
our usual way of thinking, [to stress freedom rather than justice is to
**acquiesce to at least some degree of class division**.5 This becomes
especially true if the freedom that one espouses is individual freedom,
as seems to be the case with psychoanalysis]{.underline}. In short,
because psychoanalysis places itself on the side of individual freedom,
it would appear also to be de facto on the side of the kind of
laissez-faire thinking we see in proponents of capitalism or the
aristocratic thinking visible in its right-wing opponents.

But what we encounter with psychoanalysis is something wholly different:
[rather than insisting that individual freedom **requires** class
division, psychoanalysis demonstrates how class society itself
**deprives** subjects of freedom. Its criticism of class society is
founded on its criticism of capitalism's restriction of freedom. One's
class status is the badge of one's unfreedom. In order to distinguish
oneself in terms of class, one must sacrifice freedom]{.underline}. This
holds not just within capitalist relations of production but for the
aristocratic ideal promulgated by Nietzsche and Heidegger as well. In a
certain sense, on a theoretical level the entire psychoanalytic project
targets the problems generated by a class structure in society, and the
implicit ideal guiding psychoanalytic treatment is that of a classless
society.6 We can even see this opposition to class society inherent in
the genesis of psychoanalysis.

Psychoanalysis emerges as such at the conjunction of the success and the
failure of the Enlightenment project. The fundamental impulse of the
Enlightenment is the insistence on subjects breaking from reliance on
authority and becoming free. As Kant puts it in his essay "What Is
Enlightenment?," "The motto of enlightenment is therefore: Sapere aude!
Have courage to use your own understanding!"7 On the one hand,
psychoanalysis represents the continuation and extension of this project
to the unconscious. In order to be authentically free, the subject must
confront not just its conscious subjection to authority but its
unconscious subjection as well. Insofar as it promotes this aim,
psychoanalysis is of a piece with the Enlightenment project as Kant
describes it. On the other hand, however, the emergence of
psychoanalysis stems from the failure to put this project into action.

Despite the Enlightenment's rejection of external authority and its
insistence on the subject's freedom, the dominance of this authority and
the absence of freedom persist in the post-Enlightenment epoch.
Authority continues to hold sway over the subject, but at the same time,
the enlightened subject comes to believe in its own freedom from such
authority. In its foundation, psychoanalysis addresses itself to the
persistence of unfreedom in a time when freedom appears readily
achievable. It is this contradiction that gives birth to psychoanalysis,
which is an effort to solve it, to help the subject gain the freedom
that the Enlightenment promises.

Social authority continues to restrict the subject in the wake of the
Enlightenment precisely because post-Enlightenment society never
achieved the Enlightenment ideal of equality. [The continued existence
of class division and of the inequality of class society **sustains the
unfreedom of subjects**. While Marxism shows the economic and social
costs of class exploitation for the exploited classes, psychoanalysis
emphasizes the psychic costs of capitalism for the whole society,
including those that most directly benefit from the capitalist system,
the upper and middle classes. Its concern is not the suffering that
**social or environmental conditions** explain but the suffering that
appears inexplicable, the suffering endured by those who, when one
regards their situation from the outside, should be happy]{.underline}.
Psychoanalysis arises in response to the psychic costs demanded by
capitalist, class-based society.8 Ironically, upper-class subjects pay
these costs disproportionately and thus suffer in their own way from the
inequities of the capitalist mode of production. Of course, no one wants
to lament the misfortune of the poor little rich kid or try to generate
sympathy for the suffering of Bill Gates. [The point is rather to
emphasize the **unfreedom** and lack of enjoyment that haunt the
beneficiaries of capitalism and all class society. **Even those who win
in the capitalist game lose**, and this provides what is perhaps the
ultimate indictment of the capitalist system. It is in this sense that
we should revisit the status of the analysands that psychoanalysis
treats.]{.underline}

#### Investing energy in radical revolutionary hope is a double-turn -- it buys into the same capitalist fantasy it critiques and gets coopted by the system

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 23-26, 20 September 2016, MG)

\*edited for ableist language

[The fundamental gesture of capitalism is the **promise**, and the
promise functions as the basis for capitalist ideology]{.underline}. One
invests money with the promise of future returns; one starts a job with
the promise of a higher salary; one takes a cruise with the promise of
untold pleasure in the tropics; one buys the newest piece of electronics
with the promise of easier access to what one wants. In every case [the
future embodies a type of satisfaction foreclosed to the present and
dependent on **one's investment in the capitalist system**. The promise
ensures a sense of dissatisfaction with the present in relation to the
future.]{.underline}

[One of the constant complaints from critics of capitalism is that the
capitalist system has the ability to incorporate **every attack by
integrating the attack into the system**. The accuracy of this truism is
readily apparent in the way that commodification works. Capitalism
seizes apparently revolutionary practices or figures and transforms them
into commodities. An acquaintance with a Che Guevara T-shirt or a Karl
Marx coffee mug]{.underline}, let alone the sight of sex toys in a
shopping mall or eco-friendly cars at the neighborhood dealership, seems
to bespeak its truth. [But the secret of capitalism's integration of
critique lies not in the process of commodification, no matter how
self-evident it appears. The secret is in the promise. If one inv**ests
oneself in the promise of the future**, through this gesture one accepts
the basic rules of the capitalist game.]{.underline}

[The promise of the better future is the foundation of the capitalist
structure, the basis for all three economic areas---production,
distribution, and consumption]{.underline}. If we examine only the field
of consumption, universal commodification seems to hold the key, whereas
if we confine ourselves to the field of production, the imperative to
accumulate appears foundational. In the field of distribution, it is the
idea of speed: one must move commodities to market in the least amount
of time possible. If we look at what these three fields have in common,
however, the answer is the promise of the future. One buys the commodity
to discover a potentially satisfying pleasure, one accumulates more
capital to some day have enough, and one speeds up the distribution
process to increase one's future profit.15 [Any sense of satisfaction
with one's present condition would have a]{.underline} ~~paralyzing~~
[\[**stopping\] effect** on]{.underline} each of these regions of [the
capitalist economy.]{.underline}

[This is the problem with the insistence **on revolutionary** **hope**:
it partakes of the logic that it tries to contest. Revolutionary hope
represents an investment in the structure of the promise that defines
capitalism. As a result, it is **never as revolutionary** as it believes
itself to be]{.underline}. Though obviously the act of promising
precedes the onset of a capitalist economy, once this economy emerges,
[the promise enters completely into the capitalist logic]{.underline}.
To take solace in the promise of tomorrow is to accept the sense of
dissatisfaction that capitalism sells more vehemently than it sells any
commodity. [As long as one remains invested in the promise as such, one
has **already succumbed to the fundamental logic of
capitalism**.]{.underline}

From the early Charles Fourier and Robert Owen to Fredric Jameson and
Antonio Negri, the idea of a better future has driven the Left in its
critique of capitalism. In his discussion of Marx, Jacques Derrida
exemplifies this type of investment, as he emphasizes the emancipatory
promise at the heart of his deconstructive politics. He notes, "[Whether
the promise promises this or that, whether it be fulfilled or not, or
whether it be unfulfillable, there is necessarily some promise and
therefore some historicity as future-to-come."16 While every other
concept is subject to deconstruction, this promise of "justice-to-come"
functions as the condition of possibility for deconstruction and thus
cannot be deconstructed]{.underline}. Deconstruction does not
encapsulate the entirety of anticapitalist politics today in any sense,
but Derrida's investment in the promise is representative. But it is
just this investment in the promise that must be abandoned, along with
the sense of dissatisfaction inherent in it. [As long as radical
politics operates with the belief that revolution will remove some of
the prevailing repression, it **accepts the ruling idea of capitalism**
and buys into the **fundamental capitalist fantasy**. No revolution can
transform dissatisfaction into satisfaction, but this is how revolution
has been conceived throughout the entirety of the capitalist epoch. The
revolutionary act has to be thought differently. The revolutionary act
is simply the recognition that capitalism already produces the
satisfaction that it promises]{.underline}.

And yet, this revolutionary act is far more difficult than storming the
Bastille or the Winter Palace. In the latter instances, all that is
required is sufficient political force. But [the break from the promise
of a better future seems **theoretically untenable** alongside a
position of critique. Critique appears to imply a future ideal from
which one launches the attack on the capitalist present.]{.underline}
The task is thus that of freeing critique from the promise of a better
future. Why would one be critical at all without such a promise? What
could be the possible ground for the critique?

This work attempts to answer these questions by situating the future not
as a possibility on the horizon but as the implicit structure of the
present. [There is]{.underline}, in other words, [no future to realize
except to accede to the exigencies that are already written into the
ruling capitalist system]{.underline}. The point of critique is not
promissory, not futural, but wholly immanent.

#### Prefer a psychic NOT material revolution -- their politics are born of monstrous excess and move towards eternal dissatisfaction

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 235-237, 20 September 2016,
MG)

[The recoil from abundance is **not** just a result of capitalist
ideology or the demands of the capitalist system. It is rather the
**inherent response of the subject,** whose desire depends on the
inaccessibility of the object. The subject will engage in acts of
selfsabotage at the moment when it approaches too closely its lost
object. This self-sabotage derives from an unconscious recognition of
the necessity of sustaining the object as absent.]{.underline}

[The subject's satisfaction depends on **sustaining a relation to
loss**]{.underline}. This satisfaction functions on the basis of the
object's absence. When we obtain the object---when we achieve
abundance---the emptiness of the object manifests itself, and we must
confront the traumatic connection between loss and satisfaction, as well
as the impossibility of ever obtaining satisfaction without loss or
complete satisfaction. It is impossible to obtain the object, and the
subject satisfies itself through this impossibility. The prominence of
loss in our subjectivity becomes apparent with abundance, which enables
us to see that we can never have the object. [The trauma of abundance is
at once the trauma of subjectivity itself. For this reason, scarcity is
not traumatic psychically for the subject in the way that abundance
is]{.underline}. We retreat into scarcity to avoid the recognition that
we require the object to be lost in order to enjoy it.

[But capitalism plays on appeal of scarcity and sustains the scarcity
that it requires through the subject's response to abundance. The
unconscious investment individual capitalist subjects have in scarcity
**props up the capitalist system**, which cannot survive with the image
of an abundance of resources]{.underline}. Abundance would undermine all
justifications for capitalist relations of production, and yet
capitalism itself has brought the world to the brink of this
abundance.28 By bringing up to the edge of abundance, capitalism paves
the way for its own overthrow.

THE NEW GRAVEDIGGERS

[The idea that capitalism would produce its own self-destruction is as
old as Marx]{.underline}. Marx identifies the proletariat as the
gravediggers of capitalism, and he sees them as a product of the
capitalist system. Capitalism produced the class that would inaugurate
its downfall. But [it turned out that the proletariat was ultimately
**unable, as a class, to overthrow capitalism.** Though capitalism
creates the conditions of its own overcoming, it also creates a
**psychic investment in its survival** among the working class and all
others]{.underline}. We greet the possibility of abundance with flight
rather than with open arms. [Capitalism has paved the way for abundance,
but in order for us to access it, **a psychic revolution is
necessary**.]{.underline}

[The proletarian revolution didn't fail because of a lack of class
consciousness or because of capitalism's ideological victory over the
proletariat or even because of its capacity for integrating subversive
challenges to the system into the system. No revolution successfully
displaced capitalism due primarily to the **capitalist economy's ability
to keep the trauma of abundance at bay**]{.underline}. Though capitalism
promises abundance for those invested in it, this is always a dream
deferred. It delivers scarcity in lieu of abundance, and this scarcity
is satisfying for us as subjects. It protects us from the trauma of
abundance.

Critics of capitalism often point out that its productive capacity has
developed to such an extent that it could now easily provide basic
necessities for the entire population of the world. The barrier to this
possibility is not inadequate distribution or the callousness of the
wealthy. It is instead the horror that abundance arouses in the
capitalist subject. The producer looks at abundance and sees the
disappearance of demand and thus the elimination of profit. Restaurants
prefer to throw away their excess stock rather than give it to homeless
shelters because the latter activity has the effect of suppressing
demand. If one hears of the possibility of obtaining French fries for
free, one becomes instantly reluctant to pay for them. The capitalist
thinks, along the lines of sexist parents advising their daughter to
refrain from sexual activity, that "if they can get the milk for free,
then they won't buy the cow." And in this line of thought, the
capitalist (unlike sexist parents) is not incorrect: [charitable acts
like donating excess food to homeless shelters do potentially erode the
value of the commodity and make subjects reluctant to pay for
it.]{.underline}

[The horror of abundance stems from the radical break that **we sustain
between it and scarcity**. In psychoanalytic thought, lack and excess
both have a central role, but they cannot be clearly divided from each
other. The subject's lack is correlative to an excessive satisfaction
that defines it. Because the subject lacks, it cannot find satisfaction
in the way that other living beings do]{.underline}. Instead, it enjoys
too much, and its every act is marked by this excessive satisfaction.
[As a result of the damage done by the signifier to the human animal, it
becomes a **figure of monstrous excess**.29]{.underline}

Both capitalism and socialism as traditionally conceived insist on the
radical separation of scarcity and abundance. [We exist now in a state
of scarcity, and if we adopt the proper politics, we will **accede to a
state of abundance**. This separation derives from the structure of
fantasy, which presents abundance as a fully satisfying solution to the
problem of scarcity. But the satisfaction that abundance provides is not
removed from the lack associated with scarcity. We can enjoy having too
much because we experience it through the mediation of
loss.]{.underline}

The point is not simply that we will remember our former state of
scarcity when we arrive at abundance but that any future abundance must
include scarcity within it. [Even when we have enough for everyone, lack
will **continue to structure our subjectivity**. We will still
experience ourselves as lacking subjects in an abundant world because no
amount of abundance will provide the missing lost object]{.underline}.
Abundance would make the psychic necessity of scarcity abundantly clear.

Even in abundance we will not lose scarcity. The mediation of loss will
continue to inform our existence. But we will lose the image of a future
enjoyment associated with abundance. That is to say, real abundance will
take from us the illusion of future abundance, which is why we are
constantly subverting the possibility of creating a society of abundance
or postscarcity. [Giving up this illusion is a political act in a world
of enforced scarcity; giving it up entails **abandoning the capitalist
ground under our feet.**]{.underline} A path toward this political act
is illuminated by the landmarks of modernist literature.

### L -- Anticapitalist Enjoyment

#### Their anticapitalist politics are exactly what good little capitalists strive to enjoy.

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan, Professor of English at the University of
Vermont, USA, "Enjoying What We Don't Have: The Political Project of
Psychoanalysis," pgs. 64-70)//JRD

It follows from this that the primary line of social critique launched
against capitalist society would focus on society's failure to live up
to its ideology. It is a truism of Marxist analysis --- especially aft
er the Frankfurt School --- to suggest that [capitalist ideology uses
the image of successful accumulation in order to hide the lack of
accumulation that most subjects endure and thereby produce
docility.]{.underline} According to this position, [images of
enjoyment]{.underline}, such as Hollywood f lms, [create a false or
illusory pleasure that helps to satisfy otherwise dissatisfied
subjects.]{.underline} While entranced by the romantic bond between
Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman or between Ashton Kutcher and Natalie
Portman, **[capitalist subjects do not think about their position within
the capitalist order of things.]{.underline}** **[These subjects invest
themselves in the image of enjoyment rather than in the real
thing.]{.underline}** This is why Theodor Adorno claims that "all mass
culture is fundamentally adaptation."23 [The promulgation of the image
of enjoyment]{.underline}, for Adorno and the Frankfurt School, [becomes
capitalist ideology's way of creating subjects who believe that they are
enjoying themselves while existing within the intractable
dissatisfaction of capitalism. In the face of capitalist ideology's
proliferation of such images, the task for the critical thinker becomes
one of tearing them apart, exposing the lack of enjoyment at the heart
of them and showing how]{.underline}, as Adorno and Max Horkheimer make
clear in their Dialectic of Enlightenment, [capitalism and its
ideological handmaiden]{.underline}, the culture industry, [never really
deliver.]{.underline}24 According to this view, [capitalist subjects
aren't really enjoying themselves despite feeling that they
are.]{.underline} Such subjects actually exist in a state of perpetual
dissatisfaction, and Adorno and Horkheimer hope to expose this
dissatisfaction for what it is in order to create a revolutionary
consciousness akin to their own. For Marxist thinkers like those of the
Frankfurt School, [the chief problem with capitalism is that it promises
an enjoyment without ever delivering on that promise (even to those who
seem taken care of by the capitalist system). But there is a further
problem that this critique doesn't touch --- the alignment of
accumulation and enjoyment.]{.underline} Few Marxist thinkers have
questioned this link. In fact, [the primary aim of the Marxist project
seems to be expanding or equalizing accumulation while retaining it as
the source of enjoyment.]{.underline} This attitude stems in large part
from Marx's own privileging of production and his vision of the
Communist revolution as an unleashing of the means of production. [In
contrast to capitalism, in which the restricted relations of production
erect a barrier to the expansion of the unrestricted means of
production, Communism would lift all such restrictions and allow for
excess production without restraint --- and thus enjoyment without
limit.]{.underline} [The ideal of enjoyment without limit is visible in
the politics articulated by many recent and contemporary thinkers
influenced by Marx. One can see it in Gilles Deleuze and Félix
Guattari's call for decoded flows]{.underline}, [Alain Badiou's plea for
more development of technology, and Paolo Virno's embrace of dissolved
boundaries.]{.underline}25 [These visions of the future involve
accepting the fundamental premise of capitalist ideology --- its
privileging of accumulation --- but there is a countervailing movement
within Marx's own thought that hints at a more radical critique of the
capitalist system.]{.underline} By examining this other dimension of
Marx's thought, [we can see the relationship between enjoyment and
pleasure as it operates within capitalist society and observe how a
politics of the death drive would intervene in this relationship Finding
Our Lost Enjoyment At times]{.underline}, Marx indicates how [the
capitalist mode of production transforms the driving force of human
activity]{.underline}, and he implicitly envisions Communism as a
corrective to this transformation. [The drive to accumulate, in this
view, ceases to be a drive inherent in human subjectivity itself, and an
alternative becomes visible.]{.underline} In the second volume of
Capital, Marx almost articulates the position of psychoanalytic
emancipatory politics directly when he says, "[For capitalism is already
essentially abolished once we assume that it is enjoyment that is the
driving motive and not enrichment itself]{.underline}."26 Here, [the
distinction between enjoyment and enrichment as motives for action
divides capitalism from other unmentioned economic systems. The
alternative to accumulation is]{.underline} satisfaction --- or, more
specifically, the recognition of our satisfaction. the fundamental
problem with capitalism is this: it doesn't allow us to recognize our
enjoyment or even to grasp enjoyment as what drives us. [It's not that
capitalism deprives us of the satisfaction]{.underline} involved with
thinking, loving, theorizing, singing, painting, and fencing (to use
Marx's examples cited above) [but that it doesn't allow us to view
satisfaction as a possible motive for our acts. We can think of the
drive for enjoyment or a drive centered around enjoyment as a
possibility existing outside of the capitalist system. T is drive ---
the death drive --- would have no purpose other than enjoyment, which is
to say that it would operate in contrast to the accumulative logic of
the capitalist drive. The capitalist drive to accumulate represents a
distortion of the death drive, a rewriting of it that changes its
structure. But the capitalist drive to accumulate does not simply do
away with enjoyment. As a rewriting of the death drive, it continues to
provide the enjoyment that this drive does, though this drive to
accumulate makes it more diffi cult for subjects to identify the site
where they enjoy. Our investment in capitalism doesn't occur through a
complete neglect of our enjoyment but depends in a fundamental way on
its ability to deliver enjoyment. **If capitalist subjects weren't
actually enjoying themselves at all, they would not continue to be
capitalist subjects.**]{.underline} We really do enjoy ourselves within
the capitalist universe --- the death drive continues to function ---
but we don't enjoy in the way that capitalist ideology tries to convince
us that we do. Political struggle is not simply a struggle over the
right to enjoy certain goods and the distribution of this right. It is
also --- even predominantly --- a struggle over how we identify and
locate our enjoyment. Capitalist ideology is triumphant today because it
has won this struggle. [As capitalist subjects, we must define enjoyment
in terms of accumulation: one enjoys insofar as one accumulates objects
of desire.]{.underline} This definition has become ubiquitous: according
to the prevailing logic today, even the enjoyment that derives from
romance comes from acquiring one's object of desire. But this is not the
only way of figuring enjoyment. [One of the most important political
tasks for emancipatory politics today consists in transforming our way
of thinking about enjoyment --- breaking the link that capitalist
ideology has forged between accumulation and enjoyment. At every turn,
capitalist ideology works to persuade subjects that their enjoyment
derives from acquiring and having objects of desire. As a result,
popular fantasies place most of their focus on the moments when subjects
obtain these objects.]{.underline} Rather than emphasizing the points at
which a couple struggles through the quotidian aspects of their
relationship, the typical Hollywood romance stresses the moment of the
couple's union. The entirety of Sleepless in Seattle (Nora Ephron, 1993)
builds to the climactic embrace of the long-separated couple, and this
embrace, according to the logic of the film, provides us as spectators
with the ultimate enjoyment. The final embrace is the high point (the
point at which each lover has the love object), and we leave the theater
convinced that this embrace, this union, is the source of our enjoyment.
In this way, the very structure of popular fantasies today underlines
the link between acquisition and enjoyment. The problem with this stress
on the enjoyment of accumulation is not simply that it tends to produce
a destructive society with egoistic subjects (though it certainly does)
but that it doesn't really work. When we watch a film like Sleepless in
Seattle, our enjoyment --- if we have any at all --- does not in fact
derive from the moment when the lovers obtain their love objects. To
understand where to locate our enjoyment of the film, we must observe
the rigid distinction between enjoyment and pleasure. [Pleasure
occurs]{.underline}, for Freud, [with a release of excitation, when we
are able to overcome the barriers in the way of realizing our desire for
this release. While pleasure provides a good feeling and a sense of
well-being, enjoyment uproots us and disturbs our
well-being.]{.underline} We have pleasures, but enjoyment, in some
sense, has us. Though the proper spectator clearly experiences pleasure
at the conclusion of Sleepless in Seattle, she or he does not enjoy at
this point. Instead, this marks the moment at which our enjoyment
dissipates. We enjoy the events leading up to the denouement --- the
struggles of each character with the absence of the object --- not the
acquisition of the object itself. the moment of acquiring the object
represents the end, not the beginning, of our enjoyment, though it does
mark the point at which we experience the most pleasure. There is a link
between Freud's conception of the pleasure principle as the motivating
force of human activity and the capitalist drive to accumulate. In both
cases, the focus is on the end point --- either the psyche ridding
itself of stimulation and achieving pleasure or the subject obtaining
capital and commodities in order to have things to enjoy without worry.
But what distinguishes them is their diff erent ways of envisioning the
end point: according to the logic of the pleasure principle, the subject
works to eliminate excitation, and according to that of the capitalist
drive, the subject tries to increase excitation through the acquisition
of more and more commodities. We might reconcile the two positions by
thinking of acquisition as a way of calming psychic excitation while
enhancing the possibilities for physical excitation. If one has enough
capital, one might avoid disturbing thoughts about losing it. But
sustaining the homology between the psychoanalytic conception of
motivation and the drive to accumulate becomes impossible when we turn
from the pleasure principle to the death drive as the fundamental
psychoanalytic category. Before 1920 Freud identifies enjoyment and
pleasure; he sees enjoyment as the product of the activity of the
pleasure principle. As he puts it in "Instincts and Their Vicissitudes"
in 1915, "The aim \[Zeil\] of an instinct is in every instance
satisfaction, which can only be obtained by removing the state of
stimulation at the source of the instinct."27 Satisfaction or enjoyment
results from eliminating stimulation, which is precisely what the
pleasure principle demands. After writing Beyond the Pleasure Principle,
however, Freud ceases to credit the pleasure principle with being the
primary explanatory category for human activity.28 He retains pleasure
as a category, but the death drive dislodges it from its foundational
place. Rather than explaining human activity itself, the pleasure
principle begins to function as a supplement to the death drive as an
explanatory category. Pleasure supplements the death drive by providing
a lure for consciousness. The subject actively takes up the path of the
death drive --- a drive that uses the subject and produces enjoyment at
the cost of the subject's well-being or self-interest --- because
moments of pleasure render it bearable and even attractive. But this
pleasure can only be imaginary: it is more the image of a future
pleasure to be obtained than an actual pleasure experienced. This is the
fundamental problem with the logic of accumulation and the would-be
pleasure that derives from enrichment. [Every capitalist subject has
experienced the dissatisfaction that inevitably results from actually
obtaining the desired commodity.]{.underline} As an absent object, the
object of desire appears to embody incredible pleasure, but when this
object becomes present, it devolves into an ordinary object. [In the act
of obtaining the object of desire, we deprive this object of its very
desirability. The pleasure embodied in the object exists only insofar as
it remains out of reach for the subject.]{.underline} Because we desire
the object as absent, actually obtaining the object provokes
disappointment rather than pleasure. No matt er how pleasurable the
presence of the object is, this presence never offers us what we desired
in the object. [The great lie of capitalist ideology is its insistence
that one can enjoy the act of accumulation itself.]{.underline} This act
inevitably produces disappointment in the subject who buys into it, and
this disappointment is never more acute than just after what promised to
be the most satisfying acquisition. For capitalist subjects, the
disappointment that follows acquisition of a treasured commodity is not
a reason to abandon the process of accumulation. In fact, it suggests to
such subjects that they simply haven't taken accumulation far enough,
that they need more. [In this way, capitalist ideology feeds off the
disappointment that it produces.]{.underline} If it actually produced
the ultimate enjoyment for subjects that it promised them, they would no
longer feel compelled to enter into the process of accumulation. After a
little accumulation, subjects would become satisfied and thereby cease
to be capitalist subjects, properly speaking. [Capitalism needs
dissatisfied subjects, but it also needs subjects who believe that the
ultimate satisfaction is possible. This is accomplished by locating the
ultimate satisfaction in the act of accumulation. Subjects invest
themselves in capitalist ideology because they accept its map of
enjoyment. The key to combating this ideology lies not in undermining
the fantasies that it proffers but in revealing where our enjoyment is
located, in proffering a different map. Rather than enjoying the process
of accumulation, we enjoy the experience of loss --- the loss of the
privileged object.]{.underline} Accumulation allows us to have objects,
but it doesn't allow us to have the object in its absence. This is why
accumulation always leads not to satisfaction with what one has but to
the desire to accumulate more and more. [Loss, in contrast, permits us
to experience the object as such. Th rough the act of losing the
privileged object, we in effect cause this privileged object to emerge.
Th ere is no privileged object prior to its loss. Understood in this
way, loss becomes a creative act. the loss of the object is the
foundation of our enjoyment because this act elevates an object above
the rest of the world and embodies that object with the power to satisfy
us]{.underline}

### L -- BwO -- Deleuze

#### Do no place your bets on a losing hand -- the Body without Organs will fail. Instead bet on Organs without a Body. Their moralism is nothing more than the reduction of bodies to a machinic nightmare, the regression to the human, all too human idealisms of "good" and "evil."

**Weatherill 17** (Rob Weatherill, master's degree in psychotherapy from
St. Vincents Univesity Hospital as well as the European Certificate in
Psychotherapy, "THE ANTI-OEDIPUS COMPLEX: Lacan, Critical Theory, and
Postmodernism," pgs. 91-96)//JRD

[Žižek believes that the genius of Deleuze resides in his
"transcendental empiricism," where the impersonal machinic flow of pure
becoming teems infinitely more richly than the dullness of perceived
being.]{.underline} The genius of the real philosopher is that his
thinking enlivens ordinary reality. You can see the stratifications and
segmentations of political opinion that resist any
deterritorialisations: people remain in their defensive molar
aggregations, locking in intensities, repelling with their paranoid
machines. [You can trace the molecular developments of youthful enquiry,
the lines of flight, the singularities, before they are bounced off the
solid wall of language and reabsorbed into the existing sediments. You
can sense the spinning in the black hole of the empty BwO of the addict.
Deleuze "sees" the quantum level before the collapse of wave forms. He
imagines the infinite possibilities of fluid open multiplicities, before
they precipitate out as concrete actualities.]{.underline} [Deleuze's
ultimate reference, following Nietzsche, is "pure becoming," against the
dull opacity of Being. The assertion of continuous movement, flight,
break-flows, escapes, fluxes, etc., is the pure hidden potential of the
virtual, not to be misunderstood as the "before" and "after" of any
historicism, but pure becoming]{.underline} [-- no stratigraphy or
evolution, no development or progress, no context, no reference to real
events.]{.underline} Deleuze was the key interpreter of Nietzsche in
France. [Nietzsche pointed out that nothing important is ever free from
a "nonhistorical cloud." This leads to the paradox that something really
new can only emerge via repetition out of the cloud, the repetition of
the past "failure" to realise itself properly.]{.underline} Žižek cites
Walter Benjamin's example of the October Revolution's repetition of the
French Revolution, "redeeming" the latter's alleged failure. [What is
repeated is the transcendental-non-historical-]{.underline}cloud that
was betrayed, missed, not fully realised at the time. The Spirit
(Becoming) has been betrayed by the Letter (Being). It is tempting to
add that schizoanalysis, as the true Spirit of human freedom, has been
betrayed by the (repressive) Letter of psychoanalysis. Schizoanalysis
might redeem the failure of psychoanalysis: the "betrayal" by the later
Freud of the originality of the early Freud. Schizoanalysis is more
(early) Freudian, closer to the Freudian spirit, than all the subsequent
Freudians -- more Freud than Freud himself! Stick to the Letter and you
betray the Spirit -- always becoming --
fluid-multiplemolecular-singular. Schizoanalysis is the truly new
version of psychoanalysis, redeeming its potential vitality, its failure
to aspire to full liberation. This is the lesson to be learnt from our
authors. Against the thrust of the previous chapter, Žižek asserts that,
'[What Deleuze calls "desiring machines" concerns something wholly
different from the mechanical'.]{.underline}1 Against dull machinic
repetition of the same, what emerges is the miraculous new, on the lines
of Chesterton's Christian ontology.2 For instance, there is nothing
"mechanical" in the sun's rising every morning; on the contrary, it
reveals the miracle of God's creativity! Therefore, [our negative
assertion, that "machinic" refers to an inhuman banality, emphasising
not the miraculously new but quite the reverse, the totally
repetitive -- the emerging post-human, the ticking atomic clock, should
not be conceded here but held in suspense.]{.underline}3
[While]{.underline} the schizo[\[schizoanalysis\] may celebrate this
miraculous "becoming machine" of everything,]{.underline} the
neurotic[\[psychoanalysis\] fears the increasing reductionism and
automation of human experience, the translation of the most sublime
experiences into pure "functioning" and the inherent violence of such
thinking.]{.underline} The more human capacities are handed over to
prosthetics, the more we emerge as de-substantialised (parasitic)
subjects controlled by the machanosphere and artificial intelligence.4
The proximity of miraculating machines can terrify. [After he had
settled, a man described his ordeal on the main thoroughfare of the
capital city. He had had a sudden real-isation. Reality had decomposed.
He heard the grinding mechanics, gears, bearings, pistons, explosions in
the engines of passing lorries and buses without any mediation or
imaginary filter, as in a nightmare, and he had collapsed in
shock.]{.underline} A woman described the horror she felt when she saw
the bony skeletal articulations of people and the skulls like an X-ray
machine. Anorexics can describe in minute detail the machinations of
food in their digestive machines. A man says he will only sleep in a
room that contains hundreds of ticking alarm clocks all timed to go off
at the same hour. Another says, all I can tell you is that we are fluid
luminous beings made of contracting and relaxing fibres. Another man
says, 'I am a block of ice'. [In this, he has all the frozen smoothness
of a BwO.]{.underline} The schizos and [our authors "see" machinic
assemblages everywhere and these monstrosities approach the
Real]{.underline} in the Lacanian sense, or Hegel's "Objective Spirit."
[Žižek points to a crack in the edifice of the simple opposition between
molar and molecular, between being and becoming, the Symbolic and the
Real. These opposed registers are not equal and opposite.
Representation]{.underline} (Symbolic) [cannot be opposed to
production]{.underline} (Real). [With Deleuze, 'The virtual field is
(re)interpreted as that of generative, productive forces, opposed to the
space of representations'. And for Žižek, the proper site of production
cannot be the virtual space as such, which is the "empty" Lacanian Real,
but, rather, the passage from it to constituted representational
reality.]{.underline} [Žižek therefore questions the duality of
Deleuzian thinking -- becoming versus being; the nomadic versus the
State; the molecular versus the molar; the schizo versus the
paranoiac.]{.underline} He concludes, ['This duality is ultimately
over-determined as "the Good versus the Bad"']{.underline}.5 [To pursue
Žižek's ontological "crack," the first step is to question this simple
duality with similar duality,]{.underline} that of Badiou's Being and
Event[, emphasising their ultimate incompatibility.]{.underline}
[Event(s) cannot be simply mapped onto the field of becoming which
generates the order of being. Event(s) are only be posited
retrospectively. Only later can we "believe" that this was indeed "an
Event," standing out from the multitude -- an Event to which to remain
politically faithful in a militant way, as opposed to the ephemeral
indiscriminate spontaneous way of the "anarcho-désirants."]{.underline}
Žižek suggests that [our authors are doing no more than re-heating the
old humanist-ideal: regressing from the "reified" and reduced result in
the world, to its abundant productive becoming. It is the old story of
vitalism, the elevation of life to a new "becoming."]{.underline}
Whereas, Žižek believes that Badiou's "mathematics" is the only adequate
ontology: 'the meaningless Real of the pure multitude, the vast infinite
coldness of the Void'; i.e. the indifference of truth to the chaotic
flow of the world. While Deleuze asserts life in its multiple
singularities, for Badiou there is only the Hegelian from 'nothing to
nothing'.6 Žižek creates another reversal. [Against the notion of BwO
and its high-intensity prolonged pleasure/joy, the pure body of immanent
desire, he pits "organs without a body" (OwB).]{.underline} The latter
might be, for instance, the lonely masochist staging his sterile rituals
for futile pleasure -- maybe one of those failed, empty or cancerous
BwOs. Žižek complains that **[Anti-Oedipus is the worst book Deleuze
ever wrote,]{.underline}** citing the political ideological "bad
influence" of Guattari. He concludes that [our authors, despite
protestations to the contrary, end up as 'the ideologist\[s\] of late
capitalism'.]{.underline} For Éric Alliez, however, Deleuze and Badiou
typify the polarity of French philosophy. For Badiou[, Deleuze's work
and politics lacks coherent theoretical autonomy, being imbued with
Romantic mystical pretensions.]{.underline} Badiou sees mercantile
possibilities in communities demanding their singular recognitions --
women, gays, transsexuals, ethnic groups, etc., although clearly not
what our authors had in mind with their revolutionary explosive field of
immanence. As Alliez says, [The BwO is to be considered as the very body
of desire, as its purest expression, so absolutely coincident inseparate
from what it can do that it relates back to an unliveable power, a power
which is as such the pre-condition of every real experience of desire,
driven by the necessity of \[machinic\] constructions that cut
\[striate\] the BwO in itself']{.underline}.7 Thus, [Anti-Oedipus
confronts structuralism head-on by establishing beyond any doubt the
biopolitical primacy of desire. In other words, the deterritorialising
lines of flight, etc., come first and are therefore not reactive to
established biopolitical structures. The schizo is not a revolutionary
subject]{.underline} (or indeed a "subject" at all), [but merely the
site of interruption, mutation, rupture, the potential for revolution,
schizzing effects -- undercutting state, party and even utopian
communitarian projects. Inevitably, desire becomes exile, the
unconscious is orphan.]{.underline} What Alliez concludes is that we
should not oppose the Badiou--Žižek--Lacanian--structuralist axis with a
shallow post-structural, 'making room for a spontaneous democracy of
desire and its pop-philosophical flights of fancy', but oppose it much
more vibrantly, 'with [a Biopolitics of Multitudes]{.underline} whose
socially constitutive character is the ontological fact that [sustains
the constructivism of desire']{.underline}.8

### L---Black Community

**Despite their efforts, the aff cannot [redeem]{.underline} race of the
psychic violence such a concept necessitates---the idea of a "black body
politic" [is]{.underline} and [always will be]{.underline} a
[fantasy]{.underline} that recreates the trauma of enslavement**

**George 16** (Sheldon George, Professor of English at Simmons
University, 2016 , \"Trauma and Race: A Lacanian Study of African
American Racial Identity\", pp 30-36)//guyB

It may be argued that [central to the discursive efforts of African
Americans, from ex-slaves to later social activists and scholars, is an
attempt to establish firmly a shaming gaze that does not merely wince at
the spectacles of white transgressions]{.underline}. But [given the
continued power of the master signifier whiteness to define the
discursive field of race and restrict the agency of African Americans,
not just racism but also **the concept of race itself carries over into
the present a signifying chain**, founded in the past, that **enables
both an assault on African Americans' fantasies of being and a possible
confrontation with lack**]{.underline}. Here [we may conjoin the
signifiers of race with the scars of the slave master's whip in the
formation of]{.underline} what Spillers terms [a "phenomenon of marking
and branding \[that\] actually 'transfers' from one generation to
another, finding its various symbolic substitutions in an efficacy of
meanings that repeat the initiating moments]{.underline}."89 Lacan
speaks of "[the glory of the mark," the "mark on the skin" inscribed
through such acts as "flagellation]{.underline}"; he points to [this
mark as producing the subject's body as **an "object of
jouissance**."]{.underline}90 This flagellation is tied to what Spillers
describes as [**a translation of "the captive body" into a "potential
for pornotroping**," a process of objectification that we see in the
actions of the slave master described by the ex-slaves]{.underline}.91
Lacan states that [it is "irrefutable" that this objectification is "one
of the ways in which the Other enters one's world," functioning as an
apparatus of jouissance in the manners we have already
described]{.underline}.92 But what is suggested most radically in
Lacan's work is also a process by which [this objectification may become
the grounds of identity for the abjected subject]{.underline}. Lacan's
theory helps us identify [the markings of the master's whip and the
jouissance they produce as a very source of African American
identity.]{.underline} [Lacan associates jouissance with excess, not
just an excess of pleasure but also an excess that turns to
"displeasure," an excess that leaves one in a state of
"suffering."]{.underline}93 Particularly in his reading of the fort-da
game played by Freud's grandson, however, Lacan emphasizes that [it is
only through the suffering of jouissance that the kind of narcissism
found in the mirror stage's conflation of mother and child is replaced
by **an independent subjectivity built on lack**. Lacan reads the toy
reel]{.underline} that the child of the fort-da game throws over the
edge of his crib when the mother leaves the room not just as a signifier
but [as the object a]{.underline}, that which, [in signifying an
unsignifiable loss, allows the subject to jump the "ditch," the central
lack that the mother's disappearance creates "on the frontier of his
domain]{.underline}."94 [This object a]{.underline}, Lacan says, [is "a
small part of the subject that detaches itself from him" to symbolize
some act of "self-mutilation" or other cruel loss through which the
subject finds the means to his or her own
self-designation]{.underline}.95 This object a, this symbol of the lost
part of the self, Lacan says, [is "what in the end gives the specular
image of the apparatus of the ego its real support, its
consistency]{.underline}, . . . sustained within by this lost object."96
Lacan states that [it is through this object that "jouissance is
introduced into the dimension of the subject's being]{.underline}."97
[This lost object is the means through which the subject's
self-identification compulsively masks and concurrently establishes
resonance with the unsymbolized trauma of the Real]{.underline}.
[Race]{.underline}, I propose, [is **an object a established around lack
as much for African Americans as it is for whites**]{.underline}**.**
[The function of the object a]{.underline} Lacan outlines in his reading
of the fort-da [is not only to signify loss but also **to displace it
through acts of repetition,** to reassociate traumatic entrance into the
Symbolic with a temporally and qualitatively distinct moment of trauma
later experienced in the Symbolic. In place of the subject's traumatic
division in language, the mother's departure from the room becomes
temporally defined as the cause of the split]{.underline} or "Spaltung
in the subject[," which is then repetitively represented as the true
source of loss that is also "overcome by the alternating
game]{.underline}, fort-da."98 I read [slavery as serving the function
of repetition for African Americans that Lacan here assigns to the
mother's departure, as the Symbolic and temporal signifier of a
traumatic loss that is more deeply psychic]{.underline}. [Slavery comes
to serve this function because **it eruptively displays psychic
lack**]{.underline}. Lacan defines repetition as "[the commemoration of
an irruption of jouissance]{.underline}."99 [Where this irruption
designates a breach inward and a splitting of the subject, I identify in
slavery **a simultaneous eruption or outpouring of jouissance that finds
its Symbolic representatives across distances of time through the
signifiers of race**]{.underline}. I suggest that [both these residual
signifiers (even when redefined by African Americans) and the acts of
racism that may grow out of them are repetitions that function in
relation to the jouissance of this past that both displaces and displays
psychic lack]{.underline}. [Slavery's exhibition of the slave's lack and
its insistence upon the master's exultant and autonomous being produced
within the Symbolic a certain excess or surplus of jouissance, enabling
discursive and power structures through which access to jouissance
became unusually open to manipulation]{.underline}. [Slavery thus marks
a traumatic moment in which jouissance as both lack and excess is
localized]{.underline}. This eruption of jouissance [thereby positions
**slavery as a temporal representative of the lack** that is the
Lacanian Real.]{.underline} It is the [signifiers of race]{.underline}
that help to both [localize this lack temporally and bind it to the
identity of those subjects who come to be called African
Americans]{.underline}. [The concept of race came to center African
American identity]{.underline} because [it not only augmented the
signifier's essential function of striking being from the subject,
actively restricting the slave's access to fantasies of self, but also
presented itself as an object of contention that promised to
re-establish the illusory existence of this being]{.underline}. As is
true in the case of the child of the fort-da, [the
signifier]{.underline}, as designator of the object a[, is ever a
protective source of identity, and so **race is often exceedingly
empowering for African Americans**]{.underline}. In slavery and beyond,
[it offers subjects a sense of direction, belonging, and
self-worth]{.underline}. But **[race alone could guarantee neither
community nor being for enslaved blacks]{.underline}**. [To truly
understand the notion of being that slaves were able to construct for
themselves]{.underline} and to appreciate the jouissance of suffering to
which this being yet binds contemporary African Americans, [we must look
to the function of religion in slavery]{.underline}. Because [efforts
during slavery to resignify race were especially open to contention,
enslaved blacks were slow to embrace race truly as a source of
being]{.underline}. And so, in truth, [the nascent African American
identity that began to cohere in times of slavery more often employed
religion both to contend against and to positively resignify race in an
effort to constitute this being, thus setting the stage for an emphasis
on religion in African American culture that is yet present
today]{.underline}. What we find in slavery is that [the unity developed
by enslaved blacks emerged not primarily because of a sense of their
"racial" commonality but because blacks were bound together by a common
circumstance that both accentuated existing similarities across the
group and demanded this unification as a source of resistance and a
means of survival]{.underline}.100 More likely to recognize differences
within the racial group than the masters who asserted the power to
define the group, **[individual slaves formed alliances and group
affiliations that were more nuanced than any allowed by the category of
race]{.underline}**. The slave narrative of James Albert Ukawsaw
Gronniosaw, who spends much of his enslavement on a merchant ship before
landing in New York City, supports this point, displaying the internal
differences among slaves that prevented their easy unification around
race as a source of being. Gronniosaw's inability to identify with the
other slaves in his new master's household not only leads to his
conviction that the "servants were all jealous, and envied \[him\] the
regard, and favour, shewn \[him\] by \[his\] master" but also
facilitates his construction of a narrative that asserts God will not
save Gronniosaw's fellow blacks or "those born under every outward
Disadvantage, and in Regions of the grossest Darkness and Ignorance" if
they lack "knowledge of the \[biblical\] Truth."101 Written after he is
freed and no longer has even the common circumstance of a mutual
enslavement to link him to the larger slave community, Gronniosaw's
narrative seeks support not for members of this community but for his
own starving family in dire need of money. Gronniosaw's narrative
maintains that through the bondage under which members of his race still
exist, the "Lord undertook to bring" Gronniosaw "out of Darkness into
His marvelous light."102 What Gronniosaw's religious rhetoric shows is
that [race by itself could not unify slaves or fully promise them
being]{.underline}; functioning at times in direct opposition to race,
within and beyond slave communities, [it was primarily religion that
made this promise]{.underline}. Such a focus by slaves like Gronniosaw
on religion as the source of the object a that grounded being must be
read within the context of a broader slaveholding society that
celebrated the Christian view of God as the Supreme Being, a view
expressed in the biblical statement "I am the one who is," by which,
Lacan notes, "[God asserts his identity with Being]{.underline}."103 The
object a, Lacan shows, is that which presents itself as not just a
semblance of being but also being's "remainder."104 From this Lacanian
perspective, we may read the a as the source of the soul that, for the
Christians to whom Gronniosaw addresses his narrative, links mankind to
the true Supreme Being; this a functions as the divine remnant at the
core of man, the spiritual essence, shaped by God's own hands, that
transcends man's earthly existence. Both within man and external to man,
this extimate core as object a is what sets man on the path of a true
love of his neighbor as the self. It is the source of a kind of love
that Lacan calls "soul loving," whereby subjects "love each other as the
same in the Other," aiming this love at the extimate object a that is
both absent from the self and illusorily present in the other.105 [Where
Gronniosaw wishes to establish the similarity of his soul to that of his
white reader's through use of his religious rhetoric, he struggles
against a racism that functions to define his core self as blackened by
the absence of God's light, as devoid of the soul's divine
spark]{.underline}. This struggle emerges because [the soul loving he
beseeches of the white other is equally]{.underline}, I would argue,
[the root of race love, whereby individuals of the same race come to
love each other as mirrored images of the self,]{.underline} finding in
each other the same object the self pursues, the object belonging to the
self that is absent from the self. [This absence fuels a desire for
racial unification and solidarity that stands at odds with the
universalism]{.underline} ostensibly glorified by religious soul loving
of the neighbor. I will show in chapters 2 and 3 how race comes to
supplant religion as a source of this core object a that offers African
Americans a semblance of being, but what we find in Gronniosaw's
narrative is [race as an impediment to any loving of the neighbor's
soul]{.underline}. Within slavery, [**race both obstructed cross-racial
unity and impaired creation of an extimate object a capable of unifying
blacks intersubjectively** into a group identity]{.underline}. Because
[race was the root of slavery's assertion of the nonbeing of the
slave]{.underline}, race [had to be redefined and buttressed by religion
for it to function as a source of being]{.underline}. Not only religion
but also communal activities like group worship or singing and working
together all helped to create the unified group to which this being
could be assigned.106 Establishing unity through communal activity,
religion and spiritual slave songs were especially important to both the
reformation of slave identity and the gradual development of notions of
race as possible sources of being. Emblematic of this fact is Lawrence
Levine's observation that "the single most persistent image of the slave
songs is that of \[African Americans as\] the chosen people."107 Through
attempting to supplant the authority of the slave master with that of
God, [slaves sought to recast the veil of fantasy over the psychic place
of lack uncovered by the institution of slavery. Religion became the
source of a fantasy grounded more in the patriarchs of the Old Testament
than in race]{.underline}, allowing for identification with heroes like
Moses, Joshua, Jonah, and Noah, who were delivered from their own
suffering and that of the world around them. Through such fantasies,
[the slave's suffering could be contextualized as proof of a unique
access to being, as proof of one's divine selection for
salvation]{.underline}. This is precisely what we see in Gronniosaw, who
asserts, "I am willing, and even desirous of being counted as nothing,"
for "I know that . . . every trial and trouble that I've met with . . .
\[has\] been sanctified to me."108 Gronniosaw takes the concept of the
chosen to its extreme, articulating his worthiness of financial aid from
others through a demonstration of his position of distinction from all
sinners, white and black. Seeking to constitute himself as a chosen one
by rhetorically severing this religiously sanctified self from
established notions of race, Gronniosaw simultaneously distances himself
particularly from other blacks because he realizes that [as race
augments the notion itself of a group identity it also implicitly
contests the fantasies religion allows]{.underline}. Though these
revivifying religious fantasies of being often promised salvation in
this world, and not just the next, the limits of the agency they
covenanted were displayed in the ability of slave masters to themselves
bind race to religion in order to justify notions of white supremacy.
Such biblical events as Noah's cursing of the descendants of his son Ham
to forever become the servants of all other men were significant to this
process. Through this story, whites could not only promote the
association of blacks with Ham, whose name "is a vulgarization of Cham,"
or ch'm, the Hebrew word for black, but also present black skin as the
sign of a servitude and cursed suffering that was divinely
sanctioned.109 This suffering, bound to race, is merely the obverse of
that constructed in the rhetoric of Gronniosaw. What we see through such
contention over race and suffering is that **[African Americans
encounter continuous obstacles in the construction of their fantasy of
being through reliance upon the apparatus of race]{.underline}**.
[Because race as object a today still remains discursively tied to the
trauma it attempted to compensate for in slavery, African American
identity ever circles this traumatic past, defined by a suffering that
the concept of racial identity alternately attempts to alleviate and
traumatically unfurls]{.underline}. As Lacan notes, "[There is nothing
more difficult than separating a word from discourse]{.underline}. . . .
As soon as you begin at this level, the whole discourse comes running
after you."110 [Still able to function as a stigma for African
Americans, what the word "race" marks is a fantasy difference that not
only discursively justified the master's brutal and traumatic scarring
of the slave's flesh and psyche but also still today repeats its long
historical function of signifying the lack of some quality needed to
make African Americans the equals of whites]{.underline}. It is
therefore no surprise that [the process initiated by slaves of forming
for blacks a protective group identity]{.underline} demanded the
unifying function of music and communal activities like religious
worship, and [**could not rely solely upon the efforts to resignify
race** that we see praised by African American academics like Gates and
Baker]{.underline}. As scholars such as Ron Eyerman have demonstrated,
African American racial identity could only be truly solidified as a
discursive concept after slavery ended, at the moment
post-Reconstruction when an emerging black middle class and
intelligentsia had finally attained sufficient levels of agency over
discourse to employ race in calls for political unity.111 While [most
African American scholarship repeats endlessly this early attempt by the
intelligentsia and the slaves themselves to resignify and politically
redeploy race]{.underline}, Trauma and Race suggests [a need finally to
advance beyond mere resignification. What resignification today entails
is an ambivalent scholarly desire to maintain race that is actively
facilitated by conceptualizations of agency and identity as discursive,
a desire to uphold race while also depriving it of a lethal essentialism
that is often the core of racism.]{.underline} This ambivalence suggests
[race's position not only as a fantasy object, or object a, but also as
a Symbolic remnant, as **a link**]{.underline}--- often willfully
preserved by scholars---**[to the traumatic Real of slavery's
jouissance]{.underline}**. By contrast, Trauma and Race seeks to
articulate [a notion of agency and identity that distances itself from
both race and the traumatic past it incorporates]{.underline}

### L---Black Experience/History

**Their adherence to race as a historical analytic makes psychic
crackdown against black joy [inevitable]{.underline}---only an embrace
of the [multiplicity of the self]{.underline} solves by divesting from
the project of [creating an identity politic]{.underline}**

**George 16** (Sheldon George, Professor of English at Simmons
University, 2016 , \"Trauma and Race: A Lacanian Study of African
American Racial Identity\", pp 8-12)//guyB

While [jouissance may be pinned to the black body as confirmation of an
opposing racial whiteness that is productive of both a sense of
superiority and fears of losing ground for numbers of white
Americans]{.underline}, [African Americans often experience through a
racial identity bound to the body an inability to separate from the
excesses of a racial past]{.underline}. These excesses, from the
standpoint of African Americans, are [tied to practices of exclusion and
violence that traumatically breach the salubrious limits of both the
body and the psyche]{.underline}. Here **[the white subject's jouissance
becomes the instrument of African Americans' confrontation with
trauma]{.underline}**. Beyond the trauma to the body that may present
itself in a particular racist act, however, [jouissance, as a pleasure
produced (in this case) through race, functions to link African
Americans to a trauma of slavery, repeating through racism a primordial
challenge to African Americans' sense of being]{.underline}. Dunn
disregards his role in violently instituting such a challenge, but his
conception of the possibilities opened to him in so doing allows us to
recognize the striking, divergent psychic relation that is held by many
African Americans to both the racial past and the future. Dunn, even
while imprisoned and awaiting trial, focuses on the future, "looking
forward to moving out of the south and away from the scourge \[or the
blacks\] of this country."27 His rather elaborate plan for after he is
set free is to hire a "slimy civil-law lawyer and sue" the county of
Jacksonville for "reverse-discrimination,"28 use "the settlement" to
invest in his company, and use the business profits ensured by a
"rebounding economy" to "buy or build \[his\] dream house on the river,"
a "2-story house constructed in a manner where \[he, a licensed pilot,\]
can [cessary legal impartiality as "the head of the executive branch,"
is interpellated into identification equally with a racial identity and
a racial past traced in a lineage of African American
suffering]{.underline}.32 In this tracing, [we see a shift from past
notions of racial essentialism, such that **racial identity is
determined by commonalities in experience**, by similarities in the
discursive relation to being that is established by a
racism]{.underline} that questions one's subjective value. [This
shift]{.underline}, like the move to culture described above, [defines
racial similarity through jouissance, through a relation to modes of
enjoyment and experiences of suffering that repeat across
time.]{.underline} After the verdict on the case was issued, Obama spoke
a second time about Trayvon Martin, identifying directly with Martin's
experience. He explains, "another way of saying" Trayvon Martin "could
have been my son" is to say "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years
ago."33 In an age when race as an inherited essence is questioned and
multiraciality is abundantly visible, even in Obama himself, [Obama
models a shift in American culture whereby increasingly race is
determined through relation to a historical past, the replication of
which through racism simultaneously solidifies African American racial
identity and curtails those fantasies of wholeness that define for the
African American subject a sense of access to the jouissance of
being]{.underline}. Obama himself notes that [the restrictions placed
upon African Americans, the limitations in the space allotted to them in
the American social sphere by such factors as "disparities in the
application of our criminal laws," reinforce a sense of exclusion that
helps constitute a group perspective.]{.underline}34 Noting that, after
the Zimmerman acquittal, "there's a lot of pain" for members of "the
African American community," Obama ties this pain to the fact that the
community "is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a
history that doesn't go away."35 Despite the ability of a figure like
Michael Dunn to leave this past behind---questioning, "Where is all of
this hostility coming from?"---[the past continues to beckon African
Americans toward deep associations with racialized
identity.]{.underline}36 Though many had heralded the age of Obama as
occasioning the birth of a new postracial America, these cases of
violence against African Americans suggest [an unchanging same in the
American social sphere, a repetitive, traumatic confrontation with the
legacies of the racial past]{.underline}. Echoing Obama, Attorney
General Eric Holder relates in the aftermath of the Zimmerman verdict
that "some of these same issues \[raised by the killing of Trayvon
Martin\] drove my father to sit down with me to have a
conversation . . . about how, as a young black man, I should interact
with the police . . . if I was ever stopped or confronted in a way that
I thought was unwarranted."37 Though Holder is convinced that his
position as the first African American attorney general, serving under
the first African American president, is sign that "our country has
indeed changed," Holder reveals, "Trayvon's death last spring caused me
to sit down to have a conversation with my own 15-year-old son, like my
dad did with me."38 **[It is the recursiveness of these experiences of
discrimination that becomes the source of both racial identity and
trauma in contemporary America]{.underline}**. The ascension to primacy
of African Americans like Obama and Holder has not signaled an end to
racism but instead has led to what Colin Powell, secretary of state
under the George W. Bush administration, has identified as a
"significant shift to the right" in contemporary American politics, a
politics that Powell maintains is run through with a "dark vein of
intolerance."39 Pointing to a governor who publically referred to
President Obama as lazy after his poor performance in his first
presidential debate with Mitt Romney and to another governor who
described Obama as "shuckin' and jivin'" in his discussion of attacks in
Benghazi, Libya, that led to the death of four Americans, Powell conveys
that the latter description is "a racial era slave term."40 Elaborating
on the significance of the two governors' word choices, Powell states,
"It may not mean anything to most Americans but to those of us who are
African Americans, the second word \[after lazy\] is shiftless and then
there's a third word that goes along with it, Birther, the whole Birther
movement."41 What Powell hints at is the way this focus on laziness
recursively brings us to a focus on what I would describe as the slave's
projected mode of enjoyment. Here, [binding Obama's "laziness" to the
slave's "shiftless" enjoyment produces a **racial lineage that becomes a
means of emphasizing Obama's otherness** and grounding the Birthers'
assertion of his un-Americanness]{.underline}. Though racial difference
is never directly addressed in the governors' comments, Powell's
observations help show how [within language itself is buried the history
that unravels to reproduce ready-made structures of jouissance that
ground a racism emerging from the past to shape the
present]{.underline}. It is this focus on a jouissance bound to both
language and the history of slavery that will guide much of Trauma and
Race. Through a Lacanian understanding of the function of the signifier
in language, I will present [slavery as a traumatic past that, by means
of the signifiers of race, comes to repeat itself in the present to
organize both racial relations and personal identity around a fantasy
relation to being]{.underline}. Where this fantasy relation articulates
itself through mediation of structures of jouissance that emanate from
slavery, I read racial identity and racism as efforts to manage and
manipulate the jouissance of being that emerges from the trauma of this
past. The paradox of race as an apparatus of jouissance, however, is
that it binds African Americans to a past in which race was used to
decimate the enabling fantasies of being that enslaved blacks sought to
establish for themselves. It is this paradox that centers the analysis
of this book. Critiquing the allegiance to race that many African
Americans maintain today, Trauma and Race argues that [by embracing the
concept of race contemporary **African Americans become psychically
bound to the traumatic past of slavery**]{.underline}. While
articulating the psychic and political limitations of race in chapters 1
and 2, the book argues for [a freeing up of identity that goes some way
toward relieving the self from a determinative relation to the
past]{.underline}. Using the literature of Toni Morrison and Ralph
Ellison in chapters 3 and 4, I not only suggest [the pathological
extremes to which race urges subjects both white and African
American]{.underline}---extremes that extend even to the point of what
Lacan terms perversion and neurosis---but also present through these
works models of how **[a traumatic relation to the past may be
altered]{.underline}**. Throughout, [I suggest the urgency especially
for "African Americans" to embrace **a more expansive conception of the
self, one that recognizes and celebrates the self as more than
racial**]{.underline}**.** Arguing that [it is the intensity of one's
adherence to racial identity that opens one up to a reliance upon the
identity structures of the past that produce for African Americans a
traumatic relation to being, I advocate for an identity politics that
makes room for full expression of the psychic lives of those individuals
who would call themselves African Americans.]{.underline} Where [the
pursuit of both racial whiteness and African American fantasies of being
seek after an impossible unity meant to mask the fragmentation inherent
to the psyche, what I promote is]{.underline} [**a relation to being
that embraces the multiplicity of the self**. It is beyond these racial
fantasies of the whole self, I will suggest, that both white Americans
and African Americans must come to establish a truly salutary psychic
relation to the being that is stricken from all our
subjectivities]{.underline}

### L---Black Identity

**The 1AC's attachment to black identity creates a
[recursive]{.underline} form of psychic violence and
[revels]{.underline} in the traumatic violence of slavery---their
failure to define race proves its lack of potency as a [political
analytic]{.underline}---only [the Lack]{.underline} can explain their
fixation on it**

**George 16** (Sheldon George, Professor of English at Simmons
University, 2016 , \"Trauma and Race: A Lacanian Study of African
American Racial Identity\", pp 42-48)//guyB

We can better understand how the automaton of the racial signifiers
impacts efforts to conserve the trauma of slavery if we turn more
directly to an analysis of Du Bois himself and of Du Bois' ambivalent
attachment to the concept of race. It is clear that [Du Bois employs
race for its political value]{.underline}. We see his [efforts to tie
race to politics]{.underline} when he, for example, [urges his
contemporaries in the Harlem Renaissance to be strategic in their
artistic depictions of Negroes]{.underline}, asserting quite famously
that "[all Art is propaganda and ever must be]{.underline}."24 But
[beyond his political reliance upon race, **it is the trauma of slavery
that I suggest inspires Du Bois' allegiance to this
concept**]{.underline}. Where I define the trauma of slavery as [an
attack upon psychic fantasies of being, at issue in Du Bois' work is the
effort to establish stable, irrefutable ground for his own sense of
being, a process that entails for Du Bois a redefining of the race
itself]{.underline}. Yet, I argue, [it is as Du Bois comes most fully to
embrace his racial identity that he is most directly pinned to the
trauma of slavery]{.underline}. Recognizing in America a society that
"only lets" an African American "see himself through the revelation of
the other world[," Du Bois reluctantly embraces the racial identity
granted him by the Other]{.underline}.25 [Where this identity links
Du Bois to a traumatic past, both the external insistence upon race and,
more significantly, Du Bois' own embrace of this concept prevent his
easy dissociation from the trauma of the past]{.underline}. To the
extent that Du  Bois comes to resist understanding his identity as other
than racial, Du Bois [confronts the automaton of the racial signifiers
both as that which binds him to this trauma and as his sole protection
against it. Du Bois' most pronounced traumatic confrontation with lack
emerges when **race produces for him an identity so fully entrenched in
the past that there is no room to imagine other avenues of access to
being** than the one directly contested by this same racial
past]{.underline}. [Urged to accept an identity so exclusively grounded
by his membership in a race already uniquely pinned to notions of
inferiority, what Du Bois seeks is to maintain his fantasies of being by
fending against the unveiling of a lack presented as the exclusive
possession of his race]{.underline}. [This lack]{.underline}, however,
[is constitutive of each subject, emerging with the onset of
subjectivity, which is defined by a splitting of the psyche into its
component registers of the Imaginary, Symbolic, and Real]{.underline}.
[Lack articulates itself around such fantasies as race and racial
inferiority to establish the subject's position in relation to
being]{.underline}, [the illusory sense of psychic unity and autonomy
that may be established through domination of one's external environment
and others who occupy it. These fantasies mask the fact of each
subject's mutual submission to the forced choice that Lacan calls the
"vel of alienation."]{.underline}26 This vel is defined as [a
compulsory, "lethal" choice between meaning and being, a choice that
produces the "aphanisis," or " fading of the subject," who is ever
forced to attain subjectivity via the dominating signifiers of the
Other]{.underline}.27 Subjectivity emerges with entrance into the
Symbolic, the world of language and meaning that organizes thought for
the subject but alienates the subject from the jouissance of being he or
she desires. [It is this alienation that fantasies of race both mask in
those who are able to position themselves in a hierarchal place of
dominance and highlight in those who are dominated by the signifiers of
the other.]{.underline} Rethinking Hegel, Lacan [illustrates the
"essence of the alienating vel, the fatal factor" that defines it,
through reference to the choice offered the slave: "**your freedom or
your life**]{.underline}."28 [This fatal choice]{.underline}, he
explains, [is between two elements such that one element "has as its
consequence a neither one, nor the other]{.underline}": [if the slave
"chooses life]{.underline} \[or meaning\], [he has life deprived of
freedom]{.underline} \[or being\]," but "[if he chooses freedom, he
loses both]{.underline}" his life and his freedom immediately.29 Lacan
calls this vel "[the primary alienation, that by which man enters into
the way of slavery]{.underline}."30 Expanding on Lacan, I define
[slavery as not that which alienates the slave, but that which reveals
the fact of **the slave's deeper subjective alienation in
language**]{.underline}. [Where the typical subject of the Symbolic
finds support in the signifier for the fantasies of being that underpin
his or her psyche, **the slave's confrontation with and lack of control
over the signifiers of the Other prevent the easy construction of such
fantasies**]{.underline}. Lacan describes these fantasies through his
critique of the Cartesian "I of the cogito," which he designates the
"homunculus," the illusory "presence, inside man" who "governs him, who
is the driver, the point of synthesis" for man's subjectivity.31 [This
is the self that Lacan says "has not failed to occur in the history of
what is called thought" as disguise for the fact of the subject's
alienation.]{.underline}32 [The I is presented as the subject's true
self, as the self that accesses the external world through a
manipulation of language and its signifiers. It is the integrity and
very humanity of this self that Du Bois seeks to defend in coming to
embrace propaganda as a means of manipulating the racist signifiers
confronting African Americans in the Symbolic field of the
Other]{.underline}. Elaborating on his position on art, Du Bois
explains, "The point today is that until the art of the black folk
compels recognition they will not be rated as human."33 [In this effort
to prove his humanity and secure his fantasy access to being, Du Bois
invokes race as a political and psychical tool in battle against a
culture that,]{.underline} he notes, [deems Negroes "inferior to the
dirtiest white dog]{.underline}."34 [Through a continual rethinking of
and then final reassertion of the validity of race]{.underline} at the
end of his career, [**Du Bois reveals his domination by the returning
automaton of the signifiers of racial identity** that both links him to
and defends him against the traumatic past that challenges his fantasies
of being]{.underline}. This automaton, [the continual return of race as
the concept that African Americans like Du Bois both conserve and
actively refute, is conditioned by race's ability to operate through a
relation to each of the three registers of the psyche]{.underline}.
Where race is a social and discursive construct, I argue, [one's
entrance into the social Symbolic, with the very onset of subjectivity,
initiates one into the formations of racial identity]{.underline}. What
we will see through Du Bois' example is that, [though racial difference
is truly grounded not in biology but in discourse, the racial identity
one obtains from the Symbolic of the Other has extra-Symbolic and
extradiscursive effects on the subject]{.underline}; the [images and
discursive definitions of the racial self granted the subject are
alternately embraced and resisted at levels both conscious and
unconscious, registering themselves to varied degrees at the psychic
level of the Imaginary so as to found an internal portraiture of the
body that is central to the formation of the ego]{.underline}. [The
politics of race at the level of the Symbolic holds dire stakes
particularly for African Americans because race enables the constitution
of an Imaginary ego image that simultaneously challenges and asserts the
unity of these racialized subjects. **Binding this ego's self-image to
racial identity through the illusion of race as biological fact**, the
Symbolic actively **constitutes this identity through discourses of race
that rhetorically link the racialized self to the history of
slavery**.]{.underline} In the process, [**race both masks and reveals
personal lack** by conflating personal lack with the slave's suffering
and trauma]{.underline}. Through this displacement, [race binds African
Americans to the Real of a traumatic past they both own and disown as
they negotiate through a relation to this past a fantasy of race
articulated around the promise of being]{.underline}. [Du Bois' own
negotiation of this past is emblematic of the ambivalent attachment most
African Americans hold to race]{.underline}. This negotiation [involves
for Du Bois both what he calls his "recoil from the assumptions of the
whites" and his development of "racial feeling\[s\]" as a "later
learning and reaction" to racism.]{.underline}35 These feelings become
especially significant as [Du Bois]{.underline} looks back at his career
and [contemplates]{.underline} in his autobiography, Dusk of Dawn, what
it is within himself that constitutes [a "connection, psychical and
spiritual, with Africa and the Negro race]{.underline}."36 Contrary to
the focus on logical reasoning one would expect from someone with Du 
Bois' distinguished academic training, Du Bois [describes his racial
"tie" to Negroes and Africa as something he "can feel better than \[he\]
can explain," rooting these feelings in race as not a logically defined
"concept \[but\] rather . . . a group of contradictory forces, facts and
tendencies]{.underline}" that have guided his actions throughout his
career.37 In this battle between emotion and logic, Du Bois' [sense of
his "psychical and spiritual" tie to Africa and the Negro race comes to
overbalance both Du Bois' conscious awareness of his mixed
heritage]{.underline}---"my paternal great-grandfather  .  .  . was
white"---and the deeper "culture patterns" he "absorbed" in childhood,
which he explains "were not African so much as Dutch and New England."38
[While describing an allegiance to the Negro race that defies the full
logic of his own reasoning, Du Bois reaffirms his racial identity most
directly through consideration of his biological and historical link to
a racial group that extends to Africa]{.underline}: On this vast
\[African\] continent were born and lived a large portion of my direct
ancestors going back a thousand years or more. The mark of their
heritage is upon me in color and hair. These are obvious things, but of
little meaning in themselves; only important as they stand for real and
more subtle differences from other men. Whether they do or not, I do not
know nor does science know today. But [one thing is sure and that is the
fact that since the fifteenth century these ancestors of mine and their
descendants have had a common history; have suffered a common disaster
and have one long memory]{.underline}. The actual ties of heritage
between the individuals of these groups vary with the ancestors that
they have in common with many others: Europeans and Semites, perhaps
Mongolians, certainly American Indians. But [the physical bond is least
and the badge of color relatively unimportant save as a badge; **the
real essence of this kinship is its heritage of slavery**; the
discrimination and insult; and this heritage binds together not simply
the children of Africa, but extends through yellow Asia and into the
south Seas]{.underline}. It is this unity that draws me to Africa.39
Du Bois attempts to establish for himself and African Americans a racial
identity that is not simply biological. Like most contemporary African
Americans, Du Bois remains at least consciously skeptical of the notion
of biological differences among races and grounds difference, instead,
in ancestry and history. Thus, [what unifies Du  Bois, African
Americans, and Africans into a single racial group is not primarily
biology but their one long memory of the historical disaster and insult
that was slavery]{.underline}. As Appiah reveals, however, [Du  Bois'
conception of his racial identity as historically grounded leads him to
the affirmation of an illogical non sequitur]{.underline}. [Du Bois
maintains that the insult and discrimination of slavery "binds together
not simply the children of Africa" but also the peoples of "yellow Asia
and the south Seas," who do not share the history of
slavery]{.underline}. Appiah argues that "[what Du Bois shares with the
rest of the non-white world" and what binds him to it "**is not the
insult but the badge of insult**," the biological skin color that
identifies Du Bois as black]{.underline}.40 Appiah shows that throughout
Du Bois' intellectual career [the development of his sociohistorical
argument is restricted by this illogical attachment to a "buried"
biological conception of race]{.underline}.41 Appiah rightly suggests
that [a notion of phenotypic difference grounds both Du Bois' sense of
his historical lineage and Du Bois' understanding of his relation to
other groups]{.underline}. Because of his own insistence upon logic,
however, Appiah cannot fully appreciate the function of [this buried,
illogical attachment to race]{.underline} in Du Bois' narrative, an
attachment that, I argue, [must first be understood in relation not only
to biology but also to the Symbolic and the Real]{.underline}. Appiah
undervalues his own recognition that Du Bois' bond "is based upon a
hyperbolic reading of the facts" and rejects the obvious rhetorical
(thus Symbolic) role slavery plays in defining identity for Du Bois.42
[Du Bois' willful selection of certain groups to which he claims
"kinship" and common "heritage," just like his dismissal of Dutch and
other ancestors with whom he holds an acknowledged biological and
cultural relation, displays a selection process in racial identity that
is often both unreasoned and motivated. Defying logical reasoning,
**race often functions at the emotional and psychic
levels**]{.underline}. [What structure these emotions and give shape to
our "racial feelings" are the signifiers of language that themselves
remain motivated in their articulation of subjective meaning and
identity by a fundamental relation to lack]{.underline}. With the non
sequitur, [Du Bois establishes through the signifier not an empirical
and logical understanding of race but a rhetorical and autobiographical
one that both historicizes his identity and pins it to a lack positioned
in the traumatic past and remanifested in the present through the
continual "insults" of racism]{.underline}. Most broadly, [it is this
imposition of lack onto personal identity, a process to which other
peoples of color are also subjected in varying degrees by racism, that
urges Du Bois' identification with these discriminated-against
groups]{.underline}. But, most directly, [this imposed lack is also what
constitutes for Du Bois a link to African Americans as a racial group
through his conscious embrace of the past of slavery]{.underline}.
Focusing on this past, [Du Bois presents us a narrative of the African
American racial self that we may say, with Lacan, "condense\[s\] in
relation" to "a nucleus," to an organizing, hollow center that
structures the signifiers of both Du Bois' discourse and his
identity]{.underline}.43 Lacan explains that "[when the subject tells
his story, something acts, in a latent way, that governs \[his\] syntax
and makes it more and more condensed]{.underline}."44 [What governs
Du Bois' narrative is not a movement toward race as the core of the self
but rather an identification of race as the signifying mark of a deeper
injury and insult suffered by this self]{.underline}. Du Bois' sense of
the injuries to which the racialized African American subject is exposed
because of race causes him to struggle against the concept of race, but
Du Bois fails to discard this concept that both he and science question
because [he simultaneously finds **political value in the deployment of
racial identity** and, more significantly, substitutes race for another
signifier with which race holds a metonymical relation: **slavery**.
These two signifiers]{.underline}, I suggest, [are linked within a
signifying chain that thus ensures Du Bois' return to race]{.underline}.
But [the signifier slavery that Du  Bois chooses to emphasize does not
only recuperate his racial identity; more importantly, it links this
identity to slavery's signifieds--- insult, discrimination,
disaster]{.underline}. As this source of insult and injury, [slavery is
the nucleus around which Du Bois' narrative and identity
condense]{.underline}. I say with Lacan that [this "nucleus refers to
something traumatic," something beyond slavery itself that "must be
designated as belonging to the real" of subjective lack]{.underline};
and I argue that [Du Bois confronts this lack, as may contemporary
African Americans, precisely because he begins by embracing a
hyperbolic, historical relation to the signifiers of race and their
injurious signifieds.]{.underline}

### L---Baudrillard/Bataille

#### The aff fails to create noncapitalist desire \-\-- the affirmative is fundamentally a reactionary attempt to sacrifice productive expenditure, ignoring that contemporary society is literally a cornucopia of pleasure-seeking, from reality TV to the latest iphone. Capitalism captures the desire of its subjects precisely because it sells itself as seeking useless pleasure, which means the aff's relationship to desire solves none of the impacts in the 1AC 

**McGowan 16** \[Todd McGowan, Associate Professor of Film and
Television Studies at the University of Vermont, *Capitalism and Desire:
The Psychic Cost of Markets,* Columbia University Press: New York, NY,
2016, p. 110-113\]

HIDDEN ENJOYMENT AND ITS VICISSITUDES

[Bataille was]{.underline} also [the first]{.underline} thinker [to
identify sacrifice with enjoyment. His critique of capitalism focuses on
its turn away from **sacrifice** and thus from the possibility for a
**true satisfaction**]{.underline}. In his riposte to the assumptions of
political economists like Smith and Ricardo, [Bataille locates
satisfaction not in accumulation of goods but in their
sacrifice]{.underline}. Since sacrifice functions as our basic mode of
satisfying ourselves, [capitalism represents an ontological retreat and
an abandonment of our mode of enjoyment]{.underline}. Bataille notes,
"[The practice of sacrifice has today fallen into disuse and yet it has
been, due to its universality, a human action more significant than any
other]{.underline}. Independently of each other, different peoples
invented different forms of sacrifice, with the goal of answering a need
as inevitable as hunger. It is therefore not astonishing that the
necessity of satisfying such a need, under the conditions of present-day
life, leads an isolated man into disconnected and even stupid behavior."

**[The problem with Bataille]{.underline}**, however, [is that his
theory of sacrifice is grounded in an ontology of **excess
energy**]{.underline}. **[We enjoy sacrifice because we are burdened
with too much energy]{.underline}**: there is enjoyment in the
diminution of this burden. But **[Bataille never explains how this
excess arises and how we obtain it.]{.underline}** In this way, [he
misses the creative power of sacrifice]{.underline}, [its capacity to
form something out of nothing]{.underline}. [**[We don't begin with too
much but with undifferentiated being, and sacrifice enables us to
differentiate]{.underline}**, **[to create a value where none otherwise
exists]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[. [It is the creative power of sacrifice
that generates its appeal]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In terms of his analysis of capitalism, [[Bataille's emphasis on the
impoverishment of sacrifice]{.mark} leads him astray]{.underline}. [He
[mistakes the secularization of sacrifice for its evanescence, and this
error leads him to **underestimate capitalism's
appeal**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If sacrifice was]{.underline} "a need
[as inevitable as hunger]{.underline}" as he says, [capitalism could not
endure while turning away from it. The invisibility of]{.underline}
[sacrifice is not its disuse but its multiplication]{.underline}. [But
Bataille nonetheless captures the experience of the capitalist subject
reacting to the hiddenness of sacrifice in the capitalist world. His
thought functions not so much as a critical analysis of capitalist
society but as a phenomenology of capitalist life]{.underline}, a life
[that hides its dependence on sacrifice.]{.underline}

[[The hiddenness of sacrifice often produces outbursts of sacrifice that
attempt to compensate for its apparent absence]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[The secularization of sacrifice creates the image of a world in which
all objects are equal and thus one in which no object has any
value]{.underline}. **[Where everything has a price, nothing is worth
anything]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Outbursts of sacrifice occur most
prominently with contemporary terrorists. [The true terrorist is the one
who is not fighting for a particular ethnic or nationalist cause but
rather struggling against capitalist modernity]{.underline}. This figure
finds the absence of visible sacrifice in modernity suffocating. [Modern
subjects appear to exist without any sacrificial demands]{.underline}:
they can display their bodies openly, watch obscene films, and even
engage publicly in overtly sexualized behavior. [They seem to enjoy in
lieu of sacrificing, and the terrorist aims at reintroducing sacrifice
into this abyss.]{.underline}

The terrorist always sacrifices others and often sacrifices herself or
himself to create value in the monotony of the modern world. Though
terrorism involves destruction, it is always also creation. The
terrorist tries to gives existence a value that it seems to have lost.
But this judgment on the part of the terrorist reflects a failure to
recognize how the capitalist system actually functions.

[It is true that the tedium of capitalist existence appears
valueless]{.underline}. **[But this is just the result of the
transmutation of sacrifice performed by capitalism, not its
absence]{.underline}**. Capitalism's secularization of sacrifice
actually multiplies its frequency in the social order. **[[Though no one
in capitalist society cuts out the beating heart of a sacrificial
victim]{.mark}, nuclear warheads, elaborate churches, and
[slaughterhouses testify to the persistence of
sacrifice]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And **[unlike the Aztecs and the
Mayans, [modern subjects have lost the alibi of ignorance, which makes
the presence of sacrifice within capitalism so
instructive]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[Because sacrifice becomes less explicit and more integrated into
everyday life under capitalism, [subjects often fail to see its presence
and seek out more direct forms of sacrifice out of a sense of
dissatisfaction with modernity]{.mark}. **This is the dissatisfaction
that produces terrorist attacks, fundamentalist revivals, and bungee
jumpers**]{.underline}. [The reactionaries that take up these activities
are the direct result of capitalism's ideological commitment to
utility]{.underline}. [They sacrifice themselves in senseless activities
to proclaim their disgust with utility and their adherence to something
of value]{.underline}. But [the hatred of capitalism's universe of
utility reflects a failure to diagnose that universe and its
mobilization of sacrifice.]{.underline}

[To hate capitalist modernity for the abandonment of sacrifice and the
desecration of value is to accept capitalist ideology at face
value]{.underline}. [Though capitalist ideology]{.underline} professes
that capitalism is the most efficient economic system because it is the
most responsive to human needs and eliminates the unnecessary sacrifices
of time and energy that haunt other economic systems, sacrifice remains
the sine qua non of capitalism, just as it was for earlier economies.
But [responses like terrorism, fundamentalism, and bungee jumping
themselves play a part in furthering this ideology as well. They work to
convince us that capitalism does really eliminate sacrifice]{.underline}
and simply gratify needs by implicitly criticizing it for doing so.
[Their failure to see capitalist sacrifice helps to render it more
invisible. But the answer to these reactionary positions should be an
analysis of capitalism's structural similarity to them.]{.underline}

[[One must only look and see in order to become aware of the ubiquity of
sacrifice in the capitalist economy]{.mark}.]{.underline} The moments of
satisfaction that capitalism offers are themselves replete with
sacrifice, but the system shields us from confronting it. As a result,
**[[we accept the capitalist myth that sacrifice belongs to a prior
epoch, and either we accommodate ourselves to this
world]{.underline}]{.mark}** [or violently revolt against
it.]{.underline} [But this violent revolt rests on a fundamental
misunderstanding of how capitalism sustains itself]{.underline}. One
need not turn to terrorism in order to rediscover the spirit of
sacrifice. This spirit has never left. Every act that we perform in the
capitalist system involves us in forms of sacrifice, even if the system
renders them invisible. [[Instead of flying a plane into a building, all
one need do to experience the most violent sacrifice is to buy a new
iPhone]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### L -- Consciousness Raising

#### The attempt to mobilize subjects on the basis of knowledge eschews enjoyment as the basis for action.

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan, Professor of English at the University of
Vermont, USA, "Enjoying What We Don't Have: The Political Project of
Psychoanalysis," pgs. 172-176)//JRD

[For emancipatory politics, the transformation of knowledge from a
vehicle of liberation to an instrument of power has had devastating
effects. Emancipatory politics has traditionally relied on knowledge in
order to facilitate political change, and even today one of the primary
operations of emancipatory politics is getting information out to
citizens.]{.underline} In the minds of most people engaged in the
project of emancipation, the fundamental task has been establishing
class consciousness among the members of the working class. Class
consciousness, according to this way of thinking, is the basis for
substantive political change. As Georg Lukács puts it in History and
Class Consciousness, "The fate of a class depends on its ability to
elucidate and solve the problems with which history confronts it."12
[Political change depends]{.underline}, for someone like Lukács, [on the
knowledge that makes decisive action possible]{.underline}. [As long as
authority remains in the position of the traditional master, knowledge
can have a revolutionary function]{.underline}. [Historically, the
primary problem for emancipatory politics involved access to
education]{.underline}, which is why a key component of the communist
program that Marx and Engels outline in The Communist Manifesto is
universal access to public education. [There are those on the side of
emancipation who continue to insist that knowledge will be the source
for political change. According to this position, people side with
conservative policies against their own self-interest because they lack
the proper information.]{.underline} [They are the victims of
propaganda, and emancipatory politics must respond by providing the
missing knowledge. If not for big media's control over knowledge, the
thinking goes, subjects would cease to act against their self-interest
and would begin to oppose contemporary capitalism in an active
way.]{.underline} [**For those who adopt this position, political
activity consists in acts of informing, raising consciousness, and
bringing issues to light.** But today the failures of
consciousness-raising are evident everywhere.]{.underline} Such failures
are the subject of Thomas Frank's acclaimed analysis, What's the Matter
with Kansas? Frank highlights the proclivity of people in areas of the
United States like Kansas to act politically in ways that sabotage their
economic interests. He notes: "People getting their fundamental
interests wrong is what American political life is all about."13 [The
Right's current success in the United States and around the world is not
the sign that more people have become convinced that right-wing policies
will benefit them. Instead, conservatism permits people a way of
organizing their enjoyment in a way that today's emancipatory politics
does not. Emancipatory politics may offer a truer vision of the world,
but the Right offers a superior way of enjoying.]{.underline}
Traditionally, the primary advantage that emancipatory politics had in
political struggle was its challenge to authority. When one took up the
cause of emancipation, one took a stand against an entrenched regime of
power and experienced enjoyment in this defiance. One can still see this
form of enjoyment evinced in the revolutions of the Arab Spring in 2011.
Though emancipatory activity always entailed a certain risk (even of
death, to which the fate of innumerable revolutionaries attests), it
nonetheless brought with it an enjoyment not found in everyday obedience
and symbolic identity. In short, [there was historically a strong
libidinal component to emancipatory militancy that the risk it carried
amplified rather than diminished]{.underline}. [The liberating power of
emancipatory activity is present in]{.underline} almost every political
film. We see [activists falling in love as they jointly embark on an
emancipatory project or romance burgeoning as a fight for justice
intensifies]{.underline}. This dynamic, attesting to the enjoyment
inherent in militancy against the oppressive ruling order, manifests
itself in Warren Beatty's Reds (1981), Ken Loach's Bread and Roses
(2000), and Gillian Armstrong's Charlotte Gray (2001), to name just a
few of the many. In each case, the romance seems to spring out of the
risk that militancy against an oppressive regime entails. The love that
develops between Maya (Pilar Padilla) and Sam (Adrien Brody) in Bread
and Roses sparks first at the moment when Maya helps Sam to elude
corporate security agents at the office building where he is trying to
help unionize the janitors. Maya risks losing her job as a janitor when
she aids Sam, and this risk acts as the driving force for the eroticism
between them. [Conservatism has not traditionally provided much
enjoyment of this type, but it has had its own appeal. It took the side
of authority and stability. Whereas emancipatory politics could offer
the enjoyment that comes from defiance of authority, conservatism could
offer the enjoyment that comes from identification with it.]{.underline}
This is the enjoyment that one feels when hearing one's national anthem
or saluting the flag. It resides in the fabric of the nation's military
uniform that makes the fingers touching it tingle. This eroticism is not
that of emancipatory politics --- and it is perhaps not as powerful ---
but it is nonetheless a form of eroticism. [It produces a libidinal
charge.]{.underline} The struggle between conservatism and emancipatory
politics has historically been a struggle between two competing modes of
organizing enjoyment with neither side having a monopoly. [Despite the
traditional emphasis that the forces of emancipation placed on
knowledge, even in the past the struggle between emancipatory politics
and conservatism centered on enjoyment rather than knowledge. In the
political arena, knowledge is important only insofar as it relates to
the way that subjects mobilize their enjoyment. If subjects see through
ideological manipulation and have the proper knowledge, this does not
necessarily inaugurate a political change.]{.underline} [The knowledge
that something is bad for us]{.underline} --- a president or a Twinkie
--- **[does not lessen the enjoyment that we receive from it. It is not
that we have the ability to enjoy while disavowing our knowledge but
more that the knowledge works to serve our enjoyment.]{.underline}** The
enjoyment of a Twinkie does not derive from the physiological effect of
sugar on the human metabolism but from the knowledge of the damage this
substance does to the body. [Knowing the harm that accompanies something
actually facilitates our enjoyment of it, especially when we are capable
of disavowing this knowledge. Enjoyment is distinct from bodily
pleasures]{.underline} (which the Twinkie undoubtedly also provides);
[it depends on some degree of sacrifice that allows the subject to
suffer its enjoyment. Sacrifice is essential to our capacity for
enjoying ourselves. There is a fundamentally masochistic structure to
enjoyment.]{.underline}14 [It always comes in the form of an alien force
that overcomes us from the outside.]{.underline} As Alenka Zupančič puts
it, "It is not simply the mode of enjoyment of the neighbour, of the
other, that is strange to me. The heart of the problem is that I
experience my own enjoyment (which emerges along with the enjoyment of
the other, and is even indissociable from it) as strange and hostile."15
An initial experience of loss gives birth to the lost object around
which we structure our enjoyment, and our subsequent enjoyment demands a
return to the experience of loss. Through sacrifice and loss, we
reconstitute the privileged object that exists only as an absence. This
is why actually obtaining the privileged object necessarily disappoints:
when the lost object becomes present, it loses its privileged status and
becomes an ordinary empirical object. [Knowledge thus helps us to enjoy
not in the way that we might think --- that is, by showing us what is
good for our well-being --- but by giving us something to
sacrifice]{.underline}: if we know, for instance, that cigarettes are
unhealthy and could kill us, this elevates the mundane fact of smoking
into an act laced with enjoyment.16 With each puff, we repeat the act of
sacrifice and return to the primordial experience of loss. [The death
that we bring on is not simply the price that we pay]{.underline} for
smoking; it is the means through which we enjoy the act of smoking. In
this sense, every cigarette is really killing the smoker. If it didn't,
the act would lose its ability to provide enjoyment (though it may still
produce bodily pleasure).17 Under the rule of the traditional master,
prohibition sustains the possibility for this type of enjoyment: we can
enjoy an act because it transgresses a societal prohibition. As Lacan
notes in Seminar VII, "Transgression in the direction of jouissance only
takes place if it is supported by the oppositional principle, by the
forms of the Law. If the paths to jouissance have something in them that
dies out, that tends to make them impassable, prohibition, if I may say
so, becomes its all-terrain vehicle."18 Prohibition makes our enjoyment
possible by offering us the possibility for sacrifice. We sacrifice the
good and violate the prohibition. But prohibition no longer plays this
role in contemporary society. [No universal prohibition bars certain
activities; instead, knowledge about the harm that activities cause
begins to play the role that prohibition once played.]{.underline} We
don't avoid smoking simply because it is wrong but because we know the
harm that it causes. We don't refrain from extramarital sex because it
is wrong but because we know the societal and physical dangers it
entails. [Even conservatives think and talk this way.]{.underline} When,
for instance, conservatives argue for excluding information about
condoms from sex education classrooms, they claim that we know condoms
aren't 100 percent safe in preventing the spread of hiv[. In each case,
the authority is knowledge, not law. The libidinal charge in politics
involved with challenging the master has largely disappeared today, and
now that libidinal charge has attached itself to challenging the
experts, who represent the new agents of authority.]{.underline}

### L -- Consciousness Raising -- Race

#### They have missed the mark -- racism is not a product of ignorance but one of enjoyment. Their politics can only ever re-entrench hierarchies of racialization as they represent racism as a caricature of epistemological formations rather than that of the unconscious. The truth of racial hierarchies lies not in the failure to know the horrors of racism but rather in the human, all too human horror of knowing in the first place. 

**McGowan 22** (Todd McGowan, Professor of English at the University of
Vermont, USA, "The Bedlam of the Lynch Mob: Racism and Enjoying Through
the Other," Lacan and Race: Racism, Identity, and Psychoanalytic Theory,
pgs. 19-21)//JRD

Where is the other? [The contemporary proliferation of racism in spite
of our knowledge about its wrongs suggests that we have an unconscious
investment in racism that continues and multiplies.]{.underline}
**[Armed with education and a belief in racism's fundamental immorality,
people today should have no problem leaving racist ideas and practices
behind.]{.underline}** [But education and morality are not enough.
**They are powerless in the face of an unconscious investment**, which
provides the foundation for racism's continuing appeal for those who
indulge in it. The unconscious investment is the central pillar of
racism's intransigence.]{.underline} [Unless one takes the unconscious
as the starting point for making sense of racism's appeal, the mystery
of the enduring power of racism is almost impossible to
decipher.]{.underline} Today, there is a proliferation of [historical
accounts]{.underline} of all the various manifestations of racism. These
accounts [make clear the extent of the problem, but they do not help us
to resolve it because they never attack racism at the point where it has
a hold over us. **The struggle against racism requires an engagement
with the unconscious, but deciphering the unconscious appeal of racism
places us on the difficult terrain of psychoanalytic
interpretation**]{.underline}.1 When we look at the terminology deployed
in the contemporary combat against racism, one might mistakenly assume
that the combatants have already taken the unconscious into account. The
predominance of the term unconscious bias specifically names this aspect
of the psyche. But this apparent nod to psychoanalytic thought is
ultimately misleading. [Although the term unconscious bias has become a
regular part of the anti-racist lexicon, the analysis of the unconscious
has not.]{.underline} In fact, the proponents of the term often take
pains to distinguish their thought from Freud's. In Blindspot, their
leading work on unconscious bias, Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald
assure us that "an understanding of the unconscious workings of the mind
has changed greatly in the century since Freud's pathbreaking
observations."2 According to Banaji and Greenwald, Freud's unscientific
conception of the unconscious has given way to a scientifically
verifiable one: we have now collectively moved beyond Freud's failure to
be scientific enough.3 But in the process of this shift, what has been
lost is Freud's insistence on the radical otherness of the unconscious
in relation to consciousness. The problem manifests itself in the second
part of the term unconscious bias. Bias suggests a distortion of knowing
and suggests that the problem is confined to how we know. This term
indicates the belief that racism represents a failure to know
accurately. **[But once one begins with the premise that the problem of
racism is a problem of knowing, one necessarily misses the radicality of
the problem.]{.underline}** [Armed with this understanding, to correct
our unconscious bias, we just need a little diversity training that
teaches us that our biases are unfounded.]{.underline} [All we need to
do]{.underline}, in short, [is to fill in the gaps of our
knowledge.]{.underline} But **[if racism is unconscious, this means that
it is not simply a problem of knowing but a problem of
enjoying.]{.underline}**4 [We enjoy at odds with how we know. That is to
say, we enjoy not in spite of knowing better but because we know better.
Our unconscious investment in racism delivers an enjoyment that comes at
the expense of what we know, when we transgress the norms that we know
we should obey.]{.underline} **[No matter how much we know better, this
enjoyment will find a way to manifest itself. Instruction alone cannot
alter how we enjoy.]{.underline}** The interchangeability of the term
unconscious bias with implicit bias makes clear the problem. [The
reference to the unconscious is superficial and does not have anything
to do with the unconscious that psychoanalysis theorizes.]{.underline}
The type of theorizing about racism that sees it in terms of unconscious
bias implicitly categorizes racism as an epistemological problem.
[Unconscious bias denotes racism that persons have without knowledge,
not the part of racism that resists knowledge, which is the effect of
the unconscious.]{.underline} **[The unconscious isn't simply a lack of
knowledge. It is what one does without being able to know it prior to
acting.]{.underline}** [The unconscious acts ahead of our knowledge.
Taking this understanding of the unconscious as our point of departure,
we must reverse the relationship between racism and
knowledge.]{.underline} **[Racism is not the result of a bias in our
knowing, but rather we have a bias in our knowing because of
racism.]{.underline}** [To find the root of racism we must look not at
mistakes in knowing but at successes in enjoying.]{.underline} These
successes occur through fantasy. [An analysis of racism that focuses on
the unconscious must take fantasy as its starting point.]{.underline}5
[While not every society relies on a foundational racist fantasy, every
society that has structural racism does. **Fantasy organizes enjoyment
in a way that highlights threats to this enjoyment**, which is why it
provides a foundation for obfuscating social inequalities.]{.underline}6
[Racism manifests itself]{.underline} first and foremost [not through an
exclusionary legal or social apparatus that gives one race an elevated
social position that it denies to others. The primary manifestation of
racism is the racist fantasy. The racist fantasy serves as the
foundation for the legal and social apparatus of discrimination that
arises around it.]{.underline} [It has primacy because it provides a way
of organizing enjoyment for the members of a society that enables them
to sustain the image of an unlimited and complete
satisfaction.]{.underline} [This fantasy becomes especially necessary in
the capitalist universe.]{.underline} **[Without the racist fantasy,
people in capitalist society would lose faith in this image of total
satisfaction.]{.underline}** [Racism keeps the image of an unlimited
satisfaction alive by erecting the racial other as a barrier to
it.]{.underline} [In order to confront racism, it is **not enough to
make reference to what is not conscious, to our implicit
biases.**]{.underline} [We must recognize the unconscious fantasy that
sustains racism and resists efforts at education or consciousness
raising.]{.underline} **[This fantasy remains despite the efforts at
educating away the society's racism.]{.underline}** [Without broaching
the fundamental role that the racist fantasy plays in the formation and
perpetuation of racism, we will have no chance at addressing the racism
that resists enlightenment and awareness.]{.underline} [This combat has
to involve itself in the enjoyment that the racist fantasy
produces.]{.underline}7 Although there are purely individual fantasies,
there are also collective ones that enable societies to cohere around
them. [The racist fantasy]{.underline} is the primary example of a
collective fantasy.8 It [establishes a bond between members of the
society by separating those who belong from those who don't belong
through their mode of enjoying themselves.]{.underline} The irony is
that the enjoyment of those who belong depends on their identification
with the enjoyment of those who don't. This identification occurs
through the racist fantasy. [The racist fantasy creates an avenue for
members of the society to find enjoyment in a direction that doesn't
threaten the structure of the society but instead affirms
it.]{.underline} [The danger that enjoyment poses to the social order
lessens when it occurs through the organizing principle of the racist
fantasy, which channels it in socially innocuous ways.]{.underline} Even
though we imagine that racism has deleterious effects on our bond with
each other, that it harms the social order, the racist fantasy
nonetheless can provide a social glue that holds a society together.
[Through the shared enjoyment that comes from a mutual investment in
this fantasy, members of the society have a clear connection to each
other. Those who don't share in the fantasy, however, exist outside of
the bond and are inherently suspect as members of the society. They are
members of the society but don't belong.]{.underline}**9 [Although those
invested in it have some conscious knowledge of the racist fantasy, the
way that the fantasy organizes enjoyment is unconscious. It is thus
impervious to knowledge.]{.underline}** [The fact that the racist
fantasy is responsible for much of the deployment of enjoyment in
contemporary society means that **efforts at correcting our knowledge
about racism will come to nothing.**]{.underline} [The racist fantasy
organizes the society's enjoyment around racist resentment.]{.underline}
[We can learn about the wrongs of racism, but we need something more to
undermine the racist fantasy that underwrites racism's staying power.
**Fantasies are resistant to greater knowledge because they concern how
people enjoy rather than how they know.**]{.underline} [**Racism is a
fantasy problem, not a knowledge problem.** Racism sticks around in our
era of increased knowledge about its wrongheadedness because we are
psychically invested as a society in a fundamental racist
fantasy.]{.underline} [Although people may consciously want to put
racism behind them, their unconscious desire clings to it as a source of
enjoyment. **The path to this enjoyment runs through the underlying
racist fantasy.**]{.underline}

### L -- Communism

#### **Imagining a communist society is a thought experiment gone wrong that embraces the horror of the real, enables catastrophic dissatisfaction, and creates disaster**

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 197-199, 20 September 2016,
MG)

[Perhaps the most vexing question for those who challenge capitalist
relations of production is the one that asks **what system will replace
the capitalist one**. Communism has been discredited, and those who hold
onto the idea of communism]{.underline}, like Alain Badiou and Slavoj
Žižek, [have no concrete account of what this idea would look like in
practice. It is communism as an ideal]{.underline}, as Badiou readily
admits, [rather than as a concrete historical possibility. Their
communism **informs their thinking and practice**, but it is not a
system ready to be imposed. Other champions of communism,
like]{.underline} Antonio **[Negri and]{.underline}** Michael
[**Hardt**, also fall victim to this inability to envision the communist
future in anything other than superficial and ambiguous terms. They are
cautious not to invoke any concrete descriptions that might function as
rallying cries for a political movement]{.underline}. Still others, like
Simon Critchley or Judith Butler, champion resistance to capitalism as
an end in itself and offer no sense of an alternative.26

Though the political position of unceasing resistance to capitalism and
the state seems proximate to a focus on means, one should make an
absolute distinction between them. [Resistance conspicuously avoids the
possibility of taking power. Privileging the means, on the other hand,
represents an alternative organization of society, in which productivity
and the final cause are no longer determinative. A politics that
privileges the means has no problem determining the structure of the
social order]{.underline}. In contrast with the proponents of resistance
like Butler and Critchley, proponents of the means insist of seizing the
reins, even if only indirectly in the manner of the people of Macondo in
One Hundred Years of Solitude. The champions of the means don't display
the caution that proliferates among the partisans of resistance.

[This caution is perhaps an effect of the **failed communist
experiment** of the twentieth century]{.underline}. Even Badiou, who is
not reluctant to embrace the signifier communism, understands that [the
revolutionary mindset of the twentieth century cannot serve the
twenty-first. The revolutionaries of the twentieth century produced
tragedies that the revolutionaries of the twenty-first century **must
avoid**.27 The embrace of the **horror of the real leads straight to the
gulag,** which is the effect of thought attempting to outstrip the act.
The catastrophes of the twentieth century]{.underline}, as Badiou sees
it, [are the result of an effort to **think a new system into being**
rather than to maintain fidelity to the material revolutionary
event]{.underline}. The result in the twenty-first century is a
philosophical caution, even among the most committed revolutionaries.

In one sense, this philosophical caution about advocating for a new
socioeconomic system is warranted. It reflects, on this single issue,
the victory of Hegel over Marx. For Marx, the only purpose of
philosophical thought consists in its contribution to political
practice. As the final thesis on Feuerbach has it, philosophy must
forego interpretation in order to commit itself to political
transformation. Hegel's ambitions for philosophy are much more modest.
He claims that any political ambitions are simply beyond philosophy's
province. As he puts it in the preface to Elements of the Philosophy of
Right, "As far as the individual is concerned, each individual is in any
case a child of his time; thus philosophy, too, is its own time
comprehended in thoughts. It is just as foolish to imagine that any
philosophy can transcend its contemporary world as that an individual
can overleap his own time or leap over Rhodes."28 According to Hegel,
[it would seem that philosophy can play **no role at all in politics**
other than identifying the proper questions that our epoch poses and
interpreting them. The philosopher cannot theorize a new
future.]{.underline}

[But even though the philosopher cannot anticipate the future
socioeconomic system that might arise after capitalism, she or he can
identify how another system **already exists implicitly** within the
current system. This is possible with the category of the means. Though
capitalism incessantly transforms means into ends, nothing necessitates
this transformation, and in fact, it always occurs with many
hiccups]{.underline}. The means are always present along with the end.
Thus, privileging the means represents the alternative to capitalism
waiting to be discovered. Its discovery depends on a philosophical act
on our part.

[Usually, theorists cannot take the lead in revolutionary upheavals.
When they do, **disaster** almost **inevitably
follows**]{.underline}**.** But they can forge an approach to the world
that reveals the unsustainability of the capitalist system and thereby
make the alternative readily apparent. This is what transpires when we
abandon the final cause that underwrites capitalist productivity and
insist on the means for its own sake and not for what it will produce.
By doing so, [we **do not magically leap** outside the constraints of
our present situation; we do not "jump over Rhodes." Instead, we show
that there is no need to make this jump. The means is a future that is
already present within capitalism, and the task of the theorist---or
even the task of the revolutionary---consists not in creating a new
system but in identifying the implicit presence of this new system
within the existing one.]{.underline}

Privileging the means is an alternative system to capitalism existing
within the capitalist framework. By bringing this system to light, we
don't unleash productive capacity in the way that Marx dreamed. Instead,
we unleash our capacity to pursue means for their own sake, what Agamben
calls means without end. [We immerse ourselves in **the traumatic
satisfaction of work** that matters more than its goal. The product
becomes a by-product of the means, not the end that the means aims at
accomplishing. It is only in such a system of pure means that we can
**finally abandon the tyranny of the final cause**.]{.underline}

### L -- Deleuze

#### Deleuze and Guattari are goofy -- the system wants you to invest into desire which cements psychic dependence on capitalism

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 63-65, 20 September 2016, MG)

[Capitalism has a **parasitic** relationship to signification. It
mirrors the effects that language has on the speaking being, while
cementing the **psychic dependence** that the speaking being has on the
illusory desire of the Other that emerges through signification.
Capitalism remolds the subject in its own image and protects the subject
from confronting its own traumatic satisfaction]{.underline}. It is, of
course, possible to break this hold, to which the bare fact of
recognizing it attests. But doing so requires discovering the extent and
power of its reach.

[Many critics of capitalism have failed to see that desire itself---
specifically, the belief that we might realize our desire---is the
**problem** rather than the solution]{.underline}. In an oft-cited
statement from AntiOedipus (their treatise attacking both psychoanalysis
and capitalism as they function together), Gilles **[Deleuze
and]{.underline}** Félix [**Guattari** claim, "Desire can never be
deceived. Interests can be deceived, unrecognized, or betrayed, but not
desire."]{.underline}32 Though Deleuze and Guattari recognize how
capitalism appropriates desire---for them, in a manner of speaking, it
is nothing but the appropriation of desire--- [they do not see how
desire, though it might not be deceived, can itself be a deception.
Anti-Oedipus is a **panegyric to desire**. Capitalism may function
through desire, but in the end, it puts the brakes on desire and doesn't
take desire far enough. What we need, according to Deleuze and Guattari,
is more desire, more refusals of restrictions on desire.]{.underline}

Given the identification that I see at work between capitalism and the
fantasy of unrestricted desire, [what I am proposing here is an
**anti-Anti-Oedipus**]{.underline}. Deleuze and Guattari attack
capitalism and psychoanalysis for the obstacles they erect toward the
expansion of desire. But [the problem isn't the obstacles capitalism
creates; it is that capitalism's contingent obstacles **obscure the
necessity of the obstacle**. Capitalism's deception consists in
convincing us, as it convinces Deleuze and Guattari, that desire can
transcend its failures and overcome all barriers. We don't need more
desire, but rather the recognition that **the barrier is what we
desire.** It is this recognition that provides the key for divesting
ourselves from the appeal of capitalism.]{.underline}

[Even though capitalism's incessant self-reproduction seems to mimic the
structure of subjectivity---constant repetition for its own sake---this
movement, as manifested in the capitalist system, always has a goal to
realize]{.underline}. The capitalism system must promise a better and
wealthier future. Neither individual capitalists nor the system as a
whole can function without the goal of future enrichment, whereas the
subject always operates without the possibility of a more satisfying
future. What separates the apparently repetitive circulation of capital
from the subject's repetition is accumulation. [**The subject seeks
loss, not successful accumulation**, which means that any attempt to
link capitalism to subjectivity involves a **category error.** The
subject's satisfaction does not require, and in fact disdains, the
illusion of gain that sustains the capitalist system.]{.underline}

[The capitalist subject oscillates between dissatisfaction and pleasure,
between absence and presence, and it cannot recognize the satisfaction
that underlies this oscillation. This subject remains, however, a
subject animated by a lost object]{.underline}. As such, it derives its
satisfaction from the series of failures to arrive at the pleasure it
seeks. Late in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud suggests what was
for him at the time a disturbing hypothesis. He says tentatively, "The
pleasure principle seems actually to serve the death instincts."33 If we
understand "death instincts" here as the subject's attachment to loss,
this brief sentence at the conclusion of Freud's brief book provides the
most thoroughgoing critique of capitalism that anyone has ever written.
[The recognition that we are not really pursuing pleasure frees us from
the **chains of capitalism** more completely than **any other
revolutionary gesture**.]{.underline}

#### Deleuze and Guattari can't explain the denial of desire but we can -- reject the goofballs

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 129-130, 20 September 2016,
MG)

The brilliance of Ricardo's formulation has stood the test of time, and
we should have a proper appreciation for it. Prominent defenders of
capitalism in the twentieth century, like F. A. Hayek and Milton
Friedman, continued to reason like this in order to justify the ways of
capitalism to humanity. Ricardo's logic cannot be countered because it
is perfectly circular: [capitalism gratifies human desires, but it is
only through the free market that we can know those
desires]{.underline}. Ricardo never articulates the nature of human
desires prior to their fulfillment, which renders his solution so
elegant and utterly irrefutable. From this perspective, [any attempt to
argue for an alternative would ipso facto represent a **loss of touch**
with desire as such]{.underline}. Though Ricardo's argument is
irrefutable, it does rest on the vitalist assumption that desire is
natural, that it emerges out of life itself. According to this
assumption, we simply cannot be made to desire what we don't already
desire.

This vitalism founds capitalist ideology, but it founders when it runs
into the problem of sacrifice. According to vitalist thesis, sacrifice
must be the result of some type of deception---either people being
deceived or deceiving themselves. The vitalist analysis thus consists of
denouncing those responsible for this deception, those who coerce others
into accepting the negation of life. In A Thousand Plateaus, Gilles
[Deleuze and]{.underline} Félix [Guattari place the blame on the figure
of the priest.37 Anyone who insists on the necessity of sacrifice and
lack, like the psychoanalyst or the Hegelian philosopher,
occupies]{.underline}, according to Deleuze and Guattari, [the position
of the priest and contributes to the denial of desire.]{.underline}

[But what neither **Deleuze and Guattari** nor the defenders of
capitalism can explain is how the **denial of desire emerges as a
possibility**. If there is only life, and sacrifice comes as a monstrous
deviation from life, the vitalist cannot explain what enables this
deviation to occur. In other words, life must already **negate
itself**--- being must be self-negating---in order for subjects to have
the capacity for sacrificing themselves. There must be a space within
life for sacrifice in order for priests to come along and convince
people to sacrifice themselves]{.underline}. The victims are either
somewhat invested in their own victimization or completely ~~stupid~~,
and even this ~~stupidity~~ would have to receive a philosophical
reckoning.

Despite its conceptual beauty, Ricardo's [vision of a closed loop
between capitalism and desire **must be rejected** for its failure to
account for the origin of desire. The test of capitalism as an economic
system is **not** that it meets all the needs that appear within it,
since this is one it can't fail. The test is rather whether or not
capitalism can **permit the avowal of the satisfaction that it
produces**. This is a test that capitalism does in fact fail. Capitalism
relies on the violent sacrifice of workers, consumers, and even
capitalists themselves, and it uses this sacrifice to produce satisfied
subjects. But this sacrifice can play no part in capitalism's
ideological selfunderstanding.]{.underline} In response to this failure
to make sacrifice explicit, reactionary alternatives to capitalism have
proliferated. These alternatives seek a system in which they can
rediscover the sacrifice that capitalism appears to deny to us. The
first thinker to focus the critique of capitalism on its failure with
regard to sacrifice was Georges Bataille, an anticapitalist apostle of
sacrifice.

### L -- Expertism

#### Reject their illusions of grandeur and dictum of expertise.

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan, Professor of English at the University of
Vermont, USA, "Enjoying What We Don't Have: The Political Project of
Psychoanalysis," pgs. 170-172)//JRD

[When experts become the voice of authority, the political landscape
undergoes a dramatic change, the ramifications of which have become
increasingly visible in the last few decades.]{.underline} The
transformation of authority that began in the seventeenth century
realized itself at the conclusion of the twentieth, and the result has
been a reversal of traditional political alignments. [This social
revolution strips the forces of social change of their favorite weapon
--- knowledge --- because use of this weapon has the effect of turning
subjects against social change, despite the fact that that change is
clearly in their best interests. In today's world, expert knowledge
necessarily confronts the subject as an external imperative laced with
the power of prohibition.]{.underline} [The rise of the expert
corresponds to the increasing complexity and treacherousness of everyday
life; contemporary existence seems to demand expert analysis to render
it navigable.]{.underline} In his account of the emergence of what he
calls a "risk society," Ulrich Beck notices the politics of expert
knowledge changing sides. He points out: "[The non-acceptance of the
scientific definition of risks is not something to be reproached as
'irrationality' in the population; but quite to the contrary, it
indicates that the cultural premises of acceptability contained in
scientific and technical statements on risks are wrong.\"]{.underline}
[The technical risk experts are mistaken in the empirical accuracy of
their implicit value premises, specifically in their assumptions of what
appears acceptable to the population.]{.underline}"9 [Experts provide
guidelines that allow subjects to navigate the contours of contemporary
society, in which risk confronts us everywhere, but the experts perform
this function with no proper sense of what the population desires. In
this process, experts inevitably assume the role of authority
figures.]{.underline} As Beck's statement above indicates, from the
perspective of the general population itself, [the relationship between
the expert and the population is adversarial.]{.underline} Through
psychoanalytic thought, [we can gain insight into the ramifications of
the rise of the expert authority]{.underline} and the decline of the
master. [The emergence of the expert as the figure of authority
fundamentally changes the political terrain]{.underline}, [and our
political thinking must adjust to this transformation.]{.underline}
Psychoanalytic thought represents a privileged vehicle for making the
adjustment. [Combating the expert is much more difficult than combating
the master: the knowledge that would subvert mastery becomes part of the
power that the expert wields and thus loses its subversive
power.]{.underline} [A different political program --- one that focuses
on enjoyment rather than knowledge --- becomes necessary because the
master and the expert take up radically different positions relative to
enjoyment.]{.underline} [Unlike the master, the earlier form of social
authority, the expert not only prohibits enjoyment but also appears to
embody this enjoyment through the act of laying down
regulations.]{.underline} [The expert enjoys informing subjects about
the dangers they face or the ways they should alter their behavior, and
it is this enjoyment that subjects rebel against.]{.underline} The
enjoyment that the expert derives from providing counsel is the explicit
focus of Peter Segal's Anger Management (2003), which finds comedy in
the abuse that an anger management therapist heaps on his client. The
film recounts the travails of a timid businessman, Dave Buznik (Adam
Sandler), who is sentenced to anger management therapy aft er a
misunderstanding occurs between a flight attendant and him while he is
traveling. His therapist, Dr. Buddy Rydell ( Jack Nicholson), practices
an aggressive treatment that involves intimidating Buznik, screaming at
him, and even invading his personal life. At the end of the film, rather
than helping Buznik, Rydell appears to have wooed Buznik's girlfriend
away from him and basically destroyed his life. Here we see all the ways
that the expert enjoys deploying knowledge, and [this enjoyment occurs
at the expense of the subject receiving the advice.]{.underline} But in
the last instance Anger [Management remains fully ensconced in the
regime of the expert]{.underline}, despite the comedy it tries to create
at the expense of this regime. The film's ending reveals that Rydell has
set up the entire experience --- including the incident with the flight
attendant and the sentencing by the judge --- in order to impel Buznik
to express himself, especially to his girlfriend. Rather than a course
in anger management, Rydell has actually been offering a course in
self-expression. This denouement transforms the film's (and the
viewer's) relationship to the expert: rather than impugning the rule of
expertise and knowledge, the film becomes an affirmation of it. The
ending of the film doesn't simply spoil an otherwise trenchant critique
of expert rule but infects the critique throughout the film. The
critique --- and the comedy, unfortunately --- never go far enough
because the idea that the expert really knows and really has the best
interests of the client at heart informs the entirety of the film. The
film's investment in the expert that it appears to critique portends the
film's failure as both comedy and critique. [The rule of the expert has
such a degree of hegemony today that it is difficult to think of
any]{.underline} films, novels, and other artworks that [attempt to
contest it or expose the expert's enjoyment without ultimately partaking
of it.]{.underline} On the other hand, [the works that allow audiences
to enjoy along with the expert multiply throughout the
culture.]{.underline} Television shows such as csi: Crime Scene
Investigations and House M.D. display this dynamic in its most open
form: the shows present a problem that appears utterly unsolvable to the
viewer, and then they reveal the expert's genius at finding a solution.
[Expert knowledge --- a knowledge not accessible to the ordinary subject
--- has all the answers and thus becomes the undisputable locus of
authority. The popularity of these shows derives from their ability to
allow audiences to share in the expert's enjoyment, an enjoyment that
typically is the site of trauma for the subject. Contact with expert
authority has a traumatic effect on the subject because of the proximity
of the expert.]{.underline} While the old master remained at a distance,
[the expert is always in the subject's face]{.underline}, like Dr. Buddy
Rydell in Anger Management, [never allowing the subject room to
breathe.]{.underline} As Anger Management shows, this proximity has the
effect of stimulating the subject. [Under the rule of the expert,
subjects experience]{.underline} what Eric Santner calls "[a sustained
traumatization induced by exposure]{.underline} to, as it were, fathers
who \[know\] too much about living human beings."10 [Exposure to this
type of authority, to "this excess of knowledge," produces "an
intensification of the body \[that\] is first and foremost a
sexualization."]{.underline}11 [Instead of emancipating the subject,
knowledge traumatizes and plays the central role in the subjection of
the subject to the order of social regulation.]{.underline}

### L---Liberatory Transgression

#### Their affirmation of transgressive violence enables a [will to destruction]{.underline} that creates the conditions for [brutal]{.underline} antiblack violence

**George 16** (Sheldon George, Professor of English at Simmons
University, 2016 , \"Trauma and Race: A Lacanian Study of African
American Racial Identity\", pp 27-30)//guyB

\*\*TW: intense depictions of violence

In his Ethics seminar, [Lacan associates true jouissance precisely with
transgression]{.underline}. Though arguing that fantasy, or what he
calls the "entropy" of the signifier that must ever miss the mark of the
Real, is "the sole regular point at which we have access to the nature
of jouissance," [Lacan also identifies a "jouissance of transgression"
that is "beyond the phallus" or fantasy object of pleasure, one that
emerges from violation of the limits imposed by the Symbolic regularity
of moralistic and judicial laws]{.underline}.71 Maintaining that
prohibition is the "all-terrain vehicle" that drives the subject through
what is "impassable" in the "paths to jouissance," Lacan asserts that
"[without a transgression there is no access to
jouissance]{.underline}."72 Lacan's thinking here returns to the
Freudian notion that "**[civilization is based upon renunciation of
impulse gratification]{.underline}**" and to Freud's conclusion that
"[wherever the community suspends its reproaches the suppression of evil
desire also ceases]{.underline}."73 I read [slavery as involving just
such a suspension or loosening of moral restrictions]{.underline}, and I
argue that, [most especially in the South, this allows with impunity
transgression of the law and emergence of the evil desires that agitate
around the internal emptiness characteristic of the
subject]{.underline}. The slaves' narratives themselves vividly display
these evil desires and the cruelty they unleash. The **[narratives of
both Brown and Douglass depict the illicit murders of slaves subjected
to the transgressive power of white masters and citizens]{.underline}**.
Douglass describes the case of a slave named Demby who runs into a creek
to escape a whipping by the overseer, who gives him to the count of
three to come out of the water and then proceeds with "consummate
coolness" and "savage barbarity" to shoot down his "standing victim" in
front of a crowd of slaves.74 Douglass states that Demby's "mangled body
sank out of sight, and blood and brains marked the water where he
stood."75 Not only was this "horrid crime" never "submitted to judicial
investigation," since it was witnessed only by slaves, but in its wake,
Douglass relates, its executer's "fame as an overseer went abroad."76
Here it is through the capacity granted whites by dictates of slavery to
transgress the laws of the land that the overseer accesses a means of
jouissance, solidifying his hierarchal fantasy relation to being while
also breaching the legislated limits of Symbolic activity to express
evil desires to kill and destroy that otherwise would be socially
curtailed. [In slavery, even the law itself promotes its own
transgression]{.underline}. As Brown observes[, "Where the slave is
placed by law entirely under the control of a man who claims him, body
and soul, as property, what else could be expected than the most
depraved social practices]{.underline}?"77 [The transgressions of the
master depicted by ex-slaves point to slavery's ability to unleash "the
unconscious aggression" and the "frightening core of the destrudo" that
Freud names the death drive]{.underline}.78 [This death drive is always
"for an Other-thing" than what is "registered in the signifying chain"
of the Symbolic, and it is thus marked by a "**will to
destruction**."]{.underline}79 Aimed at the Real, [the subject of the
destrudo pursues an annihilating path that both decimates the other and
unhinges the self from those Symbolic moorings through which subjective
identity and meaning are grounded]{.underline}. Douglass describes most
directly the birth of this destructive will in his discussion of his
[mistress Mrs. Auld, a "woman of the kindest heart and finest feelings,"
whose exposure to "the fatal poison of irresponsible power" leads to the
corruption of a gentle, balanced self-identity]{.underline}.80 Douglass
notes, "[That cheerful eye, under the influence of slavery, soon became
red with rage, the voice, made all of sweet accord, changed to one of
harsh and horrid discord, and that angelic face gave place to that of a
demon]{.underline}."81 Ultimately [positioning jouissance beyond the
Symbolic,]{.underline} Lacan argues that **[jouissance "begins with a
tickle and ends in a blaze of petrol.]{.underline}**"82 It [is this
consumption of his mistress by the hellish blaze of her transgressive
jouissance that Douglass displays to be the result of her acquisition of
power over slaves]{.underline}. What [her slaves allow her is access to
that central excluded core that is "at the heart" of the subject but
"beyond" him or her, the "interior or emptiness" of which the subject
does not know to whom it belongs, whether "to me or to
nobody]{.underline}."83 [**Driven toward the other in pursuit of this
emptiness beyond the Symbolic**, Douglass' mistress travels a
destructive path]{.underline} that leaves her only a few steps behind
the lady Mrs. Hick, who Douglass relates murdered his "wife's cousin" by
"mangling her person in the most horrible manner, breaking her nose and
breastbone with a stick, so that the poor girl expired in a few hours
afterward. Narratives such as Douglass' and Brown's allow us to see
[slavery as involving the approach toward a "central emptiness" where,
once reached, the other's "body breaks into pieces.]{.underline}"[85 In
the subject's approach to this lack, the racial other is reduced to the
condition of what Lacan calls a "part object, . . . silhouetted there,
separated from us and rising up . . . in the midst of a charnel house
figure]{.underline}."86 [When the other is the route to the self, the
other disappears, not only as a living being whose subjective existence
one fails to acknowledge beyond this other's relation to the fantasy
object, but also as a source of the shaming gaze that tames one's
transgressive desires. Lacan presents **the gaze as the look from the
other that "surprises" the subject** "in the function of voyeur,
disturbs him" in the actions through which he pursues his transgressive
desires]{.underline}, "overwhelms him and reduces him to a feeling of
shame."87 I read slavery as an attempt at eliding the gaze that may tame
the master's transgressive pursuit of the Real. What we see in Douglass'
description of the overseer is precisely the failure of the gaze of the
slave community witnessing the murder to establish the limits produced
by shame. This breach of the limit by the overseer allows for a Symbolic
restructuring of his identity and a growth in his popularity. [But what
we see in Douglass' Mrs. Auld is that **breaching the limit strays one
from the psychic path of desire** and leads one not merely to a
restructuring of identity but, more importantly, to **the dissolving of
the subjective limits that grant identity Symbolic
structure**]{.underline}**.** Where [the gaze is "the object that
presents each \[subjective\] desire with its universal rule, by
materializing its cause, in binding to it the subject's
division,"]{.underline} slavery forestalls the shame that may
materialize the fact of that subjective limitation that is castration.88
[Not only is the slave's potential position as holder of the shaming
gaze jeopardized by slavery, but the return look of all Symbolic Others
is deflected by the social sanctioning of transgression]{.underline}.
Without such enabling restraints placed on jouissance, [the subject, who
is most properly a desiring subject founded upon lack, **devolves into a
subject merely of the drive, advancing precipitously toward a
destruction of both self and other**]{.underline}**.**

### L -- Love

#### Their insistence on selling the ethic of love for the price of the ballot cements traumatic relations and forces subjects to experience dissatisfaction -- an ethic of love is synonymous with an ethic of capitalism

[LOVE FOR SALE]{.underline}

[Love seems like a **capitalist plot**. The prospect of falling in love
and the process associated with it form the lifeblood of many
corporations---those dedicated to the sale of diamond rings, roses,
chocolate truffles, flights to Paris, and so on. The ways of love that
redound to benefit of capitalism are not visible only on February
14.]{.underline} It is difficult to look at the array of commodities
available in today's world and not see in almost every one some
influence of the fantasy of falling in love. Gym memberships, diet soda,
mascara, and leather jackets all hold within them the potential to
render us worthy of love. Perhaps no one goes to the gym consciously
trying to create a lovable body, but keeping oneself in proper shape has
some relationship to acquiring and keeping a lover. Those who are fit
tend to have much better prospects.1

[Even if we are unfit and have long odds for acquiring an actual lover,
capitalism provides almost **infinite opportunities for the fantasy of
love.** The romance novelist sells love through an impossible fantasy
scenario, and even the video game manufacturer promises the social
outcast the possibility of heroism that would make this outcast worthy
of love]{.underline}. Beer commercials promise love relations if we
choose the proper beer, and jewelry advertisements assure us that our
proposal will be accepted if we purchase the proper ring.2 [There seems
to be no terrain free of the fantasy of love within the capitalist
universe. Though love emerges earlier in human history than capitalism,
it appears as if capitalism **invented love ex nihilo**, given how
useful it has become for fostering the subject's investment in
capitalist relations of production.]{.underline}

The commodity status of love becomes clearest in the case of dating
services. The dating service is not simply a refuge for those who fail
at falling in love on their own and therefore require assistance.
Instead, it provides the paradigm for love in the capitalist system. Its
structure is so significant that it is almost impossible to understand
how love operates within capitalism without examining the structure of
the dating service. One often turns to a dating service out of
desperation, and it is this desperation that gives the dating service
its revelatory power.

One pays the dating service for the possibility of falling in love.
Unlike the gym or the jewelry store, it offers a direct path to love. I
sign up in hopes of finding someone with whom I might fall in love
without having to go to the trouble of sculpting my body or finding the
perfect necklace that would render me worthy of love. The directness of
the dating service is the source of the ignominy attached to it. But
this direct route provided by the dating service lays bare the commodity
status of love under capitalism even more clearly than the
advertisements surrounding Valentine's Day. This clarity stems from the
way the dating service arranges compatible partners.

The dating service demands that clients list their favorable qualities.
When I compile such a list, I portray myself as a desirable and
potentially lovable commodity. I offer myself up to the dating service
for others to examine, test-drive, and perhaps purchase. To do this, I
must transform myself into a series of qualities and preferences that
function as an advertisement for myself. The features that render me
more appealing as a commodity are necessarily the ones that I emphasize,
and I pass over in silence the features that would lessen my exchange
value. I highlight my sense of humor and my doctorate in macroeconomics
while making no mention of my baldness and chronic bad breath. Even my
preferences become part of my commodity status. My love for the outdoors
or for watching classic movies helps to render me more appealing.
Preferences advertise me as much as qualities do. This mode of
self-presentation reveals that one must transform oneself into a
commodity when one embarks on the quest for love.

But the dating service doesn't simply require that prospective lovers
list their qualities and preferences. They must also choose what they
want in their love object. After purchasing an account at the dating
service, I must create a profile of my desires, and the service will
attempt to match my desires with the appropriate object. For instance, I
tell the service that I prefer men in their forties with brown eyes who
like to read crime fiction and play chess. Just as I go into a grocery
store with a shopping list for the items that I believe will realize my
desire, I provide the dating service with a description of the
characteristics that I find desirable in a romantic partner. But unlike
at the grocery store, I go to the dating service in search of love, not
just a carton of ice cream that would provide an inherently fleeting
satisfaction for my desire.

The commodity that the dating service sells is much more valuable than
those sold by the grocery store because it carries with it the illusion
of a complete satisfaction. No one believes that eating a particular
kind of ice cream will provide such a lasting satisfaction that I will
never desire ice cream again, but many in capitalist society believe
that finding one's soul mate will permanently solve the problem of
desire for a love object. This difference bespeaks the pivotal role love
has within capitalism. It is not just one commodity among many but the
central commodity. One might say that all other commodities are modeled
on the love object rather than vice versa.3

[But in addition to exposing the commodity structure of love in the
capitalist universe, the dating service enables subjects to bypass **the
inherently traumatic nature of the love encounter**. The list of
desirable qualities that I provide the dating service is the key to the
service's ideological function. Such a list attempts to remove the
trauma of love by eliminating its unforeseen power, its ability to
attack the subject at the most inconvenient time and in the most
unanticipated form. Though we may have a particular type that we find
attractive, the beloved doesn't necessarily fit this type. In fact, we
can fall in love with someone because she or he isn't the sort of object
that usually appeals to us, not because she or he is.]{.underline} The
dating service tries to mask the unexpectedness of love by making it
thoroughly predictable. The dating service transforms love from a
disruption into a stable structure for one's life.4

[The permanence attached to the love object is central to the role that
**love plays within capitalism**]{.underline}. Though many people use
dating services just to discover temporary sexual partners, [the idea of
finding a permanent relation looms large for the clients of these
services. Even if marriage goes completely out of style, the idea of
loving someone else "forever" probably will not. This idea is not purely
ideological. It reflects the ability of **love to disrupt the course of
everyday life** and to introduce the eternal into the temporal. But it
also reflects the promise **inherent in every commodity**, the promise
of a permanent fulfillment of one's desire that the commodity will never
keep.]{.underline}

[Like the typical commodity, love always keeps the subject coming back
for more. One seeks either to rekindle love with one's partner or to
find someone new. In terms of love's connection to the commodity, there
is no difference between renewing one's vows, going on a second
honeymoon, and leaving one's spouse for a newer model. In each case, the
subject **experiences the dissatisfaction** associated with having the
commodity and seeks a new form of the commodity in order to ameliorate
that dissatisfaction]{.underline}. Novelty is crucial to keeping love
alive within capitalism, even if novelty involves varying relations with
the same person. [The logic of the commodity rules in the domain of
love. One purchase is never enough, despite the claims that the
salesperson at the dating service or the priest at the wedding
makes.]{.underline}

The existence of the dating service in some form or another is not a
recent phenomenon. Though no shadchan had an online presence until
recently, the activity of this Jewish matchmaker appears very early in
the recorded history of the Jews. But the dating service changes the
nature of the office that the matchmaker performs, just as contemporary
capitalism changes the nature of love. [**The dating service is a
synecdoche for capitalist society as such**. When I go to the dating
service, I seek love as an object available for purchase, and this is
the form in which love appears throughout the capitalist
universe.]{.underline}

[Love that one can purchase is no longer love, however. It is romance.
Though capitalism appears to rely heavily on love, it necessitates a
transformation from love to romance]{.underline}. This is capitalism's
ideological operation in the domain of love. [By transforming love into
romance and thus into a commodity, capitalism provides **respite from
the trauma of love**. Capitalist society loves to talk about love, but
even as it does so, it remakes love, which involves an object that we
can't have, into romance, which involves an object that we
can.]{.underline}

#### Embracing an ethic of love is a narcissistic illusion that traumatizes the subject and forces others to change in dissatisfying ways

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 211-213, 20 September 2016,
MG)

Throughout most of his seminars, Jacques Lacan attacks [love as a
**narcissistic illusion**. When the subject loves, it places the other
in **exactly the same position that the ego occupies** in the
narcissistic relation. Both narcissism and love enable the subject to
**short-circuit the relationship** with social authority while still
remaining within the domain of that authority. One feels free without
having to endure the groundlessness of actual freedom]{.underline}.
Though he does see the possibility of an exception, Lacan says in a
statement representative of his overall attitude, "[love is only
accessible on the condition that it remains **always narrowly
narcissistic**."16 While in love with someone else, one loves **oneself
through this other**. No one feels like a narcissist when she or he
loves, but this is just the result of love's deception]{.underline}.
Nonetheless, narcissism is not the last word on love.

Even though love puts the other in the ego's stead, the relation is
always rockier than the narcissistic one. [Narcissism is ultimately a
**disappointing relation** that the subject cannot indefinitely sustain,
but the love object **traumatizes the subject in a way the ego cannot**.
The ego is just an image, an ideal that the subject has constructed for
itself, but in love the image is **always incomplete**. The other has
the capacity to **elicit the subject's love** insofar as it remains
irreducible to its image.]{.underline}

[Initially, this irreducibility to the image provokes our desire. We
desire what we can't see in the image on the basis of what we
can]{.underline}. That is to say, the beloved object does not just
remain a desired object. Our desire evokes the desire of the object, and
love involves the encounter of these overlapping desires. The encounter
with the desire emanating from the beloved object transforms love into
an experience different from desire. [Desire enables the subject to
remain at a distance that love **obliterates**. Herein lies the
radicality of love in relation to desire.]{.underline}

The beloved object's response gives love its disruptiveness. In love,
what we can't see reaches back toward us. This is a point that Lacan
makes in his seminar devoted to the phenomenon of the transference (and
a lengthy reading of Plato's Symposium), which includes his most
sustained discussion of love. He claims, "[love is what passes in this
object toward which we **hold out our hand** through our own desire, and
which, at the moment when our desire makes its fire break out, allows
for an instant this response to appear to us, this other hand that is
held out toward us as the other's desire."17 Where desire encounters the
illusion of an object at the point where it expected something
substantial, love encounters what it **didn't expect to encounter**.
18]{.underline}

[The response from the beloved---"the hand held out toward us"--- jolts
the subject out of its everyday existence. One cannot predict this
moment or work to bring it into being, and it thus appears as a secular
miracle. In love the object does not stay in its proper position. The
response to desire **forces the subject to change its life entirely**
without any clear guidance as to how it should do so. Inasmuch as it
strips away all possibility of an ordinary life, love **suffuses the
subject with satisfaction**. Life no longer just goes on.]{.underline}

Love in an act of proximity. The lover refuses to remain at a safe
distance and bombards the subject with its mode of satisfaction, a mode
of satisfaction around which the subject must try to orient itself. This
satisfaction is what we almost always recoil from, but in the act of
love we embrace it. This is why lovers can accompany each other in the
most private moments: they can tell each other their most revelatory
dreams or allow the other into the bathroom with them. What would
alienate or even repulse everyone else becomes integral to the love
relation.

[We know that someone is in love when the beloved's most repellant
qualities undergo a complete reversal of valence. A person's unpleasant
smell, slovenly attire, or obnoxious eating habits become appealing
quirks rather than reasons for keeping a distance. The lover embraces
the most unflattering characteristics of the beloved and treats them as
sublime indexes of the beloved's worth]{.underline}. The unpleasant odor
resulting from a refusal to shower, for instance, would become an
indication of the beloved object's disdain for obsessive daily rituals
with which others waste their time. [There is no quality so
**universally negative** that it could not undergo this
transubstantiation in the act of love: fat can become cuddliness,
emaciation can become fitness, bad attire can become idiosyncratic
style, and so on. In contrast to desire, love depends on the embrace of
what is undesirable in the object.19]{.underline}

### L -- Knowledge Production

#### Formulating alternative systems of knowledge production is a ruse of progress and solely amplifies the power of the death drive, confronting bodies with a horror of knowing

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 17-19, 1 July 2013, MG)

[But the inescapability of the idea of progress goes still
further]{.underline}. It is not just the normative appeal that implies
this idea; [any system of thought, **even one that confines itself to
pure descriptions**, inevitably points toward the **possibility of
progress**. The act of articulating a system of thought implies the
belief that a better world is possible and that the knowledge the system
provides will assist in realizing this better world. If I didn't believe
in the possibility of improvement, I would never bother to articulate
any system at all. The very act of enunciating **even the most
pessimistic system** attests to a fundamental optimism and **hope for
progress beyond the status quo**]{.underline}. This is true for an
extreme pessimist like Arthur Schopenhauer as much as it is for an
avowed utopian like Charles Fourier. [The position from which one
enunciates the pessimistic system is the position invested in the idea
of progress, even when the enunciated content of the system completely
denounces the idea]{.underline}. Though the good may be impossible to
realize, it is also impossible to abandon entirely. [The production of
knowledge itself points, often despite itself, toward a better
future.]{.underline}

[This link between knowledge and progress is the controlling idea of the
Enlightenment]{.underline}. In his essay "What Is Enlightenment?" Kant
emphasizes that [Enlightenment requires a situation where one is free to
gain knowledge, where one has "freedom to make public use of one's
reason in all matters."27 In the act of gaining knowledge through
reasoning, subjects **facilitate progress** as they put this knowledge
into use by restructuring society. Knowledge, for Kant and for all
Enlightenment thinkers, has an inherently progressive
leaning]{.underline}. It frees us from the tyranny of the past and from
the drudgery of repetition. Progress is only possible because we have
the ability to know the past and to learn from it.28 The Enlightenment's
belief in progress derives from its conception of the human subject as a
subject of knowledge, a subject who fundamentally wants to know.

[For psychoanalysis, the link between knowledge and progress **dooms the
possibility of progress**. Rather than desiring to know, the subject
desires not to know and organizes its existence around the **avoidance
of**]{.underline} **[knowledge]{.underline}**. In "Le séminaire XXI"
Lacan states this straightforwardly: ["There has been no desire for
knowledge but . . . **a horror of knowing**."29 The knowledge that we
avoid is knowledge of the unconscious because this knowledge **confronts
us with the power of the death drive** and the inescapability of
repetition. What we don't know --- our particular form of]{.underline}
~~stupidity~~ --- [allows us to move forward, to view the future with
hopefulness. Without this fundamental refusal to know, the subject
simply could not continue.30]{.underline}

Freud's great revolution in the history of thought stems from his
conception of the subject as a subject of desire rather than as a
subject of knowledge. Where thinkers from Plato to Kant consider an
inherent striving to know as essential to subjectivity, not only does
Freud envision a different essential drive, he contends that [the
subject wants not to know in order to continue to desire. The subject
acts not on the basis of what it knows but on the basis of how
it]{.underline} [desires]{.underline}. We might imagine linking these
two ideas of the subject if we could link the act of knowing and the act
of desiring.

[But knowledge and desire are at odds: the subject doesn't want to know
what it desires or how it enjoys. Its knowledge **remains necessarily
incomplete,** and the gap within knowledge is the trigger for the
subject's desire and the point at which it enjoys. The unconscious
emerges out of the subject's incapacity for knowing its own
enjoyment]{.underline}. Conscious knowledge is not simply unable to
arrive at the knowledge of enjoyment and its traumatic origin; it
actively functions as a barrier to this knowledge. [Conscious knowledge
thwarts access to the unconscious, and, as a result, the conscious
effort to know **continually defeats itself**.]{.underline}

Psychoanalysis attempts to fill this fundamental lacuna in the project
of knowledge by demanding that the subject abandon the project in its
traditional manifestation. It constructs a space that brackets conscious
knowledge in order that the subject might discover the unconscious. The
fundamental rule of psychoanalysis --- one must reveal not what one
knows but the words that come to mind --- aims at bringing to light what
the subject doesn't want to know. A gap exists between what the subject
knows and what it says. [In the **act of speaking**, the subject says
more than it consciously knows, and this excess is the unconscious --- a
knowledge that the subject has without knowing it. The paradox of this
knowledge is that one can access it only when not seeking it and that
once one has it, one has lost it.]{.underline}

Adherence to the fundamental rule of psychoanalysis insofar as it is
possible allows subjects to recognize what they don't know when it
surprises them. But it doesn't thereby permit subjects to make progress
through the acquisition of knowledge. The recognitions that one makes in
psychoanalysis do not have the status of knowledge in the traditional
sense of the term; instead, they mark an irreducible gap in the field of
knowledge. One recognizes oneself in an unconscious desire that remains
foreign, and one takes responsibility for it despite its foreignness. By
doing so, [one does not change or progress as a subject but becomes what
one already was. One sees the death drive as the **truth of one's
subjectivity** rather than as an obstacle that one might try to progress
beyond in order to reach the good.]{.underline}

### L -- Mimesis

#### Their anti-oedipal politics are nothing more than a modality of mimesis -- the aggressive distaste for the uncastrated subject in opposition to the self.

**Weatherill 17** (Rob Weatherill, master's degree in psychotherapy from
St. Vincents Univesity Hospital as well as the European Certificate in
Psychotherapy, "THE ANTI-OEDIPUS COMPLEX: Lacan, Critical Theory, and
Postmodernism," pgs. 52-54)//JRD

[In the absence of landmarks -- the Law, Oedipus, the Symbolic register
and civilisation itself, there is nothing for it but to collapse
backwards into imaginary rivalry and the escalating violence of the war
machines.]{.underline}49 [It is only the Law and the thin seam or
stratum of civilisation that stands guard over and against the (violent)
jouissance of the BwO, and all the desiccated and de-structured remains
of the molecularised aborted institutions]{.underline}, [the bricks on
the ground, the bodies strewn about, the fires still
burning.]{.underline} And [for those who correctly point out that the
Law itself is founded on violence and maintained by violence, let them
compare this "violence of normality"]{.underline} with Mogadishu (1993),
Sarajevo (1992), Rwanda (1994), Phnom Penh (17 April 1975), Srebrenica
(1995), Grozny (1999--2000), Darfur (2003--), Baghdad (2003--11),
Misrata (April 2011), Homs (2012), [all in the hellish nonstriated grip
of their various war machines which show no pity and that is in just the
last quarter century.]{.underline} At this point, we will turn our
attention to a theorist of war, René Girard. From his early work on
literary theory and criticism, Girard turned his attention to
anthropology and the primitive mythological origins of violence and the
means of its cessation. In his key text, Violence and the Sacred, 50
written coincidentally in the same year as Anti-Oedipus, [Girard
underlines the ubiquity of violence in primitive societies, like our
authors' theorising of the nomadic war machines.]{.underline} Girard,
however, draws attention specifically to the mimetic character of
violence. [Envy is the response to ontological lack; jealousy and
resentment of what the other has.]{.underline} Girard is unnecessarily
critical of psychoanalysis when much of his theorising amplifies both
what Freud emphasised about the ubiquity of the death drive and Lacan's
Hegelian-Kojévian theory of desire. Girard's explication sounds
Lacanian: 'he [\[the subject\] desires being, something he himself lacks
and which some other person seems to possess. The subject thus looks to
that other person to inform him of what he should desire in order to
acquire that being]{.underline}' (155). [We desire what the other
desires because they desire it, not because we need it, but because they
have it and we want it. Very quickly, many people will desire the same
thing, because it seems desirable. Desire mimes the other's desire; we
want the same as the other. Two key points emerge: first, desire
manifests as a social phenomenon, not just biologically rooted in the
drive; and second, desire]{.underline} (as in the "mirror stage")
[quickly becomes aggressive and rivalrous, in which case it becomes a
fight for what the other possesses, with the potential for
escalation.]{.underline} Girard likens this extremism to an infection or
pollution, or the spilling of blood. [Our perceiving evil in the other
and the violent measures taken to combat it, inevitably converge sowing
chaos and destruction. So-called "mimetic violence" will only be
controlled, not by counterviolence]{.underline}, [but by]{.underline}
religion, i.e. by sacred rituals involving [the killing of a
scapegoat -- an unimportant third party who can "safely" be sacrificed
to defuse the crisis which is tearing apart the social
fabric.]{.underline} [The scapegoat must be foreign, an enemy or
"other," designated by the warring factions as sufficiently different so
that his death does not lead to more killings within the society. The
sacrifice is a sacred duty, a perfect cover for the violence of the act,
the true logic of which must never be disclosed to the participants.
**The so-called "bad" violence of the warring factions will be countered
only by the "good" violence of a sacrifice that will end the chain
reactions of violent reprisals.**]{.underline} As if taking his cue from
psychoanalyst Matte Blanco, Girard demonstrates again and again how
[violence becomes symmetrical, reciprocal, eliminating difference as the
combatants become mirror images of each other, "monstrous doubles," with
their tit-for-tat killings, spreading throughout the
community.]{.underline} For instance, Oedipus, Creon, Laius, Tiresias,
taking their cue from the oracle, each seek the other's downfall. [Each
becomes similarly and symmetrically violent. Oedipus is selected as the
sacrificial victim, because he alone is regarded as guilty of patricide
and incest. He is the monstrous exception. Oedipus becomes the
repository of all the community's ills, to be done away with in order
for peace to return.]{.underline}51 Likewise here, [the anti-Oedipals
unite in their hatred of Oedipus, who therefore must be sacrificed.
Oedipus is scapegoated because he wasn't sufficiently anti-Oedipal, thus
remaining a tragic divided figure.]{.underline} [The list of potential
sacrificial victims is varied]{.underline}: prisoners of war, slaves,
adolescents, children, the handicapped, [anyone sufficiently
different]{.underline}, sufficiently other from Pharmakós to King,
[might be selected for sacrifice.]{.underline} Twins are regarded as
impure and demonic especially if identical. Other potential victims
include a warrior steeped in blood, an incestuous couple, menstruating
women, and so on. Recalling our argument, [the erotic eliminates
difference, celebrates confusion, because it allows for the "return of
the repressed" and thus provokes counter-cathectic violence against such
"evil."]{.underline} This recalls Laplanche's "sexual death drive"
theory,52 and George Bataille's erotic.53 As Girard says, ['naked or
pure sexuality is directly connected to violence. It is the final veil
shielding violence from sight']{.underline} (122). [Violence once
started creates an orgy of destruction. Violence is con-fusion,
difference is eliminated: between god and non-god; between man and
woman; parent and child -- 'a hallucinatory state that is not a
synthesis of elements, but a formless and grotesque mixture of things
that are normally separate']{.underline} (169). [This is anti-Oedipus,
everything is reduced via mixing to the sameness of shit! Violence has
this eviscerating effect. Our authors, averse to key Oedipal
differentiations]{.underline} (mother, father. child, brother, sister,
etc.), [celebrate contagion. Differentiation, on the other hand,
establishes culture, peace with the "violence of normality," where the
scapegoated "monsters" are marginalised and some stability is assured
provided the paranoid machines continue to function in the background,
with their counter-cathexes]{.underline}. However, ambiguities should
not to be passed over too lightly. The so-called differentiations within
civilised culture, from the exorcised, excluded, violated position of
the scapegoat, are clearly stigmatised differences; differences that
threaten the civilised repressive edifice. [The apparent peace and
stability of the civilised culture depends on these
exclusions.]{.underline} In other words, the differentiating and thus
civilising process is a violent process. [Whereas the anti-Oedipal
utopian vision is inclusive: the promiscuous and multiple "becomings"
are multiply differentiated singularities, molecularities, apparently
without any exceptions, antagonisms or rejected scapegoats.]{.underline}

### L -- Personal Narratives

#### Starting dialogue from the position of a personal narrative is nothing more than a cover up for the chasm at the heart of subjectivity, a meager forwarding of narcissism and a self-absorbed empty speech act as a comedic parody of dialogue.

**Hook 18** (Derek Hook, Associate Professor in Psychology at Duquesne
University, "Six Moments in Lacan: Communication and identification in
psychology and psychoanalysis," pgs. 48-49)//JRD

[We have all had the experience of watching **two people** talking,
despite that both are effectively **really** **only** **talking** about
-- and listening to -- **themselves**. Lacan confronts]{.underline} this
problem [of substance-less speech]{.underline}, the dead-end alley of
selfproclaiming talk[, with his notion of '**empty
speech'**.]{.underline} It is not hard to guess why he would prioritize
this issue: an obvious clinical imperative lies with avoiding such a
situation, where talking too much leads us away from truth. Any number
of colloquial terms evoke the type of talk I have in mind here, the idea
for example that someone has 'verbal diarrhoea', that they are
ceaselessly blathering, 'gassing on' or that they talking at me rather
than to me. [This **ego-led type** of **interpersonal**
**communication** is]{.underline} well depicted in an episode of the US
TV show The Sopranos. The lead character, Tony, is forced to take a
hiatus from his therapy, and at first struggles to find a suitable
listener to take her place. It quickly becomes apparent that her
replacement, an old friend of Tony's, is not up to the task: although he
listens at first, he uses the pauses in Tony's speech to insert stories
and complaints of his own -- in other words, he listens and responds
with his ego. Their resulting conversation is [like a **comedic**
**parody** of a **dialogue**: their respective **narratives** **hardly**
**connect**; they speak over one another, paying little if any attention
to what the other is saying; any break in the other's speech becomes the
opportunity for their counterpart to rehearse something about
themselves.]{.underline} [We have the situation,]{.underline} in short,
[where two speakers, **seemingly involved in a dialogue**, are actually
involved in two **self-enclosed monologues**, each using the other as a
**communicative** **vehicle** for a story they are **telling themselves
about themselves**.]{.underline} In his 1961--1962 seminar on
Identification, Lacan coins a term for [this tendency to reduce
everything to the perspective of me: '**mihilism'**.]{.underline} In
such exchanges [each participant is locked into a narcissistic
closed-circuit of ego speech in which the only thing that matters is how
this **communicative content rebounds off their own imaginary sense of
self.**]{.underline} The familiar phrase, that someone is 'speaking
shit' comes to mind -- not in the sense of flagrant dishonesty, but in
the sense of speech that [one **misleads oneself** with, attempting
thereby to secure or comfort one's self**, to reduce one's anxiety, to
make one's self feel whole.**]{.underline} Import - antly, what I am
attempting to invoke is not something that can be reduced to
impoliteness or a banal form of self-centredness. As will become
apparent as we continue, [such an ego-centred or 'imaginary' dimension
of communication is not merely an anomaly, an irritating aspect of
everyday speech that **blocks true dialogue.**]{.underline} This [empty
speech]{.underline} [should be viewed rather as a **constant**
**tendency** within **communicative** **exchange** between people, an
**impasse** of **dialogue** that is **inherent to inter-subjective
dialogue itself.**]{.underline} This discussion of the problems
underlying the imaginary register of communication sounds a note of
caution regards the popularity of types of narrative analysis in
psychology, particularly when such narrative analyses are deployed to
ostensibly critical ends. Now [while]{.underline} it is true that [not
all narrative forms can be limited to the function of empty speech, it
is also the case that soliciting narratives]{.underline} from research
subjects [typically elicits the story an ego wants to tell about
itself,]{.underline} [which]{.underline}, in Lacanian terms, [is for the
most part a **defensive** and/or **idealized** **formation**, an index
of the **ego's fundamental imaginary alienation.**]{.underline} Hence
Lacan's description of empty speech as speech in which 'the subject
seems to be talking in vain about someone who, even if he were his dead
ringer, can never become one with the assumption of his desire' (2006,
p. 211). [**Personal narratives** often exemplify the **imaginary**
**functioning** of empty speech: much narrative form typically **works
to create wholeness, cohesion, to provide the continuity of a
storyline**, the closure of a narrative arc]{.underline} (the resolution
of crisis or challenge) [along with the basis of a viable imaginary
identification]{.underline} (a protagonist). Hence the priority in
Lacanian psychoanalytic treatments afforded to disrupting
ego-narratives, overturning the imaginary powers of self-narration, via
free association, the abrupt halting of sessions and so on.1 To this
discussion of empty speech we must make a vital qualification. [The
**imaginary dimension to speech** is not only a problem; it is also
absolutely **necessary** to **communication**, it is a **precondition**
**for** **dialogue** to occur at all.]{.underline} As Soler (1996)
argues, [empty speech affords a means of connecting with others, it
calls out for the **recognition** that they can provide, it contains the
prospects of a type of **imaginary** **mediation** -- that one might be
understood, loved -- **but it is, in itself, insufficient for
transformation, for symbolic forms of truth.**]{.underline}

### L---Post-Structuralism/Resignification

**Attempts to redefine what it [means]{.underline} to be black
[fail]{.underline}---the problem isn't how we [talk]{.underline} about
race, it's how we figure identity as an [object of desire]{.underline}**

American Racial Identity\", pp 13-19)//guyB

[The traumatic past of slavery has rooted African American identity in
contradiction]{.underline}. Where [this identity is tasked with
representing a people engaged in an ongoing struggle for social
equality, the concept of race itself, which grounds this identity,
**leaves open the African American subject to both the racism and the
trauma that issues from this past**]{.underline}. What I would like to
begin to articulate in this first chapter of Trauma and Race is the
argument that **[race has emerged as a precarious apparatus of being for
African Americans]{.underline}**. [The central charge]{.underline} of
race in American [culture is to mediate a relation to what we may view
as a transhistorical jouissance of the past, a traumatic excess of
pleasure and pain that emanates from slavery to organize both subjective
identity and the broader American social sphere]{.underline}. [This past
of slavery has produced both race and racism as modes of jouissance, as
methods of accessing being]{.underline}. [Jouissance]{.underline}, I
would suggest[, is embedded in the very signifiers of race themselves,
which enable remanifestation of structures of enjoyment that bind
subjects equally to concepts of race and to practices of racism. It is
therefore a focus on the function of the signifier that must
contextualize this study.]{.underline} While I most specifically address
the effects of the racial signifier upon contemporary African Americans
in chapter 2, what I would like to delineate here, through reference to
both the history of slavery and narratives by ex-slaves themselves, is
[a core relation among the signifier, jouissance, and the past of
slavery that is missed by much of the contemporary scholarship on
race]{.underline}. [**The limitation of most African American scholarly
investigations of race**,]{.underline} I argue[, **is their allegiance
to conceptions of discourse, race, and agency that are framed not by
psychoanalysis but by poststructuralist criticism**]{.underline}.
Jacques Derrida's [poststructuralist argument that "centers" of meaning
have "no natural \[or\] fixed locus" but are secured instead by
discourse provides for the scholarship on race an anxiously alluring
appeal]{.underline}.1 The anxiety associated with this theory emerges
because [poststructuralism poses a challenge to the very concept of race
itself, which for many African American scholars provides both a sense
of identity and a route toward agency]{.underline}. As early as 1987
Barbara Christian, a pioneer of African American studies, articulated
the rationale for resisting this theory, observing that
[poststructuralist critique of the center emerged "just when the
literature of peoples of color . . . began to move to 'the
center.']{.underline} "2 But, [even when not explicitly employing
poststructuralist theory, African American scholars nevertheless mirror
its signature processes of decentering and discursively resignifying
identity in their efforts to establish race as a "social
construct]{.underline}." We see this, for example, in the assertion of
leading African American scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. that "[precisely
because 'blackness' is a socially constructed category, it must be
learned through imitation," and, most important for Gates, it is
therefore also open to "repetition and revision.]{.underline}"3 [This
attempt to revise race discursively is essential to African American
theoretical conceptions of agency; but, like poststructuralist models,
it **is limited by its frequent failure to acknowledge and account for
influences upon race and the racial subject that lie outside of the
structure imposed by discourse**]{.underline}. While [this focus upon
discourse directs much of contemporary race theory toward analyses of
what we may call]{.underline} after Jacques Lacan [the social
Symbolic]{.underline}, Trauma and Race is an attempt not only to
articulate the impact of the discursive signifiers of race on the
unconscious of African Americans but also to circumscribe **[a traumatic
Real that escapes and indeed structures the agency of the signifiers of
the Symbolic]{.underline}**. Lacan speaks of [the Real as the excluded
center of the subject]{.underline}. Coining the term "extimate," [Lacan
defines the Real as that which simultaneously is most intimate, or
internal to the subject, and excluded from symbolization]{.underline}.4
This extimate Real, I suggest, is what a theoretical focus solely upon
discourse misses. My work [links this Real to slavery as an exclusion
within the social Symbolic that yet shapes the discourse of race and
indeed founds central aspects of African American and American
identity]{.underline}. However, my interest is not so much in the
history of slavery as in the ineffable experience of jouissance---or
excessive, traumatizing pain and pleasure---that issues out of this Real
past to fuel the psychic desires and fantasies of Americans. Tying this
trauma to the fundamental trauma of subject formation, the traumatic
elision of being that occurs with the onset of subjectivity, I read
[slavery as marking an upsurge of jouissance]{.underline}, such that
[slavery comes to signify a moment in time when the pleasures and pains
associated with being are open to manipulation by white Americans. What
enables such manipulation is the concept of race itself, thus
constituted by slavery as an apparatus of jouissance that African
Americans today still struggle to control and manipulate]{.underline}.
But **[this precarious source of jouissance and being remains for
African Americans an illusory object of attachment that binds them to
the unbearable past]{.underline}**. Through the function of the
signifier, I argue, [race enables a psychoanalytic process of repetition
that once again produces for African Americans the psychic trauma of the
Real]{.underline}. Maintaining, therefore, that [slavery has produced a
historical legacy that is both discursive and psychical,]{.underline} I
turn to Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic theory because his fundamental
assertion that the "[unconscious is constituted by the effects of speech
on the subject]{.underline}" offers a more expansive understanding of
the workings of the signifier than is available in other theoretical
models.5 Though indebted to Freud for his ideas on the unconscious, much
of Lacan's thinking on the signifier emerges from a rereading of the
seminal work in linguistics and semiotics produced by Ferdinand de
Saussure, a theorist whose thinking also influenced Derrida. However,
[**the divergences between Lacan's and Derrida's theories offer radical
implications both for how we understand the effects of the past upon
African Americans** and for how we conceptualize an African American
agency meant to resist this past and its continuing legacy]{.underline}.
Both Lacan and Derrida derive from Saussure the notion [that signifiers
have no inherent meaning but instead produce meaning by operating
through what Lacan calls "themes of opposition" and "functions of
contrast and similitude]{.underline}."7 Derrida advances this Saussurian
reading by reducing signification to "absolute chance" and the "genetic
indetermination" of the signifier, arguing that meaning only ever
accumulates as a "trace," as the by-product of differential relations
established between signifiers in their "movement \[along\] a chain."8
Where Lacan differs from both Saussure and Derrida is in his
[understanding of the signifier as not arbitrary or indeterminate but
contingent upon causation that is external to the Symbolic. The concept
of contingency is what brings Lacan to a notion of trauma as structural
to the functioning of the unconscious and conscious]{.underline}. Lacan
explains this contingency by [linking it to what he calls "cause," which
involves "impediment, failure, split.]{.underline}"[9 Cause is the
traumatic and eruptive core around which the signifiers of consciousness
ever assemble themselves, if only in the defensive act of establishing
for the subject a protective distance from this core]{.underline}. In
tying cause to both failure and split, Lacan points to its extimate
relation to the subject, its internal externality: [cause, as trauma,
may manifest itself in a movement outward, through the failures, slips,
and stumbles of the subject as she or he unknowingly charts a repetitive
path toward a traumatic past that remains internally salient,
simultaneously enticing and terrifying]{.underline}; but [cause
manifests, finally, as an intrusion external to the system of signifiers
that structure meaning for the subject, as an experience that splits the
subject between meaning and nonmeaning.]{.underline} Emerging as that
which traumatically defies meaning, [**cause is always "something
anti-conceptual**" and thus is inevitably bound to the Real as that
register of the psyche that is removed from
symbolization]{.underline}.10 The cause that Trauma and Race demarcates
is what I call [the jouissance of slavery, a psychic experience of
trauma that emerges from the past and repeats itself in the present
through the agency of the signifier. It is the signifier that
establishes the link through which this traumatic cause, germane to the
slave's experience and not to that of ~~his or her~~ \[their\]
descendant, intrusively establishes its place in the internal lives of
African Americans.]{.underline} [The signifier defines the category of
race, allowing for a conscious association of African Americans with a
chain of signifiers that links them to the brutal historical
past]{.underline}. This linkage confronts African Americans not only
with the terrible history itself but also with a traumatic lack that, I
will argue, was made manifest by slavery. [What **the signifiers of
race** do]{.underline}, therefore, whether emanating from the racist
other or whether willfully embraced as a source of identity[, is
**rearticulate the subject's sense of self** around an unveiled lack
once defined in the racist past]{.underline}. Thus, I [maintain, **the
discursive linking of African American identity to this past becomes the
means through which the trauma of slavery is repeated** in the
experiences of African Americans.]{.underline} The anticonceptual cause
of which I speak, this more than historical jouissance of slavery, is
precisely what is ignored by both Derridean poststructuralism and
leading African American scholars like Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Houston
Baker[. At the heart of these scholars' work is a focus on the Symbolic
that actively limits African American agency and identity to what we may
call after Judith Butler "**resignification**," the effort "to **lay
claim" to the terms that define us** "precisely because of the way these
terms, as it were, lay their claim on us prior to our full
knowledge.]{.underline}"11 Butler's Derridean approach to agency and the
challenges she recognizes in it are useful for shedding light on the
mirroring route embraced by African American scholars.
[Working]{.underline}, like Butler, [with a conceptualization of the
Symbolic as a closed system in which existent signifiers can only be
resignified and recirculated, these scholars confront a particular
problematic that can be articulated as the prospect of "forging a future
from resources inevitably impure]{.underline}."12 Without a viable
methodology by which newness can enter into the Symbolic, by which
something alien to the system can either be introduced into it or act
upon it, the challenge these scholars come to embrace is how to
rearticulate the terms of race "that \[once\] signaled degradation" so
that they can now "signify a new and affirmative set of meanings," so
that this "reversal" is not one that "retains and reiterates the
abjected history of the term."13 [It is this **focus on
resignification** that we see]{.underline}, for example, in Gates'
famous theory of "the signifying monkey," [which defines a discursive
practice of resistance that is **grounded in a "formal revision**" that
"turns on repetition of formal structures, and their
difference.]{.underline}"14 [Disregarding the psychoanalytic notion of
repetition as tied to the unconscious and Real, Gates views African
American culture as involved in continual efforts to produce a
"chiasmus," or what Gates articulates as a process of "repeating and
simultaneously revising in one deft, discursive act."]{.underline}15
Gates [relies, ultimately, on a model of agency that Derrida calls after
Levi-Strauss "bricolage]{.underline}": the process of [making use of
"the instruments \[one\] finds at \[one's\] disposition around
\[oneself\], those which are already there," in one's attempt to, by
"trial and error, adapt them" to a use for "which \[they\] had not been
especially conceived."]{.underline}16 [Though Gates seeks to imagine a
beyond of this bricolage and reach outside of the American Symbolic by
asserting that African Americans must turn to their own "black
vernacular tradition" itself in their efforts to "
'deconstruct]{.underline},' if you will, the ideas of difference
inscribed in the trope of race," [**Gates limits agency to language**,
arguing that we must "take discourse itself as our common
subject."]{.underline}17 Both [**Gates and Baker bind African American
political resistance to language and thus also to the Symbolic**, with
Baker viewing the slave narrative and historical figures like Booker T.
Washington as embracing a politics of "liberating manipulation" and
"revolutionary renaming" that employs language as a "black defense
against and revision of ancient terrors, mistaken identities, dread
losses]{.underline}."18 In the view of an African American theory of
race shaped by the work of thinkers like Gates and Baker, [this
revisionary repetition has been and continues to be a means for blacks
to alter the social structure of a racist Symbolic]{.underline}. This
effort at resignification is laudable and indeed necessary. But [the
problem with a theoretical focus on the Symbolic is that **it does not
acknowledge how what is extimate may impact upon the Symbolic** and the
**discursive activities of the subject beyond his or her conscious
volition**, and **neither does it offer a direct means to address the
scars that may be left on the subject's psyche** through the operations
of racism within this Symbolic]{.underline}. Indeed, it may be argued
that what is missed in such a focus on the Symbolic is the very
psychoanalytic subject him- or herself. As Lacan states, ["the subject
is not the one who thinks" or speaks through discourse]{.underline}.19
Lacan's work continually returns to a critique of what he calls "the
I-cracy," or "myth" of "the I that masters" discourse, the myth of the
"speaker" that "is identical to itself."20 Known for his focus on the
split subject, Lacan counters the I-cracy by asserting that "the point"
is "to know whether, when I speak of myself, I am the same as the self
of whom I speak."21 In opposition to the speaking subject of the
I-cracy, Lacan "identifies the subject with that which is originally
subverted by the system of the signifier."22 What Lacan points to is
"[the function of barring, the striking out of another thing" that his
theory establishes as inherent in the subject's relation to the Other's
signifiers]{.underline}.23 [It is this process by which something
essential to the subject is stricken from him or her that I propose
enables an understanding of the effects of slavery upon both the slave
and contemporary African Americans]{.underline}. Lacanian theory shows
that **[all subjects are constituted through the Other's
signifiers]{.underline}**. More precisely, [the subject]{.underline},
Lacan argues**[, can only emerge as a signifier]{.underline}**. Lacan
notes that [because language "exists prior to each subject's entry into
it," **the subject is "the slave of a discourse**"]{.underline} in which
"~~his~~ \[[their\] place is already inscribed at his
birth."]{.underline}24 [Gaining subjectivity and meaning through those
"themes of opposition" and "functions of contrast and similitude" that
we have already seen are **essential to the operations of the
signifier**]{.underline}, "this subject," Lacan asserts, "which, was
previously nothing if not a subject coming into being---solidifies into
a signifier."25 The function Lacan ascribes to the Symbolic and its
signifiers is that of producing the aphanisis of the subject, her or his
"fading" or "disappearance" under the signifier's agency.26
[Subjectivity not only restricts the subject to the Other's preexistent
universe of meaning]{.underline}; it also [deprives the subject of
access to those essential components of the self that cannot be
circumscribed by signification]{.underline}, the unconscious and Real as
the barred or stricken portions of the self that constitute the
fundamental lack of subjectivity. Where Lacan's work is particularly
useful is in providing a comparative framework through which we may
distinguish a heightened aphanisic effect of the signifier upon the
slave, a barring that often is again manifested for African Americans as
an internal lack when accosted by acts of racism. Lacan argues that what
each "subject has to free himself of is th\[is\] aphanisic effect of
the . . . signifier."27 This ethical stance fundamental to Lacanian
theory coincides with my own efforts in Trauma and Race to **[imagine an
agency beyond the Symbolic]{.underline}**.

### L---Racial Alliance

#### They place [racial alliance]{.underline} as the object of desire which both incentivizes incentivizes [authenticity testing]{.underline} and defines [personal being]{.underline} via the [trauma of slavery]{.underline}

**George 16** (Sheldon George, Professor of English at Simmons
University, 2016 , \"Trauma and Race: A Lacanian Study of African
American Racial Identity\", pp 48-53)//guyB

In his rhetorical construction of the self as racial, [Du Bois subjects
himself to a domination by the signifiers of race in ways that can be
understood in relation to Lacan's reading of the mechanisms of metaphor
and metonymy as central to subjective activity]{.underline}. [Lacan's
work "links metaphor to the question of being and metonymy to its
lack.]{.underline}"46 [Metonymy expresses what Lacan identifies as the
"properly signifying function" of language, the root effort of language
to compensate for lack by routing the subject's desire along a
signifying chain in which desire is "eternally extending toward the
desire for something else]{.underline}."47 This something else is the
plenitude of being that the subject seeks continually to find through
the metonymical movement of language, through both the "transfer of
signification" from one word to another within a signifying chain and
the transfer of desire from one object to another as value and meaning
are cast upon them by the signifier.48 It is this metonymical revaluing
of race so as to retain it as a means of compensating for lack that we
see in Du Bois. Born in what he defines as "the century when the walls
of race were clear and straight" and "there was no question of exact
definition and understanding of the word," [Du Bois eventually comes to
question "the concept of race" because it "has so changed and presented
so much contradiction]{.underline}."[49 Insofar as Du Bois reaches
toward race as that which promises to fill lack, he struggles with these
contradictions, shifting metonymically from the biological to the
sociohistorical and eventually coming full circle through the signifier
slavery to ground his identity in this very contradiction]{.underline}.
However, the nature of **[this contradiction]{.underline}** is such that
it **[allows Du Bois a restrictive understanding of both his historical
and his psychic self]{.underline}**. [In pinning his identity to
slavery, Du Bois moves from the operations of metonymy to a metaphorical
process whereby slavery is substituted as the dominating signifier for
his (racial) identity]{.underline}. Where [metaphor involves the
substitution of the signifier for that which it names, the function of
metaphor is to remanifest being, to give presence, through language, to
absence]{.underline}. [Most notable through the subject's
self-representation in the signifier of his or her proper name, metaphor
allows for the emergence of the lost being in the only form through
which it may manifest itself, as what Lacan refers to as "the being of
signifierness]{.underline}."50 [This lost being is thus the signified
implied in the signifier of the subject's proper name]{.underline}. But
[what we see in Du Bois is how **the signifier of slavery restructures
his subjective relation to being**]{.underline}. In Du Bois' narrative[,
slavery functions as a dominating master signifier that delineates the
meaning of Du Bois' racial identity]{.underline}. Not only does [it
substitute itself for Du Bois' proper name as the signifier that will
structure Symbolic representation of his (racial) being]{.underline},
but it also [**conflates this being with the injury, insult, and
discrimination both he and the nonwhite world suffer today** and have
suffered in the past, thus bonding them in a common identity. This
substitution of identity and conflation of feelings is explained by a
Lacanian understanding of metaphor as that which brings to a halt the
metonymical sliding of desire and meaning through manifestation of a
more lasting substitution, a "conjunction of two signifiers" for which
there is "the greatest disparity of the images
signified."]{.underline}51 [Such disparity of the signified is what we
see in Du Bois when **slavery, the new master signifier of his identity,
structures Du Bois' personal feelings and sense of** being, in what he
calls a "later reaction" to racism, around racial feelings that belong
to all nonwhites]{.underline}. [Slavery is able to produce this
disparity that organizes his sliding feelings because metaphor does not
involve juxtaposition of two equally actualized signifiers but is
instead a process in which one signifier has "replaced the other" in
"the signifying chain]{.underline}."52 In such juxtaposition, [the
substituting signifier of slavery suppresses other signifiers of
identity, so that they remain present only "by virtue of \[their\]
(metonymic) connection to the rest of the chain,]{.underline}" while [it
simultaneously delimits and occludes the signifieds that emerge as an
expression of this identity's psychic and emotional
reality]{.underline}.53 In Du  Bois' discussion of his feelings toward
Negroes and Africa, [these personal feelings are themselves the
signifieds that will express and further elide his being, articulating
this being around the substitute signifier slavery that displaces the
multiple signifiers of Du Bois' personal identity with its dominating
historical context]{.underline}. As signifieds [Du  Bois' personal
feelings begin as what Lacan calls after Saussure an "amorphous" and
"sentimental mass of the current of discourse," but **they become
increasingly structured into "racial feelings" through the agency of the
signifier slavery**]{.underline}.54 [It is this sentimental mass of the
signified that Du  Bois experiences as "contradictory forces, facts and
tendencies"]{.underline} that shuttle him through the changing currents
of the discourse on race. These currents lead Du  Bois to question
skeptically "what is Africa to me," while they simultaneously ensure his
affections for Africa, despite his rational rejection of biologically
inflected notions of Africa as the "motherland."55 [The flow of this
discourse is so determinative of Du Bois' objects of desire that, though
aware of the mixture of his own racial heritage and cultural background,
Du Bois is driven at one point by what he terms **an "ultra 'race'
loyalty"** to give "up courtship with one 'colored' girl because she
looked quite white" and because, guided by racial allegiance, **he
"resented" the potential "inference on the street that \[he\] had
married outside \[his\] race**]{.underline}."56 Du Bois' [self-admitted
subjection to surrounding discourses on race exemplifies the sentimental
mass of the signified as a "continuum," as what Lacan terms a "confused
mass" ever open, through domination by the signifier, to the
"immeasurable power of ideological warfare]{.underline}."57 Du [Bois'
subjective feelings, in their amorphous metonymic shifting from
skepticism and love to allegiance and resentment, along with his
individual identity itself, become the grounds upon which this **warfare
is waged**]{.underline}. In such warfare[, it is the dominating
substitute signifier that coheres and grants structure to the
sentimental mass of the signified]{.underline}. [Slavery as signifier
comes to **organize both desire and identity** for Du Bois because
slavery "crystallizes" his feelings and sense of self in what Lacan
calls a "dialectic that has as its centre a bad
encounter]{.underline}."58 In psychoanalysis, [the bad encounter is a
"traumatizing" confrontation in the life of the subject that assumes an
"organizing function for development" because it produces an awareness
of lack]{.underline}.59 In Du Bois' case, however, [the bad encounter of
slavery that organizes his personal biography is external to his
biographical experiences]{.underline}. [Slavery allows for the
historicizing and, thus, depersonalizing of both being and lack for Du 
Bois]{.underline}. This historicizing becomes possible because [the
racism of slavery that attempted to elide the being of slaves by pinning
subjective lack exclusively to them also produced slavery as a central
historical representative of subjective lack for later generations of
African Americans]{.underline}. [Racial identity itself, whether imposed
by racism or willfully embraced by contemporary African Americans as the
historical context for self-understanding and being, not only
crystallizes for African Americans **the indisputable link between
slavery and the racism** they continue to suffer but also may **collapse
their personal sense of being** with the historical lack emerging from
slavery. Racism is key to this conflation]{.underline}. In repeating a
process whereby the African American subject's relation to being is
again questioned, as it was in slavery, [racism grounds the African
American subject's psychic sense of lack not in the split self but in
the racial past]{.underline}. This crystallization of identity through
the bad encounter of slavery is therefore what redefines Du Bois' own
desires by obfuscating lack. Du Bois models the process by which
[slavery and racial identity may displace African Americans' relation to
both lack and being]{.underline}. Lacan [ties the subject's loss of
being to the exclusion from the Symbolic of those aspects of the subject
that defy linguistic circumscription]{.underline}, the drives and
desires of the subject that evade representation even in the very
process of the subject's articulation of his or her demands. [The root
of these core drives and desires is the libido as "an internal" tension,
a "constant force" that registers what the "sexed being loses in
sexuality" upon entrance into the Symbolic]{.underline}.60 Initially
"polymorphous, aberrant," the emerging subject is able to attain
pleasure through multiple sources, but [sexuality and the signifier both
step in to define the regions of the body and the objects of the
Symbolic through which the sexed subject may attain
pleasure]{.underline}.61 As a result, [the constant force of the libido
achieves Symbolic expression only as "**partial drives**," emerging with
only "that part of sexuality that passes into the networks of the
constitution of the subject, into the networks of the
signifier]{.underline}."62 As "the most profound lost object," [the
libido]{.underline}, manifested as an aphanisis of being, [fuels desire
and sexuality such that it is through pursuit of a mate that the subject
attempts typically **to compensate for lack**, seeking out in love the
person who possesses the illusory lost object that will fulfill
\[them\]~~him or her~~ and make \[them\]~~him or her~~, fantastically,
**whole again**]{.underline}.63 However, [African Americans like
Du Bois, who ground their identity primarily in race, relate to this
fantasy of wholeness on a grander scale]{.underline}. As we see above[,
when he reaches the point of "ultra 'race' loyalty," what compensates
for lack in Du Bois is not a connection with a mate but membership in a
larger race]{.underline}. In this moment, [desire is most directly
grounded in the substitute signifier slavery that organizes the
sentimental continuum away from personal lack and toward an external bad
encounter that presents itself as a fixing manifestation of loss for all
members of the race]{.underline}. Because slavery has so bound loss to
race, [**race itself becomes the illusory object upon "which the drive
closes**" in its pursuit of wholeness]{.underline}.64 Beyond love of a
mate, [love of the race becomes the primary means of curing whatever
ails the subject and fulfilling all of Du Bois' desires as he begins to
define all lack and all suffering as racial]{.underline}. Here we see
how the amorphous continuum of an African American's subjective feelings
and desires may be reshaped by existent discourses of race and a
privileging of one's relation to the history of slavery. Lacan explains
that [the continuum of the signified is part of the "double flow of
discourse," in which the chain of the signified can be envisioned as
positioned below the chain of the signifier so as to form "two planes"
that are each "indefinitely subdivided within
themselves.]{.underline}"65 This amorphous mass of feelings [slides
continually "under the signifier," oscillating metonymically across the
plane of the signified until through metaphor a "quilting point" is
achieved, a knitting together of the tangential planes such that the
signifier, in purporting to embody the signified, "stops the otherwise
indefinite sliding of signification.]{.underline}"66 For Du  Bois,
[**slavery becomes the displacing metaphorical signifier of personal
identity**, centering a reticulated network of signifiers in which what
are substitutionally displaced are those signifiers that mark the self
as nonracial, multiracial, or more than racial]{.underline}. On the
second plane of discourse, [slavery's signifieds---insult,
discrimination, disaster---grant linguistic and cognitive structure to
the amorphous feelings of desire and lack Du Bois experiences, forming
the "lines of force" that organize this plane of the signified in its
convergence with the signifier slavery]{.underline}.67 The end result is
[a knitting together of the planes so that **self-identity is pinned to
the master signifier slavery** as a linguistic quilting point that names
Du Bois' feelings as racial, defines the proper]{.underline} (i.e.,
racial) [objects of his desire, and, finally, binds his being and his
lack to the suffering of all nonwhites.]{.underline}

### L - Racial Identity 

#### link -- incivility/aggressiveness

**McGowan 4** \[Todd, Associate Professor of Film and Television Studies
at the University of Vermont, *The End of Dissatisfaction? Jacques Lacan
and the Emerging Society of Enjoyment*, SUNY Press (Albany, NY): 2004,
p. 189-90\]

Such [interpretations of contemporary aggressiveness and its attendant
violence succumb to the thinking of the perpetrators---that is, to their
belief in the transgressive nature of their activity---failing to see
that they remain wholly within the orbit of authority. **Rather than
putting the symbolic identity of the subjects at risk**---**and thus
moving beyond the confines of symbolic authority**---**these actions
reaffirm that identity**---**and thus reaffirm that authority as
well**]{.underline}.21

[Incivility and aggressiveness seem to us as if they are fundamentally
antisocial behaviors. When]{.underline} [we experience outbursts of
incivility or aggressiveness, we feel as if the social fabric is in the
process of collapsing, as if we are descending into
anarchy]{.underline}. [But the contemporary uncivil or aggressive
subject evinces, in most cases, **an allegiance to the fundamental
commandment of the society of enjoyment**---**the command to
enjoy**]{.underline}. [We must reinterpret the incivility we encounter
in light of this prevailing commandment. **Subjects have Explosions of
Incivility, Aggressiveness, and Violence**189 **become increasingly
uncivil not because they have divested themselves from authority figures
and social rules but because they have invested themselves most
enthusiastically**]{.underline}.

Whatever the underlying causes behind them, [incivility and
aggressiveness seem to have an unambiguous]{.underline}---[which is to
say, unambiguously negative---status]{.underline}.

[Of all the symptoms that characterize the society of commanded
enjoyment, incivility and]{.underline} [aggressiveness are clearly those
that receive the most universal criticism]{.underline}. It is not only
cultural critics that decry contemporary outbreaks of aggressiveness,
but almost everyone living in this society. [Whereas one might
potentially see something appealing or liberatory in the transformation
of paternal authority, the rise of the image, the shrinking of distance,
or even the retreat into privacy, the same could not be said of
incivility and aggressiveness. These symptoms seem to have no positive
valence, and we cannot easily imagine someone who might celebrate their
emergence]{.underline}.

Nonetheless, [incivility and aggressiveness do have another side to
them, a side that has remained largely unexplored]{.underline}. [These
symptoms are indicative of a subjective disposition within the society
of enjoyment willing to challenge the dictates of symbolic
authority]{.underline}. In this sense, [contemporary incivility and
aggressiveness hold out the possibility for producing radicalized
subjects, subjects unwilling to accept injustice or a lack of freedom
simply because symbolic power authorizes it]{.underline}. [This
dimension of subjectivity in the society of enjoyment manifests
itself]{.underline}, [for instance]{.underline}, in the protests that
have met the recent meetings of the World Bank. [Such protests stem from
an ability to be uncivil and a refusal to accept enforced
dissatisfaction that the turn to the society of enjoyment
informs.]{.underline} The problem is, however, that [we too often direct
our incivility]{.underline} [toward the wrong targets, not toward the
figures of symbolic authority but toward the victims of it. The
contemporary tendency toward incivility has the ability to assist us in
contesting and freeing ourselves from symbolic authority]{.underline},
[but only when we first recognize the extent of our]{.underline}
[allegiance to this authority today in the society of commanded
enjoyment.]{.underline} **[Too often incivility is nothing more than the
contemporary expression of complete docility]{.underline}**.

### L -- Recognition

#### Their politics of recognition play right into the hands of the social order -- they'll never be satisfied through their infinite struggle causing frustration, and will only be more subjected to the social authority

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 88-91, 1 July 2013, MG)

[This is the limitation of]{.underline} pseudo-Hegelian [political
projects oriented around garnering recognition. They necessarily remain
**within the confines of the order that they challenge**, and even
success will **never provide the satisfaction that the project
promises**. Full recognition would bring with it not the sense of
finally penetrating into the secret enclave of the social authority but
instead the **disappointment** of seeing that this secret does not
exist]{.underline}. The widespread acceptance of gay marriage in the
United States, for instance, would not provide a heretofore missing
satisfaction, because the social authority that would provide the
recognition is not a substantial entity fully consistent with itself.
Even though institutional authority can grant a marriage certificate to
gay couples and the majority of the population can recognize the
validity of the marriage, there is no agency that can authorize such a
marriage that is itself authorized. Social authority, in other words, is
always unauthorized or groundless, and this is the ultimate reason why
[the pursuit of recognition leads to **frustration**.]{.underline}

[Those who seek social recognition structure their lives around the
**social authority's demand**, and recognition is the reward that one
receives for doing one's social duty. For instance, in order to gain
popularity, one must adhere to the social rules that lead to popularity.
This involves wearing the proper clothes, hanging out with the right
people, playing the approved sports, and talking in the correct fashion.
Too much deviation from the standard dissolves one's popularity. Even
those who disdain popularity most often align themselves with some other
source of recognition and thereby invest themselves in another form of
it. The outsider who completely rejects the trappings of the popular
crowd but slavishly obeys the demands of fellow outsiders remains within
the orbit of social recognition]{.underline}. This devotion to social
recognition is more apparent, though not more true, among the young; the
adult universe employs strictures with a similar severity.18 Following
the path of desire --- going beyond the explicit demand of the social
authority --- has a cost in terms of social status.

[Those who restrict themselves to the authority's demand do not
necessarily evince more obedience to actual laws than others do. In
fact, the social authority's demand often conflicts with laws because it
demands love, not just obedience]{.underline}. Criminals who flaunt the
law for the sake of accumulating vast amounts of money are among those
most invested in this demand. [There is **no inherent
radicality**]{.underline} in criminal behavior, and most criminals tend
to be politically conservative.19 [The object of the demand is the
subject's complete sacrifice for the sake of the social authority, not
simply adherence to a set of laws.]{.underline}

[By imposing a demand that requires subjects to violate the law, the
authority creates a bond of guilt among those who follow this
demand]{.underline}. For instance, contemporary capitalist society
demands the unrestricted accumulation of capital, even if this requires
bypassing ethical or legal considerations at some point. [Those who
adhere to this demand to such an extent that they break the law or act
against their own conscience **find themselves all the more subjected to
the social authority** than if the demand didn't include the dimension
of transgression.]{.underline} The guilt that the demand engenders in
them seals their allegiance. This is the logic of the hazing ritual,
which always necessitates a violation of the law or common morality.
[The demand aims to redirect subjects away from their own enjoyment and
toward social productivity. This turn is unimaginable without guilt,
which is the fundamental social emotion.]{.underline}

[Subjects who sacrifice enjoyment for the sake of recognition do so with
the expectation that this sacrifice will pay offon the other side, that
the rewards of recognition will surpass the enjoyment that they have
given up]{.underline}. This wager seems to have all the empirical
evidence on its side: every day, images of the most recognized subjects
enjoying themselves bombard us. We see them driving in the nicest cars,
eating in the finest restaurants, wearing the most fashionable clothes,
and having sex with the most attractive people, among other things. On
the other side, [we rarely see the enjoyment of those who remain
indifferent to the appeal of recognition. By definition, they enjoy in
the shadows. What's more, the apparent misery of those who do not
receive recognition is readily visible among the social outcasts we
silently pass every day]{.underline}. To all appearances, the sacrifice
of enjoyment for the sake of recognition is a bargain, as long as one
ends up among the most recognized.

The problem with this judgment stems from its emphasis on visibility; it
mistakes the display of enjoyment for the real thing. Someone who was
authentically enjoying would not need to parade this enjoyment. The
authentically enjoying subject does not perform its enjoyment for the
Other but remains indifferent to the Other. As Joan Copjec notes,
"Jouissance flourishes only there where it is not validated by the
Other."20 Enjoyment consumes the subject and directs all of the
subject's attention away from the Other's judgment, which is why one
cannot perform it and why being a social outcast doesn't bother the
enjoying subject. One immerses oneself completely in enjoyment, and the
enjoyment suffices for the subject. In contrast, [recognition, though it
offers its own form of satisfaction, ultimately leaves the subject
**eager for something else.** No matter what level of recognition
subjects receive, they **always find it insufficient and seek more**.
Unlike enjoyment, recognition is an **infinite struggle**.]{.underline}

[But no one can make a direct choice of enjoyment instead of
recognition. The initial loss of enjoyment, the initial sacrifice, is
inevitable]{.underline}. As I have insisted in earlier chapters, this
enjoyment only exists insofar as it is lost: there is no way for the
subject to avoid altogether the loss of enjoyment for the sake of
recognition. But what the subject might avoid is the perpetuation of
this abandonment of enjoyment through the embrace of recognition. [One
can't initially reject recognition, but one can subsequently revisit the
original acceptance of the social demand and refuse it by becoming
indifferent to recognition's appeal.]{.underline}

[Everything in society works against this indifference. The social order
receives the energy for its functioning from the enjoyment that subjects
sacrifice for the sake of recognition. It continues to operate thanks to
a constant influx of enjoyment from those subjected to it]{.underline}.
When subjects embrace their own enjoyment rather than readily
sacrificing it, they do not contribute to the process of production or
reproduction in the social order. Enjoyment has no use value for
society, though it organizes and sustains the subject's existence. (Th e
subject who can no longer enjoy loses the will to live altogether.) [The
goal of the social order as such and the goal of capitalism in
particular is the harnessing of the uselessness of the subject's
enjoyment and rendering it useful]{.underline}. In order to tighten the
social bond and perpetuate the ruling order, [society attempts to
redirect **enjoyment into productivity**, but in order to do so, it must
convince subjects to sacrifice their enjoyment, to offer it as a tribute
for social recognition, which functions as a kind of **social
cement**.]{.underline}

#### Recognition does not create empathy, happiness, or ethical relations -- it only cements submission to authority and foregoes connections with the Other -- only we can solve

University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 99-101, 1 July 2013, MG)

[Though recognition leaves the subject dependent on social authority and
bereft of enjoyment, it nonetheless serves as the means through which
subjects **invest themselves in the social bond**. When the subject
seeks the recognition of others, this action bespeaks the rejection of
the psychotic alternative, which involves the **foreclosure of the
social bond** and the refusal of the binding restrictions that other
subjects accept]{.underline}. In this sense, we might consider
recognition a good. Perhaps the pursuit of recognition, despite its
unseemliness and despite the sacrifice it involves, has an ethical
dimension. It allows subjects to transcend merely private enjoyment and
concern themselves with the well-being of others in the society.

[Subjects seeking recognition are constantly trying to improve their
social status, but they are also trying to find ways to please
others.]{.underline} Though their motivations are not pure, they do
bring others some degree of happiness. For instance, when a student
compliments a professor on his sense of fashion, the professor knows on
some level that the student's comment has its genesis in the quest for
recognition, but it still has the ability to make the professor feel
some amount of pleasure.1 By emphasizing the cost of recognition for the
subject seeking it, psychoanalysis seems to overlook its positive
effect. [Recognition involves submission to the symbolic authority, and
this submission **forges a connection**.]{.underline}

There is a certain reading of Hegel that aligns his moral philosophy
with the celebration of recognition. In the Phenomenology of Spirit
Hegel affirms the role of the other's recognition in the emergence of
subjectivity. Without this recognition, the subject remains caught up in
an illusory sense of its own isolation and unable to find a satisfying
identity.2 This is why the struggle between the master and the slave,
where the stake is nothing but prestige (or recognition), marks a
significant advance for the subject. [In this struggle, the subject
realizes its dependence on the **other's recognition**, even though the
master and slave cannot properly recognize each other. In the later
stages of the dialectic, recognition finds a form adequate to it in the
spiritual community, and at this point, subjectivity arrives at its
ethical terminus]{.underline}.

For a liberal thinker like John Rawls, Hegel's conception of the ethical
role that the quest for recognition plays is the key to his worth as a
moral philosopher. Hegel's great contribution, his advance beyond Kant,
lies in his ability to link recognition --- that is, social conformity
--- to ethical duty. He conceives of a social rather than an
individualist ethical program. As Rawls says, "Hegel wants us to find
our moral compass in the institutions and customs of our social world
itself, as these institutions and customs have been made part of us as
we grow up into them and develop habits of thought and action
accordingly."3 By seeking recognition, Rawls contends (or believes that
Hegel contends), we initiate ourselves, perhaps even unconsciously, into
the ethical position that best corresponds to our social world. Rather
than marking an ethical nadir (our desire to give up our autonomy and
become dependent on social authority), seeking recognition forms the
basis for our ethical subjectivity.4

[The problem with this reading]{.underline} of Hegel (which is in no way
confined to Rawls and is in fact nearly the dominant reading) [stems
from its inability to come to grips with Hegel's insight into the
**ultimate failure of recognition**.5 Though the search for recognition
inaugurates subjectivity, recognition can **never apprehend the
subject** in its singularity. Recognition reduces the subject to a
**symbolic identity** --- I am recognized as a professional, as a
parent, as an American, and so on --- and thus completely misses the
subject's uniqueness, what in the subject is irreducible to determinate
symbolic coordinates, even if this uniqueness is finally nothing more
than a fantasy (or the subject's singular mode of
fantasizing).]{.underline}

[The failure operates in the other direction as well: the subject who
seeks the other's recognition **does not address itself to the real
other** but only to a symbolic entity that exists only as a construction
of the signifier. Even when we seek the recognition of an actual person,
what gives value to this recognition is its **authorization by social
authority**, which is itself wholly unauthorized. The search for
recognition cannot have any ethical status whatsoever because it
involves **submission to an entity** that exists only through the act of
submitting to it.6]{.underline}

[When the subject seeks recognition, it devotes itself to becoming
someone in the eyes of social authority, and the search for recognition
validates this authority. But at no point does the subject actually
encounter the real other, the other as such]{.underline}. Encountering
the real other, the other that several thinkers have christened the
"neighbor," requires turning away from social authority and abandoning
the project of recognition.7 At the point where the subject does not
experience social recognition, it discovers the neighbor. As Kenneth
Reinhard explains, the neighbor "materializes an uncanniness within the
social relationship, an enjoyment that resists sympathetic
identification and 'understanding.'"8 [The experience of recognition
**obscures this uncanniness** and mediates the other's enjoyment in
order to render it more palpable for the subject. But in the process,
recognition allows the subject to avoid the neighbor or the real
other.]{.underline}

[The encounter with the real other is the key to the subject's ethical
being and to the subject's enjoyment. Psychoanalysis allows us to see
the foundational link that exists between ethics and enjoyment, where
other approaches erect a clear divide between the two.]{.underline}
Ethics, for most ways of thinking, involves a sacrifice of my own
enjoyment for the sake of someone else's. Rather than lying to get ahead
at work, I tell the truth to help create a more pleasant workplace
atmosphere. Rather than devoting all my free time to watching
pornography, I spend part of it working at the food bank. For Spinoza in
his Ethics, [**I become ethical when I cease thinking from my own
private perspective** and approach an Amor intellectualis Dei, or
"intellectual love of God," in which I can think in terms of the whole
of creation rather than simply view isolated events from my limited
perspective. This movement from the private and self-interested to the
public and concerned for the whole defines almost every ethical project.
But psychoanalytic thought does not conceive of ethics in this way. It
is through **enjoyment itself**, not the sacrifice of it, that I
genuinely encounter the other. An insistence on enjoyment is at the same
time an **insistence on ethical subjectivity**.]{.underline}

### L -- Revolution -- Deleuze

#### They are narcissists.

**Weatherill 17** (Rob Weatherill, master's degree in psychotherapy from
St. Vincents Univesity Hospital as well as the European Certificate in
Psychotherapy, "THE ANTI-OEDIPUS COMPLEX: Lacan, Critical Theory, and
Postmodernism," pgs. 26-28)//JRD

With psychoanalysis now overwhelmed by therapy culture, our authors'
attack was farseeing. A lachrymose philosophy around victimhood, the
allegedly traumatic nature of ordinary life, the "fragile child," the
"loving" mother, the regressive infantilisation of language, and so on,
have become commonplace since Anti-Oedipus. However, has schizoanalysis
fostered this regression, while aggressively asserting the opposite? The
"flowers" were told that they had no power against the fascist System.
They were traumatised by excess! No wonder the mass of ordinary working
people at the time failed to understand and sympathise with their
hysterical protesting! [The paranoid logic machine deployed through
books, TV, lectures, sit- ins, workshops, etc., convinced and seduced
many into believing that the "military industrial complex of the West"
was at work everywhere; the silent masses were complicit, as fascistic
as the war-planners in Washington or Moscow]{.underline}. [They were
told and believed that they had been alienated, colonised, violated and
conditioned into fascistic "normality;" and with this ideology the
engine of narcissism and hurt was set going demanding a whole
therapeutic culture to put things right.]{.underline}21 They were tuning
in and dropping out like flies. The baby- boomers had the biggest
tantrum in history. Born into an unprecedented age of prosperity after
WW2, protected by the welfare state, educated beyond what any former
generation could ever have hoped for, pampered with consumer goods, and
they are the ones to complain! They felt guilty about war, about
violence (televised from anywhere in the world for the first time in
real- time), about wealth, about living. [They succumbed to
ressentiment, as activated anti- Oedipal force or desire is turned
around against itself, 'pushed back and repressed, incarcerated within
and finally able to discharge and vent itself only on
itself']{.underline} (Nietzsche cited: 234). Baudrillard referred to
this self-hatred or backlash as the last stage in the liberation of the
species, a paradoxical turning around against the self at the advanced
stage of rationality and civilisation. 'There is no need to posit a
death drive at work, a biological nostalgia for a state prior to
individuation and sex',22 just a reflexive mortification as we glimpse
the degree to which the soul has lost its grandeur. Two
post-psychoanalytic strands took shape during the past half century.
First, the non-erotic infantile logic based in hurt and trauma; second,
the "nonhuman erotic" spirited on by neo-Reichians and anti- Oedipeans
with their desiring machines and molecular rhizomal energies. Both
strands claim a psychoanalytic heritage; both have polemicised an aspect
of Freud to the detriment of his whole opus. And now it is probably too
late to rescue that whole thing. Sloterdijk noted that psychoanalysis
lacked thymos and thymotic potential, what he called a "bank of rage."
Instead of mobilising prideful rage, honour and ambition, we
domesticated rage, turning it into hurt, while becoming preoccupied with
sex as an end in itself. In short, we went crazy about both love and
humility, creating 'subcultures in which beautiful souls sent one
another messages of love'.23 [The interruption of pride for the sake of
a libidinal politics entirely suits contemporary capitalist consumerism,
buying off the dignity of human beings with gadgets as
concessions.]{.underline} [Pride, dignity and honour are not part of the
psychoanalytic lexicon.]{.underline} [Instead they have become
pathologised by 'the thymos-forgetting therapeutic culture
...]{.underline} in the tradition of Christian moralists'.24 [The rage
generated in the pages of Anti- Oedipus against familial domestication
in all its forms is a great burst of freedom, a mass break-out and
escape- release of great thymotic potential]{.underline}. [Why in
practice does it fall back to earth in narcissistic ruins, a failed
project easily reterritorialised by the capitalist machine?]{.underline}
In the last chapter of Rage and Time, called "The Dispersal of Rage in
the Era of the Centre," Sloterdijk points to this diffusion of desire
where '[every individual is turned into a consumption
citizen]{.underline}, who unless uplifted by family, cultural and
cooperative counter- forces, [is increasingly fixed to a poisoned
loneliness with a doomed irritation of desire']{.underline}.25 [Desire
per se, destined for total liberation by anti- Oedipeans, forever free
and untrammelled, becomes just an irritation.]{.underline} Enzenberger,
seeming to echo [Anti- Oedipus, refers to "molecular civil wars." 'The
reality is that civil war has long since moved into the
metropolis']{.underline}. As Enzensberger26 says, 'The beginning is
bloodless, the evidence circumstantial. [Molecular civil war starts
unnoticed; there is no general mobilization'. Rubbish accumulates,
syringes and broken bottles appear in the park, graffiti is daubed on
the walls. In schools and colleges, classroom furniture is
smashed.]{.underline} These are 'muted declarations of war which any
experienced city- dweller can interpret'. [Then, tyres are slashed, cars
set on fire. In one incident after another, rage is vented, hate turns
on anything that works, and forms an insoluble amalgam with self-
hate'.]{.underline} He concludes, 'its only message \[is\] one of
autism'.27 [Not dispersal of rage, but a free-floating random affair, a
lone-gunman syndrome -- molecular, atomistic, homicidal-
suicidal.]{.underline} [The desiring machines exact their revenge for
their wholesale failure to break through and break out by turning
themselves into rage machines.]{.underline} Add self- radicalisation
here as Islamism is a ready conduit for rage. [The flowers are turned
into weeds, dominated not by Oedipus and daddy, but by mommy alone, or
indeed by no one at all. Be orphan. Be nomad. Be free. Go viral: 'Make
rhizomes, not roots, never plant! Don't sow, grow offshoots! Don't be
one, be multiple, be multiplicities!']{.underline}28 [Free -- to be
bereaved, homeless, rootless, aimless "singularities" with "enjoyments,"
left absolutely alone with 'the unconscious that produces itself in a
cyclical orphan movement']{.underline} (319). [The wreck of
psychoanalysis is to be found at these two extremes: at the weedy end
with mommy, safe but fragile; or with mommy and daddy slaughtered long
ago as part of the libidinised, schizo killing machines -- 'knowing
nothing of persons ... nothing of the ego']{.underline} (392) -- [in
total indifference creating a level killing field and a race to the
bottom- anus- shit.]{.underline} [If you take schizoanalysis seriously
you seem bound to end as a speck on a pseudopodium of the
erotic]{.underline} (Foucault), [or a green- fly parasite consumer
sucking on the erotic juices of Capitalism.]{.underline} No effective
thymotic, no bank of rage, no balls, just generalised neurasthenia and
stress. [Every bridge back]{.underline} (to civilisation) [has been
burned by the scorched earth deterritorialisations of capitalism and
schizoanalysis, with no way of deciding about these mass "enjoyments,"
daring not even to venture a judgement.]{.underline} Sloterdijk shares
our disillusion with a reference to Lacan. 'In its pretension to co-form
a revolutionary subject, politicised psychoanalysis failed miserably'.
So, as a half-way house to revolution, 'the new purists \[Lacanians\]
mark themselves off from everything to do with sense-giving,
interpretation, construction, life-projects, because this would once
again put into play the need to explain people normatively, to develop
positive ideas of culture \[civilisation\], and introduce creative
processes'.29 [By retaining notions such as castration, the Law, the
Symbolic, they are still part of the kill-joy processes, while
pretending to be otherwise. As our authors say, psychoanalysis spans a
mixed semiotic. On the one hand, 'a despotic regime of significance and
interpretation', and on the other, 'an authoritarian regime of
subjectification and prophetism'. Between the fetishised authority of
the unconscious and the aura of the silent analyst: '\[T\]he worst, most
underhanded of powers are founded on it']{.underline} (138). For its
part, however, romanticised schizoanalysis has been influential. Like
Zarathustra, these romantics know incredible sufferings and sicknesses.
Fifty or more years on are they still remarkable? 'They must reinvent
each gesture. But such a man produces himself as a free man,
irresponsible, solitary and joyous, finally able to say and do something
in his own name, without asking permission; a desire lacking nothing
...' (142).

### L -- Sacrifice/Bataille

#### The desire to sacrifice is one that masks the loss underneath that is imposed onto bodies to endure -- it ends up reenacting the state

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Enjoying What We Don't Have", University of
Nebraska Press, Pages 148-150, 1 July 2013, MG)

It is this excess that motivates the philosophy of Georges Bataille,
perhaps the foremost thinker of sacrifice. Of all those who confront
this mysterious phenomenon, [Bataille is the one who does not try to
reduce sacrifice to some form of interest. Instead, he accepts sacrifice
as an act performed for its own sake. Societies sacrifice, according to
Bataille, because sacrifice is essential to their functioning and
because they enjoy it]{.underline}. He claims: "There is generally no
growth but only a luxurious squandering of energy in every form! The
history of life on earth is mainly the effect of a wild exuberance; the
dominant event is the development of luxury, the production of
increasingly burdensome forms of life."8 Divesting itself of excess is
the fundamental social operation, and this occurs most often through
sacrifice. As society advances, it becomes more luxurious, sacrificing
more and more, and this sacrifice is always its own reward, providing an
enjoyment that derives from a process of unburdening.9

[The problem with Bataille's theorization of sacrifice resides in the
**obscure ontology that informs it.** For Bataille, there is an
overabundance of energy in the world --- represented most obviously by
the sun, which is constantly burning offits excess --- and the
fundamental goal of existence is the elimination of this
excess]{.underline}. All beings engage in efforts to rid themselves of
their surplus energy, either through gift s, sacrifice, or simply
destruction. Elimination in whatever form becomes, according to this
theory, the primary fact, and accumulation occurs only in order to
engender possibilities for sacrifice and destruction. [While Bataille
correctly sees the primacy of sacrifice as a social phenomenon, he links
it to a theory of being as **intrinsically excessive** that is, at
bottom, empirical (as evidenced by his argument about the sun). Where
Bataille sees excess, one could just as easily see **balance**: a
universe in which beings take in a certain amount of energy and then
expel that same amount]{.underline}. But he sees excess in being itself
because he begins with a philosophy of excess.10

[Though psychoanalytic thought arrives at the same conclusion as
Bataille --- seeing sacrifice as a primary social fact not reducible to
selfinterest or a social good --- it takes a **different path to get
there**. It locates the impulse to sacrifice in the original loss that
constitutes the subject and that entry in the social order repeats.
Because loss creates society as such, societies tend inevitably toward
**reenacting it**, most often in the form of sacrifice]{.underline}.
Societies perform sacrificial rituals in order to allow subjects to
experience and enjoy the social bond through an encounter with the
nothing that they hold in common.

Such rituals appear explicitly in premodern societies, which
consistently make public sacrifices of animals (or people) to please
their gods. [While sacrifices have the expressed intent of gaining good
favor or warding offbad, their unconscious function consists **solely in
enacting the sacrifice itself**. Any pleasure that follows from the
sacrifice --- such as abundant rainfall that produces good crops --- is
strictly secondary to the enjoyment of the sacrifice itself. Societies
sacrifice for the sake of sacrifice, not for the end that it
produces]{.underline}. This sacrifice for the sake of sacrifice doesn't
end with the onset of modernity but instead continues primarily in a
disguised form. What defines modernity isn't so much a degree of
enlightenment and rationality as a fundamental refusal to avow the
primacy of sacrifice.

Modernity replaces a regime centered around sacrifice and squander with
one centered around utility and accumulation. Modern consciousness
directs itself toward the useful: one justifies technological advances,
medical breakthroughs, and economic progress through their utility.11
[Modern societies act with the conscious intention of making the world
run smoother and with the utmost efficiency. And yet, at the same time,
**wasteful behavior endures** --- most conspicuously in the form of
religion, which modernity's philosophy of utility has not succeeded in
extirpating]{.underline}.

Even though modern religious observations tend for the most part to
avoid animal or human sacrifices, they do nonetheless represent one of
the predominant arenas in which social sacrifice occurs. Thought of in
terms of the self-interest of participants or the larger social good,
religion constitutes a massive sacrifice of time and resources. This is
what renders it problematic for evolutionary biology. According to the
tenets of this science, natural selection tends to eliminate waste
rather than foster it.12 The wastefulness of religion, combined with its
continued wide appeal, forces evolutionary biologists to explain its
existence and persistence as the by-product of another process that has
evolutionary benefits (which is, according to most prominent
evolutionary biologists, the tendency to trust authority figures). But
what the evolutionary biologist cannot see, because this science does
not take enjoyment into account, is the appeal of the sacrifice of
resources for its own sake. [Religious rituals persist in modernity ---
even if in a completely modified form, like the worship of a sports team
--- because they provide an opportunity for the repetition of the
original shared social sacrifice.]{.underline}

[Not only do religious observations allow subjects to repeat the
original social sacrifice, but they also **mask this sacrifice as the
source of enjoyment**.]{.underline} Religions tell their adherents that
they must sacrifice freedom in their lifestyle choices, money that might
be spent for pleasure, and time otherwise left for leisure. The reward
for these sacrifices --- most typically, an eternal life of pure
enjoyment, or at least membership in a privileged community --- serves
to justify them. As a result, the sacrificing adherents of the religion
can believe that they are sacrificing for the sake of the future reward
rather than for the sake of the sacrifice itself. [When we practice
religious sacrifice, we **don't see where our true enjoyment lies** ---
we don't recognize the link between loss and enjoyment --- and this
deception is crucial for religion's attractiveness. We **cling to our
enjoyment,** but we also **cling to the illusion that it is something
that we might have rather than a loss that we must
endure**.]{.underline}

#### Bataille fell for the capitalist trap -- sacrifice is a tool out of capitalism's pocket to justify itself and forces dissatisfaction onto subjects

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 131-133, 20 September 2016,
MG)

[The problem with Bataille]{.underline}, however, [is that his theory of
sacrifice is grounded in an **ontology of excess energy**. We enjoy
sacrifice because we are burdened with too much energy: there is
enjoyment in the diminution of this burden. But Bataille never explains
how this excess arises and how we obtain it. In this way, he misses the
creative power of sacrifice, its capacity to form something out of
nothing]{.underline}. We don't begin with too much but with
undifferentiated being, and sacrifice enables us to differentiate, to
create a value where none otherwise exists. [It is the **creative power
of sacrifice** that generates its appeal.]{.underline}

[In terms of his analysis of capitalism, Bataille's emphasis on the
impoverishment of sacrifice leads him astray. He mistakes the
secularization of sacrifice for its evanescence, and this error leads
him to **underestimate capitalism's appeal**]{.underline}**.** If
sacrifice was "a need as inevitable as hunger" as he says, capitalism
could not endure while turning away from it. [The invisibility of
sacrifice is not its disuse but its multiplication]{.underline}. But
Bataille nonetheless captures the experience of the capitalist subject
reacting to the hiddenness of sacrifice in the capitalist world. His
thought functions not so much as a critical analysis of capitalist
society but as a phenomenology of capitalist life, a life that hides its
dependence on sacrifice.

[The hiddenness of sacrifice often produces **outbursts of sacrifice**
that attempt to compensate for its apparent absence. The secularization
of sacrifice creates the image of a world in which all objects are equal
and thus one in which no object has any value. Where everything has a
price, nothing is worth anything]{.underline}. Outbursts of sacrifice
occur most prominently with contemporary terrorists. The true terrorist
is the one who is not fighting for a particular ethnic or nationalist
cause but rather struggling against capitalist modernity. This figure
finds the absence of visible sacrifice in modernity suffocating. Modern
subjects appear to exist without any sacrificial demands: they can
display their bodies openly, watch obscene films, and even engage
publicly in overtly sexualized behavior. They seem to enjoy in lieu of
sacrificing, and the terrorist aims at reintroducing sacrifice into this
abyss.

The terrorist always sacrifices others and often sacrifices herself or
himself to create value in the monotony of the modern world. Though
terrorism involves destruction, it is always also creation. The
terrorist tries to gives existence a value that it seems to have lost.
But this judgment on the part of the terrorist reflects a failure to
recognize how the capitalist system actually functions.

[It is true that the tedium of capitalist existence appears valueless.
But this is just the result of the transmutation of sacrifice performed
by capitalism, not its absence. Capitalism's secularization of sacrifice
actually **multiplies its frequency** in the social order. Though no one
in capitalist society cuts out the beating heart of a sacrificial
victim, nuclear warheads, elaborate churches, and slaughterhouses
testify to the persistence of sacrifice]{.underline}. And unlike the
Aztecs and the Mayans, [modern subjects have **lost the alibi of
ignorance**,]{.underline} which makes the presence of sacrifice within
capitalism so instructive.

Because sacrifice becomes less explicit and more integrated into
everyday life under capitalism, [subjects often fail to see its presence
and seek out more direct forms of sacrifice out of a sense of
**dissatisfaction with modernity**. This is the dissatisfaction that
produces terrorist attacks, fundamentalist revivals, and bungee jumpers.
The reactionaries that take up these activities are the direct result of
capitalism's ideological commitment to utility. They sacrifice
themselves in senseless activities to proclaim their disgust with
utility and their adherence to something of value]{.underline}. But the
hatred of capitalism's universe of utility reflects a failure to
diagnose that universe and its mobilization of sacrifice.

[To hate capitalist modernity for the abandonment of sacrifice and the
desecration of value is to **accept capitalist ideology at face
value**]{.underline}. Though capitalist ideology professes that
capitalism is the most efficient economic system because it is the most
responsive to human needs and eliminates the unnecessary sacrifices of
time and energy that haunt other economic systems, [sacrifice remains
the **sine qua non** of capitalism, just as it was for earlier
economies]{.underline}. But responses like terrorism, fundamentalism,
and bungee jumping themselves play a part in furthering this ideology as
well. They work to convince us that capitalism does really eliminate
sacrifice and simply gratify needs by implicitly criticizing it for
doing so. [Their failure to see capitalist sacrifice helps to render it
more invisible]{.underline}. But the answer to these reactionary
positions should be an analysis of capitalism's structural similarity to
them.

One must only look and see in order to become aware of the ubiquity of
sacrifice in the capitalist economy. The moments of satisfaction that
capitalism offers are themselves replete with sacrifice, but the system
shields us from confronting it. [As a result, we accept the capitalist
myth that sacrifice belongs to a prior epoch, and either we accommodate
ourselves to this world or violently revolt against it. But this violent
revolt rests on a **fundamental misunderstanding of how capitalism
sustains itself**]{.underline}. One need not turn to terrorism in order
to rediscover the spirit of sacrifice. This spirit has never left.
[Every act that we perform in the capitalist system involves us in forms
of sacrifice, even if the system renders them invisible.]{.underline}
Instead of flying a plane into a building, all one need do to experience
the most violent sacrifice is to buy a new iPhone.

### L---Survival Strategies 

#### \*\*\*K of survival strategies:

#### \-\--affirming individual survival maintains the construction of a psychotic social order. Deprived of any symbolic order, the subject can only appeal to a web of contradictory gazes, producing profound mistrust of anything beyond the self. This maintains the structure of neoliberalism by letting corporations and government alike off the hook for social responsibility and making collective political change structurally impossible. 

#### \-\--despite describing themselves as socially alienated from the institutions they castigate, they still require validation from those institutions, maintaining a structure of desire that will fail to produce enjoyment without that institutional gaze \-\-- they want their survival affirmed by the crowd to validate what they've accomplished.

Silva's account of a transition to adulthood marked not by "entry into
social groups and institutions but rather the explicit rejection of
them" provides a poignant rejoinder to Sennett.19 One man tells Silva
that "the hardest part about being an adult is finding a real fucking
job."20 People aren't lacking a narrative for adulthood. [Capitalism
presents adulthood as an individual project]{.underline}. For the young
working people Silva interviewed, individualism equals dignity. [They
tell heroic tales of self-sufficiency, turning inward as they manage
feelings of betrayal, accept flexibility and flux, and buttress their
sense of being utterly alone]{.underline}. Although the dependencies of
the welfare state and corporate bureaucracy that Lasch associates with
the therapeutic sensibility have been dismantled and replaced by a
harsher, more competitive capitalism, [**therapeutic language** remains
the vocabulary through which to account for individual success and
failure]{.underline}.

Instead of the jettisoning of the past that Lasch and Sennett observe,
[Silva's subjects embrace the past as they narrate the challenges they
have had to overcome in order to realize their authentic
selves]{.underline}. Understood in terms of familial and personal
experiences, [the past provides an open field of explanations for
hardship, failure, and the diminution of what they see as success.
Unlike]{.underline} Lasch's [empty narcissists, Silva's young adults
have lives of inner purpose---surviving on their own in a context where
the odds]{.underline} [are against them]{.underline}. They struggle with
illness and battle with addiction. [They overcome dysfunctional families
and past relationships]{.underline}. **[The fight to survive is the key
feature of an identity imagined as dignified and heroic because it has
to produce itself by itself]{.underline}**.

Silva's [young adults point to an imaginary identity beyond the rugged
individualist and the narcissistic gamesman: the
**survivor**]{.underline}. [Unlike the symbolic identity of
institutions]{.underline} (the place from which one sees oneself as
acting), [imaginary identity is the image one adopts of
oneself.]{.underline} Since so many of Silva's informants feel they have
had to do it all by themselves, in contexts of poverty and diminishing
opportunity, [they take the fact of their survival as the morally
significant fact]{.underline}: [making it on one's own is what bestows
dignity.]{.underline}

Some of the white survivors Silva interviews resent "socialists" like US
President Barack Obama for trying to take away their last best thing,
the special something that is all they have left, namely, the dignity
they have because they are completely self-reliant.

**[The black survivors]{.underline}**, too, **[narrate their experiences
in individual rather than collective terms]{.underline}**.
**[They]{.underline}**, too, [**seek to hold on to the only person they
can count on---themselves**. Betrayed by schools, the labor market, and
the government, Silva's working-class informants in general feel
"completely alone, responsible for their own fates and dependent on
outside help at their peril." For them, surviving means internalizing
the painful lesson that "being an adult means trusting no one by
yourself]{.underline}."21

What Sennett lauded as a repudiation of dependence appears in Silva's
account as a deep skepticism of solidarity. [Reliance on other people
requires acknowledging one's insufficiency as an individual, one's
inability to survive alone]{.underline}. [The hostility to the needy
expressed by some of Silva informants suggests a defense against their
own need]{.underline}. **[Hostility lets them displace their need onto
others and thereby shore up a fragile and impossible
individuality]{.underline}**. Having learned that they can't rely on
anyone, these [young working-class adults try to numb their sense of
betrayal by affirming the worst cultural scripts of individualism,
personal responsibility, and self-reliance, hardening themselves to the
world around them]{.underline}. Their hostility to various forms of
government intervention, particularly affirmative action, makes them
ideal supports for neoliberal capitalism. Incidentally, [those of us who
write and circulate critical exposés]{.underline}---stories of
governmental corruption, [university failure, and corporate
malfeasance]{.underline}---[may not be helping our cause. We may be
affirming what some in the working class already know to be true: they
are being betrayed]{.underline}.

Likewise countering Sennett's happy rendering of the repudiation of
dependence, Carrie M. Lane's research on white-collar technology workers
in Dallas situates the emphasis on individual responsibility in the
context of wide-scale layoffs and unemployment.22 Insecurity is a
primary feature of the lives of these tech workers. Most alternate
through contract positions of varying duration, unemployment, and
selfemployment.23 Lane notes how the technology workers she interviewed
embrace a "career management" ideology that casts "insecurity as an
empowering alternative to dependence on a single employer."24 They
construe loyalty as a thing of the past: since everyone is a victim of
economic forces beyond their control, neither companies nor employees
owe each other anything. Owners and workers both want to make money
however they can. No one should expect a company to provide employment
security or opportunities for professional development. Such an
expectation indicates a childish attitude of dependence. According to
one executive, "To give my employees job security would be to disempower
them and relieve them of the responsibility that they need to feel for
their own success."25 Laid-off and job-seeking tech workers adopt the
corresponding individualist mindset: success comes from doing "whatever
it takes" to get by, get through, get that next job.

[The survivor is a compelling identity under conditions of extreme
competition and inequality. It validates surviving by any means
necessary. Survival is its own reward.]{.underline} Setbacks and lapses
are new challenges, ultimately greater proof of one's survival skills.
[Popular culture provides a wide array of survivors to
emulate]{.underline} (as well as examples of those who have been unable
to get themselves together): from Katniss in The Hunger Games, to the
winners of uncountable reality television competitions, to games like
Day Z and Fallout, to victims of illness or crime. **[Emotions of anger,
suspicion, and defensiveness are justified]{.underline}**---one can rely
only on oneself---**[and potentially useful as the psychic weapons that
can help maintain an impossible individuality]{.underline}**.

[**The survivor is a figure** not for a culture of narcissism but **for
a psychotic culture**]{.underline}. [If narcissistic culture is
characterized by the dislodging of symbolic authority, psychotic culture
is characterized by its foreclosure]{.underline}.26 In brief, [Lacan
defines psychosis in terms of the foreclosure of the Name-of-the-Father
or master signifier. That the master signifier is foreclosed means that
it does not stabilize meaning; the signifying chain lacks an anchor that
can hold it together. The generalized loss of symbolic power impacts the
subject such that he feels this now-missing authority to be all the
closer, more powerful, and intrusive]{.underline}. **[In a psychotic
culture]{.underline}**, then, **[mistrust is pervasive]{.underline}**,
all-consuming. **[Each confronts power directly and
alone]{.underline}**.

[To compensate for the missing symbolic authority, the psychotic turns
to the imaginary. He positions himself in relation to a "captivating
image," perhaps of one whom he hates, admires, or fears]{.underline}.27
[This imaginary other would then be a rival to defeat or
destroy]{.underline}. [The psychotic may try to mimic those around him,
particularly as he grapples with intense fear and aggression. And he may
also become captivated by an image of himself]{.underline}. Here [the
psychotic imagines himself not as anyone or anything in particular: I am
my]{.underline} [own worst enemy. What matters is **persistence,
survival, for its own sake**.]{.underline}

[Whether rendered as **caring for oneself** or looking out for number
one, the captivating image of the individual **enjoins its own
maintenance**]{.underline}. [For all their]{.underline} emphases on
[self-reliance]{.underline}, Silva's [interviewees]{.underline}
nonetheless **[want to be recognized]{.underline}**. **[They want
someone else to hear their stories, validate what they've accomplished.
Communicative capitalism supplies the necessary infrastructure, the
crowd of many who might view, like, or share]{.underline}**.

Lasch's diagnosis of cultural narcissism has lost its currency:
[communicative capitalist society is less narcissistic than it is
psychotic, oriented via an alliance of the imaginary and the Real in the
wake of the loss of the symbolic]{.underline}. Rather than enduring a
surfeit of expertise, [we are awash in multiple, conflicting,
irreconcilable opinions]{.underline}.

Unable ever fully to determine which is right, we have to decide for
ourselves. [Algorithms and data render social science
obsolete]{.underline}. [Power is backed by neither authority nor
knowledge, appearing and manifesting instead as violence.]{.underline}
[Therapy offers neither justice nor cure. **Militarized
policing---arrests and shootings without accountability or
cause**---takes the place of the former; a wide array of pharmaceuticals
takes the place of the latter, and when these fail there is depression,
incapacity, addiction, and suicide]{.underline}. Finally, precarity,
competition, and social networks supplant the antagonistic cooperation
Lasch associates with the internal life of the corporation.

[Aggressive impulses need not be repressed under a veneer of
cheerfulness]{.underline}. In the extreme inequality of communicative
capitalism, [multiple channels encourage their expression: hate and
outrage circulate easily in affective networks.]{.underline}28

Nevertheless, Lasch's attention to the forces that simultaneously
command and undermine individuality remains compelling for the way it
opens up the growing weight placed on the individual form. As subsequent
sociological research attests, **[the interiorization of this weight
continues to unburden corporations and the state from social
responsibilities, intensifying concentration on already stressed
individuals]{.underline}**. **[An effect has been the diminishing of
expectations such that survival itself becomes the achievement worth
celebrating]{.underline}**.

### L -- Sublimity

#### Sublimity is capitalism's pet -- their endorsement of it exposes subjectivities and desecrates them by leaving them terminally dissatisfied as well as recreating the system

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 242-244, 20 September 2016,
MG)

[Every society makes use of sublimity. The sublime serves as the engine
for **social organization** and for individual activity within that
organization. Without some indication of the sublime, a society would
become idle and cease even to reproduce]{.underline} itself. The sublime
gives the subject the capacity for enjoyment by convincing it that its
life is not simply a series of empty physical processes. [The subject's
capacity for satisfaction emerges along with the idea of the sublime and
**can't endure without this idea.** The end of the sublime would mark
the **end of subjectivity itself** in addition to the social order in
which the subject exists. As subjects of the signifier, we need a reason
to go on, and sublimity provides that reason for us.]{.underline}

[The act of sublimation occurs when the subject creates an **object that
is out of reach**, but it is precisely the status of being out of reach
that serves to animate the subject]{.underline}. If we did not have an
object that we could not obtain, we would cease to be active subjects
because we would find ourselves with no incentive to act. Everything
would be attainable, and nothing would be worth attaining. [Sublimation
provides a way for the subject to fail, and the subject satisfies itself
by repeating a necessary failure. It produces **satisfaction for the
subject, but this satisfaction is never that of obtaining the
object**.1]{.underline}

[Traditional society based on rigid social hierarchies and capitalist
society are radically distinct. But both **share the need for the
sublime**. If capitalism simply eliminated the sublimity of traditional
society, it would not be able to provide any enjoyment for its subjects,
and they would never invest themselves in its perpetuation]{.underline}.
Because there are people devoted to capitalist society, we know that it
has not eliminated sublimity altogether. And yet, the situation with
regard to the sublime is not what it once was. The site of sublimity has
undergone a transformation, and in the process, our understanding of the
sublime has shifted as well.

In traditional societies, gods, leaders, or priests bore sublimity.
People followed their commands because these commands emanated from a
site that transcended the brute material world and gave significance to
that world. Though some people continue to treat political or religious
leaders as sublime figures today, this status has for the most part been
lost in the epoch of capitalist modernity. A popular music star or
famous athlete is more likely to appear sublime than a president or a
priest, but this type of sublimity is contingent and confined to a
limited number of fans. Capitalism allows for the beheading of kings,
the mockery of presidents, the critique of popes, and the denunciation
of preachers. [All of traditional society's bastions of sublimity find
themselves **exposed to desecration under capitalism**. Capitalist
society appears to function without the necessary ingredient for social
reproduction. But sublimity doesn't disappear under capitalism, even
though it seems like it does.]{.underline}

[The transformation in the sublime that capitalism effectuates creates a
**more palatable version of sublimity for the subject**. Just as
capitalism gives us love in the less traumatic form of romance, it gives
us the sublime without the awe-inspiring and terrorizing figure that we
must obey. Capitalism **sustains sublimity**, but it subtracts the
traumatic figure in which subjects experience this sublimity.
Even]{.underline} though capitalist sublimity lacks the power to produce
the extreme versions of satisfaction produced by the traditional
sublime, it gives it to us in a more tolerable package. [This is the
bargain the capitalist subject accepts: a less terrifying sublime in
exchange for a **lessened satisfaction that derives from the
sublime**.]{.underline}

[Capitalism's transformation of the sublime is not self-evident, even
though everyone can see that we no longer live in a world of kings or
priests]{.underline}. But a seeming contradiction in Marx's thought
reveals the complex operation that capitalism performs in regard to the
sublime. [To grasp the nature of the capitalist sublime---that is, to
see why people **invest themselves** to profoundly in the self-
destructiveness of the capitalist system---one must confront this point
at which Marx speaks against himself.]{.underline} The tradition of this
type of reading of Marx begins with Louis Althusser, but we must take it
in a new direction.

### L -- Unproductivity

#### Their radical act of unproductivity gets commodified and used for new surplus value for the system -- they've provided the same potentiality to the system as Donald Trump and Bill Gates

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 190-192, 20 September 2016,
MG)

In a number of works dedicated to potentiality, Giorgio Agamben has
advocated just this type of change in perspective. He identifies
potentiality not with the capacity to realize one's desire but with the
satisfaction that comes from the failure to realize it. As he argues in
the essay "On Potentiality," "To be potential means: to be one's own
lack, to be in relation to one's own incapacity. [Beings that exist in
the mode of potentiality are capable of their own impotentiality; and
only in this way do they become potential. They can be because they are
in relation to their own non-Being."16 Potentiality implies
impotentiality and failure, an ability to identify with one's own
inability to realize a desire.]{.underline}17 Potentiality is an
immanent alternative that exists within the capitalist system. [Despite
its insistence on all potentiality realizing itself in actuality,
capitalism **relies on impotentiality** or the interruption of
productivity to create new values and to sustain the **functioning of
the system**.]{.underline}

[The insistence on impotentiality is not just a protest against
capitalism's demand for productive ends. It is also---and perhaps more
importantly---an act that contains within it the essence of capitalism's
productivity. Impotentiality's refusal blocks the process of capital's
actualization, but such refusals are the real source of
value]{.underline}. Capitalism relies on subjects of impotentiality even
when they destroy potential productivity, because [these subjects open
up **other avenues for productivity**]{.underline}. Even though
capitalism demands productivity and reduces laborers to instruments of
reproduction, it desires and in fact requires an interruption of this
pure productivity. [The special talent of capitalism lies in its
capacity for marshaling the threat of impotentiality in the service of
its regime of actuality]{.underline}. This is why the political valence
of impotentialty is never cut and dried.

[Within the capitalist mode of production, the interruption of
productivity becomes a **new way of creating surplus
value**]{.underline}. As Hannah Arendt theorizes it, capitalism---and
communism, about which she is equally critical---demands the reduction
of all potentially active subjects to laborers. Labor, which is nothing
but the reproduction of life itself, becomes the only possible mode of
relating to one's existence. Work (which is world creating) and action
(which is the realm of the political) cease to be viable concerns within
the modern capitalist universe. The dominance of labor and its pure
productivity create a world in which there is no value at all, and this
destruction of value forms the basis for Arendt's critique of capitalism
and communism.18

[But what Arendt misses is the impossibility of a system continuing to
survive just for the sake of surviving.19 Even when we claim to want
only to survive, we must find **some satisfaction in this survival** or
else we wouldn't bother with it. Pure survival simply isn't worth the
effort, either for the individual or for the socioeconomic system. Every
system needs a source of value, and in order to create it, capitalism
relies on the interruption of the pure productivity]{.underline} ---or,
to put it in Agamben's terms, the interruption of actuality---that it
explicitly demands. Pure productivity cannot create value, which is
precisely why Marx sees capitalism's production of value infinitely
shrinking. This process, for Marx, will ultimately lead to capitalism's
decay and overthrow. But [capitalism finds **new forms of value** in
those moments when productivity stops and when an interruption manifests
itself]{.underline}. This is what Marx fails to anticipate, and his
failure is due to his investment in productivity as the fundamental
value. Withdrawal from the capitalist system energizes the system by
providing it with a new potential that it must work to actualize.

We can see an exemplary case of this in any great modernist work of art.
Marcel [Duchamp's Fountain (1917) is simply a urinal torn from the
system of productivity, an interruption of that system. Though Duchamp's
work had a scandalous effect at the time of its initial appearance, its
interruption of productivity later became the site of immense
productivity]{.underline}. Many art historians consider it one of the
greatest artworks of the twentieth century, and replicas appear in
museums around the world. It now generates revenue through museum
admissions, T-shirt sales, and related ventures. [Duchamp's work marks a
genuine interruption of capitalist productivity, but that **productivity
uses such interruptions as the fuel that propel it
forward**.]{.underline}

Even though it is difficult to imagine Duchamp's Fountain bringing new
life into a decaying capitalist mode of production, this is nonetheless
what happens. Duchamp's work is not just resistance but also
interruption, and [capitalism **requires interruption in order to
survive**. Fountain and other similar works force capitalism to change
course and begin to do things differently in order to respond to the
refusal that they embody]{.underline}. Perhaps Duchamp's subtraction of
the urinal from the regime of productivity would create a change in the
construction of urinals or of museums, for instance. Perhaps this
refusal would lead to the privileging of a wholly new commodity.
[Insofar as it reduces subjects to beings of pure survival, capitalism
would destroy itself, but it can thrive insofar as it can make use of
figures such as Duchamp's urinal. What doesn't fit is just as necessary
to the **perpetuation of capitalism** as what does]{.underline}. This
applies as much to people as it does to objects.

Nowhere is this reliance on those who don't fit clearer than in the
world of fashion. New fashions derive not from insiders but from
outsiders, subjects exiled from mainstream society. To take the most
obvious example, the style of baggy pants did not emerge in the Upper
East Side of New York or from Paris but from street gangs. But it
quickly spread to clothing production and provided untold millions in
profits for manufacturers who undoubtedly scorned (and didn't socialize
with) the gang members who started the trend. [The figures that
interrupt productivity drive the productivity of the market, even though
they receive no monetary benefit for their creative act. They are the
**exiles from the capitalist system**, but they are **every bit as
integral to it as Donald Trump and Bill Gates.20**]{.underline}

#### Student movements, Vietnam, university reform, sexual liberty, civil rights, and the sexual revolution all prove that their ethic of unproductivity gets captured to fuel the regime, only the alt can solve

**McGowan 16** (Todd McGowan PhD - Professor of English at the
University of Vermont, "Capitalism and Desire: The Psychic Costs of Free
Markets", Columbia University Press, Pages 193-196, 20 September 2016,
MG)

[Capitalism's reliance on the outburst of nonproductivity that is
politically opposed to the system is manifest in the response to the
**student movement of the 1960s**]{.underline}. For many leftists, the
1960s---and especially May 1968---represent a highpoint in recent
political history. 22 In contrast with the apolitical years of the 1980s
and 1990s when university students around the world seemed more focused
on finding a place within the capitalist economy than on asserting
themselves politically, the 1960s were a time of dissatisfaction with
this economy, a time when many tried to "turn on, tune in, and drop
out."23 The [student radicals took up a position of nonproductivity and
refused to comply with capitalist society's demand that they become
productive members of this society. They were a group who preferred not
to contribute to capitalist relations of production.]{.underline}

[The nonproductivity of the student movement became **literal** in the
free speech movement at Berkeley]{.underline}. Led by Mario Savio,
Berkeley students began by protesting against, as the name of the
movement suggests, university restrictions on speech. When the police
arrived to arrest students who occupied university buildings, the
students responded in a unique way that indicated their commitment to
nonproductivity. Rather than go quietly with the police or resist
arrest---what seem to be the only two legitimate options for someone in
this situation---they let their bodies go limp so that the police had to
drag them from the buildings. [When this happens, the resistance against
capitalist society and the refusal to go along with the demands of that
society confront every viewer of the scene.]{.underline}

The development of this form of resistance represents a brilliant
strategy on the part of the free speech movement precisely because it is
not just a strategy. The form of the protest is the expression of its
content. Fighting back against the police does not simply run the risk
of escalating repressive violence. It also involves an assertion of
productivity and testifies to an inherent complicity with the capitalist
system against which one is struggling. The limp body, in contrast, does
not just negate but rather affirms nonproductivity. 24

[Though the authority figures of capitalist society responded to the
revolts with displays of force, capitalism as a system found
**revitalization in them**]{.underline}. As Luc Boltanski and Eve
Chiapello rightly note in their discussion of May 1968 in France, "[it
was by recuperating some of the oppositional themes articulated during
the May events that capitalism was to disarm critique, regain the
initiative, and discover a new dynamism."25]{.underline} This final
point is the most significant. [The assertion of nonproductivity within
capitalism's regime of productivity **fuels the regime**. Capitalism
requires the assertion of nonproductivity in order to continue to
survive, as nonproductivity renews capitalism by **providing it with a
limit that it must conquer**]{.underline}. In response to the student
revolts, it had to realign itself in accordance with the demands that
they articulated. [New products and professions followed in the wake of
these revolts.]{.underline}

[The insistence on nonproductivity in the student revolts of the 1960s
went beyond limp bodies. It manifested itself in the insistence on
**sexual liberty**, in the refusal to fight in the **Vietnam War**, in
demands for **university reform**, in advocacy for **civil rights**, and
so on. The nonproductivity of the revolts was the source of new value
for capitalist society. This is most clearly the case with the **sexual
revolution**]{.underline}. The status of sexuality after the student
revolts of the 1960s underwent a vast transformation. The idea that sex
should be restricted to married life became outmoded and restricted to a
nostalgic reaction to sexual liberation. Even if most people did not
take up the practice of free love, the relaxation of sexual mores
proliferated throughout capitalist society. Though some had the dream
that sexual liberation would topple capitalism, the effect was quite the
contrary. [The movement opened a new market and allowed capitalism to
expand into a previously unavailable domain.]{.underline}

After sexual liberation, sex became a new source of value. Businesses
began selling more sexy underwear, revealing clothes, and sex toys. The
pornography industry began in earnest in the United States in the 1970s,
and it opened up a vast field of production to meet an increasing
demand. In fact, in 1972 the porn film Behind the Green Door (Artie
Mitchell and Jim Mitchell) was the fourth highest grossing film of the
year in the United States, beating out popular mainstream films such as
Cabaret (Bob Fosse, 1972) and The Getaway (Sam Peckinpah, 1972). And in
a more indirect manner, sex became fecund territory for advertisers, as
innumerable companies began to appeal to consumers by associating their
products with sex. One can now see sexually explicit advertisements that
would have been unthinkable in the 1960s. Rather than harming
capitalism, sexual liberation helped to save it.

[But this should not imply that valuing the means and nonproductivity is
a fool's errand, that it simply **feeds the society from which it
withdraws**. The problem lies in the **approach that we take to the
means**. Capitalism requires thinking in terms of the final cause, and
prioritizing the means does not fit smoothly in this context. If we
recognize capitalism's dependence on the means and insist on the means
for its own sake, we undermine the logic that sustains capitalist
production]{.underline}. Once the priority of the means becomes
apparent, we move beyond the confines of the capitalist system.

The linchpin of a critique of capitalism---and the formation of a
workable alternative---rests on valuing the means over the end. [Rather
than acquiescing to capitalism's use of means for the end of the
production of value, rather than submitting the means to the reign of
the capitalist final cause, we can turn our attention to the **means in
itself**. Attention to the means is always the revolutionary gesture,
even when it ultimately becomes transformed into actuality.]{.underline}

### !---Trauma of Slavery

**The impact is the [trauma of slavery]{.underline}---the signifier of
race [destroys]{.underline} black subjectivity, [crushes]{.underline}
the possibility of fantasy, and renders black life
[fungible]{.underline}**

**George 16** (Sheldon George, Professor of English at Simmons
University, 2016 , \"Trauma and Race: A Lacanian Study of African
American Racial Identity\", pp 19-21)//guyB

The applicability of this notion of the barred subject to a theory of
African American identity and agency becomes clearer when read in
relation to race theorist Hortense Spillers' essay "Mama's Baby, Papa's
Maybe: An American Grammar Book." Here Spillers [describes the social
Symbolic as operating through the **signifiers of race** to restructure
the very identity of African Americans]{.underline}. For Spillers,
[African Americans are subjects "embedded in bizarre axiological
ground," **buried under the signifiers of "a dominant Symbolic
order**]{.underline}."28 [This order was created out of **a "rupture and
a radically different kind of cultural continuation**" that Spillers
identifies as slavery]{.underline}.29 Spillers [finds in slavery the
"**total objectification" of an "entire captive community**," the
"dehumanizing, ungendering, and defacing" of "subjects" who come to **be
"taken into account as quantities**]{.underline}."30 [As a result of
this process of quantifying and commodifying human beings, the slave's
identity adheres to "no symbolic integrity," and a restructured Symbolic
unfolds as "an American Grammar" grounded in the "originating metaphors
of captivity and mutilation.]{.underline}"31 Particularly useful in
Spillers' theory is its prescient observation of [slavery's ability to
**conflate identity with commodity** for the slave, its ability to
reduce the slave to the status of a signifier with monetary exchange
value.]{.underline} The narratives told by the slaves themselves support
such a reading. In the slave narrative of William Wells Brown, for
example, Brown describes as one of the most memorable incidents of his
enslavement the case of [a blind child deemed worthless by his master
and sold for "the small sum of one dollar."]{.underline}32 What the
slave narratives record is [not just the commodification of the slave
but the **appropriation and rearticulation of his or her identity by the
signifiers of the Other**]{.underline}**.** As James Olney argues, [the
repeated phrase that begins most slave narratives, "I was born," is
precisely an effort to establish the identity that is stricken out by
the slave master's rewriting of the slave's identity, a rewriting that
we see often occurs through the violent inscriptions of the master's
whip]{.underline}.33 Significantly, both Brown's narrative and that of
Frederick Douglass start by detailing the place of their birth and then
move within mere paragraphs to scenes of whippings (suffered by Brown's
mother and Douglass' aunt) as conveying through "bitter experience" what
it means to be a slave.34 The narratives identify such experiences of
devaluation as "the blood-stained gate, the entrance to the hell of
slavery, through which" these ex-slaves were "about to pass."35 When
read alongside the testimony of ex-slaves, Spillers' work allows us to
see that excessive domination by the Other's signifier is characteristic
of the slave's experience. Indeed, [Brown's relation to the transcribing
whip and the Other's signifiers is so overwhelming that even upon
gaining freedom he states, "the fact that" there was no longer anyone
"to stand over me with the blood-clotted cow-hide . . . made me feel
that I was not myself]{.underline}." [This **split relation to the
self** is what]{.underline} I suggest [slavery establishes for the
slave]{.underline}. [What is stricken from the slave here]{.underline},
and [is read as a blow to his or her sense of identity, is more
precisely the slave's fantasies of being]{.underline}.
[Being]{.underline} can be understood [as an illusory, lost state of
wholeness and "totality" that never existed for the subject but that the
subject ever pursues]{.underline}.37 [This fantasy of a lost wholeness
is necessary because the splitting of the subject by language is
inherently traumatic, constituting the Real as a psychic register of
lack founded in trauma]{.underline}. Where it is "rupture," [the
division of the psyche into the conscious and the unconscious that
simultaneously **grants subjectivity and makes lack and "absence
emerge**]{.underline}," [the subject compensates for the trauma of this
loss with the "mirage" of a "false unity," a whole being or unified self
capable of being refound because it existed "anterior" to the splitting
initiated by language]{.underline}.38 [Being]{.underline} fantastically
[emerges for the subject as **an illusory autonomy and state of
pleasure** that is displayed most visibly in the Imaginary of the mirror
stage, wherein the child conflates ~~him- or herself~~\[themselves\]
with the mother seen in the mirror]{.underline}, forming the gestalt of
a single self who is misapprehended as one "whole" being. [The search
for this lost being propels subjectivity]{.underline}, constituting
desire as that which directs the subject endlessly toward Symbolic
substitutions that promise to fill the subject's constitutive lack.
[Through such illusory notions of wholeness, the final, traumatizing
truth avoided by the desiring subject is that his or her status as a
subject demands both a perpetual condition of lack and a reduction to
the status of signifier]{.underline}. What I wish to argue is that
[slavery and racism seek to bring about precisely a traumatic
confrontation with lack and an unveiling of the subject's status as
signifier]{.underline}. I call this confrontation [**the trauma of
slavery**, an assault directed not simply at the slave ~~him- or
herself~~ \[themselves\] but, more critically, at the very fantasies
that sustain subjectivity]{.underline}. Lacan defines "[fantasy" as that
which employs language and the signifiers of the Symbolic to mask the
traumatic lack of the subject and construct the illusions of
self]{.underline}, the I-cracies, through which [the subject compensates
for a psychic sense of loss.]{.underline} What we see in the case of
Brown, however, is **[the instability of such fantasies for even the
freed slave]{.underline}**. Because [his subjective sense of self
remains scarred by the effects of the master's whip]{.underline}, Brown
[is unable fully to recognize himself in the illusions of autonomy that
freedom more readily allows]{.underline}. I suggest that [because the
slave and his African American descendants continually confront
obstacles in their efforts to manipulate the discourses that define
them, these racialized subjects often struggle more than is usual to
maintain their safe distance from the traumatic jouissance of
lack]{.underline}. My argument is that [slavery and racism become
traumatic because they **seek to inhibit the subjectifying function of
fantasy**, aiming to confront African Americans with the very lack that
is necessarily masked in the Lacanian subject]{.underline}.

### !---Phallic Whiteness

**The impact is [phallic whiteness]{.underline}, a resentful attachment
to race that necessitates antiblack violence as an iteration of [the
fantasy]{.underline} of white identity**

**George 16** (Sheldon George, Professor of English at Simmons
University, 2016 , \"Trauma and Race: A Lacanian Study of African
American Racial Identity\", pp 24-27)//guyB

Lacan calls this fantasy object the objet a, or object a, arguing that
[the fantasy "object a was the place Marx revealed, uncovered, as
surplus value]{.underline}."59 [This fantasy object, which Lacan allows
us to associate with capital, **may also be seen productively in
American society as race**]{.underline}. [Where the master signifier,
**whiteness**, and its accompanying discourses of race are **rooted in
slavery**, Lacan displays that "there is a use of the signifier that we
can define by starting out from the master's signifier's split" from
"the body lost by the slave, which becomes nothing other than a body in
which all the other signifiers are inscribed]{.underline}."60 [What was
split from the slave through the Symbolic's transcription upon his or
her body of the master's meanings and fantasies was not only the master
signifier, whiteness, but also the fantasy of being that race guaranteed
to the master]{.underline}. [The fantasy object of race established
whiteness hierarchically as the pinnacle of being by **binding the
master's being to an asserted absence of being in the
slave**]{.underline}. As Lacan shows, "[the master can only dominate
\[the slave\] through excluding" from the slave "this \[surplus\]
jouissance," **this fantasy of being**]{.underline}.61 [The master's
illusory supremacy lay in his ability to reinforce for the slave the
Symbolic's essential function of defining the subject as a signifier
while also depriving the slave of the fantasies utilized by subjects to
compensate for this traumatic subjective condition]{.underline}.
[Through discursive manipulation of the signifier whiteness, the master
attempted to reduce the slave to not just a signifier with monetary
exchange value but also a fantasy object with jouissance
value]{.underline}. Both [the abstract concept of racial whiteness and
the tangible, embodied slave himself were presented in slavery as
versions of the object a,]{.underline} emerging as the supports that
buttressed the master's fantasies of being. [By masquerading in the
master's discourse as the source of a distinctive racial identity,
whiteness adopted in slavery the object a's core function of
remanifesting being]{.underline}, emerging as a "semblance of being," or
as what I have called **[the para-being that replaces the being
irretrievably lost to the subject]{.underline}**.62. But, beyond the
masquerade[, whiteness remained only a signifier,]{.underline} the
signifier I shall describe more fully in chapter 4 [as the phallus;
where **the phallus is a fantasy object a that has achieved discursive
dominance as the representative of being**, presenting itself as the
possession that signals a completion that defies castration, all other
manifestations of the object a attain their own fantasy value by
standing as "referent" to the phallus]{.underline}, whose ascendency
they thus also support.63 [As phallus]{.underline}, I argue, [whiteness
ultimately functioned to designate an ascendant state of plenitude and
completion that was available to the master only through a fantasy
relation to the slave as object a]{.underline}. [The master's proof that
he possessed the illusory phallic object of whiteness was his
**commodified possession of the slave,** whose stricken being allowed
the slave to be presented not just as the fantasy object a but also as a
visible, tangible signifier of the master's supremacy]{.underline}. [The
process of desubjectifying the slave through his or her transformation
into a representation of the object a was pivotal to both the notion of
whiteness and the economics that supported the social structure of
antebellum America]{.underline}. [Through denying the subjective
fantasies and humanity of blacks, white slaveholding Americans not only
sought to transform the slave from subject into commodity but also
shored up **white fantasies of being**, employing slaves themselves as
signifiers of this being]{.underline}; indeed, [white Americans were
able to purchase and display their illusory being through the very
procurement of slaves]{.underline}. Slaveholding became an access route
to economical bliss and the surplus jouissance of fantasy, grounding
through the slave as possessed object the hierarchy of social status in
the South. The refined sophistication and vaunted pre-eminence that
seemed uniquely inherent to the southern leisure class was the surplus
snatched from the labor of the bought slave, whose very service to this
class pronounced its members' gentility through the distinction implied
in having a slave courteously answer one's door, pour the right wine at
the right time, or flaunt the master's wealth and family in the
slave-driven carriage that paraded them to church and on other
outings.64 [Making jouissance and being calculable, a man's slave was an
index of his superiority over both the slave and his white
compatriots]{.underline}; but [as status and surplus jouissance were
tied to slave ownership, in buying slaves an unestablished white man
could move up the social ladder, asserting not only his entitlement to
membership within the mastering race but also his status as an
individual of distinction, worthy of a position within the master class
of slaveholding aristocracy]{.underline}. As **[it made white men into
gentlemen]{.underline}**, so too did [ownership of slaves enable white
womanhood]{.underline}, [providing the means for, say, a poor white
woman tilling the fields to advance into the domestic sphere as a lady
lording over her own home.]{.underline} [The slave served as the
capital, the financial backing, that guaranteed these identities of
plenitude]{.underline}. Slavery was the foundation of an economics in
which the abstract value of both a white man's capital and his superior
being were not only signified but also reified by the subjugated body of
enslaved blacks. This effort to reify white phallic supremacy by
splitting being from the slave was so central to antebellum America and
white identity that even the third president of the United States and
author of the Declaration of Independence, [Thomas Jefferson, is
inspired to assert]{.underline} in his Notes on the State of Virginia
[his "suspicion" that blacks are "inferior to the whites in endowments
both of body and mind]{.underline}."65 [Jefferson discursively
contributes to the fantasies of race that deprive the slave of being by
pinning the "real distinctions" he finds between blacks and whites not
on the "condition]{.underline}" (or enslavement) of blacks but on
nature, [arguing that skin color is both the sign of a difference that
is "fixed in nature" and the "foundation of a greater or less share of
beauty in the two races]{.underline}."66 Through the visible difference
of skin color and through the hegemonic power of the master signifier,
whiteness, to organize difference, [Jefferson delineates, fixes, and
ranks deeper attributes of blacks and whites, **helping to solidify race
as the fantasy object** a that guarantees a differential relation to
being and secures white phallic sovereignty]{.underline}. Starting with
an aesthetical argument that merely asserts his preference for the "fine
mixtures of red and white" that are "expressions of every passion" in
white faces and his distaste for "that eternal monotony, which reigns in
the countenances" of blacks, [Jefferson **transforms aesthetics into
proof of racial inferiority**, suggesting that the "veil of black" not
only covers "all the emotions of the other race" but also indicates an
essential absence of sentiment]{.underline}.67 Through his reading of
the races[, Jefferson fortifies the notion of the insensate slave,
immune to the inherent pains and hardships of slavery, that came to
center ideological justifications for the institution]{.underline}.68
Finding in blacks a want of that "tender delicate mixture of sentiment
and sensation" evident in his own race[, Jefferson declares of blacks,
"griefs are transient," "less felt," and "sooner forgotten with
them]{.underline}."69 Especially in an antebellum culture that praises
sentimentality, emotions are proof of sentience, humanity, and
subjecthood. However, while this discursive remaking of the slave's
identity contributed to by Jefferson and others impaired the slave's
ability to compensate for lack through the surplus jouissance of
fantas[. In denying both the emotional and intellectual capabilities of
blacks, Jefferson thus questions the concept of their full humanity, the
very fantasies of self that center the I-cracy of human
subjectivity]{.underline}y, it did not guarantee an unproblematic
relation to being for white Americans. Indeed, [what especially the
slave master did as a result of this curtailing of a surplus jouissance
of fantasy was let loose **a terrifying psychic jouissance of the
Real**, one that, significantly, impacted both slave and
master]{.underline}. What occurred in [slavery's discursive splitting of
the master signifier from the black body that was established as other
to the white self was, in actuality, a process by which the psychic
distinctions between self and other became blurred by a mutual approach
to jouissance]{.underline}. Defining **[jouissance as fundamentally
"evil,"]{.underline}** Lacan not only acknowledges that [in embracing
the jouissance that emerges from the other's pain we "move toward some
cruelty," but also poses the striking question of whose cruelty is
involved here, the other's "or mine";]{.underline} Lacan answers his own
question with the assertion [that "nothing indicates they are distinct,"
arguing that such evil cruelty emerges "on condition that those limits
which oblige me to posit myself opposite the other as my fellow man are
crossed]{.underline}."70 While [slavery]{.underline} maintained racial
oppositions, it [breached the psychic boundaries of the self by founding
jouissance not just on fantasy but also on access to a Real that is
approached through transgressions against the other]{.underline}.

### 2NC/1NR---Biological Essentialism DA

**Biological Essentialism DA: The perm's insistence on race's [political

American Racial Identity\", pp 39-42)//guyB

The debate that has developed between Appiah and Outlaw over Du Bois'
relationship to race allows us some insight into how both [Du Bois and
contemporary African Americans like Outlaw seek to conserve the
jouissance of the traumatic past]{.underline}. The debate centers on
what Appiah identifies as [Du Bois' **irrational inability to give up
the socially accepted biological conception of race** in spite of
Du Bois' avowed efforts to replace it with a sociohistorical
conception]{.underline}. Outlaw responds to Appiah in defense of
Du Bois, arguing that, whereas Appiah reads Du  Bois as essentially
presenting a biological definition of race, Du Bois is more properly
read as combining both a sociohistorical and a biological conception.
[Outlaw allies Du Bois with "natural philosophers of the seventeenth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries" who define race as a "cluster
concept that draws together under a single word]{.underline}" references
to "biological, cultural and geographical factors"; the properties this
concept describes are to be taken "disjunctively," says Outlaw, so that
possession of "at least one of the properties" identifies an individual
as a member of the race.7 [Outlaw echoes Du Bois in acknowledging the
inability of race to define precisely its referent, but for Outlaw this
does not imply that "all racial classification is thereby
inappropriate.]{.underline}"8 [Where race fails to serve the purpose of
"characterizing persons into or in terms of biologically constituted
groupings," Outlaw argues, "**it might well just mean that an additional
racial or sub-racial category may be needed** for such
persons]{.underline}."9 What we find in both Du Bois and Outlaw, I
suggest, is [**an effort to conserve race beyond its referential value**
and **an attachment to race that extends beyond the logic of these
individuals' arguments**]{.underline}. [Part of the reason for this
adherence to race is a dogged belief that, despite the conceded lack of
scientific basis for race, this concept does indeed have some
perceivable referential value]{.underline}. [Du Bois himself argues that
a "scientific definition of race is impossible,"]{.underline} for
"physical characteristics are not so inherited as to make it possible to
divide the world into races."10 But [race asserts its existential
veracity through appeal to the eyes, through assertion of a natural and
visible difference, marked in skin color, that helps to seduce equally
Du Bois and Outlaw into compliance with racial thinking. It is this
seductive visibility of race, this "common sense" evidence from
"everyday life," as Outlaw puts it, that we must first come to terms
with in understanding the compelling attachment to race maintained by
African Americans like Outlaw and Du Bois]{.underline}. Though race is a
discursive construct, one that I argue is inspired by psychic urgencies,
[race remains compelling to the eyes because **racial differences emerge
from a grafting of the meanings of the Symbolic onto
biology**]{.underline}. [It is this propensity of race to conflate the
Symbolic's discourses with biology that Du Bois and Outlaw promote in
clustering race as both sociohistorical and biological]{.underline}.
Emerging from the intersection of biology and the Symbolic, [race does
not manufacture difference but instead structures a prescribed mode of
interpretation that grants forms of existent biological difference more
critical Symbolic value. The biological fact of phenotypic variations
functions in racial discourse as race's alibi, masking the inherent
arbitrariness of racial distinction by internalizing and eternalizing
difference as an embodied permanency]{.underline}. Because [phenotypic
differences in pigmentation and morphological variations in bone and
hair are often traceable through ancestral lines, these visible
differences provide an ostensive basis for a biological notion of race
as defined by inheritable characteristics]{.underline}. However, as the
history of racial passing in this country attests, [such characteristics
do not always correlate in predictable ways with racial
identity]{.underline}. Though, [by grounding itself in the biology of
phenotype, race comes to imply deeper dissimilarities in such things as
morality, intellect, degrees of licentiousness, violent proclivities,
and so on, it is the system of the Symbolic itself that grants race and
these implied dissimilarities their value]{.underline}, establishing a
differential status that has meaning only within a chain where black
adopts its Symbolic significance through its interrelation with and
distinction from white. Precisely by grafting itself onto biology,
however, [race presents itself as pre-dating the system of the
Symbolic]{.underline}, masquerading as an inherent component of nature
indicative of visible, natural variations in groups of humans. [This
ability to grant **permanency to difference through biology is both what
enables race to function as the accomplice of psychic fantasies aimed at
jouissance** and what Outlaw attempts to reinforce by defining race as a
cluster concept]{.underline}. Though [Outlaw contends that racism today
is caused by "invidious conceptualizations of raciality and
ethnicity]{.underline}" and that therefore [today "we desperately
need . . . settled and widely shared knowledge" of "empirically and
socially appropriate identification of persons and groups]{.underline},"
Outlaw [does not embrace the cluster concept for its empirical or social
appropriatenes]{.underline}s.12 [Recognizing that race's lack of
scientific grounding makes it a concept that will always be "subject to
challenge and change]{.underline}," Outlaw admittedly [embraces the
"cluster concept]{.underline}" definition of race for its fluidity and
its ability to account for "variation across time and space"; **[he
embraces this definition because it allows him to maintain race and
racial distinctions]{.underline}**.13 We note [most visibly the
contradiction in Outlaw's argument when he asserts that the "continued
**existence of discernible racial/ ethnic communities of meaning is
highly desirable**, even if, in the very next instance, racism and
invidious ethnocentrism in every form and manifestation were to
disappear forever]{.underline}."14 [If race, though failing to define
its referent, is yet needed to achieve "social peace and harmony" in the
face of invidious racism, **why this compulsion to maintain race once
racism disappears forever?**]{.underline}15 It would seem that [what
Outlaw seeks is not to establish communities of meaning but to maintain
racial communities forged by the memory of this very history of race and
racism Outlaw seeks to overcome]{.underline}. What is revealed in this
break in Outlaw's logic, I suggest, is his **[unconditional attachment
to a traumatic history]{.underline}**. Outlaw's [insistence on
conserving the concept of race is determined by his resistance to
relinquishing the traumatic past that established this
concept]{.underline}. [Because America]{.underline}, "from the onset,"
[was "structured, with the assistance of complex doctrines of white
racial supremacy]{.underline}, into a racialized, hierarchic
nation-state," [says Outlaw, reference to the racial past is always
necessary for "understanding the historical and social
being"]{.underline} that this past has created.16 But Outlaw's [emphasis
here is not on understanding the multiplicity of each subject's identity
in the present or on recognizing each subject's situatedness along
numerous points of cultural intersection; it is, instead, primarily on
an effort to perpetuate the process of racializing subjects as African
American through linking them to the past]{.underline}. There is in
Outlaw's thinking [**an imbrication of the historical past with
contemporary personal identity** such that this past becomes the
dominating core of the self. Such an imbrication]{.underline}, I
suggest, [**threatens to ground the psyche primarily in a subjective
sense of self** built on a relation to the trauma of the
past]{.underline}. This process of [collapsing one's self with the past
of slavery allows for **a bond with slavery's trauma** that must be
conceptualized in the light of]{.underline} what Lacan identifies as
[the "hauling of the subject]{.underline}, who always drags his thing
into a certain path that he cannot get out of."17 Where [for Outlaw
reference to this traumatic past remains necessary even in a
hypothetical future when this past's influence not only is nonexistent
but has disappeared]{.underline} "forever," it is clear that [moving
past racism should never entail giving up race or the memory of a racial
history that once forced certain identities upon African
Americans]{.underline}. But most significantly, [what Outlaw finally
resists giving up]{.underline}, I think, [is an attachment to what, at
"the onset," initiated America into the racial history that Outlaw will
not forget: **not just slavery but also the trauma it
produces**]{.underline}. Lacan describes [trauma as a "form" of the Real
that]{.underline}, though excluded from the Symbolic, [structures both
consciousness and Symbolic activity]{.underline}.18
[Slavery]{.underline}, I argue, [is an intrusive traumatic Real with
which African Americans like Outlaw maintain a psychological link
through adherence to the concept of race]{.underline}. Outlaw's
[insistence on race breaks free of the logic of his argument about its
political utility so as to become, I propose, an "act of homage to the
missed reality]{.underline}," a tribute to the inaccessible and
unsymbolized trauma emanating from the past of slavery.19 [Where trauma
defies Symbolic representation]{.underline}, such [**insistences on race
perform "a rite, an endless repeated act"** as a means **to
"commemorate" the "not very memorable encounter" that I call the trauma
of slavery**]{.underline}.20 The insistence [simultaneously fends
against and facilitates the repetition of this traumatic Real through
what Lacan refers to as the automaton]{.underline}, "the return, the
coming back, the insistence of the signs, by which [we see ourselves
governed by the pleasure principle" and its "function of
fantasy.]{.underline}"21 I thus point to [the "sign" of race as unifying
for African Americans a returning automaton, a "network of signifiers"
entrenched in the fantasy construction of their racial
identity]{.underline}.[22 African Americans maintain an attachment to
the fantasy of this racial identity because what lies beyond race's
return as the insistent sign, as the sign that African Americans like
Outlaw would "drag" and "haul" into the present and future]{.underline},
is [the repetition of the Real that cannot be confronted but yet must
not be forgotten]{.underline}. [The insistent automaton produces race as
what Lacan speaks of as the "obligatory card]{.underline}," the card
[dealt by the Symbolic that must be drawn by the subject, the returning
sign that the subject comes to seek after actively because its return
masks the repeated Real "beyond the automaton]{.underline}."23 [This
obligatory card, race, is drawn, dragged, hauled, and insistently
conserved by many African Americans as **a means of maintaining but not
confronting the very trauma of slavery** that conditions and accompanies
race's compulsory return.]{.underline}

[Psychoanalysis]{.underline}, [to be (in)credible must keep faith with

Insofar as therapy supports repression with its recovery programmes, our
husband will try to focus on the fact that he did arrive home too early,
or, even if he didn't, and whatever his wife was doing, he should work
on his issues -- to do with jealousy, dependency and so on. Mindfulness
would help him relax. [The whole drama of psychoanalysis struggles
against these false notions of recovery, growth and comfort which are
legion, to find instead the "basic fault,"]{.underline}63 [where the
story breaks, or the mask slips, the lip quivers and the cracks
appear.]{.underline} [The analyst struggles against all the various
"fixes" that tempt the sufferer]{.underline}, from CBT programmes to
drug therapies, [all of which]{.underline} have their uses, but [have to
do with "doing" and "utility" rather than with "being" as such; to do
with "moving on" rather than "being still," to do with continuous
re-invention and re-branding, the "new me," and so on, rather than
reflection.]{.underline} In this Heideggerian sense, therapies are
indeed 'forgetful of Being', individual being and the larger Being.

own and unable to cope herself? The child seeks a "container," his
school, or the classroom to hold him together, but he continually
destroys it as he repeats and "communicates" his psychotic distress
about his (idealised and unreachable) mother who bore him and now cannot
love him. No! He has a damaged brain, neuro-imaging shows it, and he
must take his Ritalin. Who is willing to investigate by listening to the

and her family, an unaccountable depression after her father died, which
has continued too long. Medication is indicated. She believed that out
of her four siblings she was secretly her father's favourite, enjoying
really special times with him especially when her mother got sick. In
adult life, she became his unofficial secretary and confidante and would
even accompany him to functions as his career progressed. She got
married, had children, but her imaginary father still held a special
place in her heart. When he got sick and died suddenly just a few years
back, she was distraught. But when his will was read, she was left with
practically nothing. [Who, without analytic insight and experience, can
really appreciate the intense rage and hurt at the "betrayal" by her
father and the self punishment and self-hate]{.underline} (depression)
[that ensue as she identifies with his rejection and abandonment, first
by dying and second at the level of his final desire/will? The analyst
with an Oedipal compass understands the primitive oral omnipotence
involved in anorexia, the master-slave fight to death with the
re-discovered disappointing mother, over food -- the ravaging greed
coming from the id and the cannabalistic superego that that reduces her
body to a skeleton that looks as if it might win the battle of will and
counter-will in the war for total control and total perfection of the
emaciated body.]{.underline} And the father was forced out to be a
helpless bystander. [Everyone has a story to tell, but the analyst needs
investigative powers, the skill and the desire to get beyond the story's
manifest content -- the very limited story -- to the real scandals of
Oedipal dynamics.]{.underline} Who understands and accepts as real, for
instance, the intense emotions elaborated by Melanie Klein --
matricidal, infanticidal, the insane mute limits of the human? And who
in these non-judgemental days is prepared to find hidden sadism and
masochism? Even analysts under supervision regularly miss human
deviousness, complicity, deceit, double-dealing, and so on. They refuse
in toto the real range of human dialectic, preferring instead the
sentiments around a "damaged self," or now a "damaged brain," with
minimal responsibility. We believe what people say, but must also
disbelieve, because revelation and resistance alternate. Resistance is
always present. Only the gullible will just listen and believe, but this
now passes for the highest therapeutic understanding and respect. To
disbelieve is disrespectful and insulting unless you are a negative
thinker. Winnicott spoke of the true and false self. If we give it a
Levinasian gloss, conatus essendi is the false self. The striving to
maintain being, the false self qua caretaker self, or ego, begs the
question of the status of the true self. Does it exist? Winnicott's
answer is that it "exists" to a degree in secret,64 until it finds a
facilitating environment (in life, in analysis?) in which to express its
emergent spontaneity, aliveness and real feeling, or in Lacanian terms,
until it can speak. An analyst unaware of this distinction may allow
years of analysis to continue unproductively -- 'The patient's false
self can collaborate indefinitely'.65 The existential twist creates a
necessary edge, not there with Winnicott. The delight with Winnicott was
always his sense of ease and playfulness. However, analysis is bound to
interrogate the false self, as it can become not so much a caretaker,
but a minder, at worst a paranoid mindbody guard, protecting the subject
from suffering, from the other within and without. With the loss of the
"facilitating environment" over the half-century since this paper was
written, the minder false self increasingly threatens to usurp the whole
scene, guaranteeing security at the expense of life. Disturb this minder
false self (via analysis) and he is likely to retaliate with terroristic
threats against the subject and the analyst. What happens, observes
Winnicott, is 'a need to collect impingements from external reality so
that the living-time of the individual can be filled by reaction to
these impingements'.66 Thus, an analysis risks taking on the minders but
with no certain outcome! [Rather than resolving the Oedipus complex, the
anti-Oedipal "solution" is likely to end up becoming bogged down within
it, or remaining pre-Oedipal. But who can detect this without the
Oedipus compass?]{.underline} Like the young man with no history and no
dreams, who lives from minute to minute, not thinking but reacting. His
mother calls him many times a day as she worries about him. He lets her.
She does his washing and sometimes she "feeds" him. He works a little
but spends time helping out his sisters with their children. He says,
'they are always there for him'. There is never a mention of his father.
[Who without an Oedipal orientation can identify the "plague," the story
spoken of around the forbidden/enjoyable/disappointing incestuous
bonds?]{.underline} A young woman was given medication to cope with the
ongoing stress caused by her parent's acrimonious divorce 10 years
previously. Her father left and remarried. She had no self-confidence in
spite of significant success in her career. Her therapist gave her
positive exercises to increase confidence but to no avail. Analysis
revealed her secret Oedipal wish that her fighting parents would
separate, countered by an equally strong reparative wish that they would
stay together. When they really did divorce, her guilt was intense. She
had caused it. She tried to excel at work to ward off her "badness."
When her father re-married, his "betrayal" was complete, stirring up
more jealous hatred and punitive self-condemnation. [Only by proper
analysis of Oedipal desire, confronting head-on the negative drives, is
it possible to rebuild, repair, but not recover. The subject remains
divided. People used to fear their demons, derived from negative
thinking and wishes associated with the Oedipus complex. Now, after
anti-Oedipus there is shallowness. With positive thinking, not just some
things are phoney, but everything may be phoney! Semblants everywhere
forcing their dissembling reality on you like an insomniac roar to drown
out the void.]{.underline} [The closer the void, the louder the roar,
which bespeaks the ultimate failure, the ultimate cynicism of positive
thinking. The pendulum has swung so far in this direction that all
moderation has been lost.]{.underline} Heidegger reminds us that for the
Greeks, truth is something stolen from concealment. For Heraclitus, the
prevailing of things has in itself a striving to conceal. The risk of
analysis is underlined by American satirist H. L. Mencken: 'for every
nugget of truth, some wretch lies dead on the scrapheap'. [The conceit
of positive thinking is that it can definitely improve on the prevailing
of things, whereas analysis, in creating a space for the saying of what
is concealed, risks the radical contestation of "prevailing of things."
The criticism of modern "analysis" is that it does not contest. It
listens well but does not analyse.]{.underline} [Analysis per se belongs
to a master discourse and must cease its search for truth. Listen but
don't analyse; the end of analysis.]{.underline} Freud's instruction to
the analyst was 'to put aside all his feelings, even his human sympathy,
and concentrate his mental forces on the single aim of performing the
operation \[analysis\] as skilfully as possible'. Freud concludes his
remarks by reference to the French surgeon, Ambroise Paré: 'I dressed
his wounds, God cured him'.67 At first reading, this is the best
refutation of the comforting therapeutic you could imagine -- analysis
not therapy. [This instruction should be read in conjunction with the
aforementioned assertion by Freud that 'analysis is a cure through love'
-- clearing a space free of sympathy, pity, etc., yet dressing his
wounds, and finally, the unknown -- God's cure -- through love. But who
ever thinks of God?]{.underline}

### Alt -- Clinical Disavowal

#### Our alternative is to adopt the analytic of the Lacanian subject as a means to decipher the truths of the racially hierarchized social order. We must disavow the very fantasy of race in and of itself and move towards a new kind of imaged signifier that, drained of jouissance, stands for difference as such.

**George and Hook 22** (Sheldon George, Professor and Chair of the
Department of Literature & Writing at Simmons University, Derek Hook,
Associate Professor in Psychology at Duquesne University, "Introduction:
Theorizing Race, Racism, and Racial Identification," Lacan and Race:
Racism, Identity, and Psychoanalytic Theory, pgs. 6-11)//JRD

Racial identification and the subversion of race Having foregrounded the
centrality of fantasy and enjoyment to racism, and even fantasy's
centrality in previous psychoanalytic engagement with racialized others,
[we might ask: how are we to be liberated from such fantasies of
race?]{.underline} Lacanian perspectives on race and racism would be of
limited value to us, surely, if they did not broach this difficult
question. Jennifer Friedlander's chapter, "In medium race: traversing
the fantasy of post-race discourse," provides a prospective answer to
how such a liberation might occur. Drawing on contemporary scholarship
that recognizes race as an illusion, Friedlander highlights how
[identification with the illusory object of race is tied to race's
promise to serve as a "medium" through which to decipher the truths of
the racist social reality this illusion itself helps generate.
Friedlander]{.underline} questions the knowledge we seem to arrive at
through this illusory medium. She [urges "disavowal" of race through a
Lacanian process of separation from the signifiers of race, which, she
argues, secure formidable bonds of racial identification within
post-racial discourse precisely through the fantasy of having seen past
race and its illusions.]{.underline} [The Lacanian concepts of the objet
a and the Act may, she hopes, be harnessed to disrupt the binding
structure of race, destabilizing race's grip by pressing on---and
identifying with---precisely its negativity.]{.underline} Friedlander
argues that [we should expose the incompleteness of the Symbolic
order---the signifier's inability to generate any finalized metatruth
about our racial reality---alongside its inability to ever fully ground
any subjective identity.]{.underline} To subvert such attempted
grounding of identity, however, our contributors suggest that [one must
work from a clear understanding of the mechanisms at play in racial
identification.]{.underline} This latter task is embraced most directly
by the chapters of this section. One of the most egregious historical
sites of global white supremacy was apartheid South Africa, a site of
mass identification with the myth of racial whiteness. Derek Hook's
chapter "The object of apartheid desire: A Lacanian approach to racism
and ideology" returns us to this site, drawing on the novelist J.M.
Coetzee's conceptualization of "the mind of apartheid" as a means of
foregrounding a series of paradoxes underlying the racist ideology of
this political system. [How, for example, might we separate historical
from subjective agency when accounting for the persistence of
apartheid?]{.underline} Who, moreover, might be said to be the author of
such racist ideologies when apartheid's ideologues seem themselves
subject to its parasitic spread of ideas? Taking as his starting point
Coetzee's suggestion that apartheid ideology was sustained by the
promise of various "phantasmatic rewards," Hook goes on to deploy a set
of Lacanian concepts (the desire of the Other, objet petit a, the
processes of alienation and separation) to advance a fulsome account of
racist fantasy. [Without an appreciation of racism as an ongoing
transaction between the perceived desire of the Other and the subject's
own fantasmatic response to that desire]{.underline} (in the form of
object a), says Hook, [we fail to grasp how racism is simultaneously a
subjective and a social formation; and, moreover, we fail to account for
the insistent momentum and gratifications of racism and racial
identification.]{.underline} Molly Rothenberg's chapter "Raced Group
Pathologies and Cultural Sublimation" is likewise concerned with the
pathological dimension of raced group identification. Rothenberg focuses
her analysis of identification on the production of a fantasm, that is,
the embodiment of a common attribute of identification that overwrites
the values of a given cultural egoideal and obstructs the development of
individual desires. She explores desire and racial group identification
in light of Lacanian structures of perversion and neurosis. Nella
Larsen's novel Quicksand serves as a crucial point of reference for
Rothenberg, dramatizing as it does the effects on desire of fantasmatic
raced identifications. It is in Lacan's theorization of
[Atè,]{.underline} the ultimate object of desire veiling the death
drive, that Rothenberg finds a prospective answer to what [might counter
and disrupt such pathologically perverse and neurotic raced
identifications.]{.underline} [Lacan regards Atè]{.underline} within the
context of Sophocles' Antigone, designating Antigone herself as Atè, [as
a new kind of imaged signifier]{.underline} (Un seul) [that, drained of
jouissance, stands for difference as such.]{.underline} For Rothenberg,
the cathartic effect of Sophocles' play depends on its production of
just such a new kind of signifier that offers a model of cultural
sublimation that could subvert pathological raced identifications. Race
and the clinic [A crucial factor enabling us to move beyond the
parameters of much contemporary theorizing about race and racism
concerns the clinic]{.underline}, and, more directly, the vocabulary
that emerges from the realm of Lacanian clinical practice. One of
Lacan's most important contributions in this respect takes the form of
his structural categories of diagnosis, namely, neurosis, psychosis, and
perversion. Sheila Cavanagh makes figurative reference to the last of
these in her chapter, "Race, perversion and jouissance in Portrait of
Jason." She explores Shirley Clarke's (1967) documentary film on Jason
Holliday---the first gay African American man to appear solo on
screen---in which Holliday presents himself as a provocative and
loquacious hustler. The film, for Cavanagh, resembles an unorthodox
psychoanalytic scene where the intention is not to cure, but rather to
expose a perverse truth about Holliday. His stories of anti-black racism
are, she says, as erotic and titillating as they are harrowing and
unbelievable, inviting uncertainty with respect to the difference
between fact and fiction, reality and the Real. [Holliday becomes the
object cause of the Other's]{.underline} (Clarke's)
[jouissance]{.underline} in the tradition of the Lacanian pervert, [his
perverse performative discourse foregrounding the psychic traumatism of
racism in an utterly distinct way.]{.underline} At the heart of clinical
vocabulary is, of course, the term psychoanalysis itself. Patricia
Gherovici's contribution, "The lost souls of the barrio: Lacanian
psychoanalysis in the Ghetto," reminds us that in promoting this term,
psychoanalysis, Freud put the accent on the first of its two conjoined
parts, with "psyche" being the Greek word for soul. This is important,
says Gherovici, inasmuch as nearly all of Freud's references to the soul
(die Seele) have been removed from English translations and replaced
with "mind." Gherovici links Freud's emphasis on the soul to the legacy
of Bartolomé de las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish historian, social
reformer and theologian who denounced the atrocities committed against
Indigenous Peoples considered to be soulless animals. For de las Casas,
to emphasize that Indigenous Peoples had souls was a way of advocating
for a more humane policy of colonization. This historical juxtaposition
frames Gherovici's meditation on contemporary forms of racism, which she
bases on her ongoing clinical work with inner-city Latinx analysands
living in Philadelphia's barrios. [Gherovici's Lacanian psychoanalytic
perspective aims at establishing the right of barrio patients to own
their "souls."]{.underline} [This means]{.underline}, she says, [that
they have the right to be considered as appropriate candidates for a
psychoanalytic treatment, and to avail themselves of the emancipatory
potential of the unconscious.]{.underline} Gherovici's chapter stresses
a need for both redefinitions of psychoanalysis and reconceptualization
of its curative impact upon subjects of race. As Kareen Malone and Tiara
Jackson similarly assert in their chapter, "Dereliction: Afropessimism,
anti-Blackness and Lacanian psychoanalysis," the work of the clinic
itself must be reenvisioned to account for race. For such accounting, in
the clinic and beyond, Malone and Jackson turn to Afropessimism, one of
the most formidable and challenging critical perspectives on white
supremacy and global racism to have emerged in recent years. [They stage
a conversation between Lacanian psychoanalysis and Afropessimism to
think through anti-blackness and its relationship to the Lacanian
registers of the Symbolic, the Real and the Imaginary.]{.underline}
[Moving between the fields of psychoanalysis and
Afropessimism]{.underline}---both of which, significantly, are invested
in questions of subjective formation or the lack thereof---[Malone and
Jackson invite us to consider the liminal space between being and
nonbeing as a paradigm for thinking antiblack racism and
violence.]{.underline} [Taking up the effects of the history of
enslavement and blackness as a category of nonbeing, they examine Black
being/nonbeing in the "afterlives" of this history so as to situate
black subjects in the context of both Lacan's clinical frame and that of
black social life.]{.underline} Their chapter closes with an examination
of Christina Sharpe's "wake work" as a modality of sublimation for
blacks living within the perils of anti-blackness. While Malone and
Jackson reconsider the relation of Lacanian theory specifically to
anti-blackness, [it remains important to explore, especially from a
clinical perspective, how Lacanian theory might illuminate issues of
cultural and racial identification that exist beyond blackness as a,
perhaps, dominant frame of reference]{.underline}. Kazushige Shingu's
chapter, "Japanese intersignifier subjects: jouissance in the locus of
the character," expands this frame by engaging head-on Lacan's
scandalous suggestion in the preface to the Japanese translation of his
Écrits that psychoanalysis is neither necessary nor possible for
Japanese subjects. Shingu notes how the Japanese writing system allows
most characters (kanji) to be read in two ways, a fact which, for Lacan,
grants the Japanese subject a fundamentally different relation to the
signifier. Although this subject---like any other--- remains divided by
the signifier, Lacan suggests that there is no masking the repressed for
the Japanese subject because the repressed can find expression in the
shifting significations of the letter in kanji. But kanji, for Shingu,
more properly expresses a Lacanian notion of the littoral, or the
boundary space that positions the Japanese subject between on-yomi and
kun-yomi, that is, between China and Japan, the two cultural sources
that coalesce in Japanese writing as kanji. This littoral is expressed
in Japanese culture through folktales, origin myths, and stories that
emphasize oppositions--- including the opposition of life and
death---and that situate the unconscious of the Japanese subject at the
littoral between such extremes. Through case studies from his own
practice, Shingu demonstrates that [this unconscious mediates the
cultural and personal fantasies that establish a patient's relation to
life and death.]{.underline} Residing in the littoral between polysemic
meanings, it does not reveal but mask itself in the signifiers of kanji.
Theorizing the racialized Lacanian subject While many of Lacan's early
contributions to psychoanalysis have by now become standard reference
points in critical and cultural theory---such as the Imaginary, the
mirror-stage, the role of the signifier in unconscious life, the
Symbolic Order, the big Other, and even, increasingly, ideas pertaining
to jouissance---Lacanian scholars in this collection are exploring
facets of Lacan's work that have hitherto been only inadequately
utilized in reference to race and racism. [This new theorizing insists
upon recontextualizing Lacanian concepts in ways that allow for new
readings of the Lacanian subject as a racialized subject.]{.underline}
Sheldon George's contribution, for example, "The Lacanian subject of
race: sexuation, the drive and racial subjectivity," presents Lacanian
theory as an exploration of human subjectivity that is left incomplete
by its inability to account for race. Where this theory highlights the
agency of the Symbolic in providing answers to the subject's existential
questions about sex and being, [George argues that race too, surely,
lies at the core of such queries.]{.underline} George's chapter takes up
the concepts of drive and sexuation that have proved foundational to
psychoanalysis, but he rethinks them for their relation to contemporary
formations of race. [Given subjectivity's constitution through
lack---wherein both the signifier and physical embodiment strike being
and sexual libido from the subject---race emerges]{.underline}, says
George, [precisely as a promised recuperation of loss.]{.underline}
[Through analyses of the lasting legacy of slavery and Jim Crow era
racism, George]{.underline}'s chapter [presents race as a fantasy object
a]{.underline}, [an illusory object that fuels racial desire while also
agitating the drive in its pursuit of jouissance. Through a reading of
Lacan's graph of sexuation, the chapter presents race as a signifier
that aids in the process of structuring the unconscious around
jouissance. Race]{.underline}, George argues[, is an object of the drive
that helps sexuate and racialize the body around gapped zones of
enjoyment, tying enjoyment by the body and the psyche to histories of
racism.]{.underline} It is not only core Lacanian concepts like
sexuation that may allow redefinition of the Lacanian subject. In the
decades-long process of refining his theories of the subject, Lacan
introduced and abandoned multiple concepts that the authors of this
section suggest are useful to the theorizing of race that Lacan himself
did not conduct. Consider Lacan's puzzling notion of the lamella,
presented in The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis as a
mythical organ of the body, one that gives substance to Freud's concept
of libido and provides a means of thinking the operations of the libido
in the subject's formation. In her chapter, "Skin-things, fleshy matters
and phantasies of race: Lacan's myth of the lamella," Michelle Stephens
takes up this intriguing mythical notion to suggest that the drive, and
the lamella specifically, become sites for the appearance of
corporeality as psychic phenomenon in Lacan's work. For Stephens,
[Lacan's myth of the lamella is the catalyst for imagining---alongside
our common tropes of skin as signifier---an alternative gesture to a
fleshy libido-body that exceeds the remit of language and social
construction. Highlighting]{.underline} [how racialized skin might
itself operate as lamella, Stephens shows that fantasies of race cannot
be reduced to the idea of skin as the desired object of
difference.]{.underline} [It is instead the case that fantasies of the
flesh of the racialized body point to disavowed aspects of corporeality
that exceed current discursive constructions and social meanings of
blackness.]{.underline} One of the most challenging and yet also most
analytically promising concepts in Lacanian psychoanalysis is the notion
of [the Real]{.underline}. This domain, [which exceeds containment by
both the Symbolic order]{.underline} (of language and law) [and the
Imaginary order]{.underline} (of imaged representation), [provides a
crucial means of understanding racism's effective "de-ontologization" of
racialized subjects.]{.underline} Gautum Basu Thakur's "Fanon's 'zone of
nonbeing': Blackness and thepolitics of the Real" develops this idea.
[By embracing a postcolonial strategy of rereading texts for their
foreclosed signifiers and disavowed meanings]{.underline}, Basu [Thakur
reconvenes a dialogue between Fanon and Lacan]{.underline}ian theory,
reading Fanon's Black Skin, White Masks against the grain to
theoretically explicate Fanon's concepts of "zone of nonbeing" and
"Blackness" precisely in relation to Lacan's theory of the Real. For
Basu Thakur, a focused examination of Black Skin, White Masks unravels
Fanon's most important contribution to the study of colonialism, namely
that colonialism may be conceived less in terms of social justice---as a
question of economic and/or political inequality---and more in relation
to ontology. Properly revived[, the idea of the zone of nonbeing posits
blackness as negativity, highlighting the need for a shift in focus from
conceiving colonialism in terms of Symbolic politics]{.underline} (the
rehabilitation of stifled voices and identities) [to an understanding of
colonialism in terms of ontological absence and the Real.]{.underline}
But [it is precisely through its negativity that Basu Thakur imagines a
new possible agency for the colonial subject.]{.underline} What Basu
[Thakur finds in Fanon]{.underline} is, ultimately, the theory of a new
subject. Fanon imagines, says Basu Thakur, [a "New Man" able to achieve
his own disalienation from the identities generated by racism in the
colonial Symbolic, paradoxically, through dwelling within the negativity
of his own lack: this new subject, most radically, abandons identity for
lack.]{.underline}

### Alt -- Drive

#### We must forefront the analytic of the drive. Only analysis which begins from the question of enjoyment and the abandonment of the good as a model of desire can ever hope to transform political terrains.

**McGowan 13** (Todd McGowan, Professor of English at the University of
Vermont, USA, "Enjoying What We Don't Have: The Political Project of
Psychoanalysis," pgs. 283-286)//JRD

[There is no path leading from the death drive to utopia. the death
drive undermines every attempt to construct a utopia; it is the enemy of
the good society.]{.underline} It is thus not surprising that political
thought from Plato onward has largely ignored this psychic force of
repetition and negation. [But this does not mean that psychoanalytic
thought concerning the death drive has only a negative value for
political theorizing.]{.underline} [It is possible to conceive of a
positive politics of the death drive.]{.underline} [The previous
chapters have attempted to lay out the political implications of the
death drive, and, on this basis, we can sketch what a society founded on
a recognition of the death drive might look like.]{.underline} [Such a
recognition would not involve a radical transformation of society: in
one sense, it would leave everything as it is. In contemporary social
arrangements, the death drive subverts progress with repetition and
leads to the widespread sacrifice of self-interest for the enjoyment of
the sacrifice itself.]{.underline} [This structure is impervious to
change and to all attempts at amelioration. But in another sense, the
recognition of the death drive would change everything. Recognizing the
centrality of the death drive would not eliminate the proclivity to
sacrifice for the sake of enjoyment, but it would change our
relationship to this sacrifice.]{.underline} [Rather than being done for
the sake of an ultimate enjoyment to be achieved in the future, it would
be done for its own sake.]{.underline} The fundamental problem with the
effort to escape the death drive and pursue the good is that it leaves
us unable to locate where our enjoyment lies. [By positing a future
where we will attain the ultimate enjoyment]{.underline} (either through
the purchase of the perfect commodity or through a transcendent romantic
union or through the attainment of some heavenly paradise), [we replace
the partial enjoyment of the death drive with the image of a complete
enjoyment to come. There is no question of fully enjoying our submission
to the death drive. We will always remain alienated from our mode of
enjoying.]{.underline} As Adrian Johnston rightly points out,
"Transgressively 'overcoming' the impediments of the drives doesn't
enable one to simply enjoy enjoyment."1 [But we can transform our
relationship to the impediments that block the full realization of our
drive. We can see the impediments as the internal product of the death
drive rather than as an external limit.]{.underline} [The enjoyment that
the death drive provides, in contrast to the form of enjoyment proffered
by capitalism]{.underline}, religion, and utopian politics, [is at once
infinite and limited.]{.underline} This oxymoronic form of enjoyment
operates in the way that the concept does in Hegel's Logic. [The concept
attains its infinitude not through endless progress toward a point that
always remains beyond and out of reach but through including the beyond
as a beyond within itself.]{.underline} As Hegel puts it, "The
universality of the concept is the achieved beyond, whereas that bad
infinity remains afflicted with a beyond which is unattainable but
remains a mere progression to infinity."2 That is to say, the concept
transforms an external limit into an internal one and thereby becomes
both infinite and limited. The infinitude of the concept is nothing but
the concept's own self-limitation. [The enjoyment that the death drive
produces also achieves its infinitude through self-limitation. It
revolves around a lost object that exists only insofar as it is lost,
and it relates to this object as the vehicle for the infinite unfurling
of its movement. The lost object operates as the self-limitation of the
death drive through which the drive produces an infinite enjoyment.
Rather than acting as a mark of the drive's finitude, the limitation
that the lost object introduces provides access to infinity. A society
founded on a recognition of the death drive would be one that viewed its
limitations as the source of its infinite enjoyment rather than an
obstacle to that enjoyment.]{.underline} To take the clearest and most
traumatic example in recent history, the recognition of the death drive
in 1930s Germany would have conceived the figure of the Jew not as the
barrier to the ultimate enjoyment that must therefore be eliminated but
as the internal limit through which German society attained its
enjoyment. As numerous theorists have said, the appeal of Nazism lay in
its ability to mobilize the enjoyment of the average German through
pointing out a threat to that enjoyment. the average German under Nazism
could enjoy the figure of the Jew as it appeared in the form of an
obstacle, but it is possible to recognize the obstacle not as an
external limit but as an internal one. In this way, the figure of the
Jew would become merely a figure for the average German rather than a
position embodied by actual Jews. Closer to home, one would recognize
the terrorist as a figure representing the internal limit of global
capitalist society. Far from serving as an obstacle to the ultimate
enjoyment in that society, the terrorist provides a barrier where none
otherwise exists and thereby serves as the vehicle through which
capitalist society attains its enjoyment. [The absence of explicit
limitations within contemporary global capitalism necessitates such a
figure: if terrorists did not exist, global capitalist society would
have to invent them.]{.underline} [But recognizing the terrorist as the
internal limit of global capitalist society would mean the end of
terrorism.]{.underline} This recognition would transform the global
landscape and deprive would-be terrorists of the libidinal space within
which to act. Though some people may continue to blow up buildings, they
would cease to be terrorists in the way that we now understand the term.
[A self-limiting society would still have real battles to
fight.]{.underline} There would remain a need for this society to defend
itself against external threats and against the cruelty of the natural
universe. Perhaps it would require nuclear weapons in space to defend
against comets or meteors that would threaten to wipe out human life on
the planet. But [it would cease positing the ultimate enjoyment in
vanquishing an external threat or surpassing a natural limit. The
external limit would no longer stand in for a repressed internal one.
Such a society would instead enjoy its own internal limitations and
merely address external limits as they came up.]{.underline}
[Psychoanalytic theory never preaches, and it cannot help us to
construct a better society. But it can help us to subtract the illusion
of the good from our own society. By depriving us of this illusion, it
has the ability to transform our thinking about politics.]{.underline}
With the assistance of psychoanalytic thought, we might reconceive
politics in a direction completely opposed to that articulated by
Aristotle, to which I alluded in the introduction. In the Politics,
Aristotle asserts: "Every state is a community of some kind, and every
community is established with a view to some good; for everyone always
acts in order to obtain that which they think good. But, if all
communities aim at some good, the state or political community, which is
the highest of all, and which embraces all the rest, aims at good in a
greater degree than any other, and at the highest good."3 Though later
political thinkers have obviously departed from Aristotle concerning the
question of the content of the good society, few have thought of
politics in terms opposed to the good. This is what psychoanalytic
thought introduces. [If we act on the basis of enjoyment rather than the
good, this does not mean that we can simply construct a society that
privileges enjoyment in an overt way.]{.underline} An open society with
no restrictions on sexual activity, drug use, food consumption, or play
in general would not be a more enjoyable one than our own. That is the
sure path to impoverishing our ability to enjoy, as the aftermath of the
1960s has made painfully clear. [One must arrive at enjoyment
indirectly. A society centered around the death drive would not be a
better society, nor would it entail less suffering. Rather than
continually sacrificing for the sake of the good, we would sacrifice the
good for the sake of enjoyment. A society centered around the death
drive would allow us to recognize that we enjoy the lost object only
insofar as it remains lost.]{.underline}

#### Embracing the anxiety of the other's enjoyment \-\-- the death drive itself \-\-- offers the only possibility of ethical encounter 

**McGowan 13** \[Todd, Associate Professor of Film and Television
Studies at the University of Vermont, *Enjoying What We Don't Have: The
Political Project of Psychoanalysis*, Symploke, University of Nebraska
Press (Lincoln, NE): 2013, p. 112-120\]

[The **alternative**]{.underline} --- the **[ethical path that
psychoanalysis identifies]{.underline}** --- **[demands an embrace of
the anxiety that stems from the encounter with the enjoying
other]{.underline}**. [If there is a certain ethical dimension to
anxiety, it lies in the relationship that exists between anxiety and
enjoyment]{.underline}. Contra Heidegger, [the ethics of anxiety does
not stem from anxiety\'s relation to absence but from its relation to
presence - to the overwhelming presence of the other\'s
enjoyment]{.underline}. In some sense, the encounter with absence or
nothing is easier than the encounter with presence. [Even though it
traumatizes us, absence allows us to constitute ourselves as desiring
subjects. Rather than producing anxiety, absence leads the subject out
of anxiety into desire]{.underline}. Confronted with the lost object as
a structuring absence, the subject is able to embark on the pursuit of
the enjoyment embodied by this object, and this pursuit provides the
subject with a clear sense of direction and even meaning. [This is
precisely what the subject lacks when it does not encounter a lack in
the symbolic structure. When the subject encounters enjoyment at the
point where it should encounter the absence of enjoyment, anxiety
overwhelms the subject.]{.underline}

In this situation, the subject cannot constitute itself along the path
of desire. It lacks the lack-the absence -that would provide the space
through which desire could develop. Consequently, [this subject
confronts the enjoying other and experiences anxiety. Unlike the subject
of desire - or the subject of Heideggerean anxiety-the subject who
suffers this sort of anxiety actually experiences the other in its real
dimension]{.underline}.

[The real other is the other caught up in its obscene enjoyment, caught
up in this enjoyment in a way that intrudes on the subject]{.underline}.
There is no safe distance from this enjoyment, and one cannot simply
avoid it. [There is nowhere in the contemporary world to hide from
it.]{.underline} As a result, [the contemporary subject is necessarily a
subject haunted by anxiety triggered by the omnipresent enjoyment of the
other. And yet, this enjoyment offers us an ethical
possibility]{.underline}. As Slavoj Zizek puts it, \"[It is this
excessive and intrusive jouissance that we should learn to
tolerate]{.underline}.\"[27 **When we tolerate the other\'s \"excessive
and intrusive jouissance\" and when we endure the anxiety that it
produces, we acknowledge and sustain the other in its real
dimension**]{.underline}.

[Tolerance is the ethical watchword of our epoch.]{.underline} However,
[the problem with contemporary tolerance is its insistence on
**tolerating the other only insofar as the other cedes its enjoyment and
accepts the prevailing symbolic structure. That is to say, we readily
tolerate the other in its symbolic dimension, the other that plays by
the rules of our game. This type of tolerance allows the subject to feel
good about itself and to sustain its symbolic identity. The problem is
that**]{.underline}, at the same time, it **[destroys what is in the
other more than the other]{.underline}** - the **[particular way that
the other enjoys]{.underline}**.

[It is only the encounter with the other in its real dimension - the
encounter that produces anxiety in the subject - that sustains that
which defines the other as such.]{.underline}

#### We should adopt a position of drive, rather than desire, when confronting the topic of race. I know, that sounds nebulous. Desire is when one thinks that there is an object which can fill their lack. Drive, by contrast, affirms lack itself as constitutive of the subject- founding identity on a void that can never be filled. 1) This is the condition for WISDOM, according to Lacan. 2) This is the only way to overcome the fantasy of a self that can be complete or full or satisfied. 3) This is the condition for overcoming racialized desire.

### Alt -- Fanonian New Man

#### Our alternative is to cultivate the Fanonian New Man, the subject neither of-lack, nor in-the-lack, but just "lack" in and of itself -- the drive incarnate. We must break ourselves apart from our toxic attachments to racial structures of psychic oppression and move towards a decolonized subjectivity beyond the western fantasy of racial identity.

**Thakur 22** (Gautam Basu Thakur, Associate Professor and Director of

Written nine years after BSWM and from within the context of segregated
French Algeria, the stakes in WOE are very different. French Algeria is
a military occupation where the colonized live as bare lives and in a
continuous state of siege. Therefore, [the demolition of the blatant
structural and material divisions between the colonized and the
colonizer must be accomplished before the subject-(un)making process of
the decolonized masses can be possible.]{.underline} But
[this]{.underline} second step [is essential for the "substantive
liberation of the colony from]{.underline} economic and [psychic
neocolonialism"]{.underline} (Ciccariello-Maher 2010: 14). It is only
through both these two stages of violence, one external and the other
internal, it is possible to create a society where the conundrum of
nonrelationality can be ethically addressed and a politics of social
relation formulated around, and not in spite of, the antagonism. [The
goal is to free society from all fantasies of sovereign identity and
destroy all bogus social and cultural institutions responsible for
sustaining a reality of identity politics. Violence, in this sense, is a
"detoxifying and destructive, creative and reinventive"
force]{.underline} (Marriott 2018: 72). Akin to Coleridgean daemonic
imagination, [Fanonian violence is a magical and synthetic force which
recreates men and society by bringing the discordant inherent to the
social into focus. Fanonian violence seeks "the veritable creation of
new men"---free from desire, identity, and Symbolic
belonging]{.underline} (Fanon 1968: 35). The New Man: a cut instead of a
conclusion [The notion of the New Man is yet another theoretical
experiment on the part of Fanon]{.underline}---[an exercise in
abstraction, another effort trying to define the
asignificative]{.underline} (negativity) [for a politics of the Real.
Conceptually, it is related to and an expansion on the notions of
nonbeing and Blackness.]{.underline} Like these, [the New
Man]{.underline}, too, [is an impossibility that is positively
unrealizable at the level of the Symbolic, since it is impossible to
conceive man sans desire.]{.underline} [Also akin to these]{.underline},
[the New Man disrupts the principle of exchange that is foundational to
the colonial regime. Insofar as both the creation of social relations
around the exploitation of the colonized as labor and the constitution
of the colonized as subjects desiring Whiteness are grounded in the
logic of exchange, the New Man, theoretically speaking, has the
potential to challenge the colonial script.]{.underline} An in-depth
discussion of the concept will require an entire chapter, so here I will
restrict my observations to the relation between the New Man, violence,
and the Real, and to how the concept of the New Man aligns with the
concept of nonbeing in Fanon. [The New Man emerges by being violently
unmade or stripped from delusions of being, desire, and
sovereignty---the "colonized becom\[ing\] a man during the same process
by which it frees itself "]{.underline} (Fanon 1968: 36). [But this is
not a freedom that sets up the colonized for a socially equal life, that
is, a freedom premised on the notion of justice or equal rights for
every human in society. Rather, Fanon indulges here in thinking about
freedom that is philosophical but with consequences for real politics.
It is a thinking about equality before real material conditions for
living equally can be accomplished.]{.underline} [In the philosophical
sense of being free, therefore, the idea of the New Man attempts to
reinstate the body as pure negativity back into the
Symbolic.]{.underline} Hence, the New Man in the Symbolic is nothing but
a potential corpse. Or, a corpse that speaks! But, [importantly, neither
can this body be marked by the Signifier nor can its speech be
recognized in terms of articulating desire.]{.underline} [The New Man is
both present in and absent from the Symbolic. Unregimented by desire,
the New Man is not "of-lack," not "in-the-lack" but just "lack"---the
insupportable not-all existing in but gesturing to a beyond of the
Symbolic order.]{.underline} [Disrobed of epidermal (in)security, this
New Man is truly disalienated from the flesh---it is a body devoid of
the skin as dress of the Symbolic; as such, it is the drive
incarnate.]{.underline} [It is a speaking subject without a
misrecognized body, therefore, a Thing, or, a voice, and nothing more.
The New Man is, consequently, a paradox: Signifier of a
non-significative vacuity, it is the deathdrive sticking to and ticking
through the Symbolic. The colonized's transition from a
pre-revolutionary to a post-revolutionary subject(ivity) involves
shifting from desiring]{.underline} (to become White) [to becoming the
negativity]{.underline} (that eviscerates the fictions of Whiteness):
[that is, from being crossed out in the Symbolic to reappearing in the
Symbolic as the apparition of the Real. As the Real, the New Man
returns, remains, but cannot be (un) seen. But this is not the "I"
becoming the "We" of the Third World oppressed; rather, this "I"
expresses the radical particularity]{.underline} (en moi) [standing in
for the Universal and, thereby, demonstrates true Universality not in a
common positive but in a shared excluded, i.e. the lack as foundational
to being.]{.underline} [It is by passing through the subject
eviscerating "real hell"---the zone of nonbeing---that a new Man can
come to "exist absolutely" without confinement in History or
desire.]{.underline} And with the "density of History determin\[ing\]
none of \[its\] acts," [this New Man is not trapped in the dialectic of
becoming, but, rather, by remaining in "permanent tension" with the
(im)possibility of achieving freedom outside the dialectic]{.underline},
[the New Man is a unique possibility for imagining a social politics for
a universal of negated subjects]{.underline} (Fanon 2008: 205--6). But
[this is a dangerous freedom. It requires being without the support of
desire and the guarantees of a (big) Other. What's worse is that this
notion of freedom is irreconcilable with our habitual understanding of
politics]{.underline}, and, therefore, questions might arise regarding
whether it is at all possible to conceive politics without wholesome
ideas, defined identities, and clearcut horizons of action demarcated by
desire? Indeed, can ontology-based politics replace the grind of the
politics of representation? [Does the impossibility of living as
persistent, determinate negativity---without desire and without
identity---not problematize or capsize politics altogether?]{.underline}
Sadly, Fanon does not address these issues; in fact, he seems only to
bring them up in the gaps or interstices of his writing. Unfortunately,
I too cannot expand upon this without moving beyond Fanon and
lengthening this chapter considerably. Therefore, in lieu of a
conclusion, I will end this essay abruptly, at this point, raising more
questions than answers. My hope is that a cut here will only encourage
further conversations about Fanon's ontology-based politics of social
(non-)relation. Continuing these conversations are crucial not only for
a serious reevaluation of Fanon but also for understanding how Fanon
shows the way for non-Europeans to occupy psychoanalysis.

### Alt---Self Naming

#### The alternative endorses a process of [self-naming]{.underline}---rather than attempting to [fill]{.underline} or [escape]{.underline} the Lack we ground ourselves [within]{.underline} it and embrace the [multiplicity]{.underline} of personal identity

Centering this study is the recognition that [race functions not only at
the social level but also at the psychic]{.underline}. We can more
precisely say that [the staying power of race, the inability to discard
it despite our awareness of its illusory groundings, is founded in
race's capacity to structure a relation to jouissance for the subject of
race]{.underline}. Beyond its Symbolic value[, race grounds the
fantasies and transgressions through which both African Americans and
white Americans access a semblance of being]{.underline}. With race thus
conflated with being by the historical trauma of slavery, with it
functioning as the central apparatus through which raced subjects define
their own and the racial other's relation to the jouissance of being,
[**contending against race means contending against the fundamental
fantasy of the desiring subject**, the aspiration toward wholeness that
founds subjectivity itself]{.underline}. But what I would like to
suggest here is that [the alienation of especially the African American
subject, which has been emphatically displayed in the racist Symbolic
that justifies oppression through disregard for African American
fantasies of being, has produced in many African Americans a cynicism
toward the Symbolic that is an essential defense against psychic
alienation]{.underline}. I have shown that Lacan defines [alienation as
the effect constituted upon the subject by language]{.underline}.
"[Man]{.underline}," Lacan says, "[is ravaged by Word]{.underline},"
[experiencing through the signifier the "death" that "brings
life]{.underline}."1 In ascending toward subjectivity through language,
**[the subject sacrifices an essential part of the self in order to
conform to the definitions of self that are imposed by the
Symbolic]{.underline}**. [The subject is constrained by the limits of
the signifier]{.underline} and [thus "designates his being only by
barring everything]{.underline}" of the self that escapes linguistic
signification.2 But, Lacan maintains, [**the signifier is also "the
cause of jouissance**," the means of articulating an illusory recovery
of the lost being]{.underline}.3 I have shown how the master signifier
of whiteness seeks to recover this being for the white subject but more
often denies it to blacks. As Lacan elaborates, "[Every dimension of
being is produced in the wake of the master's
discourse]{.underline}---the discourse of he who, proffering the
signifier, expects therefrom one of its link effects."4 **[African
Americans struggle against the effects of the master signifier of race
originally proffered by whites through seeking to resignify its value
and reaffirm a fantasy of being]{.underline}**. But [this struggle at
the level of the Symbolic is both necessary and
insufficient]{.underline}. [The necessity involved here is determined by
the fact that the exaltation of whiteness as master signifier and the
structuring of desire within the Symbolic around the white phallus
impair the ability of African Americans to identify with the Symbolic
itself and to establish the fantasies of being that facilitate a psychic
sense of contentment]{.underline}. Thus, [it would seem, what is needed
in race relations is access by both African Americans and white
Americans to vivifying fantasies of being]{.underline}. This need is
supported by the fact that [the limitations placed upon jouissance by
the Symbolic through its shaping of fantasies of being enable a possible
mediation of aggression toward the other]{.underline}. [Where the
subject "cannot recognize himself" except "by alienating himself" in the
desire and image of the Other, what the subject most naturally aims at
in his or her "aggressiveness" toward the racial other is an effort to
"refind" him or herself "by abolishing the ego's alter
ego."]{.underline}5 This alter self, experienced in the "extremity of
\[an\] intimacy that is at the same time excluded" internally, is what
the racial other comes to personify for the raced subject, such that
[the racial other stands as "the locus of the decoy in the form of
a,]{.underline}" in the form of the object that embodies a fantasy
manifestation of what is essentially lost to the subject.6 It is for
this reason that Lacan contends, "A solid hatred is addressed to
being."7 Thus [**it is at the level of fantasy, through the operations
of the fantasy object a that designates a relation to being, that this
aggressivity must be mediated**. Through a redefinition of the Symbolic
and its signifiers, language may attain a mediating function in which
"it allows two men to transcend the fundamental aggressive relation to
the mirage of their semblable]{.underline}."8 [Making a place for
African Americans in the Symbolic therefore means the destruction of old
fantasies of race]{.underline}, but, I contend, **[it does not mean the
creation of new ones]{.underline}**. [This study ultimately **refutes
the concept of race**, designating it as a primary source of subjective
alienation]{.underline}. We may say that [with race the master signifier
structures identity in such a fashion that between the raced subject's
"proper name," as the signifier of his or her identity, and the
signifiers of race, a "poetic spark is produced" that "metaphorically
abolishes" this identity, transforming the subject into his or her
race]{.underline}.9 [Race thus perfectly exemplifies the process through
which the subject]{.underline}, as Lacan states, [is transformed into a
signifier and deprived of being]{.underline}. Yet the paradox I have
shown is that **[raced subjects remain bound to race because through it
they dangerously recover a fantasy sense of being]{.underline}**. [Race,
emerging from a traumatic past that eruptively manifested jouissance
through sanctioned acts of transgression, perilously exacerbates illicit
desires for jouissance by fixing jouissance to the racial
other]{.underline}. Th[rough positioning the other as a source of
jouissance, race co-opts the function of the phallus by defining
desirability in the Symbolic, and what it defines as desirable is the
Real of an exultant bliss to which not only the Symbolic but also the
self and other that occupy it are subordinated]{.underline}. [Bound
through race to the jouissance of the traumatic past, the subject of
race remains alienated by the desire of the Other, by the racist
Symbolic that "proffered" the terms of race that African Americans
ascribe to even in their efforts to redefine them]{.underline}. [What is
needed, therefore, is **a "separation" from the Symbolic and the master
signifier of the Other** that grounds it in the jouissance of
race.]{.underline}10 [This separation must be founded]{.underline},
first of all, [on a recognition of the interdependence of the
subjectivities of the self and the racial other]{.underline}. The fact
of the extimacy of this racial other, who is internal to each American's
subjective sense of self, is exemplified in the racial fantasies that
structure both subjective and national identity for Americans. In the
first chapter of this book I showed how **[the identity of the slave
master depended on that of the slave]{.underline}**, and I suggested in
chapter 2 how [slave songs and jazz music became integral to American
identity]{.underline}. The implication here is [the need to conceive of
individuals in terms of broader cultural identities that transcend
racial differences and acknowledge interconnectivity across
groups]{.underline}. This is the solution I pointed to in my reading of
Ellison's Juneteenth, which presents the figure of Abraham Lincoln as a
paternal authority that transcends race. Present in Ellison's work is
[an urgency guiding us toward recognizing the vast diversity in American
identity and the disparately intermingled racial lineages that root
America in cultural hybridity, not racial separation]{.underline}. This
hybridity, what Du Bois conceives of as the problem of the "two warring
souls in one dark body" that characterizes African American double
consciousness, is the very extimacy that Ellison rightly celebrates in
his own life.11 Usefully modeling for us his own relation to the
Symbolic in his essay "The World and the Jug," Ellison speaks of
ancestral figures that shape his role as artist. [Where Ellison admits
that an African American author such as Richard Wright may be seen as a
"relative" of his, it is white writers like Hemingway and Faulkner that
he counts as his "ancestors]{.underline}."12 The title of Ellison's
essay stems from his [rejection of the notion that the traumatic
experiences of African Americans have cornered them into a place of
"unrelieved suffering," as though they are trapped in an "opaque steel
jug."]{.underline}13 Ellison asserts that "[if we are in a jug it is
transparent, not opaque, and one is allowed not only to see outside but
to read what is going on out there]{.underline}."14 [It is this
**ability to see outside the limitations imposed by race** that enables
Ellison to claim Hemingway and Faulkner as ancestors]{.underline}.
Ellison explains that "[one can do nothing about choosing one's
relatives," but "one can, as artist, choose one's
'ancestors.']{.underline} "15 In choosing his ancestors, however,
[Ellison attempts not to discard his relatives but rather to foreground
the urgencies of his own desires and drives. Privileging an
understanding of the self in the active choice he makes in his
identification with the other]{.underline}, Ellison explains, "Hemingway
was more important to me than Wright . . . not because he was white" but
"because he appreciated the things of this earth which I love and which
Wright" didn't "know," and because "all that he wrote" was "imbued with
a spirit beyond the tragic with which I could feel at home."16 Seeking
after that with which the self is most at home, [Ellison extends beyond
race toward a hybridized cultural identification with Hemingway
precisely because the spirit of Hemingway's writing is "very close to
the feeling of the blues" that also speaks to Ellison's sense of
self]{.underline}.17 Forestalling an identity grounded singularly in the
metaphor of race, Ellison pursues this sense of self through its
accumulation in the metonymic movement of self-identifications that are
driven by an individualized artistic desire to explore the homely spirit
of tragedy. What Ellison ultimately models is **[a desire grounded in
cynicism toward notions of race and racial lineage]{.underline}**. [This
cynicism]{.underline}, I suggest, [establishes a liberating distance
mutually from the alienating desire of the Symbolic Other and from the
avenging desire of the racial ancestor]{.underline}. Lacan makes clear
that "[desire is a defense" against alienation, a defense that "reverses
the unconditionality" in which "the subject remains subjected to the
Other" who]{.underline}, in this case, [binds ~~him or her~~ \[them\] to
a psychic relation to race]{.underline}.18 Lacan argues that "[**what
the subject has to free ~~him~~\[them\]self of is the aphanisic \[or
fading\] effect**" to which the subject is submitted by the signifiers
of the Symbolic, and the way that the subject does this is through
"scepticism" as what Lacan calls "a mode of sustaining man in
life."]{.underline}19 Where "man's desire is the Other's desire,"
granted to the subject and structured for him or her by the Symbolic
Other[, a "cynic\[ism\]" by which the subject questions the desire of
the Other is the stance that "best leads the subject to the path of his
own desire]{.underline}."20 Along this path, [the subject must
articulate what Lacan calls the Chè vuoi]{.underline}?, the simple
question, ["What does he want of me?"]{.underline}21 This question
creates distance between the conflated desires of the subject and the
Other, allowing for the emergence of something more properly subjective
and personal to the subject. As Lacan argues[, "if there is a position
that one can essentially qualify as subjective," it is "clearly" the
position of "doubt]{.underline}."22 [**This position is one uniquely
available to the African American subject**, as a subject who is
continually urged toward an antagonistic relation to the Symbolic
Other]{.underline}. In his reading of James Joyce, Lacan shows how [this
antagonism can lead to an exploration of one's own desires]{.underline}.
Like African Americans in their relation to the ancestor, Joyce is a
figure who has been confronted with the belief, Lacan states, that "his
father was lacking, radically lacking."23 [This confrontation
complicates Joyce's relation to the Symbolic]{.underline}. [Unable to
identify with the Symbolic, Joyce takes to an extreme the sense that the
Symbolic and language are imposed upon the subject, the feeling, I
argue, that is also experienced by African Americans submitted to the
Symbolic's racist signifiers]{.underline}; Joyce comes to sense that
[**"language" is a parasite**, a "veneer," a "cancer which afflicts the
human being,"]{.underline} and [he therefore moves to embrace
"**equivocation" as his "only weapon" against the
Symbolic**]{.underline}.24 This equivocation [leads to not only a
restructuring of Joyce's desires but also their resituation in direct
relation to his own Real.]{.underline} Joyce develops what Lacan calls
his own sinthome, as a substitute for the function of the father. Where
subjectivity is comprised of the three registers of the psyche---the
Imaginary, Symbolic, and Real---it is the father that functions
metaphorically as sinthome, as the knot that ties together the registers
into a unified subjective self.25 The sinthome is the root of the ego,
which is, at the decline of the oedipal complex, modeled after the
agency of the paternal metaphor as ego ideal. It is this modeling of the
self after the Symbolic Other that leads to alienation in the Symbolic.
But [as "heir" to a father found lacking, Joyce is able to assume
through equivocation the position of the "heir-etic" who questions both
the father and the Symbolic]{.underline}.26 This equivocation occurs at
the level of the emergence of the "personal" as the "support of the
subject," at the level where "personality" comes to stand as not a link
to the Other but a "link between \[this\] sinthome and the unconscious,
and between the imaginary and the real."27 [Though the unconscious,
"structured like a language," incorporates within it the signifiers of
the Other that make complete liberation impossible, this linking occurs
through Joyce's embrace of the individual lack that centers his
personal, unconscious relation to being]{.underline}.[28 It starts with
a recognition **not only that the ancestor lacks but that so too does
the Symbolic itself**]{.underline}. [It acknowledges a "lack inherent in
the \[Symbolic\] Other's very function as the treasure trove of
signifiers," an incapacity in its purported function of defining the
subject's identity, desire, and lack]{.underline}.29 Insofar as "the
Other is called upon (chè vuoi) to answer for the value of this
treasure," insofar as the heir-etic child of the Symbolic puts the
Symbolic Other to the impossible task of naming the lack personal to his
or her subjectivity, [this cynical subject begins the process of making
a name for \[themselves\]~~him- or herself~~.]{.underline}30 [Instead of
paying homage to the dead ancestor or bowing to the definitions imposed
by the paternal authority of the Other, **what is availed the subject is
the capacity to valorize \[their\]~~his or her~~ own "proper name**,"
designating it as the only signifier to be paid the deference he or she
bequeathed to the Other]{.underline}.31 [It is this signifier that must
come to stand for the lack, the absence, that is \[their\]~~his or her~~
being]{.underline}. [Radically altering one's psychic relation to the
Other, **the process of self-naming**]{.underline} I here advocate [both
**redirects the urge to grieve** the ancestor and **repudiates the
racialized designations through which the Other seeks to confine the
subject** in the steel jug of the Symbolic]{.underline}. What is
ultimately entailed in this self-naming is [**the subject recognizing
\[their\]~~his or her~~ "own image**" as "a mortal cause, and
griev\[ing\] this object" as a loss, as an emptiness around which **the
subject's own personality must be built as an incrementally expansive
structure to contain this internal absence**]{.underline}.32 In
establishing such personality, [**the goal is not to escape lack** but
rather to ground the self within it, to, more precisely, build the self
around its sustained void]{.underline}. Lacanian theory shows that [the
only way "to found wisdom \[is\] on lack,"]{.underline} which [presents
the single viable source of self-recognition afforded the
subject]{.underline}.33 [The absent image, as container, as personality,
must be cultivated and built up "ex-nihilo," from nothingness, as
psychic defense against the alluring phallus and objects a that act as
the decoys for desire within the confining ambit of the
Symbolic]{.underline}.34 [By recognizing this absence as the true
pathway to desire, and by coming to travel this discovered path, the
subject of race may not only attain **the means of expressing the
multiplicity of an identity and desire unhinged from the fantasy a of
race**, but also potentially **direct \[themselves\]~~him- or herself~~
toward a goal that centers the very practice of psychoanalysis**: not
just a transcendence of race but a transcendence of the fundamental
fantasy of recoverable loss that drives subjective and racial
desire]{.underline}. What Lacanian theory posits is the possibility
that, [after the experience of actively mapping one's own relation to
the fantasy object is undertaken by the subject, this "experience of the
fundamental phantasy" can become "the drive" by which desire is then
"agitated]{.underline}"; unveiled by the theory is the potential that[,
in cynically questioning the fantasy of race, the subject may confront
the very lack that fuels all fantasy and all desire, the lack that must
be subjectified as the empty core of a newly adumbrated
self.]{.underline}35 Lacan importantly cautions that the "loop" of the
subject's fantasy often must be "run through several times" before the
subject abandons it. I propose, however, that [because of the cynicism
already central to their relation to the Symbolic, African Americans are
uniquely positioned to embrace this very daunting task of transcending
both race and the fundamental fantasy it supports.36]{.underline}

### 2NC/1NR---AT: Race k2 politics

**Attachment to race [exceeds]{.underline} political utility and masks
the effort to conserve a [violent relationship]{.underline} to trauma**

**George 16** (Sheldon George, Professor of English at Simmons
University, 2016 , \"Trauma and Race: A Lacanian Study of African
American Racial Identity\", pp 37-38)//guyB

In chapter 1, I presented [slavery as constituting for African Americans
a jouissance of the past that repeats itself in the
present]{.underline}. Through a focus on the work of the renowned
African American scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, I will now describe how
**[racial identity facilitates an unconscious link to this traumatic
past]{.underline}**. Grounding my reading of this link on a Lacanian
definition of trauma and viewing trauma as structural both to the
operations of the signifier and to subjective self-identification, I
will demonstrate how [this past still urges at a psychic level the
allegiance to race of not only contemporary African Americans but also
contemporary African American scholars]{.underline}. Where I have argued
that [in slavery African Americans most often relied upon religion, and
not race, to constitute for themselves an essential semblance of
being]{.underline}, I point to [Du Bois as an important nexus in efforts
to shift from religion to race as determinant of the fantasies of being
that organize African American identity around the trauma of
slavery]{.underline}. In the late nineteenth century [Du Bois starts to
articulate the notion that establishing and maintaining a racialized
identity is a **political urgency** for African Americans.]{.underline}
Recognizing the centrality of the church as "the first distinct
voluntary organization of Negroes," [Du Bois maintains that "the Negro
church came before the Negro home" and "stands to-day as the fullest,
broadest expression of organized Negro life]{.underline}"; yet [it is
Du Bois' contention that "the Negro church must become differentiated"
from the home and other personal and political aspects of Negro
life]{.underline}.1 Du Bois [finds the church incapable, ultimately, of
protecting African Americans from moral and social decay]{.underline}
"born of Reconstruction," which has left the Negro only with the limited
"defense of deception and flattery, of cajoling and lying."2 [Instead of
religious organizations, argues Du Bois, "**we need race
organizations**: Negro colleges, Negro newspapers, Negro business
organizations," and, above all, a "Negro Academy]{.underline}" that
gathers "about it the talented, unselfish men and the pure and
noble-minded women" of the race [to "determine by careful conference and
thoughtful interchange of opinion the broad lines of policy and action
for the American Negro]{.underline}."3 Most emphatically in his 1897
essay "The Conservation of Races," [Du  Bois argues that **to achieve
social equality African Americans must conserve the concept of race**
forged in slavery and "**maintain their race identity**]{.underline}."4
In promoting racial identity, [Du Bois begins to articulate the central
assertion still made today by many African Americans: that African
Americans should maintain the concept of race as an essential means to
fight politically against racism]{.underline}. Echoing this sentiment,
contemporary African American critic [Lucius Outlaw argues that because
of "continuing legacies of invidious ethnocentrism and racism" in
America, justice cannot be "achieved practically without giving
consideration to raciality and ethnicity."]{.underline}5 [My own reading
of race and trauma]{.underline}, however, [complicates this political
justification for racial identity]{.underline}. As Anthony Appiah's
critique of Du Bois in his book chapter "Illusions of Race" implies,
**[it is not only the political utility of race that causes African
Americans to use and conserve this concept]{.underline}**; often, [it is
also a compelling attachment to the concept itself]{.underline}. Appiah
reveals that [whether Du Bois was able to use the concept of race to
escape "racism, \[Du Bois\] never completed the escape from race"
itself]{.underline}.6 Appiah cannot identify the influence that produces
in African Americans like Du Bois this attachment to race that clearly
exceeds race's political utility. What I propose, however, is that
**[the conservation of race by African Americans often masks an effort
to conserve the trauma of America's racial history and shore up a
personal sense of being fortified by the apparatus of
race.]{.underline}**

[This interpretation of slavery and African American identity demands an
appreciation for apparatuses of power, oppression, and ideology that is
rarely ascribed to Lacanian theory.]{.underline} Specifically in The
Other Side of Psychoanalysis, however, Lacan provides [a reading of
discourse, the signifier, and slavery that emerges precisely as a
revision of the notions of power presented in the socioeconomic theories
of Karl Marx]{.underline}. Of particular interest to us in this work is
Lacan's analysis of what he calls [the master's discourse]{.underline}.
Lacan describes [the master's discourse as incorporating a master
signifier that serves the hegemonic function of **making a Symbolic
system "readable**]{.underline}."39 [This master signifier is the
"joint," the "quilting point" that "creates" any given
discourse]{.underline}.40 Lacan asserts that the master signifier [not
only "can be any signifier" but also can serve the function of "mythical
support of certain societies" when it enables a belief of the master
"being identical with his own signifier."]{.underline}41 [Racial
whiteness is just such a signifier, establishing slavery as a nodal
point for the myths of race that still retain levels of structural
control over American society and its social Symbolic]{.underline}. This
view of slavery's relation to a master signifier allows us to supplement
groundbreaking scholarship done by Lacanian theorist Kalpana
Seshadri-Crooks on the psychoanalytic workings of race. Astutely
defining [whiteness as the master signifier for discourses of
race]{.underline}, Seshadri-Crooks argues that [whiteness establishes "a
structure of relations, a signifying chain that through a process of
inclusions and exclusions constitutes a pattern for organizing human
difference]{.underline}."42 Her work supports the notion that **[race
grounds the fantasies that promise the subject access to
being]{.underline}**. Whiteness does this by using its signifying chain
to establish a hierarchy in which whiteness comes to represent the
pinnacle of being, or "sovereign humanness."43 Seshadri-Crooks thus
rightly reads [whiteness as "the inaugural signifier of race" that
"implicates us all equally in a logic of difference]{.underline}," but
what we are able to specify through Lacan's The Other Side of
Psychoanalysis is a differential relation to this signifier that implies
for African Americans certain obstacles in the construction of those
fantasies of wholeness that protect the subject from a traumatic
confrontation with lack.44 It is here that Lacan's rereading of Marx is
useful. What Lacan does in The Other Side of Psychoanalysis is present
[capital and power as determinative of access to a jouissance of
excessive pain and pleasure made available to the subject through a
display of lack. Not only does Lacan tie the pursuit of being to
capitalism with an assertion that Marx's "surplus-value is surplus
jouissance," but he also supplements Marx's focus on the worker with his
own focus on the slave]{.underline}, arguing that **[surplus jouissance
is what "the slave brings" the master]{.underline}**.45 In Theories of
Surplus Value Marx observes, "Only that labour is productive which
creates a surplus-value."46 [Marx defines "surplus value" as the
monetary excess that the laborer's work]{.underline} or "labour-power
secures for the user of labour-power," arguing that "this surplus-value
can clearly only consist in the excess of labour which the labourer
returns to the capitalist over and above the quantity of labour that he
receives for his wages." As an expansion of Marx's theory, [Lacan's
surplus jouissance focuses not on excess capital produced through
underpaid labor but on the unearned excess pleasure the master receives
through the slave's work]{.underline}: "**[The work is mine, and the
surplus pleasure is yours]{.underline}**," says Lacan.48 [But where true
jouissance is bound to an impossible wholeness that is lost with being,
**surplus jouissance most precisely designates the fantasy of
being**]{.underline}. As a term, what [surplus jouissance ultimately
conveys is the excessive, brutal abuse of the other that may emerge from
the subject's determined pursuit of actions and objects that
fantastically secure an impossibly complemented state of being for the
subject]{.underline}. Lacan argues that **[capitalism is always tied to
a "birth of power,"]{.underline}** and [what brings slavery and
capitalism]{.underline} together in Lacan's theory [is precisely his
sense that power over others facilitates a control over discourse that
allows the subject to mask lack]{.underline}.49 [A central component of
Lacan's interest in capitalism is his focus on defining a historical
moment when "the signifier is introduced as an apparatus of
jouissance]{.underline}."50 Lacan's discussion of capitalism and slavery
is primarily a rereading of Hegel and Marx, and not a direct analysis of
race-based oppression. But one cannot ignore the striking similarity in
Lacan's language to Spillers' description of slavery, an institution
that Spillers sees as initiated in the middle passage's attempt at
["transforming personality into property" through that process by which
"subjects are taken into account as quantities]{.underline}."51 Similar
to Spillers, Lacan maintains that ["something changed in the master's
discourse at a certain point in history";]{.underline} beginning
possibly with "Luther, or Calvin, or some other unknown traffic of ships
around Genoa, or in the Mediterranean Sea, or anywhere else," [on "a
certain day surplus jouissance became calculable, could be counted,
totalized]{.underline}."52 [This traffic of ships]{.underline}, for
Lacan, [identifies the historical moment when "the accumulation of
capital begins" as a means of **quantifying a surplus jouissance** that
**exceeds the exchange value of labor**]{.underline}.53 At least in
antebellum America, [one cannot deny the connections between the
master's pleasures, a flourishing capitalist economy, and slave
labor.]{.underline} What Lacan allows us to do is [read slavery **not
simply as about racism, or even capitalism**, but as **bound most
fundamentally to the master's own masking of lack** through the
surpluses allowed by a coordination of capital and fantasy]{.underline}.
Showing that [capitalism and power enable certain fantasies for the
master,]{.underline} Lacan asserts that [to act "the master is to think
of oneself as univocal" and to, through fantasy and discourse, "mask\[\]
the division of the subject]{.underline}."54 [What "essentially
constitutes the master's discourse]{.underline}," Lacan states, "[is
that he commands, that he intervenes in the system of
knowledge]{.underline}," and thereby [accesses the means to hide the
"truth" that, like all subjects, "**the master is
castrated**]{.underline}."55 [The master submits himself to this
castration through reliance upon the signifier, even in the very act of
"giv\[ing\] an order";]{.underline} but, through the signifier,
[something also comes "back within the master's reach]{.underline}."56
Making [a distinction between the jouissance of being, or wholeness,
that is ever lost to the subject and the jouissance one receives from
the mere fantasy of wholeness]{.underline}, Lacan maintains that [what
returns to the master is not the lost jouissance of which castration
deprives him, but its surplus, a pleasure one may steal from the
other]{.underline}. He explains, "[something necessitates
compensation . . . for what initially is a negative number," for that
subtractive loss imposed upon the subject]{.underline}.57 [This
compensation emerges as "an irruption, a falling into the field, of
something not unlike jouissance---a surplus," a fantasy object snatched
from the Symbolic and made to signify the jouissance of being that it
can never make manifest.58]{.underline}

### 2ac death drive

#### There's no utility in embracing the death drive---it just reinforces things that already suck 

**Robinson 5** \[Andrew, PhD in political theory at the University of
Nottingham, Theory and Event, 8/1, "The Political Theory of Constitutive
Lack: A Critique", projectmuse\]

Guattari\'s critique of psychoanalysis makes clear the myths which
underlie it.  \'Psychoanalysis transforms and deforms the unconscious by
forcing it to pass through the grid of its system of inscription and
representation.  For psychoanalysis, the unconscious is always already
there, genetically programmed, structured, and finalized on objectives
of conformity to social norms\'104.  Similarly, [R]{.underline}eich has
already exposed a predecessor of the idea of \"constitutive lack\" - the
Freudian \"death instinct\" - as a denial that \"I don\'t know\".  It
is, he says, a metaphysical attempt to explain as yet inexplicable
phenomena, an attempt which gets in the way of fact-finding about these
phenomena105.  He provides a detailed clinical rebuttal of the idea of
the \"death instinct\" which is equally apt as an attack on Lacanians
(who seem unaware of Reich\'s intervention).  In Reich\'s view, the
masochistic tendencies Freud associates with the \"death instinct\" are
secondary drives arising from anxiety, and are attributable to \'the
disastrous effect of social conditions on the biopsychic apparatus. 
This entailed the necessity of criticizing the social conditions which
created the neuroses - a necessity which the hypothesis of a biological
will to suffer had circumvented\'106.  [[The idea of the \"death
instinct\" leads to a]{.mark} cultural [philosophy in which suffering
is]{.mark} assumed to be [inevitable]{.mark},]{.underline} whereas
Reich\'s alternative - to attribute neurosis to frustrations with
origins in the social system - leads to a critical sociological
stance107.  The relevance of Reich\'s critique to the political theory
of constitutive lack is striking.  [[The \"death instinct\" is connected
to]{.mark} an idea of [primordial masochism]{.mark}]{.underline} which,
in the form of \"aphanisis\" or \"subjective destitution\", recurs
throughout Lacanian political theory.  [[Zizek]{.mark} in particular
[advocates masochism,]{.mark} in the guise of \"shooting at\" or
\"beating\" oneself, [as a radical gesture]{.mark} which reveals the
essence of the self and breaks the constraints of an oppressive
reality]{.underline}108, although the masochistic gesture is present in
all Lacanian theorists.  The death instinct is typified by Zizek as a
pathological (in the Kantian sense), contingent attitude which finds
satisfaction in the process of self-blockage109.  It is identical with
the Lacanian concept of jouissance or enjoyment.  For him, \'enjoyment
(jouissance) is not to be equated with pleasure: enjoyment is precisely
\"pleasure in unpleasure\"; it designates the paradoxical satisfaction
procured by a painful encounter with a Thing that perturbs the
equilibrium of the pleasure principle.  In other words, enjoyment is
located \"beyond the pleasure principle\"\'110.  It is also the core of
the self, since enjoyment is \'the only \"substance\" acknowledged by
psychoanalysis\', and \'the subject fully \"exists\" only through
enjoyment\'111.  Primordial masochism is therefore central to the
Lacanian concept of the Real, which depends on there being a universal
moment at which active desire - sometimes given the slightly misleading
name of the \"pleasure principle\" - is suspended, not for a greater or
delayed pleasure, but out of a direct desire for unpleasure (i.e. a
primary reactive desire).  Furthermore, this reactive desire is supposed
to be ontologically prior to active desire.  Dominick LaCapra offers a
similar but distinct critique to my own, claiming that Lacanian and
similar theories induce a post-traumatic compulsion repetition or an
\'endless, quasi-transcendental grieving that may be indistinguishable
from interminable melancholy\'112. Reich has already provided a rebuttal
of \"primordial masochism\", which, paradoxically given Zizek\'s claims
to radicalism, was denounced by orthodox Freudians as communist
propaganda.  In Reich\'s view, masochism operates as a relief at a
lesser pain which operates as armouring against anxiety about an
underlying trauma113.  Regardless of what one thinks of Reich\'s
specific account of the origins of masochism, [what is crucial is his
critique of the idea of a death drive. ]{.underline} \'Such hypotheses
as are criticised here are often only a sign of therapeutic failure. 
For [[if one explains masochism by a death instinct]{.mark}, [one
confirms to the patient his]{.mark} \[sic\] [alleged will to
suffer\']{.mark}]{.underline}[114]{.mark}.  [Thus, [Lacanian]{.mark}
[metaphysics conceal Lacanians\' encouragement of a variety of neurosis
**complicit with oppressive social realities**]{.mark}.  Politically,
[**the thesis of primordial masochism provides a mystifying cover** for
the social forces which cause and benefit from the contingent emergence
of masochistic attachments (i.e. sadistic power apparatuses).  One could
compare this remark to Butler\'s claim that Zizek \'defends the trauma
of the real\... over and against a different kind of
threat\']{.mark}]{.underline}115.

#### Studies don't support death drive---replicable tests are impossible, variables are too vague to operationalize 

**Holowchak 12** \[Andrew, teaches Philosophy at Rider University. When
Freud (Almost) Met Chaplin: The Science behind Freud\'s \"Especially
Simple, Transparent Case\" Project Muse\]

[The problem is]{.underline} that [psychoanalytic concepts]{.underline}
(e.g., \"super-ego,\" \"Oedipus complex,\" [and \"[death
drive]{.mark}\"]{.underline}30 ), unlike them of say physics
(\"electron,\" \[End Page 67\] \"muon,\" and \"quark\"), [[are logical
constructs that have not been corroborated by]{.underline} **[precise
observations]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline} **[replicable
tests]{.underline}**. Hence Freud\'s logical constructs as
proto-concepts are not even adequate as working hypotheses. As early as
1934, J. F. Brown, who claimed he was in sympathy with Freud\'s new
science, urged, \"But, and here almost [all critics of psychoanalysis
are in agreement, the theory has never been precise enough to allow
formulation of working hypotheses for which adequate experimental
situations **could be found\"**]{.underline} (1933, p. 333). He went on
to acknowledge, perhaps somewhat prophetically, given the amount of
attention Freud gets today in philosophy of mind, \"Freud\'s discoveries
probably are the most striking and original contributions made to the
science of mind in our time.\" He added, in a manner that vitiates the
compliment, that Freud is more prophet than scientist---more Bruno than
Galileo (1933, p. 226).

Freud was aware of that. His own view of the concepts of psychoanalysis
is ambivalent. At times, he shows impatience and becomes intolerant of
his critics. \"Only in psychology \[is obscurity not tolerated\]; here
the constitutional incapacity of men for scientific research comes into
full view. It looks as though people did not expect from psychology
progress in knowledge, but some other kind of satisfaction; every
unsolved problem, every acknowledged uncertainty is turned into a ground
of complaint against it\" (1916--7, S.E., XXII: 6). At other times,
[Freud seems to agree with his critics.]{.underline} In
\"Autobiographical Study,\" when he mentions difficulties with
\"compulsion to repeat,\" [he adds]{.underline}:

[Although it arose from a [desire]{.mark} to fix some of the most
important theoretical ideas of psycho-analysis, it [goes far **beyond
psychoanalysis**]{.mark}. I have repeatedly heard it said contemptuously
that [it is impossible to take a science seriously **whose most general
concepts are as lacking in precision as those of libido and of
drive**]{.mark}]{.underline} in psychoanalysis.

(1925, S.E., XX: 57)

In \"Why War?,\" Freud writes to Einstein in a manner to explain his
ambivalence: \"It may perhaps seem to you \[Einstein\] as though our
theories are a kind of mythology and, in the present case, not even an
agreeable one. But does not every science come in the end to a kind of
mythology like this?\" (1933, S.E., XXII: 211)

In sum, [the [bedrock concepts of Freudian psychoanalysis are
conceptually indeterminate]{.mark}]{.underline}. That means that the
fundamental principles of Freudian psychoanalysis are conceptually
indeterminate and, [[thus]{.underline}, **[obscure or
meaningless]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Unfortunately, as we have seen,
Freud was evasive when it \[End Page 68\] came to the question of the
status of the bedrock concepts of psychoanalysis and even said that
psychoanalysis, with the exception of \"repression\" and
\"unconscious,\" could do just as well without them31 (1914, S.E., XIV:
16; 1925, S.E., XX: 32--3). [Without referents to the concepts he
employs so significantly, **[Freud is writing
gobbledygook]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[A related difficulty is conceptual change. [Freud]{.mark}, as a
scientist, [was committed to conceptual flexibility, insofar as his
postulates were avowedly data-driven]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nonetheless,
[many of the conceptual changes he made]{.underline}---e.g., his
rejection of his Seduction theory and [[his adoption of the death drive
and structural model]{.underline}---[were prompted more by theoretical
difficulties than they were driven by observational
data.]{.underline}]{.mark} In addition, [[Freud **surrounded himself**
with **lackeys**]{.mark}, albeit intelligent lackeys, that allowed him,
[**as founder** of psychoanalysis, the **privilege** of being final
arbiter on issues of **conceptual change** within
psychoanalysis.]{.mark}]{.underline}[32]{.mark}

### 2ac death k

#### Affirming survival doesn't devalue life -- life is complex and malleable and can be celebrated even when it seems oppressive

**Fassin, 10** - James D. Wolfensohn Professor in the School of Social
Science at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, as well as
directeur d'études at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales,
Paris. (Didier, Fall, "Ethics of Survival: A Democratic Approach to the
Politics of Life" Humanity: An International Journal of Human Rights,
Humanitarianism, and Development, Vol 1 No 1, Project Muse)

Conclusion

[[Survival]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the sense Jacques Derrida attributed
to the concept in his last interview, not only shifts lines that are too
often hardened between biological and political lives: it
[**[opens]{.mark} an ethical [space for]{.mark}** **[reflection and
action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Critical thinking in the past decade has
often taken biopolitics and the politics of life as its
objects]{.underline}. It has thus unveiled the way in which individuals
and groups, even entire nations, have been treated by powers, the
market, or the state, during the colonial period as well as in the
contemporary era.

[However, through indiscriminate extension, this powerful instrument has
lost some of its analytical sharpness and heuristic
potentiality]{.underline}. On the one hand, [[the]{.mark} binary
[reduction of life to the opposition between]{.mark} nature and history,
[bare life and qualified life]{.mark}]{.underline}, when systematically
applied from philosophical inquiry in sociological or anthropological
study, [[erases]{.mark} much of [the]{.mark} complexity and [richness of
life]{.mark} in society as it is in fact observed]{.underline}. On the
other hand[, the normative prejudices which underlie the evaluation of
the forms of life and of the politics of life, when generalized to an
undifferentiated collection of social facts, end up by depriving social
agents of legitimacy, voice, and action]{.underline}. The risk is
therefore both scholarly and political. It calls for ethical attention.

In fact, the genealogy of this intellectual lineage reminds us that the
main founders of these theories expressed tensions and hesitations in
their work, which was often more complex, if even sometimes more
obscure, than in its reduced and translated form in the humanities and
social sciences today. And also biographies, here limited to fragments
from South African lives that I have described and analyzed in more
detail [elsewhere, suggest the necessity of complicating the dualistic
models that oppose biological and political lives. Certainly, [powers
like the]{.mark} market and the [state]{.mark} do [act sometimes as if
human beings could be reduced to "mere life," but]{.mark} democratic
[forces]{.mark}, including from within the structure of power, [tend to
produce alternative]{.mark} [strategies that escape this
reduction]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And [people themselves, even under
conditions of domination]{.mark},]{.underline} \[End Page 93\] [[manage
subtle tactics that transform their]{.mark} physical [life]{.mark} [into
a]{.mark} political instrument or a [moral resource]{.mark} or an
affective expression]{.underline}.

But let us go one step further: ethnography invites us to reconsider
what life is or rather what human beings make of their lives, and
reciprocally how their lives permanently question what it is to be
human. "The blurring between what is human and what is not human shades
into the blurring over what is life and what is not life," writes Veena
Das. In the tracks of Wittgenstein and Cavell, she underscores that the
usual manner in which we think of forms of life "not only obscures the
mutual absorption of the natural and the social but also emphasizes form
at the expense of life."^22^ It should be the incessant effort of social
scientists to return to this inquiry about life in its multiple forms
but also in its everyday expression of the human.

[the actions of **unadulterated goodwill**]{.underline} [that become
commonplace]{.underline} in harrowing conditions [represent the **truly
authentic form of humanity**]{.underline} **[that all of

after]{.underline}** in contemporary consumer culture every day. [And
while it is certainly a bit foolhardy to seek authentic humanity through
disaster-related]{.underline} [media]{.underline} and [culture,
**[the]{.mark} sheer [strength]{.mark} [of that desire has been evident
in the public's response to all]{.mark} the
[disasters]{.mark},**]{.underline} crises and catastrophes to hit the
United States in the past decade[. The millions of television viewers
who cried on September 11, or during Hurricane Katrina and the Virginia
Tech shootings, and the thousands upon thousands who volunteered their
time, labor, money, and even their blood, as well as the countless
others who created art, contributed to memorials, or adorned their cars
or bodies with disaster-related paraphernalia]{.underline}--- despite
the fact that many knew no one who had been personally affected by any
of these disasters---[all attest to a **desire for real human community

already have, simply by consuming. [It is ultimately less a form of
political anesthesia than a simulation of politics]{.underline}, a
Potemkin village of communal sentiment, that fills our longing for a
more just and humane world with disparate acts of cathartic consumption.
Still, [the positive political potential underlying such
consumption---the desire for real forms of connection and
community---remains the most redeeming feature of disaster
consumerism.]{.underline} Though that desire is frequently warped when
various media lenses refract it, diffuse it, or reframe it to fit a
political agenda, [its overwhelming strength should nonetheless serve
notice that people want a different world than the one in which we
currently live, with a different way of understanding and responding to
disasters]{.underline}. They want a world where risk is not leveraged
for profit or political gain, but sensibly planned for with the needs of
all socio-economic groups in mind. **[[They want a world where]{.mark}
preemptive [strategies are used to anticipate]{.mark} the [real
threats]{.mark} posed by global climate change and global inequality,
[rather than to]{.mark} invent fears of ethnic others and [justify

can come together **not simply as a market, but as a
public**]{.underline}, **[to exert real agency over the policies
made]{.underline}** in the name of their safety and security. And, [when
disaster does strike, they want a world where the goodwill and
compassion shown by their neighbors]{.underline}, by strangers in their
communities, [and even by distant spectators and consumers, will be
**matched by their own government**]{.underline}. **[Though this vision
of the world is utopian, it is not unreasonable]{.underline}**, and if
contemporary American culture is ever to give us more than just an
illusion of safety, or empathy, or authenticity, **[then it is this
vision that we must advocate on a daily basis, not only when disaster
strikes.]{.underline}**

**[Belief in Authority]{.underline}**

[Psychoanalysis is a "testimonial science" \[4\]; its theoretical
concepts rely on its major proponents\' clinical case interpretations.
However, the authority argument is **not sound** if the authors do not
have **sufficient proof about what they say**]{.underline}**.** Freud
did not make use of systematic and controlled scientific investigations
and not even statistics to achieve his conclusions \[9\], making it
imperative for the reader that consults the foundations of the theory to
trust that he possessed both different and special capabilities to find
out the truth about how human psychology works. However, [there are **no
reasons to believe** that a human being that resorts only on his
personal experience and decides not to use scientific tools would have
the means to formulate the most epistemically warranted psychological
theory. The other major psychoanalytic authors have also followed
Freud\'s steps. For one to believe in Lacan\'s discourse, for example,
it is necessary to first **take it as true and attribute him an
authority role**, since the reader has neither a way to verify its
claims independently, nor the resources to explicitly understand its
meanings]{.underline} \[10\]. Besides that, in the founder\'s case,
[reasons to take his narratives into consideration **might not even
exist**]{.underline}. When the topic is psychoanalysis, its proponents\'
honesty is an important aspect to be observed, precisely because the
theory is based on their authority \[4\]. [If there is no honesty, there
should not be any reasons, even for those unaware of the problems
related to anecdotal evidence, to continue adopting their
assumptions.]{.underline}

Dersken \[11\] demonstrates that [Freud frequently used a variety of
rhetorical strategies to avoid criticism and keep his theory\'s good
appearance in front of the]{.underline} public, and he succeeded. The
psychoanalyst affirmed several times that his theory did not consist of
speculation, in an attempt to convince his reader that a solid empirical
basis supported his conclusions, even while having none. [To deal with
the most severe counterarguments, he inverted the speech roles: Freud
himself presented objections to his own doctrine in the most threatening
way possible, and by doing so, it sounded like he was aware of the
problems and would know how to reply to them]{.underline}. What other
reason would he have to bring up all the criticism without knowing how
to defend his theory from it? [Even so, at the end of his discourse, the
supposed reply was **only evasive**, the original topic was altered,
**the burden of proof was inverted**, or absolutely no answer was given,
maintaining the original critiques still untouched]{.underline}.

Crews \[9\] argues that during several moments Freud adjusted his
narratives in order for them to fit in the result he previously aimed to
achieve, no matter if what he was saying was really true. [Many of his
clinical cases developed in ways that were distinct from what was
declared by him, went through a **biased interpretative process**, or
**did not obtain promising results**. Anna O. was not someone with
hysteria]{.underline}; in fact, she suffered from a chemical dependency
of substances like morphine and chloral hydrate, and all her symptoms
could be listed as possible effects of these \[9, p. 354-360\]. [Dora, a
young victim of sexual harassment, was reported as a protagonist of a
hysteria case]{.underline} for not desiring to be involved with her
abuser and feeling repulsed by his advances \[9, p. 590-600\]. In the
[Little Hans]{.underline} case, a five-year-old, [Freud did not hesitate
to give him a diagnosis even before knowing him personally: his fear of
horses was in fact a fear of being castrated by his father]{.underline},
since Freud believed he sexually desired his mother \[9, p. 645\]. [The
Wolf Man was declared as cured by Freud; however, he kept being treated
by several different analysts for decades, not obtaining any
results]{.underline} \[9, p. 651; 12\].

Those are just some examples of famous clinical cases, but others suffer
from the same problem \[9\]. The success of these kinds of adulterations
and other rhetorical strategies contributed to the building and
widespread recognition of Freud\'s authority role, as well as masking
how fragile his proposal was.

#### 2\-\--Unrepeatable Experiments

MG)

**[Unrepeatable experiments]{.underline}**

As discussed earlier, the theoretical concepts in psychoanalysis are
sustained by Freud and the other major proponents' clinical case
reports, who also followed his tradition of producing anecdotal
evidence. Until today, they maintain their authority over contemporary
analysts:

"André Green, when asked about what was new in psychoanalysis, answered:
Freud. To this playful, but nonetheless very accurate answer, we could
add the list of the great thinkers and practitioners of psychoanalysis
who were essential to the several traditions in which the psychoanalytic
movement was divided since the \'40s. Decades after their deaths, they
continue to be what exists of new, as long as we know how to read them"
\[13, p. 10\].

[Although anecdotal evidence is still being used]{.underline}, in most
cases, as the major means of psychoanalysis dissemination and production
\[14\], [important obstacles are placed when they are employed. A
psychoanalytical clinical case is a type of process that **cannot be
replicated** because it addresses a single subject
individually]{.underline}. However, as Schmidt \[15\] argues,
[replication is one of the most **central processes within empirical
sciences**, and sadly not even psychology gives proper attention to the
matter. It possesses five major functions: **control sampling errors,**
by verifying if the results obtained happened by chance alone; **control
internal validity**, that is, if the procedures adopted were adequate to
answer the research's question; **control the possibility of scientific
fraud**; allow a generalization of the findings to a larger/different
population; and finally, verify if the first hypothesis of the
experiment was correct. In the case of an unrepeatable experiment, the
possibility of performing these analyses is thrown away.]{.underline}

[Besides the impossibility of replication, there are other problems, now
related to human psychology: People are commonly victims of **cognitive
bias** that distorts their judgment and leads to irrational
interpretations more frequently than they usually notice \[16\], and
therapists are not immune. An example could be **confirmation
bias**]{.underline}: someone's initial belief significantly impacts how
they remember situations and how they interpret them, giving more
importance to what apparently confirms their world view rather than
paying attention to what could contradict it. In the case of a
psychoanalyst, this could bring them to understand exactly what they
yearned to, that is, what would supposedly confirm the analytic
hypothesis, regardless if that was or was not the case \[14, p.
139-140\]. [Even if a case report is not a good evidence, it would sound
like a source of theoretical confirmation for an adept, as it is
expected that it would reflect their own preconceptions.]{.underline}

[As Spence \[17\] shows, even if someone wished to analyze the veracity
of the reported clinical phenomena, the person still has to face the
fact that they are **frequently replaced by fictional narrative**. Their
contents could be partially reported, omitted, distorted, and mixed with
other case contents, even in a non-intentional way, precisely because
they are based on the therapist\'s memory. Psychoanalytical clinical
case reports are **not sufficiently controlled**, so when they aim to
support a human psychological theory, they end up being just **fuel for
a system of self-confirmations**]{.underline}. There is no way to
generalize a human psychological theory based on anecdotal clinical
evidence, neither to guarantee its reliability, because a
nonsystematized process does not aim to control variables that can
interfere with the conclusions. At the same time, there are reasons to
expect that distortions are going to happen.

#### 3\-\--Handpicked Examples

MG)

**[Handpicked examples]{.underline}**

As already discussed in previous sections, the widespread use of
anecdotal evidence would be an excellent example to fulfill this third
criterion, precisely because those [cases are **isolated** and **exposed
to bias**. However, along with them, another endeavor of contemporary
psychoanalysis is neuropsychoanalysis]{.underline}. Neuropsychoanalysis
is a movement that looks for an integration between neuroscience and
psychoanalysis, and despite being rejected by part of the psychoanalytic
community that wants no part in it, some others consider it to be a
contemporary version of the theory.

Callegaro \[18, p. 207-20\] argues that, instead of what the
neuropsychoanalytical movement declares, the scientific literature shows
something opposite to union: [The evidence from neuroscience either
refutes or directly conflicts with psychoanalysis. It is not as if it
was plausible to use psychoanalysis as a reference model; it is in the
new unconscious model that neuroscientists rely on, and not on the
psychodynamic one.]{.underline}

Paris \[14, p. 94-99\] argues that [neuropsychoanalysis is not operating
in order to evaluate Freudian and neuroscientific theories in an
unbiased way, but rather **starts from the principle of validating
Freud\'s model beforehand**]{.underline}, even though it showed not to
have a consistent hypothesis with modern neuroscience. The author lists
some reasons that show why [**neuropsychoanalysis is far from science**:
In this doctrine, it is previously assumed that Freud was right, and
research would serve the only purpose of proving what was already
obvious from the psychoanalytic point of view; the majority of
neuropsychoanalysis papers do not present concrete data, but theoretical
speculations; methods used to measure basic psychoanalytic concepts are
**still pretty rudimentary**; and, finally, there are many difficulties
and problems, even in neuroscience itself, to adequately locate mental
functions in specific brain areas.]{.underline}

[In the end, it is noticeable that neuropsychoanalysis consists in a
**great cherry picking of data**]{.underline}, in which its proponents
"attempt to systematically associate almost every neuroscientific
concept or finding with a quote from Freud" \[19, p. 170\], giving the
impression that when neurological phenomena such as anosognosia, memory
problems, brain damage and others are associated with concepts from the
Freudian model, that would mean that they were, from the beginning, an
adequate theoretical explanation given by its founder, but that is not
the case.

#### 4\-\--Unwillingness to Test

**Ferreira 21** (Clarice de Madeiros Chaves Ferreira - Vice-President of
the Brazilian Association of Evidence-Based Psychology and holds a
degree in psychology from FUMEC University and Scientific Initiation at

MG)

**[Unwillingness to Test]{.underline}**

[Most psychoanalysts assume as true that human subjectivity is above all
possible scientific analysis \[20-21\]. Thus, since the foundation of
psychoanalysis and until the present day with its contemporary version,
psychoanalysts **carry on the tradition** of being resistant to testing
their hypothesis, whether they are about clinical effectiveness or
theoretical constructs]{.underline}. Melanie Klein, for example, can be
"dismissed (...) from the point of view of empirical science (...) while
many of Klein's ideas were based on what she called 'infant
observation', they actually consisted only of speculations about what
infants might be thinking" \[14, p. 55\]. Also, ["there has **never been
empirical research** on any of the constructs that Lacan proposed" \[14,
p. 122\], and "**neither neo-Freudian models**, nor ego psychology,
**nor relational psychoanalysis**, nor self-psychology, **have ever
conducted empirical investigations** of their theories, or of the
process and outcome of the treatment approaches derived from these
ideas"]{.underline} \[14, p. 55-56\].

Despite the different opinions in the psychoanalytic community about the
scientific status of the doctrine, it is possible to observe that the
majority of adepts have great resistance towards the adoption of
systematized tools and processes for data collection, under the argument
that their object of study, humans, are too singular and unique to be
understood by a supposed "positivistic science", in which only empirical
experiments are allowed \[22\]. It is explicitly said by psychoanalysts,
for example, that they believe "that today it is essential to
demonstrate that psychoanalysis does not need new scientific foundations
that would be provided in a \'systematic\' and \'safe\' way" \[23, p.
15\], that the psychoanalytic cure could not be apprehended in terms of
efficacy criteria, as would be done in psychiatry \[24\], and that the
establishment of criteria for assessing psychotherapeutic effectiveness
would be considered a threat to subjectivity \[20\]. There is even a
clear opposition to those who seek these objectives:

"What we can perceive in contemporary times, is that many professionals
in the psi field, when they come across the symptom presented by the
individual, seek to annihilate it, not taking into account the ethical
dimension through which the symptom manifests itself. This means that
the vast contemporary psychotherapeutic proposals that announce to the
world a way of treatment increasingly supported by science, in addition
to the current proposal in the field of mental health that plays
insistently with the possibility of defining a common norm, are not
committed to the experience revealed by psychoanalysis (\...). We will
see that [psychoanalysis poses itself as an obstacle to this
psychological and medical attitude" \[25, p. 242\].]{.underline}

[As previously seen, using the broad definition of science, disciplines
such as philosophy, history, linguistics, and other humanities can be
considered sciences, even without using traditional experimentation,
because the most adequate methods to look for truth in those particular
circumstances are being employed. However, **psychology and psychiatry
are not in the same situation**: There is **no reliable way** to acquire
the most epistemically justified beliefs about human behavior without
resorting to systematic empirical methodologies. Humans **do not have
the ability to**, using only speculation, develop reliable enough
beliefs about these topics. Therefore, while psychoanalysis rejects
those methods, it cannot be the most reliable psychological doctrine of
our time.]{.underline}

Instead, some of its adepts are aligning it to relativistic positions.
This fuels the notion that science is only one more discourse, and it
could not claim to have better interpretations about reality than any
other:

["The fact remains that **science is a discourse**]{.underline}. As
banal as that statement may seem, it implies a dethroning of Science and
a reassessment of science as one discourse among many. Freud may be
interpreted as translating 'rationality' into 'rationalization', and
Lacan\'s discourse theory suggests that there are as many different
claims to rationality as there are different discourses" \[26, p. 138\].

[Science is accused of being the real dogma, and psychoanalysis then
comes to break it \[27\]. Therefore, it does not have to bow to its
methods, including systematic testing]{.underline} \[22\]. In fact, some
aspects of the psychanalytic doctrine have the stated purpose of serving
"as an epistemological obstacle to the attempt of scientifically
addressing the psyche" (p. 237), and also to the evidence based
treatments of mental health disorders \[25\]. [**Psychoanalysis requires
the unreasonable**: it demands special protection and would not admit
being judged like any other scientific doctrine should be, while also
aims to have a similar status that any other would have. However, if the
same level of recognition and appreciation is demanded, then it **must
be evaluated by similar requirements** for rigor and presentation of
evidence.]{.underline}

Despite the majority of the community being averted to hypothesis
testing, there are some exceptions to this rule. Attachment theory is
probably the most promising contemporary revision of psychoanalytic
theory, for being the only one that is more open to the testing of
hypothesis and empirical research \[14, p. 62\], and for the same reason
it is rejected by other psychoanalysts as something that is not
legitimately part of the doctrine \[14, p. 56-57\]. Unfortunately,
attachment theory does not consider genetic and temperamental aspects
\[14, p. 58\], and its predictions between child attachment patterns and
adulthood are very weak \[28\], while psychoanalysis places the major
causes of adult psychopathologies precisely in the childhood.

About psychoanalysis as a treatment: even though there was great
resistance from the community, some studies on its psychotherapeutic
efficacy were conducted. Nowadays, long-term [psychotherapies usually
**do not have convincing evidence** for their effectiveness, and in this
category long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy is included
\[14\].]{.underline} One example can be observed with the Leichsenring
and Rabung meta-analysis \[29\]. Despite being one of the most cited
works done to evaluate this kind of psychotherapy, it was severely
criticized for failing in all the quality criteria required of
meta-analyses \[30\]. One of the common strategies that psychoanalysts
adopt to deal with the lack of good evidence is turning to their
personal experiences, and this can be observed in the following report
published by the International Psychoanalytical Association:

["It is easy to be critical of psychoanalytic studies. There are no
definitive studies which show psychoanalysis to be unequivocally
effective relative to an active placebo or an alternative method of
treatment. There are **no methods available** that might definitively
indicate the existence of a psychoanalytic process. Most studies have
major limitations which might lead critics of the discipline to discount
their results. Others have limitations that are so grave that even a
sympathetic reviewer might be inclined to discount the findings. (\...)
As]{.underline} psychoanalysts we all know that psychoanalysis works.
Our own analytic experience is probably sufficient in most instances to
persuade us of its effectiveness" \[31, p. 283\].

When compared to long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy, the shortterm
psychodynamic one has a higher number of studies reported in the
literature, with mostly favorable results \[14\]. [However,
psychotherapy in general faces problems with higher complexity than this
article can cover. The majority of results on the topic, no matter what
type of psychotherapy is investigated, tend to show positive effects,
with few exceptions. Although, there is evidence that, in many cases,
those results are biased or have questionable methodology.]{.underline}

[Dragioti \[32\] conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses about
various types of psychotherapy (including psychodynamic). They realized
that only **16** of **247 meta-analyses** (7%) were capable of providing
good evidence without bias, and **none were from psychodynamic or
psychoanalytic approaches**.]{.underline} Besides the discussion about
psychoanalysis\'s scientific status, this is undoubtedly a topic that
requires more attention from clinical professionals, psychologists and
psychiatrists.

#### 5\-\--Disregard of Refuting Information

**[Disregard of refuting information]{.underline}**

[There is evidence that many of the key concepts of psychoanalysis are
**wrong**]{.underline}, but notwithstanding, they keep being adopted in
Brazilian universities and as a theoretical basis for clinical practice.
[The empirical literature **did not support the psychoanalytical theory
about dreams** \[33\], **memory or repression** \[34\]. The brain does
not work making permanent recordings about situations that are then
repressed \[14, p. 30\]. Despite recognizing that unconscious processes
exist and significantly impact human beings, the psychodynamic
unconscious that is governed by repressed desires and drives **does not
receive empirical support**]{.underline} \[14, p. 29- 30\]. As an
alternative, the new unconscious theory is more coherent with
contemporary discoveries in the field of neuroscience \[14, p. 29-30;
18\].

[**Psychoanalysis ignores other possible variables**, like genetics,
social class, and more, treating a single and specific traumatic event
that happened during the subject's childhood as the causation of present
disorders. However, there is **no good evidence** of causal links
between specific, traumatic childhood experiences and disorders in adult
life \[35\]. Other stressing events that happen during an individual\'s
life are much more impactful than the infancy ones, and social
disadvantages could better explain the worse mental health outcomes of
these groups \[35\]. There is **no good evidence that remembering past
events would be a good route** to cure psychopathological symptoms,
despite it being the usual route of analysis \[14, p.
107]{.underline}\]. Even with all those disparities between scientific
data and the analytic view, those concepts are kept alive until the
present day.

#### 6\-\--Built-in Subterfuge

**Ferreira 21** (Clarice de Madeiros Chaves Ferreira - Vice-President of

MG)

**[Built-in subterfuge]{.underline}**

This item covers similar aspects to Popper's criticism. However, [it is
not the same as the falsifiability criterion,]{.underline} since [what
matters for falsifiability is the possibility of a given theory to be
proven false]{.underline}. For Popper, there is no such thing as
"confirmation" by induction. This item proposed by Hansson better
encompasses theory designs that are always confirming, or that can only
confirm the original hypothesis, in which alternative outcomes are not
possible. [About the topic, Rillaer \[36\] provides a group of examples
of why psychoanalysis **cannot be disconfirmed**, only continuously
confirmed. With it, **everything could be explained in the light of
unconscious processes**, and finding contrary evidence would be
**inconceivable**:]{.underline}

"Have you forgotten your umbrella in a friend\'s house? You want to come
back to his house. (...) Does he react badly to your interpretation? 'He
is defending himself', he is resisting to the 'id' that talks inside
him, 'without the ego noticing'. Does he criticize Freud or Lacan? He is
revolting against the Father. (...) Does your son fear horses? He fears
being castrated by his father because he desires his mother. Does your
analysis make you suffer more each day? You are finally entering the
deepest layers of your unconscious. Do the analyst\'s prices seem
excessive? You are having a 'negative transference' or a 'regression to
the analsadistic stage'. After five years of analysis, do you still feel
painful symptoms? You have not dug deep enough, you desire to suffer
because your superego is excessively strong" \[36, p. 154\].

A psychoanalyst could counterargue that this would be a case of wild
psychoanalysis, and within the clinical context they would not impose
interpretations, but instead would build them in a unique relationship
between therapist and client, reserved for the clinical environment
\[37\]. However, this does not refute the objection that [psychoanalysis
is a system that operates by those rules. It is not for the depth of the
dialogue or the time of interaction that it would happen
differently.]{.underline}

Boudry and Buekens \[38\] argue that [**psychoanalysis operates
similarly to a conspiracy theory**, in which criticism can always be
labeled as derived from resistance, and in the case of psychoanalysis,
it is an unconscious resistance. Not even a critic or patient's
rejection of the analytic explanations could be seen as a possible
counterexample: It would only be a major confirmation that unconscious
and unobservable processes are happening. Also, if they agree with the
offered interpretations, the explanation stays the same: It was a
process originated from the unconscious]{.underline}. In the end, when
dealing with the psychodynamic unconscious, there is no possibility to
accept contrary evidence. In relation to psychoanalysis, for all
circumstances "interpretation can be a weapon" \[39, p. 12\].

[Therefore, the excessive number of explanations that would fit all the
possible cases is **not really explicative**; it only seems to be. The
chosen interpretations to deal with the variety of human psychological
phenomena are **not based on good and carefully collected scientific
evidence**. Instead, those are concepts that **lack empirical support**,
used to explain every behavior and also its opposite]{.underline}.
\"Psychoanalysis is indeed irrefutable, because it can say everything
and its opposite --- summoning up the \'servile\' unconscious
testimonial is enough, as it is always ready to bow to the
circumstances' demands\" \[40, p. 140\].

#### 7\-\--Explanations are Abandoned without Replacement

**Ferreira 21** (Clarice de Madeiros Chaves Ferreira - Vice-President of

MG)

**[Explanations are abandoned without replacement]{.underline}**

[The definitions given to the concepts of \"cure\", \"health\" and
\"disease\" in psychoanalysis fit this criterion. Neves \[23\] says that
the discussion about the cure in contemporary psychoanalysis cannot
occur if it does not start with a **critique of the traditional meaning
of the term**, and the same goes for the other two
concepts]{.underline}. The author argues that psychoanalysis understands
that, according to medical point of view, which adopts the traditional
use of these, a state of health should refer to a harmonious state,
completely free of diseases and pathologies. In addition, unlike medical
objectives, Priszkulnik \[41\] states that \"psychoanalysis is opposed
to the objective of mental health to reintegrate the individual into the
social community\". Still according to Neves \[23\], psychoanalysts
understand that in medicine "cure" would mean conforming to an idealized
mode of operation based on ideas of normality that are socially accepted
and expected, starting from the elimination of diseases and the
reestablishment of the previously present health state. Or, more
succinctly, it would be \"the realization of an experience that leads
the individual to health through the elimination of the disease\" \[23,
p. 33\].

[Considering the traditional definition, psychoanalysis would **accuse
the existence of hidden intentions behind the goal of curing people in
distress**: this would, in reality, be an attempt to exert social
control \[23, p. 16\]. Therefore, it would make more sense to be
**helpless instead of cured**, since: "We must not forget that being
helpless, from both psychoanalytic and political points of view, means
to a large extent having crossed the ghost of infinite protection by the
instituted power. To be helpless (\...) is to sustain the political
action as an action that forces the impossible not to cease not writing
itself in the situation\" \[23, p. 28\].]{.underline}

[For some, like Nasio, it would **not even make sense to conceive
healing as a concept**:]{.underline}

["We cannot say that the cure, understood as a reduction or
disappearance of suffering linked to symptoms, is a psychoanalytic
concept. We also cannot say it is an objective towards which the
treatment should aim, or a criterion that allows us to evaluate its
progress (\...) we cannot make cure a concept, or an objective, or a
criterion, and that is equivalent to not giving in to the influence of
the medical model, which tends to hypostasize this cure, to give it a
status, to elevate it to the dignity of a concept (\...) there is **no
psychoanalytic concept of cure**, and that cannot be a goal that the
analyst should pursue in their practice, differently from how it happens
in medicine" \[42, p. 160\].]{.underline}

Even with these considerations, some proposals for new definitions were
supposedly made, in order to replace the traditional ones; however, they
are usually empty and worse than the previous ones. \"Health in
psychoanalysis can only be understood as a normativity that becomes
individualized, so it is impossible to think of it as the expression of
an absolute value, that is, of a general norm\" \[23, p. 28\]. It could
also be added the observation that \"it is true that psychoanalysis does
not take health as a constitutive element of its ethics and cure
policy\" \[43, p. 23\]. Regarding the definition of disease, we can
understand it in psychoanalysis as being \"a productive experience of
indeterminacy\" \[23, p. 18\], while also considering that \"the
disease, whether it be psychic or organic, does not mean anything other
than the reduction of the tolerance margin for changes in the
environment\" \[23, p. 28\]. In fact, they affirm that there is
something special within the field of disease: \"being sick is,
initially, assuming an identity with great performative force\" \[44, p.
293\], and the curative ideal \"aims to weaken the power that inhabits
the experiences of the pathological, the abnormal, the inhuman and of
helplessness\" \[23, p. 21\].

As for the cure, several options are offered in psychoanalysis. Some of
them are as follows: \"getting cured is, therefore, to build and
experience a new order, that is, the cure involves experiencing
unprecedented ways of adjusting to the environment\" \[23, p. 18\]. Or
also, "to carry out an experiment that is nowhere and cannot be
registered in the situation" \[23, p. 8\]. For psychoanalysts, \"the
cure in psychoanalytic experience can be defined, fundamentally, by the
idea of transformation, that is, the realization of a subjective
experience that is not the reestablishment of the norm nor the expected
result of performing a treatment method\" \[23, p. 84\]. Dunker and
Peron \[24, p. 89\] argue that the concept of cure can have different
interpretations based on Freud\'s work, in addition to not being related
to traditional medicine. One of them could be that the \"cure coincides
with the knowledge of the causes of the symptoms\" \[24, p. 86\]. In
Neves\'s \[23\] view, Freud and Lacan\'s works have as their legacy the
definition of cure as an experience that touches the impossible \[23, p.
25\]. According to Nasio "the cure is an imaginary value, an opinion, a
prejudice, a preconception, just as nature, happiness or justice are"
\[42, p. 160\]. Not only that, but according to the definitions given in
psychoanalysis, \"the cure as the realization of a singular experience
will not be identical to anything\" \[43, p. 24\]. In any case, it is
important to be aware of the fact that even if it is understood in these
ways adapted by the doctrine and even by Freud himself as a
"reorganization of the Ego", it remains as an ideal that is "harmful to
the analysis and to the psychoanalyst" \[42, p. 167\]: a therapist who
seeks the cure of his patient would possibly be under the influence of
feelings of pride and narcissism \[42, p. 168\]. Psychoanalysis, even
though it is treated as a psychotherapy, does not have curing as a goal
as seen in Lacan's words, quoted by Nasio:

[\"(\...) the mechanism (of analysis) is not oriented towards the cure
as a purpose. I am not saying anything that Freud has not already
powerfully formulated: every inflection towards the cure as a purpose
--- making the analysis a pure and simple means to a precise end ---
gives something that **would be linked to the shortest path which could
only falsify the analysis**\" \[42, p. 159\].]{.underline}

[For psychoanalysis, the definition of cure as an experience that leads
to health must be replaced by an experience that is nowhere, **does not
concern any possible situation**, has nothing to do with the objectives
proposed by a treatment, and is impossible. It would not be identical to
anything, and if it is not identical to anything, it could not even be
identical to itself, and that would constitute a logical contradiction.
In psychoanalysis, **the cure is imaginary, and even
harmful**]{.underline}. In the case of health, this would be an
individualized normativity that is not included in the ethical demands
of the doctrine. Meanwhile, attempts to treat illness are accused of
being attempts at social control, and influenced by narcissism and
pride. Diseases and pathologies could not, in psychoanalysis, be
considered as a deviation from the organic standard, but instead they
are classified as sources of some kind of renegade power, instead of
suffering. These concepts, in their many variations, are supposedly
presented as possible replacements for the traditional concepts of
\"cure\", \"health\" and \"disease\". However, [even though the
traditional definitions can be criticized and have gaps, the definitions
adopted in psychoanalysis make these concepts much more vague and
distant from reality than their original versions, with some of them to
a point where they **are no longer comprehensible**. This makes the new
proposal much less explanatory than the traditional one.]{.underline}

#### 8\-\--Obscurantism

**Ferreira 21** (Clarice de Madeiros Chaves Ferreira - Vice-President of

degree in psychology from FUMEC University and Scientific Initiation at
the Clinical Neuroscience Investigation Laboratory of the Federal
University of Minas Gerais, "Is psychoanalysis a pseudoscience?

MG)

**[Obscurantism]{.underline}**

[A lot could be said about the obscurantism problem, its relations with
pseudoscience, and its pertinence as a part of a
demarcation]{.underline} criteria. However, there is not a claim of
being exhaustive in this section, despite being offered the following
explanations for the introduction of this new item:

[Obscurantism is a communication style, commonly adopted by
pseudoscientists as a rhetorical strategy, that happens when the
presentation of the assertions or concepts in a theory is done in a
significantly imprecise way, **preventing an adequate comprehension of
its proposal.** This protects it from objections: Since its definitions
are excessively vague, it is **always possible to accuse the critic of
not comprehending** it, as well as alternating the definitions in order
to adopt or abandon its numerous meanings, using them respectively in
the most opportune moments.]{.underline}

An obscurantist text, despite appearing to bring a robust content about
a topic, in fact does not \[10\]. This seems relevant especially when
comparing it to the definition of pseudoscience: Similarly, in the
obscurantism case, an impression of scientificity is created when in
fact there is a considerable distance from science (in the broad sense).
For that reason, the introduction of this item seems justified.

[In some obscurantism cases, a series of claims are made, but in
reality, they are **proclaimed as phrases that lack truth value**, that
is, phrases that cannot be true or false]{.underline}. In others, even
if some meaning could be salvaged, an unclearness is imposed under their
real definition by the own author, preventing readers from tracing
precise or consensual interpretations about what they intended to say.
[This creates more difficulties for placing objections: It is harder to
criticize a position that one cannot adequately comprehend compared to
another that exposes its arguments explicitly and clearly]{.underline}.
Also, it is important to notice that, under many circumstances, concept
changes are welcome in science, but in order to do so, reasonable
justifications must be presented. This is not taken into account by the
obscurantist.

[In the case of psychoanalysis, some things have changed from Freud\'s
times to the present day, but despite not being many, they also were
**not adopted based on the emergence of good evidence**]{.underline}.
The great psychoanalytical theories of the present are still used,
adopted and taught without going through empirical testing \[14\],
showing that the [changes were **arbitrary** and probably aimed just to
**adapt to each age's cultural climate**. An example of this could be
the change in the pathological status regarding the sexual orientation
of gays and lesbians, as well as penis envy \[4\]. A]{.underline} theory
supposedly evolving and changing its concepts over time only has merits
if those changes are made based on good evidence, and not only by
cultural influence; after all, even religious movements change their
explanations about the world as the centuries go by, and this is no
reason to classify them as scientific.

Cioffi \[4\] points out that the etiological role of sexuality suffered
with an opportunistic change of meanings. Ideas about sexuality,
eroticism, and libido had their definitions chosen arbitrarily by Freud
according to the context: When questioned by the skeptic, they became
something that would represent fraternal love, affection, or in the case
of sexual drives they would be desires that could be satisfied by using
a variety of senses, including non-genital ones. Meanwhile, in safer and
more receptive environments, those conveniently change back to mean
\"sexual\" in the traditional sense.

["As psychoanalytic theory is **entirely empty,** it is also, at the
same time, supremely adaptable. When some concept of the theory shows to
be **hard to sustain**, or even **downright embarrassing** (...) it is
enough to silently abandon it and take a new **theoretical rabbit out of
the immense top hat of the unconscious**. This is what psychoanalysts
like to describe as the 'progress' of psychoanalysis (...).]{.underline}
What is given as progress in psychoanalysis is nothing but the ultimate
interpretation, that is, the most acceptable in a specific
institutional, historical or cultural context" \[40, p. 140-141\].

Buekens and Boudry \[10\] show that [Lacanian psychoanalysis is another
example of obscurantism. Lacan]{.underline} assumes that the unconscious
is structured as a language, and defends that his writings are
equivalent to the expression of his own unconscious. The adherence to an
obscurantist style is, therefore, justified from his point of view. In
this way, [any systematic effort to interpret him would be **destined to
fail,** and this immunizes the doctrine against any possible criticism.
Even if Lacan gave the impression of being an authority about human
psychology that would transmit his ideas through occult means, it would
be up to the reader to interpret him (in the countless ways of doing
so), while still being susceptible to possible accusations of not really
understanding him.]{.underline}

Buekens and Boudry \[10\] argue that since it is not possible to trace
definitive conclusions about what Lacan really meant to say, the only
thing left for the reader is to subjectively interpret him according to
their personal experience, what creates a significant divergence of
interpretations by the adepts themselves. The psychoanalyst not only
used an obscurantist language in his works, but also assumed and
defended its use explicitly:

["I would say that it is with a deliberate, if not entirely deliberate,
intention that I pursue this discourse in such a way as to **offer you
the opportunity to not quite understand**. This margin enables you
yourselves to say that you think you follow me, that is, that you remain
in a **problematic position**, which always leaves the door open to a
**progressive rectification**" \[45, p. 164\].]{.underline}

### 1ar falsifiability matters

#### Falsifiability matters -- treating psychoanalysis like it's not a pseudoscience is a dogmatic move that leads to scientific stagnation and prevents discipline development

This article pointed out that [psychoanalysis --- not only on its
classic, but also with its contemporary version]{.underline} --- ends up
checking all of the seven items in Hansson's multicriteria list. It also
fits the eighth item that was introduced in this work. So, in this way,
psychoanalysis [checks eight out of eight demarcation of
**pseudoscience's items**]{.underline}. The evidence presented in this
article suggests that with both Popper and Hansson's demarcation
proposals, and taking into account its traditional and contemporary
versions, [psychoanalysis is **indeed a pseudoscience**. Even if the
impression that it represents the most reliable human psychological
theory is created by its proponents, that is not the case, because it
considerably **deviates from scientific standards of
quality**]{.underline}.

Although research in psychoanalysis is widespread in Brazil, its
objections are not being discussed in the literature, and this may be an
indicator of alienation \[46\]. [The maintenance of a dogmatic approach
on a doctrine inserted in the academic environment is **dangerous**,
since it can lead to **scientific stagnation** and prevent the full
**development of its disciplines**, which in the case of psychoanalysis
are psychology and psychiatry]{.underline}. It is important to further
discuss criticisms of psychoanalysis, given that it is still treated as
one of the main theoretical and clinical models for the comprehension of
human behavior inside the academy. Even from an ethical perspective, it
is important to carry out practices and build theories that are
compatible with the best scientific evidence. [There is **no good moral
justification** for believing in whatever the theory, if it does not
have enough evidence in its favor \[47\].]{.underline}

### 2ac framework

#### Debating about policy is good, it's the only way to reflect upon personal boundaries and engage with contingency -- their model excludes that and causes dissatisfaction through thematizing politics

**Turnbull 05** (Nick Turnbull PhD -- Lecturer in Politics at the
University of Manchester, "Policy in question: from problem solving to
problematology", University of New South Wales, February 2005,
https://www.academia.edu/download/66798539/SOURCE02.pdf, MG)

[The key to moving beyond]{.underline} both positivism and [the
deconstruction of meaning is]{.underline} the foundation of questioning
and the concept of [the problematological answer. Politics is surely the
**sphere of debate** over the meaning of public problems and how to
solve them. If we disagree on a question, we **argue** about it, add to
it with other questions]{.underline}, ~~weaken~~ it, [and debate the
**pro and con of the possible answers**. A plurality of meanings means a
plurality of answers, which indicates contingency, but it is **not an
aporia**]{.underline} (an impassable obstruction to knowledge) (see
Derrida 1993). [It simply entails that meaning is in question.74 This
establishes rhetoric as a legitimate dimension of discourse because
problematological answers have an equal status, as answers, to
apocritical answers. Some questions **cannot be solved** beyond dispute
but they can be expressed and **then debated**]{.underline}. In fact, as
I pointed out in Chapter Four, there is no argumentation in
poststructuralism, because if signification were a free play of meaning
it would be impossible to indicate one answer to a question over another
(Meyer 1995: 238). Similarly, while Foucault depicts a figurative
picture of discourse (see Foucault 1970) he has no argumentation, which
perhaps accounts for the feeling that agency is absent in his work. [But
while we are 'prisoners' of language, defined by it in important ways,
we can **reflect upon our boundaries as well**, through questioning,
even if this is difficult. Knowledge has its own inertia because we
operate on the basis of presumed answers and so reality appears
continuous]{.underline} (Meyer 2000; see also Chapter Seven).
Nonetheless, it is also open to question and therefore we are not always
powerless. Even those working within an established discourse have to
continually reinforce its legitimating power, and therefore can escape
responsibility only by rhetorical means. Hence powerful elites have a
strategic interest in arguing for particular ways of framing problems.
Agency and structure are in reason, and we can understand both in terms
of questioning. Rationality is still possible, so our task should be to
reverse the fragmentary reductionism of science and the internal
fragmentation of radical poststructuralism but without reimposing the
problem solving model upon reality as the sole, unjustified criterion of
resolution. By drawing on Meyer's concept of problematological answers,
we can establish what is rational and what is irrational about politics
without judging it in scientific terms. This is essential if we are to
understand policymaking, which is multidisciplinary.

In political theory, where poststructuralism is enjoying contemporary
popularity, for example with Laclau and Mouffe (1985) and Zizek (1999),
[poststructuralists argue that politics emerges from the failure of
ontology to establish the conceptual closure of reason]{.underline}.
Laclau and Mouffe, for example, [identify the breakdown of
foundationalism with an appreciation of the contingency underlying
social relations as the source of politics, in contrast to scientific
utopianism which searches for an]{.underline} essence (1985: 142-3).
However, [if ontology is a failed approach to philosophy then **why**
**develop an alternative philosophy** based on this
failure?]{.underline} Meyer makes this criticism of Derrida by pointing
out that the concept of 'trace' of the subject actually reinstates
Cartesianism in a new guise, albeit one of radical negativity: 'Is it
not quite simply an insurmountable contradiction to want to declare the
death of Cartesianism, while in the same breath overcoming that death by
stating that the subject is a trace of itself?' (1995: 136). He [points
out a similar contradiction in Lacan's assertion that **the 'lack' of
reality is reality**, asking if this does not, in fact, reveal a
foundational problematicity that]{.underline} [defines]{.underline}
humanity (1995: 136-7). Robinson's (2004) review of several works
drawing on Lacanian theory, including books by Mouffe and Zizek, sums up
the problems of this approach to politics very well. He points out that
[Lacanian theorists work from **ontology rather than
politics**]{.underline} (2004: 261). [Instead of articulating
contingency, 'lack' is instead reified into an essence; a nihilistic,
fundamental negativity (2004: 259). This actually tends to **exclude
politics from theory** by essentialising negativity in exactly the same
way as the totalising theories they reject (2004: 268).]{.underline}

[We will not be able to theorise 'the political' adequately without
expressing the problematicity that defines it. Despite affirming
contingency as essential to reason, poststructuralist theories have
little to say about rhetoric. Instead, they speak of politics in terms
of the impossibility of reason (Zizek 1999) or as defined by antagonism
(Laclau and Mouffe 1985).]{.underline} Why should we speak of politics
in such radical terms? When we are faced with contingency we resort to
persuasion in order to reach a solution. However, poststructuralists
barely speak ofrhetoric in its traditional sense as 'persuasion' because
the theory derives from the idea that literal discourse is only possible
by repressing other meanings. Yet [we know that policy, for example,
does effectively make pronouncements that **function at a literal
level**, **no matter what symbolic meaning might be attributed to
it;**]{.underline} a bus timetable, for example. [Politics deals with
contingency, yet it does reach answers despite this]{.underline}. Hence
poststructuralism seems only to apply to cases of radical social
disjuncture or, on the other hand, to define everything that makes sense
as authoritarian. [Apart from the fundamental **dissatisfaction we feel
about a theory that thematises politics** in only a negative light, such
a theory does not help us conclude anything about policy, which deals
with answers as much as questions.]{.underline}

#### Problem solving is good, it's the only way to express identity and establish a foundation for knowledge -- their theory is reductionist, paradoxically replicates the shortcomings of ontology, and crowds out politics

**Turnbull 05** (Nick Turnbull PhD -- Lecturer in Politics at the
University of Manchester, "Policy in question: from problem solving to
problematology", University of New South Wales, February 2005,
https://www.academia.edu/download/66798539/SOURCE02.pdf, MG)

[If poststructuralism has a critical value it is because it
**questions** established theory]{.underline} and therefore has at least
questioning as a fundamental property [(even if it does not affirm this,
because it affirms nothing), which indicates that it is possible to
answer. Policymaking involves **posing questi**ons and **settling upon
answers**]{.underline}. Hence, we cannot understand it without a
philosophical framework that accounts for both questioning and
answering. Dewey's practical orientation is something to hold on to
because [policymaking does seek **practical solutions**. Political
reasoning is **not necessarily irrational**, even if it can be when
people employ irrational discourse to their own political
advantage.]{.underline}

[Radical postmodernism or poststructuralism is **not sufficient for
understanding policymaking** not just because it is abstract,
nonpractical philosophy, but because it actually rejects
philosophy]{.underline}. In this sense, it has much in common with
positivism even though they are quite different. This is Meyer's view of
these two streams of twentieth century thought, and in their rejection
of questioning he identifies a common thread (1994: 44). Science
restricts rationality by rejecting philosophy in favour of solving
problems empirically; [nihilism (poststructuralism) rejects philosophy
by saying that we have only questions, while failing to thematise this
as positive, therefore rejecting rationality along with it. At the same
time, it paradoxically **replicates the shortcomings of ontology** in
rejecting it. Problematology is opposed to both of these.]{.underline}
Meyer thematises the nature of philosophy as questioning and therefore
contemporary problematicity is the condition for the restoration of
philosophy, not its renewed rejection.

I would point out that references to questioning are everywhere in
discussions of postmodernity and postmodernism. For example, Smart
describes postmodernity as the period in which the values of Western
civilisation are 'justifiably in question', as that which 'called into
question or subjected to doubt' modern ideas of progress (1993: 26, 28).
He cites Giddens' description of a generalised problematicity across
society, and not just of philosophy, when he noted that ['we
increasingly find ourselves "left with questions where once there
appeared to be answers"' (1993: 35). It is in the very nature of
modernity to generate the radically reflexive questioning that now
encompasses modernity itself]{.underline}, says Zygmunt Bauman, who
describes the postmodern social condition as 'an incessant flow of
reflexivity' that produces 'institutionalized pluralism, variety,
contingency and ambivalence' (1992: 149). Not dissimilarly, Lyotard
stated that postmodernity is in fact a consequence of the modernist
drive to question its own presuppositions (1984: 79). And Beck argues
that the pervasive 'doubt' that has arisen around the project of
modernity could provide the basis for a new ethics, modern identity and
social contract (1997: 162). One could find many references to
questioning elsewhere. So, [although Western thought has always put
things into question, what is new is the generalised reflexive
questioning of postmodernity and the lack of new answers.]{.underline}

[In postmodernity, questioning is not just a social condition but even
extends to questioning the foundations of thought itself]{.underline}.
Despite the differences between theorists described as postmodernists,
they share in common the view that metaphysics is at an end. Along with
[**Lyotard**, Baudrillard, Derrida, Foucault, **Lacan**, Fish, and Rorty
have all attacked foundational philosophy]{.underline}. The general view
is that the foundation of knowledge has been called into question and no
new metaphysics will ever be constructed. **[One would think
philosophers had given up]{.underline}.** In the postmodern critique we
see the fragmentation of thought from within, of logical difference
itself, which becomes marked by a 'trace' or a 'lack'. This confusion is
reflected in the uncertainty about the nature of postmodernism itself,
which Smart says seems to bemore a series of questions than a definitive
concept (1993: 12). Thus Lyotard's 'answer' to the question of the
postmodern is 'that which, in the modern, puts forward the unpresentable
in presentation itself' (1984: 81). Postmodernism, then, is the
non-closure of reason, the irrational without which the rational could
not exist.

How might we understand postmodernity in a more rational way? If the
postmodern condition is a situation of generalised questioning,
shouldn't this draw our attention to questioning itself? Indeed, what is
Lyotard's 'incredulity toward metanarratives' (1984: xxiv) if not an
affirmation of questioning as a primary stance? Despite this,
[postmodern thinkers have not considered questioning for itself. In
fact, questioning has received very little attention at all in
philosophy, which has always questioned in practice even though it has
never been its central]{.underline} theme (Meyer 1995: 6). Philosophers
in the twentieth century did pay more attention to questioning, for
example, to understand meaning (Collingwood 1939, 1962; Gadamer 1979),
logic (Hintikka 1999) and politics (Castoriadis 1991). But while these
thinkers valued questioning, they did so in only a limited way. This is
because philosophy focused on answering, via ontology, and displaced
questioning to a cognitive, rhetorical role.

Despite the title of [Lyotard's]{.underline} paper, 'Answering the
question: what is the postmodern?', he [could not answer satisfactorily
because he **did not recognise the value of questioning in his own
critique**. Because he could not adequately thematise questioning or
answering, postmodern theory became that which paradoxically expresses
progress as the impossibility and undesirability of progress.
Postmodernity is different from modernity, but it also cannot be
different, because difference itself has fragmented]{.underline}.
Postmodernism neither is nor isn't because identity is non-identical
with itself; knowledge fragments from within and the cohesion of reason
collapses. Under these terms conceptual confusion and a lack of meaning
indicate success. But why should we accept this contradiction and mirror
the fragmentation of thought (Meyer 1995: 3), now conceived of as
positive, all the while denying its positivity because such an
affirmation is impossible? Meyer makes the contradiction clear; '...how
can we put as our guiding principle the negation of all guiding
principles?' (Meyer 1995: 3)

Is problematicity really unpresentable? The confusion over the nature of
postmodernity is a natural result of the failure to thematise
questioning as constitutive of reason. If we consider postmodernity in
terms of questioning, postmodernity is the generalised questioning of
modernity and problematology is the only sufficient response to
historical problematisation. Postmodernity emerges from modernity as a
problematological response to modernity's questioning of itself,
modifying the past without completely dissolving it in the answer.

W[ith a rational account of postmodernity as questioning,
poststructuralism and postmodernism are **firmly behind us**, this time
philosophically so, a stop on the path to questioning that has been
superseded by it (Meyer 2001a). Problematology explicates questioning
and establishes a **foundation for knowledge** that also permits us to
describe contemporary problematicity. Problematology is a new
metaphysics to replace ontology]{.underline}. Meyer has created a new
logic and terminology that expresses the problematicity of
postmodernity, a necessary quality for a successful systematic study of
contemporary society (see Bauman 1992: 161). [If identity has
fragmented, then it has become a question that cannot be conclusively
resolved because it expresses several alternative possible answers at
the same time, hence it is rhetorical. The decentering of the subject
makes of us 'an irreducible problem, one for which the only answer, far
from suppressing the question, reproduces it endlessly']{.underline}
(Meyer 1995: 303; see also Castoriadis on identity as a 'puzzle' 1991:
170-1). In postmodernity, our answer to the question of identity is
always problematological, and therefore always in question as much as it
provides an answer. [With increased questioning comes politics and so
political processes operate from, and contribute to, the production of
individual and collective identities. Policymaking is also a part of
this questioning and produces social identity and difference as much as
solving practical problems.]{.underline}

#### Only effective discursive stewardship and technological power prevents the rogue usage of nuclear weapons -- this turns and outweighs the K and proves the permutation is possible and desirable.

Now [this contrasts with the argument of those who would \"reinvent
government\" by putting up bureaucratic roadblocks to maintaining the
reliability of the US nuclear arsenal through research and
testing]{.underline}. [They reason that if the reliability of
everyone\'s nuclear arsenals declines, everyone will be less likely to
try using them]{.underline}. The problem is that some
\"adventurer-conqueror\" may arise and use everyone\'s doubt about their
arsenals to risk massive conventional war instead. A[n expansionist
[dictatorship might]{.mark} even [risk nuclear war with weapons]{.mark}
that are simpler, cruder, less powerful, much riskier (in terms of the
possibility of accidental detonation) but much more reliable than **our
own may eventually become without adequate \"stockpile
stewardship.\"\[**]{.underline}14\] But **[the inhibitory effect of
reliable nuclear weapons goes deeper than Shirer\'s deterrence of
adventurer-conquerors]{.underline}**. **[It changes the way we think
individually and culturally, [preparing us for a future we cannot now
imagine]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Jungian psychiatrist Anthony J. Stevens
states, \[15\] \"H[istory would indicate that people cannot rise above
their narrow sectarian concerns without some overwhelming paroxysm. It
took the War of Independence and the Civil War to forge the United
States, World War I to create the League of Nations, World War II to

view]{.underline}. Or [what about fear]{.underline}? **[[Can the
horror]{.mark} [which we all experience when we contemplate]{.mark} the

option]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Perhaps [horror, the experience of
horror, [the consciousness of horror, **is our only
hope**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps [horror alone will enable us to
overcome the otherwise invincible attraction of war]{.underline}.\" Thus
[I also continue engaging in nuclear weapons work to help fire that
world-historical warning shot I mentioned above, namely, that as our
beneficial technologies become more powerful, so will our weapons
technologies, unless genuine peace precludes it]{.underline}. **[We must
build a future more peaceful than our past]{.underline}**, **[if we are
to have a future at all]{.underline}**, with or without nuclear weapons
--- a fact we had better learn before worse things than nuclear weapons
are invented. [If you\'re a philosopher, this means that I regard the
nature of humankind as mutable rather than fixed, but that I think most
people welcome change in their personalities and cultures with all the
enthusiasm that they welcome death]{.underline} --- thus, **[the [fear
of nuclear annihilation of ourselves]{.mark} and all our values [may be
what we require in order to become peaceful enough to survive]{.mark}
our [future tech]{.mark}nological breakthroughs]{.underline}**.\[16\]

#### Their criticism of nukespeak fails -- its nostalgia for a utopian world beyond language with authentic relationships to nuclear weapons merely feeds the fantasy of nuclear control they claim to resolve. Instead, a subtle struggle over the power of the meaning of nuclear weapons through our Foucaultien approach solves better.

Colorado State University, Knowing Nukes: The Politics and Culture of

From the nuclear critic\'s perspective, nuclear opponents unnecessarily
constrain themselves when they adopt a first political assumption that
is misleading and has not been subjected to the same reflection reserved
for the other terms of the debate. [The [**claim that nukes are
\"unspeakable\"** appears as]{.mark} an intolerable oppression, [a
**paternalistic admonition** to \"be quiet\"]{.mark} that outdistances
(and silences) all such preceding calls]{.underline}. In carry- ing as
well the injunction that we not speak about that which can only be
spoken, this presumption deepens the paradoxes of nukes. There must be a
reason we \"cannot speak,\" and there is. [To speak is to reveal a
paradox nuclear politics must repress]{.underline}. [We can begin to see
the awkward, reversed influence of this repression **when we consider
the one activity by which nuclear opponents have been attentive to
language**---**their focus on interpretations of
\"nukespeak.\"**]{.underline}53 [[Nukespeak actually stands for
**a**]{.mark} **simple [critique of euphemism]{.mark}**]{.underline};
**[the problem is that [this simplicity leads away from the rest of the
critique]{.mark} offered by opponents ---it is inverted]{.underline}**.
**[The nukespeak argument imagines a world, just before this one, which
had no technocratic euphemisms and no evasive verbs and
nouns]{.underline}**. **[Somehow, this was a world without language
games, without genres of political speech, where words \"meant\" some-
thing explicit]{.underline}**. **[That world ---presumably the one that
Einstein argued the nuke inalterably changed ---sits invitingly just
outside our grasp, recover- able if only we would resolutely call things
by their real names]{.underline}**. [The [nukespeak argument conforms
to]{.mark}]{.underline} Baudrillard\'s \"**[[nostalgia for the
real]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" **[[There can be no reconstructive
politics based on]{.mark} [eradicating euphemism]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[The artifacts and practices of nuclearism **have no honest, real
meanings**]{.underline}. **[[There is no straightforward]{.mark} [name
for a]{.mark} protective reaction [strike]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[To
call it a bombing]{.mark} run [trivializes it]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[To call it genocide]{.mark} (or eco- cide) [conflates it with]{.mark}
phenomena ---such as [the Holocaust]{.mark} ---that we would rather keep
separate, for good reasons]{.underline}. **[And so on]{.underline}**.
**[The activities of nuclearism are encased in a context so thoroughly
bound to its discourse ---technologized, simulated, and then turned into
spectacle --- that any attempt to speak simple truth could only be
another part of the simulation]{.underline}**. This is where nuclear
criticism draws the line between itself and the liberal critics of
modern society, from Orwell on to the present. Either Einstein was right
and the world was irretrievably changed, or he was wrong and it can be
returned to a prior condition of innocence, where things had \"real\"
names. While the nukespeak argument suggests that these things are
nameable, the nuclear critic responds that the nuke has already been
actively reshaping situations. Indeed, that insight on the activism of
nukespeak has been available for some time now. It was Marcuse who
showed how contemporary nuclear discourse is not simple misleading, but
is a manip- ulation that has its own syntax and grammar. Nuclear
criticism might disagree with Marcuse\'s (and, later and more
explicitly, Habermas\'s) pre- sumption that a clearer language game
would be closer to truth. Still, we can note that Marcuse identified the
discursive component of nuclear- ism\'s authority. The forms Marcuse
finds all share a pattern, constructing an inverted universe in which
absurdity and danger serve security and trust. In one important example,
Marcuse deconstructs Edward Teller\'s oft- repeated, unofficial title,
\"the father of the H-Bomb,\" showing how this highly improbable
combination is powerfully useful for discipline: Terms designating quite
different spheres or qualities are forced together into a solid,
overpowering whole. The effect is \... a magical and hypnotic one ---the
projection of images which convey irresistible unity, harmony of
contradictions. Thus the loved and feared Father, the spender of life,
generates the H-bomb for the annihilation of life.54 The cleverness (or,
for Marcuse, the cunning) of such formulations belies the hope that
clarity could solve matters. **[The simplest [nukespeak commentaries ask
the]{.mark} [wrong question when they argue that matters would be more
obvious if terminology were less
euphemistic]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [At a certain point---**in
Utopian remove from the realm of knowledge and power** ---that would be
the case]{.underline}. But [the better question is slightly different.
We could ask, What sort of an authoritative logic would behave this
way]{.underline}? [Founding strength on deterrence, then announcing the
unspeakability of its topic, then pro- ducing a discourse that flaunts
contradiction and turns it into unity and safety, nukespeak is more than
euphemism]{.underline}. [It turns ecstatic]{.underline}. An oppositional
politics, fully capable of problematizing this (hyper-) exuberant
nuclearism, is possible on bases other than such suspect cate- gories as
euphemism, survival, unspeakability, and numbing. Through- out this
book, I am trying to reposition antinuclearism within such a defensible
political practice. At the very least, this implies an intellectual
project; to paraphrase Foucault, [there is a struggle over issues of
knowledge, set off by nuclear criticism]{.underline}. The political mood
of the language-and-politics position is well framed by nuclear
criticism. More precisely, [a political mood could yet form, one that
would contrast sharply with an existing nuclear opposition that, in the
United States, has adopted a paradoxical structure, **as if driven to
mirror the paradoxes of nukes themselves**]{.underline}. [[Antinuke
talk]{.mark} has been ponderous ---so responsible and serious that it
just obviously [defeats itself,]{.mark} and must invent the defense that
\"people really don\'t like to talk about nuclear war very
much]{.underline}.\" **[Paradoxically, opponents then test that
humorlessness by asking citizens to become independent entrepreneurs of
risk, weighing the likelihood and amplitude of possible disasters. It
[should not be surprising that such a politics works]{.mark} only
[intermittently, if at all.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[The pragmatist feminist perspective]{.underline} that I develop in this
chapter is deeply indebted to and [affirms in many respects [the]{.mark}
antiwar feminist [approach]{.mark}]{.underline} outlined
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} Carol **[[Cohn and]{.underline}]{.mark}** Sara
**[[Ruddick]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the preceding chapter, [but with
**some marked differences**. These differences]{.underline}, I argue,
[[reveal]{.underline}]{.mark} more completely both the promise and
[**the [limitations]{.mark}** [of antiwar feminism]{.mark}]{.underline}.
At the outset, it is important to note that there is neither a single
\"feminism\" nor a single \"pragmatism\" with which it might be aligned.
Instead, there are multiple feminisms, just as there are multiple
pragmatisms. [The \"[pragmatist feminism]{.mark}\" developed in this
essay [draws on]{.mark} several [elements from American
Pragmatism]{.mark}]{.underline}, a philosophical school developed in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, most prominently by
Charles Peirce, William James, John Dewey, and George Herbert Mead.
Despite the many differences among the pragmatists, [they]{.underline}
tend to [share several features]{.underline}. Perhaps [most
salient]{.underline} to the subject of this volume [is their
presumption]{.underline} [\"that human agency]{.underline} in all of its
higher manifestations [has evolved from \... concrete circumstances in
which a vulnerable organism is confronted]{.underline}, often (if not
usually) in concert with other organisms of the same species, [with
possibilities of both injury and fulfillment]{.underline}.\"\' It is
[the continuous reminder of \"human fallibility and
finitude]{.underline}\"\' that **[constrains pragmatists]{.underline}**
from positions such as foundationalism and dogmatism and thus
[**against** ideologies that encourage the use of armed
force]{.underline}, and especially of WMD, [in all but the most extreme
circumstances. It is also a reminder that armed conflicts are composed
of embodied human beings]{.underline}, **[each of whom has the capacity
for suffering]{.underline}** as well as happiness, a point stressed by
feminist analyses of armed conflicts. There are several significant
points of commonality or intersection between pragmatism and feminism.3
Perhaps most important for thinking about the ethics of weapons of mass
destruction is that both are actively engaged in attempting to solve
social problems. The early pragmatists viewed the purpose of
philosophical reflection to be \"the intelligent overcoming of
oppressive conditions.\" Dewey, for example, recommended the criticism
of beliefs underlying society that have led to \"unsatisfactory
conditions in order to radically reconstruct our society according to
non-oppressive and cooperative standards.\"5 [[Feminist goals of
liberating women from oppression]{.underline}]{.mark} thus **[[echo
pragmatist ones]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While most often feminist
movements have been focused specifically on ending the male domination
and oppression of women, [a more inclusive feminist vision has as its
object the elimination of all hierarchical and oppressive
relationships]{.underline}, including the oppression of so-called third
world or developing nations (especially of the Global South) by those of
the so-called first world or industrialized nations (especially of the
Global North), of ethnic, cultural, racial, or religious minorities by
majorities, homosexuals by heterosexuals, the poor by the wealthy,
children by adults, and so on. In addition, [pragmatists advocate the
elimination of sharp divisions between theory and practice, reason and
experience, and knowing and doing]{.underline}.8 [[Pragmatists **focus
much more on consequences**]{.mark} rather [than]{.mark} on [a
priori]{.mark} abstract [conceptualizing]{.mark}]{.underline}, captured
in the phrase that pragmatists assign value on the basis of \"what
works\" or what provides \"emotional satisfaction.\"9 From a pragmatist
perspective, the most important questions are practical ones.
[[Pragmatists consider moral agents]{.mark} to be **actors [within a
concrete]{.mark} particular [context]{.mark}** that both influences what
is experienced and is influenced by those experiences]{.underline}. The
inextricability of the perceiver from what is perceived means that
[**[action]{.mark}**, whether [in the context of armed conflict]{.mark}
and the use of WMD or otherwise,]{.underline} [**[must be situated
within]{.mark} the larger [context]{.mark}** of which it is a
part]{.underline}. [Since every decision to enter or engage in an armed
conflict]{.underline} and every decision to deploy WMD, of whatever
type, [must be considered within the full context of **other relevant
actors, agencies, and term strategies or results**]{.underline},12 [[a
pragmatist perspective is **unlikely** to result in the]{.mark} kind of
[abstract thinking that antiwar feminism criticizes in dominant]{.mark}
just war and [realist approaches]{.mark}]{.underline}.13 Feminism also
shares pragmatism\'s rejection of traditional rationalist and empiricist
approaches and its commitment to the inseparability of theory and
practice.14 Both believe that reason must be grounded in experience and
requires being supplemented, at least in particular circumstances, by
emotion.15 In this respect, feminists also favor a posteriori rather
than a priori forms of knowledge, those that develop on the basis of
experience rather than those that are posited prior to it.16 In sum,
[both pragmatism and feminism accord a central place to the particular,
the concrete, and the factual elements of experience, as opposed to the
universal, the generalizable, and the abstract]{.underline}.17 This
opposition to abstraction is apparent, for example, in feminist
understandings of women\'s \"different voice\" and Dewey\'s views about
the importance of the qualitative background of situations. In contrast
to mainstream philosophy, both feminist and pragmatist perspectives
focus on everyday life and emphasize respect for others and the
constitutiveness of community. [The pragmatists\' sensitivity to the
social embeddedness of persons led them to understand the \"I\" \"only
in relation to other selves, so that the autonomy of individual agents
needed to be integrated with their status as social beings\" existing in
community]{.underline}. 18 [This common conception of the \"relational
self\" suggests that both [pragmatists]{.mark} and feminists will
[resist turning others into \"the Other,\" who can then be demonized
and]{.mark} made into \"the enemy,\" suitable to be
[killed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The feminist commitment to the well-being
of others, in both the local and the global community, is]{.underline}
well [illustrated by]{.underline} Carol [Cohn\'s and]{.underline} Sara
[Ruddick\'s contribution]{.underline} to this volume. However, [this
commitment also provides the basis for [the pragmatist feminist
position]{.mark} articulated here that **[refuses to categorically rule
out the moral legitimacy of any resort to armed force]{.mark} or war**,
[since such resort may be **morally imperative to protect innocent
others**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition to these marked similarities,
it is also important to acknowledge how a pragmatist feminism differs
significantly from American Pragmatism. Perhaps most important is
pragmatist feminism\'s attention to the gendered character of the social
world and gender\'s impact on the formation and maintenance of male and
female identities. These subjects largely were ignored by the American
Pragmatists19 but influence the analysis of the ethics of WMD outlined
here. In addition, feminists tend to give greater import to the
cognitive aspects of affect than pragmatists, even though, as already
discussed, pragmatists recognize the importance of emotions to agency
and cognition. Despite its differences from more mainstream strands of
feminism, [[pragmatist feminism shares the goals]{.mark} of many strands
of feminism [to **make gender a central consideration**]{.mark} **of the
analysis**]{.underline} (here of armed force and WMD)20 [[and]{.mark} to
[eradicate (patriarchal) oppression]{.mark} and domination]{.underline}.
[[These goals result in]{.mark} a **[strong presumption against]{.mark}
the [use of]{.mark} any [weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not only WMD,
[since they are in their very inception designed as tools for domination
and suppression of others designated as \"the enemy]{.underline}.\"
[[This]{.mark} opposition to the use of armed force [is related to
feminist observations of the patriarchal]{.mark} and hierarchical,
[male-dominated]{.mark} and -controlled [character of the military and
the oppressive effects of war and militarism]{.mark}]{.underline} around
the world, [especially on women]{.underline} and children. In addition,
the pragmatist feminist view described here affirms much in the
\"constitutive positions\" of antiwar feminism articulated by Cohn and
Ruddick,21 especially its observation of the gendered character of war
and militarism, its suspicion of masculinist approaches to war and
conflict resolution, and its critique of the dominant tradition for its
focus on the physical, military, and strategic effects of these weapons
separate from their embeddedness in the rest of social and political
life. With this brief overview in mind, in the following section, I
describe how a pragmatist feminist perspective compares with the antiwar
feminist position outlined by Cohn and Ruddick in Chapter 21 with
respect to the specific issues addressed by this volume. SOURCES AND
PRINCIPLES Although pragmatist feminism itself does not directly provide
general norms governing the use of weapons in war, it does so indirectly
through its affirmation of elements of justwar theory, as described
below. [[Pragmatist feminism **does not categorically rule out the use
of armed force**]{.mark} or engagement in war]{.underline}. [Its
pragmatist perspective steers in a different direction from the antiwar
feminists\' \"practical\" opposition to war]{.underline}. Whereas the
realist tradition has been unduly pessimistic in its assumption that war
and armed conflict are necessary, certain, and inevitable, on a
pragmatist feminist view, [[antiwar feminist thinking tends to
be]{.underline} [**unduly optimistic** about the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[human [capacity to transcend]{.mark} the use of [violent
methods]{.mark} of resolving disputes]{.underline}, given the consistent
and continual resort to such means throughout most of human history.
[From a pragmatist feminist perspective]{.underline}, the
[[historical]{.mark} and contemporary [experience of]{.mark} the
[repeated resort to violence and]{.mark} the [inability]{.mark} of
humanity]{.underline} thus far [[to develop alternative
mechanisms]{.mark} for resolving large-scale disputes [suggests the
likelihood of future]{.mark}]{.underline} wars and [[armed
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}. In light of this history,
[**[overcoming]{.mark} the \"[war culture]{.mark}**\" that antiwar
feminists view so unfavorably [can be possible **only outside the
immediate situation of armed conflict**. Once the aggressor has struck
or threatens to]{.mark} do so imminently]{.underline}, **[[it is too
late to change our societies and ourselves]{.mark} in order [to avoid
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Rather, [[it is]{.mark} then [necessary to
act]{.mark} in order [to **avoid annihilation**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
one form or another. Given its view that some wars and some opposition
to war and armed conflicts are morally necessary to protect ourselves
and others from harm, pragmatist feminists seek to impose moral limits
on the harm and suffering to the minimum necessary. Despite an awareness
of its limitations,22 a pragmatist feminist perspective considers just
war theory to provide a flexible and modifiable set of criteria for
attempting to act morally and in accordance with principles of justice,
both in entering into an armed conflict (jus ad bellum) and in the
actual engagement of that conflict (jus in bello). In particular,
pragmatist feminism shares just war\'s starting premise of a strong
presumption against the legitimacy of the use of armed force and
violence to resolve conflicts. [[A pragmatist feminist
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [**[rejects Cohn\'s and Ruddick\'s
contention]{.mark}** that justwar [theorists]{.mark}]{.underline}
\"implicitly **[[accept war as a practice even when condemning
particular wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"23 [[Recognizing the]{.mark}
historical and global [reality of war]{.mark}]{.underline} making and
armed force [as means of resolving conflicts [and **adopting strategies
to**]{.mark} **maximize justice and [minimize immorality]{.mark}** [when
such means are adopted **is not the same as**]{.mark} **\"implicitly
[accepting the practices of war]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" at least [in
the absence of **demonstrably effective means of eliminating such
conflicts**. [To ignore the reality of]{.mark} the [continuing resort to
war]{.mark}]{.underline} and armed force [[is]{.mark} itself [to revert
to **abstraction** **rather than**]{.mark} offering **[a practical
method for eliminating]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[human
[suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}** and incalculable damage [caused by
war]{.underline} and armed conflict. Here [Colin and Ruddick
reveal]{.underline} (intentionally or otherwise) [their situatedness as
citizens of a war-making state]{.underline}, one that has had the choice
in many, if not all, instances since the mid-twentieth century, at
least, of deciding whether or not to go to war. [Just as [Cohn and
Ruddick]{.mark} criticize just war theory]{.underline} for failing to
explore nonviolent alternatives once a just cause is determined or war
has begun, [**their [antiwar feminist approach fails to offer concrete
suggestions for avoiding armed conflict]{.mark}** when a
nation]{.underline} or people [is confronted with armed aggression or
assault by others]{.underline}, the situation [where the options boil
down to \"**fight or die**.\" [This perspective **fails to look at war
from the point of view of the aggressed-against**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[when]{.underline}]{.mark} [armed [conflict becomes a
necessity]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to retain national and/or
cultural and/or ethnic identity from subjugation by the aggressor(s).
[In such circumstances, the moral necessity of armed force looks quite
different]{.underline}. And in such circumstances, [the [**threatened**
use of WMD can be]{.mark} seen as **[less evil than]{.mark}** the
**[alternatives]{.mark}**, such as **[doing
nothing]{.mark}**]{.underline} and being conquered **[[or fighting
a]{.mark} conventional [war and faring poorly]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Rather than reverting to abstract thinking about war, pragmatist
feminism affirms just war theory\'s casuistic approach to particular
armed conflicts as well as its position that such means are sometimes
morally justifiable or even morally obligator)\' in order to protect
oneself (individual or nation) or innocent third parties. Further,
[[pragmatist feminism affirms]{.underline}]{.mark} just war thinking\'s
[[**attention to particular conflicts rather than war in the abstract**
and]{.mark} its stance of moderation and of **[imposing]{.mark}** the
**[minimal suffering]{.mark}**]{.underline} necessary to accomplish the
objective of restoring the peace.24 Thus, with respect to the military
response of the United States to the September 11 terrorist attacks, a
pragmatist feminist application of just war criteria yields the
conclusion that the jus ad bellum principles of \"last resort\" and
\"proportionality,\" as well as the in hello principles of
\"proportionality\" and \"discrimination,\" were not satisfied. [A
second [difference]{.mark}]{.underline} in the two feminist perspectives
[[emerges out of the]{.mark} antiwar feminist [observation]{.mark} that
[war and militarism are not separate from everyday
life]{.mark}]{.underline} but integral aspects of it.25 [While
[this]{.mark} is]{.underline} an extremely [important]{.underline}
insight into the underlying conditions of war and militarism, [it [needs
to be joined with]{.mark} **alternative [proposals for
addressing]{.mark} the [\"large-scale military conflict]{.mark}**[.\"
There has been scant attention to this]{.mark} issue [in antiwar
feminist scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Even if one
assumes]{.underline}]{.mark}, as antiwar feminists do, [that [war is a
\"presence\" in everyday life]{.mark} and not merely a discrete
\"event\"]{.underline} that occasionally \"erupts,\"26 [[it is]{.mark}
nonetheless [the case that \"**war\" is more damaging and harmful, and
creates greater suffering in a multiplicity of ways**]{.mark}, than the
absence of war. [Pragmatist feminist thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} about
the ethics of WMD [[is **attentive to how such differences in
consequences** differentiate war from "everyday
life]{.underline}]{.mark}." A third significant area of difference
between the two types of feminist theories concerns responses to the
causes of war. Whereas pragmatist feminists agree with antiwar feminists
that wars are partially a mutual construction, they also insist that
some wars have much more to do with unjust aggression for which opposing
sides do not share equal responsibility. Antiwar feminism fails to
accept that some wars are not only necessary as a matter of prudence,
but also morally justifiable *on feminist grounds*, for example,
humanitarian intervention to end the severe oppression of innocent
victims. [[For a pragmatist feminist]{.mark}, the [current]{.mark} state
of [international affairs]{.mark}]{.underline} unfortunately
[[**requires** consideration of the circumstances in which the
**threatened**]{.underline}]{.mark} or actual [**[use of]{.mark} such
[weapons for]{.mark} defensive or [deterrent purposes]{.mark}** [may
be]{.mark}]{.underline} morally allowable or even **[[morally
necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Given these circumstances, pragmatist
feminism considers the just war tradition to provide a morally useful
source of norms relating to the use of weapons in war.

#### Zero empirical correlation between innate drives or social institutions and war -- the only way to prevent conflict empirically is to look at the specific decision calculus of national leaders

[While classical liberals focused on political structures, socialists
analyzed the socioeconomic system of states as the primary factor in
determining the propensity of states to engage in war.]{.underline}
Socialists such as Karl Marx attributed war to the class structure of
society; Marx believed that war resulted from a clash of social forces
created by a capitalist mode of production that develops two
antagonistic classes, rather than being an instrument of state policy.
Thus capitalist states would engage in war because of their growing
needs for raw materials, markets, and cheap labor. Socialists believed
replacing capitalism with socialism could prevent war, but world events
have proven socialists wrong as well. 32 [These two schools of
thought---[war is caused by]{.mark} innate [biological drives or social
institutions---do not demonstrate any meaningful correlation
with]{.mark} the [occurrence]{.mark} or nonoccurrence [of war. There are
many variables not considered]{.mark}]{.underline} by these two schools:
[for example, the influence of national [special interest groups]{.mark}

victory, greater [resources]{.mark}, greater [domestic political
power]{.mark}, or justification for their existence.]{.underline} Legal

studies of]{.mark} the nature of [war]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} 33
[[and concludes]{.mark} that [there "is no single cause]{.mark} of
war.]{.underline}" 34 In A Study of War, h[e concludes that [peace is an
equilibrium of]{.mark} four complex factors: military and industrial
[technology]{.mark}, international [law]{.mark} governing the resort to
war, social and [political organization]{.mark} at the domestic and
international level, [and]{.mark} the distribution of [attitudes]{.mark}
and opinions concerning basic values]{.underline}. War is likely when
controls on any one level are disturbed or changed. 35 Similarly, the
1997 US National Military Strategy identifies the root causes of
conflict as political, economic, social, and legal conditions. 36
[[Moore has compiled the following]{.mark} list of conventional
[explanations for war: specific disputes]{.mark}; absence of dispute
[settlement mechanisms; ideological disputes; ethnic]{.mark} and
religious [differences; communication]{.mark} failures;
[proliferation]{.mark} of weapons and arms races; social and economic
[injustice; imbalance of power]{.mark}; competition for
[resources]{.mark}; incidents, [accidents]{.mark}, and miscalculation;
[violence i]{.mark}n the [nature]{.mark} of man; [aggressive]{.mark}
national [leaders; and economic determination]{.mark}]{.underline}. He
has concluded, however, that these causes or motives for war explain
specific conflicts but fail to serve as a central paradigm for
explaining the cause of war. 37 In the final analysis, [[Wright is
unequivocally correct]{.mark}---there is no single cause or explanation
for war. [However, there is one clear consistency in all wars: wars
always begin through]{.mark} the [calculated decisions]{.mark} of men or
women]{.underline}, regardless of any cause, motive, or explanation. As
the UNESCO constitution asserts, "wars begin in the minds of men." 38
[People---national leaders--- are always at the core of any decision to
wage war, and any strategy for preventing war must address these
individuals]{.underline}.

#### The lack of deterrence is the most reliable predictor of war -- instead of focusing on root causes, we should look to variables that directly affect decision-making, and deterrence is the most important factor

**Sharp 8** \[Gary, adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University
Law Center, "Democracy and Deterrence. Foundations for an Enduring World
Peace,"
<http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA493031&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf>\]

Wars are not simply accidents. Nor, contrary to our ordinary language,
are they made by nations. [[Wars are]{.underline}]{.mark} made by
people; more specifically they are [[decided]{.mark} on [by]{.mark} the
[leaders o]{.mark}f nation [states]{.mark}]{.underline}---and other
nonnational groups in the case of terrorism---[who make the decision to
commit aggression or otherwise use the military instrument]{.underline}.
[[These leaders make that decision based on the totality of
incentives]{.mark} affecting them at the time of the
decision]{.underline}. . . . Incentive theory\] tells us that we simply
have a better chance of\] . . . predicting war, and fashioning forms of
intervention to control it, if we focus squarely on the effect of
variables from all levels of analysis in generating incentives affecting
the actual decisions made by those with the power to decide on war. 42
[[Incentive theory focuses on the]{.mark} individual [decisions that
lead to war and explains the]{.mark} synergistic [relationship
between]{.mark} the [absence of]{.mark} effective [deterrence and the
absence of democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Together [these three
factors---the decisions of leaders made without the restraining effects
of deterrence and democracy--- are the cause of war:]{.underline} War is
not strictly caused by an absence of democracy or effective deterrence
or both together. Rather war is caused by the human leadership decision
to employ the military instrument. [[The absence of democracy, the
absence of effective deterrence, and most importantly, the synergy
of]{.mark} an absence of [both are conditions]{.mark} or factors [that
predispose to war]{.mark}]{.underline}. An absence of democracy likely
predisposes by \[its\] effect on leadership and leadership incentives,
and an absence of effective deterrence likely predisposes by its effect
on incentives from factors other than the individual or governmental
levels of analysis. [[To understand the cause of war is to understand
the human decision for war]{.mark}; that is, major war and democide . .
. are the consequence of individual decisions responding to a totality
of incentives.]{.underline} 43

### 2ac psychoanalysis wrong

#### Psycho-analysis is wrong\-\--terrible methodology, every refutable claim has been disproven, ineffective results

Robert **Bud and** Mario **Bunge 10** {Robert Bud is principal curator
of medicine at the Science Museum in London. 9-29-2010. "Should

[WE SHOULD congratulate the Science Museum for setting up an exhibition
on psychoanalysis. Exposure to pseudoscience]{.underline} greatly h[elps
understand genuine science, just as learning about tyranny helps in
understanding democracy.]{.underline} [[Over]{.mark} the past [30 years,
**psychoanalysis has**]{.mark} quietly **[been displaced]{.mark}** in
academia [by scientific psychology. But it persists in popular
culture]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as being a lucrative profession.
[It is the psychology of those who have not bothered to learn
psychology]{.underline}, and the psychotherapy of choice for those who
believe in the power of immaterial mind over body. [**[Psychoanalysis is
a bogus science]{.mark}** because **[its practitioners do not do
scientific research]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When the field turned 100, a
group of [[psychoanalysts admitted this gap]{.mark} and endeavoured to
fill it. They [claimed to have performed the first
experiment]{.mark}]{.underline} showing that patients benefited from
their treatment. Regrettably, **[[they did not include a control group
and did not entertain]{.mark} the possibility of [placebo
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Hence, [their claim remains
untested]{.mark}]{.underline} (The International Journal of
Psychoanalysis, vol 81, p 513). More recently, a meta-analysis published
in American Psychologist (vol 65, p 98) purported to support the claim
that a form of psychoanalysis called psychodynamic therapy is effective.
However, once again, the original studies did not involve control
groups. [In [110 years, psychoanalysts have not set up a single
lab]{.mark}. They do not participate in scientific
congresses,]{.underline} do not submit their papers to scientific
journals and are foreign to the scientific community - [[a marginality
typical of pseudoscience]{.underline}]{.mark}. This does not mean
[[their hypotheses]{.underline}]{.mark} have never been put to the test.
True, they [are [so vague that they are hard to test and]{.mark} some of
them]{.underline} [are]{.underline}, by Freud\'s own admission,
[irrefutable]{.underline}. Still, [most of [the testable ones have been
soundly refuted]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For example, most dreams have no
sexual content. The Oedipus complex is a myth]{.underline}; boys do not
hate their fathers because they would like to have sex with their
mothers. [The list goes on.]{.underline} As for therapeutic efficacy,
little is known because psychoanalysts do not perform double-blind
clinical trials or follow-up studies. Psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience.
Its concepts are woolly and untestable yet are regarded as unassailable
axioms. As a result of such dogmatism, [[psychoanalysis]{.mark} has
[remained]{.mark} basically [stagnant]{.mark} for more than a century,
[in contrast with scientific psychology, which is
thriving.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Psychoanalysis has zero [logical]{.underline} or [empirical]{.underline} basis, can't be scaled up, and totalizes the existence of the human condition in pseudoscientific terms

**Robinson 8** \[Andrew, political theorist and activist based in the UK
Contemporary Political Theory. Avenel: Aug 2008. Vol. 7, Iss. 3; pg.
351, 7 pgs\]

By his own admission, [[Stavrakakis **does not provide
blueprints**]{.underline}]{.mark} (which is unsurprising), [nor does he
provide]{.underline} prescriptions, [political direction]{.underline} or
policy proposals (pp. 13-14, 30). [[This leaves the work of **dubious
relevance to people doing politics**]{.underline}]{.mark} whether as
activists, politicians or administrators. The aim is rather to argue for
radical democracy as \'the institutionalization of a mechanism which
enables the continuous re-articulation of the symbolic field
constituting society\' (p. 129). The author makes very broad claims
about this function of democracy, which is \'the most pressing task\' of
politics (p. 60), the only way to ensure permanent creation of the new
(p. 60) and the only legitimate form of hegemony (p. 256). [[The
argumentation backing up these claims]{.mark} mostly [amounts
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**assertion**]{.mark} and
exegesis]{.underline}. However, this is not simply a case for existing
liberal democracies. Radical democracy is contrasted with existing
democracies (pp. 255-256) and is taken to imply a change in the
arrangement of jouissance . Instead of the fantasies pervasive today,
typified by their blaming of the other for the incompleteness of the
self, Stavrakakis proposes a passage to feminine jouissance that
encircles the lack (pp. 22-23, 111, 144, 268, 278-279). Present
democracies have been hit by an assault on the two pillars of modern
democracy \-- equality and liberty \-- by the neoliberals and
neoconservatives, respectively, leading to a \'post-political\' world in
which conflict is avoided and thus returns as social problems, and in
which a new, almost pre-democratic despotism is taking shape (pp.
263-264). Despite this, democracy can still function as \'the mobilising
force, the common denominator, for a politics of alternatives\' (p.
258).

[These political conclusions are dubious]{.underline}. Liberal
democracies in fact tend to be quite closed to change and to be
supplemented with aggressive nationalist and racist identities. The
liberal state, like the authoritarian state, tends to essentialize
itself as a form in such a way as to deny its own contingency. It is not
clear that the radical democratic framework guarantees basic rights or
prevents the state from making essentialist claims on others.
Stavrakakis assumes that the democratic form itself directly achieves
the goal of recognizing contingency (p. 141). Yet this cannot be the
case, since as Stavrakakis admits, this form does not prevent actually
existing democracies from being inflected with fantasmatic projects such
as ultranationalism, or degenerating into a \'post-political\' disavowal
of conflict. Further, whichever party gets in power \-- by majority will
or procedural hitch \-- is generally able to ignore intransigent
realities, pursue its own fantasmatic actings-out and repress,
foreclose, disavow or otherwise silence whatever forms of social
otherness are not to its tastes. Beyond this, there is a fantasmatic
frame of the liberal-democratic state that pits the permanent
institutions such as the police, bureaucracy and secret service against
semi-permanent Others, hence displacing real social antagonisms into
narratives of \'crime\', \'disorder\', \'terrorism\', \'madness\',
\'anarchy\' and so on. [[Can this]{.mark} fundamental [fantasy be
traversed without **shattering the frame of the**]{.mark}]{.underline}
\'democratic\' **[[state]{.mark} itself?]{.underline}** One might also
wonder if the \'politics of alternatives\' has not already emerged \--
and passed by entirely the radical democrats \-- in the form of the
anti-capitalist and anti-neoliberal movements.

[The linking of Lacanian theory to liberal democracy seems just too
convenient. One cannot but be reminded of the Soviet-era dissidents
whose [critiques of]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[the [**existing
regimes** ended up **reproducing** them in **their**]{.mark} proposed
**[alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline} \-- [hence [operating as
the]{.mark} fantasmatic [supplement of the regimes
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. Surely a full acceptance of social
contingency would generate social relations radically different from
those pertaining in a society where such acceptance has not occurred.
Acceptance of contingency might, for instance, necessitate the
elimination of punishment, which involves a fantasy frame blaming the
other (the criminal) for social conflict and risk; it would instead
require that risk be assumed by all social actors and not displaced into
special \'exceptional\' spaces. It would seem to imply that the state
needs to be constrained from the outside by other institutions, that a
social order where power is negotiated or contested among multiple
institutions is better than one where a single site monopolizes the
field of social power. Or maybe it would be better served by the
fluidity of affinity and the looseness of custom than by the fixity of
state and law. Perhaps the revival of activities inscribing agonism and
difference emerge, not inside the state, but in societal relations,
oppositional movements and everyday life.

While the Lacanianism of the title is self-explanatory, it raises
another problem \-- why the \'left\' in \'Lacanian left\'? Stavrakakis
defines \'left\' as meaning a democratic legitimation of antagonism and
\'alternatives\' (p. 30), a definition that begs the question,
identifying the \'left\' directly with Lacanianism. This is pretty much
unrecognizable in relation to general usage, in which \'left\' is
generally associated with the welfare or self-assertion of the
worst-off, and the prioritizing of substantive social issues over
property, propriety and order. Is Lacanian theory really \'left\' in
this more usual sense? It is, on Stavrakakis\'s own admission,
\'subversive\' rather than \'revolutionary\' (pp. 2, 158) and has a
\'reformist direction\' (p. 109). What this means in concrete terms is
that the structural frame is taken as unchangeable but the elements
within it can be reshuffled. \'Exclusion and antagonism may be
unavoidable, but acknowledging this does not restrict our ability to
influence their particular articulations, to displace continuously the
limits they impose\' (p. 226). Again in common with other \'radical
democrats\', Stavrakakis says little to reassure either the excluded or
included of the present that they will not be the losers of such a
reshuffling; it is unclear as to who will be excluded in this process,
and indeed, if any one exclusion can be deemed ethically worse than any
other. At best it is possible that the presently marginalized could come
out on top from such reshuffling. However, this is not the main aim of
Lacanian theory, which has more to do with the recognition of
contingency, rejection of \'utopianism\' and defence of
liberal-democratic regimes \-- of the \'situationness\', or ordering as
such, of society, along with its \'eventness\' or the recurrence of
radical acts (pp. 156-157). This leads to assertions of the need for
hierarchical power. For instance, authority is taken as inevitable in
all social situations; it is \'a frame presupposed in every social
experience\' (p. 173). \'Without someone in command reality
disintegrates\' (p. 174). Such an orientation has a long history, but it
is a history of the right, not the left, associated particularly with
anti-communist liberals such as Popper, Kolakowski and Berlin, and
traceable to the classical liberalism of authors such as Jefferson, de
Tocqueville and J.S. Mill, who viewed constitutionality, political
pluralism and a competitive \'marketplace of ideas\' as necessary to
impede the totalitarian tendencies of any one perspective taken alone.
Contingency, anti-utopianism, a humble acceptance of limits to knowledge
and action, the primacy of lack in human experience, are all paralleled
in this older tradition. \<\<\<Continues next page\>\>\>

The strengths and weaknesses of the text largely follow from the
usefulness and limits of the perspective it provides. [The [Lacanian
perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}, as a partial truth, [certainly
provides interesting insights and a different way of
seeing]{.underline}, and [as such often generates productive
contributions]{.underline}. However, [it [fails]{.mark} drastically
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[understand the **partiality of its own
\'truth\'**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In Stavrakakis\'s words, lack can\'t
be signified but it can be formalized (p. 279). In other words, a final
map of the structure of reality can still, from this perspective, be
drawn \-- and has been drawn already by Lacan. In effect, the [result is
a claim to be the theoretical end of]{.underline} [history \-- all else
is utopian, essentialist and so on.]{.underline} In many respects, [[the
perspective is]{.mark} also [reactive]{.mark}]{.underline}, [defined by
what it is against]{.underline} (anti-essentialist, anti-utopian,
anti-fantasmatic). **[[It is less clear what it is
for]{.underline}]{.mark}** \-- although the idea of feminine jouissance
begins the task of constructing a positive pole. [[Its relation to the
other is **very intolerant**]{.mark} and dismissive. [It is not open to
other voices]{.mark} [because it is always ready to judge the other as
failing its]{.mark} own rigid [internal criteria]{.mark}. [It expresses
a dangerous urge to drive the other out of]{.mark} the
community]{.underline} of speakers, [and perhaps out of
[existence]{.mark}]{.underline} altogether. The chapter on Castoriadis
is symptomatic here. Castoriadis in many ways stands for the entire
field of horizontalist radicalism \-- horizontalists and immanentists
(Stirner, Reich, Negri, Deleuze, Marcuse, various critics of Lacan)
circle around the text like barbarians at the gates. The dispute between
Lacanianism and horizontalism is a dispute the stakes of which Lacanians
are reluctant to confront, instead hiding behind the view from one side
\-- \'they disagree with us, therefore they are wrong\'. Except that
\'wrong\' is usually replaced by one of a number of theoretical epithets
\-- romantic, utopian, essentialist \-- which sound superficially like
useful categories of theory but which are never defined and which serve
mainly as a name to call people who disagree with one or another basic
Lacanian assumption. The impression is given that those who hold these
perspectives are somehow naïve, intellectually disreputable or
unrespectable, but this connoted claim is never demonstrated. It is
simply a choice of one perspective over another, conveyed in loaded
language. Like most of its ilk, [this book does plenty to show what
Lacanian theory does]{.underline}, how it \'works\' as a theoretical
machine or toolkit, [but rather less to say why it]{.underline} [should
be preferred to other approaches]{.underline} (assuming, of course, that
not wanting to be called names is insufficient reason to accept its
validity). [[Lacanian theory]{.underline} [suffers from an **ontological
and epistemological restrictiveness** derived from its absolutizing
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [structural [topologies, which **limits its
explanatory power** by]{.mark}]{.underline} [[rendering]{.mark} far too
many [specificities]{.mark} of metropolitan statist societies
\'necessary\' or [\'unavoidable\']{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The theory
involves]{.underline}]{.mark} [restrictive, totalizing [claims that
are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**neither logically**]{.mark} necessary
**[nor empirically demonstrated]{.mark}**; most often, acceptance of
such claims is unnecessary to gain the benefits of the explanatorily
or]{.underline} [theoretically useful aspects of the perspective. Social
phenomena vary in how well they fit this limiting frame. Nationalism and
racism, having the right form, fit well, and hence become favourite
expository targets for Lacanian theorists. But [dogmas will have to be
sacrificed if a broader]{.mark} field of [social]{.mark}
[movement]{.mark}s [is to be encompassed.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Even if they win superior explanatory power, psychoanalytic imaginings are useless in advancing political change

Politics," Psychoanalytic Quarterly, Vol. LXXIX, No. 1, p. 205-207

On the other hand, though in these ways and many others, [psychoanalysis
seems to promote the sorts of subjective dispositions and habits
requisite for a thriving democracy, and though in a variety of ways
psychoanalysis contributes to personal emancipation]{.underline}--- say,
[by releasing individuals from self-defeating, damaging, or petrified
forms action and reaction, object attachment, and the
like]{.underline}---[in light of the very uniqueness of what it has to
offer, one cannot but wonder: [to what extent]{.mark}, if at all,
[can]{.mark} the habits and dispositions---broadly, the forms of
life---cultivated by [psychoanalytic practice]{.mark} survive, let alone
[flourish, under]{.mark} **modern social and [political
conditions]{.mark}**[?]{.mark}]{.underline} [[If the]{.mark}
emancipatory [inclinations]{.mark}]{.underline} and democratic virtues
that [psychoanalytic practice promotes [are]{.mark} systematically
[crushed]{.mark}]{.underline} or at least regularly unsupported by the
world in which they would be realized, [**then [isn't
psychoanalysis]{.mark} implicitly** [making promises it cannot
redeem?]{.mark}]{.underline} Might not massive social and political
transformations be the condition for the efficacious practice of
psychoanalysis? And so, under current conditions, [can we avoid
experiencing the forms of life nascently cultivated by psychoanalytic
practice as something of a tease, or even a source of deep
frustration]{.underline}? (2) Concerning psychoanalysis as a politically
inclined theoretical enterprise, [[the worry is whether
political]{.mark} diagnoses and [proposals]{.mark} that proceed
[on]{.mark} the basis of [psychoanalytic insights]{.mark} and forms of
attention [partake of a fantasy of]{.mark} interpretive [efficacy (**all
the world's a couch**]{.mark}]{.underline}, you might say), [wherein our
profound alienation from the conditions for robust political agency are
registered and repudiated]{.underline}? Consider, for example, Freud and
Bullitt's (1967) assessment of the psychosexual determinants of Woodrow
Wilson's political aspirations and impediments, or Reich's (1972)
suggestion that Marxism should appeal to psychoanalysis in order to
illuminate and redress neurotic phenomena that generate disturbances in
working capacity, especially as this concerns religion and bourgeois
sexual ideology. Also relevant are Freud's,
[[Žižek's]{.underline}]{.mark} (1993, 2004), Derrida's (2002) and
others' insistence that we draw the juridical and political consequences
of the [hypothesis of an irreducible [death drive]{.mark}]{.underline},
as well as Marcuse's (1970) proposal that we attend to the weakening of
Eros and the growth of aggression that [[results]{.mark} [from]{.mark}
the coercive [enforcement of the reality principle]{.mark} upon the
sociopolitically weakened ego, and especially to the channeling of this
aggression into hatred of enemies.]{.underline} Reich (1972) and Fromm
(1932) suggest that psychoanalysis be employed to explore the
motivations to political irrationality, especially that singular
irrationality of joining the national-socialist movement, while Irigaray
(1985) diagnoses the desire for the Same, the One, the Phallus as a
desire for a sociosymbolic order that assures masculine dominance. Žižek
(2004) contends that only a psychoanalytic exposition of the disavowed
beliefs and suppositions of the United States political elite can get at
the fundamental determinants of the Iraq War. Rose (1993) argues that it
was the paranoiac paradox of sensing both that there is every reason to
be frightened and that everything is under control that allowed Thatcher
"to make this paradox the basis of political identity so that subjects
could take pleasure in violence as force and legitimacy while always
locating 'real' violence somewhere else---illegitimate violence and
illicitness increasingly made subject to the law" (p. 64).
[[Stavrakakis]{.mark}]{.underline} (1999) [[advocates that
we]{.underline}]{.mark} recognize and [[traverse
the]{.underline}]{.mark} residues of [[utopian
fantasy]{.underline}]{.mark} in our contemporary political imagination.1
[Might not the psychoanalytic [interpretation of powerful
figures]{.mark} (Bush, Bin Laden, or whomever), collective subjects
(nations, ethnic groups, and so forth), [or]{.mark} urgent ["political"
situations **register** ]{.mark}**an [anxiety]{.mark} regarding
political impotence** or "castration" that is **pacified and modified**
by the fantasmatic frame [wherein the psychoanalytically
inclined]{.mark} political [theorist situates]{.mark} him- or herself
[as diagnosing]{.mark} or interpretively intervening in the lives of
political figures]{.underline}, collective political subjects, [or
complex political [situations]{.mark} with the idealized efficacy of a
successful clinical intervention]{.underline}? If so, then [**the
question is: [are the contributions of psychoanalytic]{.mark}ally
inclined political [theory anything more than tantalizing menu]{.mark}
cards [for ]{.mark}**[meals it cannot deliver**?**]{.mark}]{.underline}
As I said, the worry is twofold. These are two folds of a related
problem, which is this: [might the very seductiveness of psychoanalytic
theory and practice]{.underline}---specifically, the seductiveness of
its political promise---[register the lasting eclipse of the political
and the objectivity of the social, respectively]{.underline}? In other
words, [[might not every**thing that makes psychoanalytic**]{.mark}
**theory and [practice]{.mark} so politically [attractive]{.mark}**
[indicate]{.mark} precisely the necessity of wide-ranging
social/institutional [transformations that far exceed the powers of
psychoanalysis]{.mark}]{.underline}[?]{.mark} And so, [might not the
politically salient [transformations]{.mark} of subjectivity [to which
psychoanalysis can contribute overburden subjectivity as the]{.mark}
site of [political transformation, **blinding us to** ]{.mark}**the
necessity of largescale [institutional reforms]{.mark}**]{.underline}?
Indeed, might not massive institutional transformations be necessary
conditions for the efficacy of psychoanalytic practice, both personally
and politically? Further, [might not the so-called interventions and
proposals of psychoanalytically inclined political [theory]{.mark}
similarly [sidestep the question of the institutional]{.mark}
transformations [necessary for]{.mark} their [realization, and]{.mark}
so [conspire with]{.mark} our blindness to the enormous institutional
[impediments to a]{.mark} progressive [political
future?]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Psychoanalytic explanations of racism are reductionist, non-falsifiable and anti-political

**[Gordon 1]{.mark}**---psychotherapist living and working in London
(Paul, Psychoanalysis and Racism: The politics of defeat Race & Class v.
42, n. 4)

[[Given that racism works at an unconscious level, it
follows]{.underline}]{.mark}, in Cohen\'s¶ view, [[that strategies to
challenge it at a conscious level are doomed]{.mark} to]{.underline}¶
[failure.]{.underline} They are bound to fail precisely because they are
rational and¶ fail to appreciate that the power of racism lies in the
fact that it is¶ unconscious. To deinstitutionalise racism \`will not in
itself abolish¶ the power of the racist imagination\' which will
continue to flourish¶ through the media of popular culture long after
its state forms have¶ withered away.42 \`All the evidence to date\',
Cohen writes elsewhere,¶ \`shows that the racist imagination is not
accessible to rationalist¶ pedagogies, and almost effortlessly resists
their impact\'. [[What is all]{.underline}]{.mark}¶ [[this evidence?
Certainly it is neither presented nor cited]{.underline}]{.mark}.43
Rustin,¶ too, claims that classroom teaching can have the effect of
\`increasing¶ kinds of defensive organisation\'. But he cites no
evidence - other¶ than referring to Cohen\'s work - and seems to believe
that all \`antiracism\'¶ in education is a matter of seeking to change
attitudes, rather¶ than opening up new ways of looking at the world.44¶
In Cohen\'s schema, then, [[racism is taken out of society]{.mark} and
material]{.underline}¶ [reality [and lodged very firmly in the
minds]{.mark}, the unconscious minds, [of]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶
[individual subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although in his 1988 article,
\`The perversions of¶ inheritance\', he distanced himself from a
position that afforded¶ absolute autonomy to the ideological, and thus
ran the risk, as he¶ acknowledged, of \`substituting changes in personal
attitude or societal¶ values for structural reforms\', this is, in fact,
where he has ended up.¶ As his work has developed, **[[there is less and
less sense of any]{.underline}]{.mark}**¶ **[[political project of
anti-racism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and an almost exclusive
concentration¶ on dealing with the beliefs and attitudes of racists.
Ideology has¶ become all.¶ [In placing racism in the
unconscious]{.underline}, [Cohen is]{.underline} very much [in
line]{.underline}¶ [with]{.underline} [the most orthodox of
psychoanalysis which claims to find]{.underline}¶ \`[inside\'
individuals]{.underline} (whatever that might mean - the notion of an
\`internal¶ world\' is always taken for granted and never really put
into question)¶ [what actually belongs in society, in what
psychoanalysis calls]{.underline}¶ \`[the external world]{.underline}\'.
Indeed, one of the earliest Marxist critiques of¶ Freud\'s theories made
precisely this point, accusing Freud of rendering¶ individual what was
irredeemably social.45 In the same vein, and particularly¶ germane to
the present discussion, the refusal of psychoanalysis¶ to acknowledge
social and political reality, to see what is in front of it, is¶
exemplified in the following story.¶ Like many analysts of her time,
Melanie Klein, in whose tradition¶ Cohen writes, engaged in the quite
unethical and inappropriate practice¶ of analysing her own children. She
began her son Erich\'s analysis in¶ Budapest in 1920 when he was 5 and
continued it when she separated¶ from her husband and moved to Berlin.
There, Erich developed a¶ phobia about going outside. Klein
\`explained\' to Erich that his anxiety¶ was due to his fantasies about
having sexual intercourse with his¶ mother. Erich told his mother of a
street that was particularly frightening¶ to him because it was filled
with young \`toughs\' who tormented him.¶ Klein ignored this and,
recalling that the street was filled with large¶ trees, interpreted
these as phalluses and evidence of his continued¶ desire for his mother
and of his fear of castration as a punishment.¶ Years later, Erich\'s
elder brother Hans, also an analysand of his¶ mother, told Erich that
the youths had, in fact, been an anti-Semitic¶ gang that routinely
attacked Jewish children. Erich had never been¶ told by his mother that
he was Jewish. As the historian of psychotherapy¶ Philip Cushman
comments: \`It is difficult to know what is¶ more remarkable in this
incident with Erich: Klein\'s dismissal of, her¶ almost phobic denial
of, the \`\`external\'\' social realm, or her remarkable¶
self-centredness.\' 46 [Klein]{.underline}, in other words, [placed in
the mind of her son]{.underline}¶ [that which fully belonged in the
material world. [Objective reality]{.mark}]{.underline}¶ [[became a
\`state of mind\'. Exactly the same criticism can be
levelled]{.underline}¶ [at]{.underline}]{.mark} Cohen\'s
[[placing]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[racism inside the unconscious minds
of individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶ It is indeed ironic that, with
postmodernists such as Cohen,¶ we should be witnessing a return to a
past - albeit at a more sophisticated¶ level of \`discourse\' - when,
according to the liberal race relations¶ paradigm, racism did not really
exist, only racial prejudice, something¶ that was individual and
psychological.¶ The question of method¶ Cohen\'s work unavoidably raises
the question of the status of psychoanalysis¶ as a social or political
theory, as distinct from a clinical one.¶ Can psychoanalysis, in other
words, apply to the social world of groups, institutions, nations,
states and cultures in the way that it does,¶ or at least may do, to
individuals? Certainly there is now a considerable¶ body of literature
and a plethora of academic courses, and so on, claiming¶ that
psychoanalysis is a social theory. And, of course, in popular¶
discourse, it is now a commonplace to hear of nations and societies¶
spoken of in personalised ways. Thus \`truth commissions\' and the¶
like, which have become so common in the past decade in countries¶ which
have undergone turbulent change, are seen as forms of national¶ therapy
or catharsis, even if this is far from being their purpose.
Nevertheless,¶ the question remains: [does it make sense]{.underline},
as Michael Ignatieff¶ puts it, [to speak of nations having psyches the
way that individuals do?]{.underline}¶ \`Can a nation\'s past make
people ill as we know repressed memories¶ sometimes make individuals
ill? . . . Can we speak of nations \`\`working¶ through\'\' a civil war
or an atrocity as we speak of individuals working¶ through a traumatic
memory or event?\' 47¶ [[The problem with the application of
psychoanalysis to social institutions]{.underline}¶ [is that there can
be no testing]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the claims made]{.underline}. If
someone says,¶ for instance, that nationalism is a form of looking for
and seeking to¶ replace the body of the mother one has lost, or that the
popular¶ appeal of a particular kind of story echoes the pattern of our
earliest¶ relationship to the maternal breast, [how can this be
proved?]{.underline} The¶ pioneers of psychoanalysis, from Freud
onwards, all derived their¶ ideas in the context of their work with
individual patients and their¶ ideas can be examined in the everyday
laboratory of the therapeutic¶ encounter where the validity of an
interpretation, for example, is a¶ matter for dialogue between therapist
and patient. [Outside of the consulting]{.underline}¶ [room, [there can
be no]{.mark} [such verification]{.mark} process, [and the
further]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [one moves from the individual patient,
the less purchase psychoanalytic]{.underline}¶ [ideas can
have]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Outside the therapeutic encounter,
anything]{.underline}¶ [and everything can be true, psychoanalytically
speaking. But if everything]{.underline}¶ [is true, then nothing can be
false and therefore nothing can be]{.underline}¶ [true.]{.underline}¶ An
example of Cohen\'s method is to be found in his 1993 working¶ paper,
\`Home rules\', subtitled \`Some reflections on racism and nationalism¶
in everyday life\'. Here Cohen talks about taking a \`particular line¶
of thought for a walk\'. While there is nothing wrong with taking a
line¶ of thought for a walk, such an exercise is not necessarily the
same as¶ thinking. One of the problems with Cohen\'s approach is that a
kind¶ of free association, mixed with deconstruction, leads not to
analysis,¶ not even to psychoanalysis, but to\... well, just more free
association,¶ an endless, indeed one might say pointless, play on words.
This¶ approach may well throw up some interesting associations along
the¶ way, connections one had never thought of but it is not to be
confused¶ with political analysis. In \`Home rules\', anything and
everything to do¶ with \`home\' can and does find a place here and, as I
indicated above, even the popular film Home Alone is pressed into
service as a story¶ about \`racial\' invasion.¶ Cohen\'s method also
relies to no little extent on various caricatures.¶ There is the parody
of an undifferentiated anti-racism which is always¶ crude and simplistic
in its explanations, always dogmatic and authoritarian¶ in its
prescriptions. \`It is no longer possible\', Cohen claims at one¶ point,
\`to call a spade a spade . . . because the level of connotations,¶
which is always open to multiple associations, including racist ones,¶
has been shut down \`\`By Order\'\'.\' 48 [No one would deny that
much]{.underline}¶ [that is called anti-racism has been ill-considered
or counter-productive]{.underline}¶ or simple-minded, [but to suggest
that this is the whole story]{.underline} - and this is¶ the picture one
gets from Cohen\'s account - appears simply bad faith.¶ Nor does one get
any sense from his account that some forms of antiracism¶ have been
subjected to the most rigorous critique - from other¶ anti-racists,
notably in this journal. So, too, there is the distorted depiction¶ of
teachers bearing the anti-racist message. In Cohen\'s world, they¶ are
always middle class, relying on a \`deficit model\' of working-class¶
culture, and engaged in a \`civilising mission\', believing themselves
to¶ be \`the bringers of reason and tolerance to those gripped by
unreason,¶ prejudice and ignorance\'.49 Doubtless such attitudes exist,
but Cohen\'s¶ depiction is so one-dimensional; it has no room for
complexity or¶ difference. If it did, he could not take up the position
that he does, of¶ the one who really knows. It is also a position that
takes Cohen on¶ to dangerous ground in which, at times at least, it
seems as though¶ all authority is bad (in the language of Foucault, it
is tutelary and¶ constitutes surveillance) and all resistance to
authority good, or at¶ least understandable.50¶ Racism without history¶
[[Not only is racism psychologised and individualised]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline}]{.mark} [also [becomes]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶]{.mark}
[something that is [universal]{.mark}.]{.underline} Cohen\'s colleague
Rustin makes this¶ clear in the article cited earlier,51 while Cohen
himself states that¶ \`Every language and culture, in so far as it is
able, privileges its own¶ practices, using them to define its own
origins, and defend its own¶ boundaries. Every form of ethnicity, if it
has the means, is ethnocentric.¶ The key word is if.\'52 (There is a
dangerous slippage here in that¶ \`ethnocentrism\' is not the same as
racism and, while it may turn into¶ it, it need not and frequently does
not.) [[What is not explained]{.underline}]{.mark} by¶ either Cohen or
Rustin [[is why some individuals]{.mark} or some groups
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ \`[more\' racist or less racist than
others]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Racism is]{.mark} thus
[completely]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [removed from history, but what is
also not explained]{.underline}]{.mark} [in this regard
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [why it is more or less virulent at
particular times]{.underline}]{.mark} [and in particular]{.underline}¶
[places]{.underline}. [A psychoanalytic account]{.underline} like
Cohen\'s simply [cannot account]{.underline}¶ [for such
twentieth-century events as the massacre of the Armenians by the Turks
in 1914 or the destruction of the Jews, or indeed anything]{.underline}¶
[else]{.underline}. \`[To deny racism its history\']{.underline}, Cohen
had written in 1988, \`[is to]{.underline}¶ [surrender to a kind of
fatalism]{.underline}.\'53 **[Yet that is precisely the
position]{.underline}**¶ **[he has come to occupy]{.underline}**.¶ [[The
question is not whether or not racism operates at an
unconscious]{.underline}¶ [level]{.underline}]{.mark}[. There is clearly
too much evidence to deny this. [The question]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶
[is,]{.underline}]{.mark} [rather, [how important is this unconscious
working?]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Should it]{.underline}]{.mark}¶ [[be,
can it be, the focus of anti-racist strategy?]{.underline}]{.mark} For
Cohen, however,¶ the unconscious has become all; nothing else really
matters. [[Here we]{.underline}¶ [have reached the site of a
psychoanalytic determinism]{.underline}]{.mark} [- a curious
inversion]{.underline}¶ [of]{.underline} the [crude
materialism]{.underline} that Cohen would rightly distance himself¶
from. It is a determinism which holds that we are not at all rational¶
thinking beings, but that we are driven all the time by forces beyond¶
our control. [Our attachment to a belief or an ideal, our cultural
preferences]{.underline},¶ [all these are to be explained by some
supposed psychoanalytic]{.underline}¶ [interpretation]{.underline}.
**[[There is no hope,]{.mark} then]{.underline}**, except in the form of
psychoanalytic¶ or psychotherapeutic treatment and it is this which
Cohen¶ seeks to offer through his cultural studies approach.

### 1ar no-scale up

#### Psychoanalysis can't be scaled up to explain society or politics 

**Sharpe 10** \[Matthew, lecturer, philosophy and psychoanalytic
studies, and Geoff Goucher, senior lecturer, literary and psychoanalytic
studies, Deakin University

Matthew and Geoff, *Žižek and Politics: An Introduction*, p. 182-185\]

Can we bring some order to this host of criticisms? It is remarkable
that, for all the criticisms of Žižek's political Romanticism, no one
has argued that the ultra- extremism of [Žižek's political position
might reflect his untenable attempt to shape his model for [political
action]{.mark} on the curative]{.underline} final [moment in [clinical
psychoanalysis.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The differences between
these]{.underline}]{.mark} two [[realms]{.underline}]{.mark}, listed in
Figure 5.1, [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly [too many and too
**[great]{.mark}** to restate -- [which]{.mark} has]{.underline} perhaps
[[caused]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**theoretical
oversight**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The key thing is this.
[[Lacan's]{.underline}]{.mark} notion of [traversing the fantasy
involves]{.underline} the [radical [transformation of]{.mark} people's
[subjective structure]{.mark}: a refounding of]{.underline} their most
[elementary beliefs]{.underline} about themselves, the world, and sexual
difference. [This [is]{.mark}]{.underline} undertaken [[in the security
of the clinic]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the basis of the analysands'
voluntary desire to overcome their inhibitions, symptoms and anxieties.
As a clinical and existential process, it has its own independent
importance and authenticity. [The [analysands]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
transforming their subjective world, [change the way they regard the
objective]{.underline}, shared social reality outside the clinic. [But
they [**do not transform** the world.]{.mark} The political relevance of
the clinic]{.underline} can only be (a) as a supporting moment in
ideology critique or (b) as a fully- fl edged model of politics,
provided that the political subject and its social object are ultimately
identical. Option (*b*), Žižek's option, [rests on the
idea]{.underline}, not only [of a subject]{.underline} who becomes who
he is only through his (mis) recognition of the objective sociopolitical
order, but [whose 'traversal]{.underline} of the fantasy' [is
immediately identical with]{.underline} his [transformation of the
socio- political system]{.underline} or Other. Hence, according to
Žižek, we can analyse the institutional embodiments of this Other using
psychoanalytic categories. In Chapter 4, we saw Žižek's resulting
elision of the distinction between the (subjective) Ego Ideal and the
(objective) Symbolic Order. [This leads him to analyse our entire
culture as a single subject--object,]{.underline} whose perverse (or
perhaps even psychotic) structure is expressed in every manifestation of
contemporary life. Žižek's decisive political- theoretic errors, one
substantive and the other methodological, are different (see Figure 5.1)
[[The substantive problem is to equate]{.mark} any [political
change]{.mark}]{.underline} worth the name [[with]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [total [change of the subject--object]{.mark}]{.underline} that is,
today, global capitalism. This is a type of change that can only mean
equating politics with violent regime change, and ultimately embracing
dictatorial government, as Žižek now frankly avows (*IDLC* 412--19). We
have seen that the ultra- political form of Žižek's criticism of
everyone else, [the theoretical Left and]{.underline} the [wider
politics]{.underline}, is that [no one is sufficiently radical for
him]{.underline} -- even, we will discover, Chairman Mao. We now see
that [this is because [Žižek's]{.mark} model of
[politics]{.mark}]{.underline} proper [[is modelled
on]{.underline}]{.mark} a pre- critical [[analogy
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the total transformation of [a
subject's]{.underline} entire [[subjective structure]{.mark}, at the end
of the talking cure.]{.underline} For what could the concrete
consequences of this governing analogy be? We have seen that [[Žižek
equates the individual]{.underline}]{.mark} fantasy
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[collective identity of **an entire
people**.]{.underline}]{.mark} The social fantasy, he says, structures
the regime's 'inherent transgressions': at once subjects' habitual ways
of living the letter of the law, and the regime's myths of origin and of
identity. [If political action is modelled on the Lacanian cure, it must
involve the complete 'traversal']{.underline} -- in Hegel's terms, the
abstract versus the determinate negation -- [of]{.underline} all these
[lived myths]{.underline}, practices and habits. Politics must involve
the periodic founding of entire new subject--objects. Providing the
model for this set of ideas, the fi rst Žižekian political subject was
Schelling's divided God, who gave birth to the entire Symbolic Order
before the beginning of time (*IDLC* 153; *OB* 144--8). But [[can the
political theorist]{.mark} reasonably]{.underline} hope or
[[expect]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[subjects will]{.mark} simply [give
up on]{.mark} all [their inherited ways]{.mark}]{.underline}, myths and
beliefs, all [[in one world- creating moment?]{.underline}]{.mark} And
can they be legitimately asked or expected to, on the basis of a set of
ideals whose legitimacy they will only retrospectively see, after they
have acceded to the Great Leap Forward? And [if they do not]{.underline}
-- for Žižek laments that today subjects are politically disengaged in
unprecedented ways -- [what means can the theorist and his allies use to
move them to do so?]{.underline}

#### Can't scale up Lacanian psychoanalysis to the state level

**Epstein 10** \[senior lecturer in government and IR -- University of
Sydney

Charlotte, "Who speaks? Discourse, the subject and the study of identity
in international politics," *European Journal of International
Relations* XX(X) 1--24\]

To be clear, this move is not intended to deny the intimate links
between discourse and subjectivity. The earlier foray into Lacanian
thought served precisely to underline the centrality of discourse to
both the making and subsequent analysis of the subject. But by the same
token it also drew out what is required to wield the discourse approach
effec­tively in IR. Indeed [[Lacan's analysis emphasizes]{.mark} the
sheer complexity of the [dynamics of a highly individual
phenomenon]{.mark}]{.underline} (identity), [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
consequently [[the difficulties in taking this]{.mark} level [as the
starting point for analysing]{.mark}]{.underline} all [[other
levels]{.mark} at which identity is]{.underline} politically [at
play.]{.underline}13 As the discipline that positions itself at the
highest level of analysis (the supra­national), [[IR cannot maintain its
focus at the level where]{.underline}]{.mark} some of the [finer
[debates around subjectivity take place]{.mark}]{.underline} (see for
example, Butler, 1997). [[The issue]{.underline}]{.mark} here
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} one of [[discipli­nary
specificity]{.underline}]{.mark}, or, in other words, equipping IR for
what it wants to do; and the solu­tion proposed is one of suspension or
bracketing. To restate this important point differently, at the
individual level, subjectivities and subject-positions remain
coextensive. [The distinction between subject-positions and
subjectivities becomes operative once the analysis shifts beyond the
individual level]{.underline}. This distinction thus offers a
theoretically cogent way of studying identity while bracket­ing some of
its more unwieldy dimensions that may, moreover, not be pertinent at the
levels at which IR casts its focus. It renders the discourse approach
operative for IR, because it makes it possible to study *state*
identities, without having to presume that states have feelings, or
indeed enter into questions of how much exactly are they like people, or
what kind of selves do they possess. What the discourse approach
analyses, then, is the ways in which actors --- crucially, whether
individuals or states --- define themselves by stepping into a
particular subject-position carved out by a discourse. In taking on the
'I/we' of that discourse, actors' identities are produced in a very
specific way. In doing so, they are establishing them­selves as the
subjects of particular discourses, such as the anti-whaling discourse,
and thereby marking themselves as 'anti-whalers'. How, then, do
discursive subject-positions differ from Wendt's (1999: 227--229) role
identities, where the actor is similarly seen as stepping into
institutionalized roles (such as professor and student)? The crucial
differ­ence is that [the concept of subject-position does not harbour any
assumption about any primordial self supporting]{.underline} these
[roles.]{.underline} Importantly, [[this is not to say that the self
does not exist]{.underline}]{.mark} --- that the professor or student
have no selves --- but [[simply that the concept is not relevant
to]{.mark} the [analysis of]{.mark}]{.underline} the discursive
[construction of [identity]{.mark},]{.underline} especially when [[taken
to the interstate level.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 2ac positivism good

#### Valid, descriptive theories of the world are an essential prerequisite to emancipatory critique -- epistemic shifts from Eurocentric thought are impossible without reclaiming the concept of objectivity.

**Jones 04** -- (August 2004, Branwen Gruffydd, PhD in Development
Studies from the University of Sussex, Senior Lecturer in International
Political Economy at Goldsmiths University of London, "From Eurocentrism
to Epistemological Internationalism: power, knowledge and objectivity in
International Relations," Paper presented at Theorising Ontology, Annual

[The rejection of positivism]{.underline} which is a central element of
recent critiques of mainstream IR [has tended to extend to rejection of
the]{.underline} notion and [possibility of science itself]{.underline}.
Science, often written in quotation marks 'science', is [seen as
inherently part of the project of Enlightenment-modernity]{.underline},
[a mode of technical instrumental knowledge which is necessarily a means
of control and domination]{.underline} of both society and nature 22 .
[An important component of the critique]{.underline} of the positivist
orthodoxy [is]{.underline} exposure of [its coincidence with the
interests of the powerful]{.underline}. [Dominant ideas]{.underline} and
methods which rest on claims of value-free scientificity and neutrality
[are shown to mask or legitimise the]{.underline} interests of the
powerful and the [exercise of power and domination]{.underline}. The
very claim to be able to produce value-free, neutral scientific truth is
rejected in a world of inherently conflicting interests. Instead, the
'illusion of objectivism must be replaced with the recognition that
knowledge is always constituted in reflection of interests' (Ashley
1981: 207).

[There are **two kinds of conflation**]{.underline} which are embedded
[within this critical stance]{.underline}. [The first
conflates]{.underline} the contents of [natural scientific knowledge
with the uses to which it is put in society]{.underline}. [Much
scientific knowledge]{.underline}, in both natural and social sciences,
[has indeed been produced by and in the]{.underline} explicit [interests
of the powerful]{.underline}, an integral part of the construction and
maintenance of unequal and oppressive social orders, and the
administration of accumulation and imperialism. [But it is **important
not to conflate the contents of knowledge with its social conditions of
production and use**]{.underline}. [When]{.underline} scientific
knowledge is [developed for]{.underline} and utilised in the service of
[oppression or commercial profit]{.underline} [as opposed to the
increased satisfaction of human needs]{.underline}, the [oppression
results from social forces, not from the cognitive properties of
scientific knowledge]{.underline} 23:

Even assuming all the results of a research project are objectively
true, the area chosen for investigation may be determined by contentious
ideological assumptions or practical interests. Thus it is likely that
drug companies have concentrated on artificially synthesized drugs to
the detriment of research into those occurring naturally in plants; and
it is certain that military might and commercial profit are the chief
determinants of which secrets of nature get uncovered. [In a world where
science was funded with a view to satisfying human needs and conserving
planetary resources, quite different discoveries might be made --
neither more or less objective than the findings of modern science, but
useful for different purposes]{.underline}. (Collier 1994: 180; see also
Collier 1979).

[The second conflation reduces scientific method to a positivist
approach]{.underline}, equating positivist social science with social
science per se with technical instrumentality. [It is often asserted
that the problem with positivist IR is that it applies the method of
natural sciences]{.underline} or 'the scientific method' [to the study
of social phenomena]{.underline} 24 . **[This is a
mischaracterisation]{.underline}** of [the real]{.underline} nature of
the [problem]{.underline}, [which is that positivism first
misunderstands]{.underline} the method of [natural science]{.underline},
and then applies these misunderstood methodological principles to the
study of social phenomena (Bhaskar 1997). Recognition of this enables us
to retrieve the possibility of a particular form of social inquiry which
can be called scientific or objective from abandonment along with
positivism 25 .

[A positivist understanding]{.underline} of scientific inquiry [rests on
a Humean notion of cause as constant conjunction between empirical
variables or events]{.underline}, and explanation as the discovery of
empirical regularities and correlations. When such empirical
regularities are discovered they can be used to make predictions. This
assumes an empiricist ontology and epistemology: the world consists only
of that which is available to direct experience, and the only source of
knowledge is through direct sensory experience. [Critiques of positivism
are correct]{.underline} to question these assumptions about knowledge
and the world, but they are [not correct in equating this with
scientific method]{.underline}. Positivism consists of philosophers'
misunderstanding of the actual practice of natural science. **[The
practice of experiment is central]{.underline}** to the method of some
natural sciences. A scientific experiment involves establishing closure:
creating an artificial environment where the external and internal
conditions are controlled so as to isolate particular features and
mechanisms. This enables scientists to discover about aspects of reality
which are not empirical : the [causal properties]{.underline} and
necessary ways-of-operating of specific mechanisms in nature which
**[are real]{.underline}** because they have the capacity to bring about
change, given appropriate conditions and inputs, **[but]{.underline}**
are **[not empirical]{.underline}** -- [they cannot be seen, only the
effects of their operation can be seen]{.underline}. **[This
non-positivist, philosophical realist theory of science]{.underline}**,
epistemology and ontology **[is very different]{.underline}** from the
positivist misunderstanding of scientific method and explanation.
[Scientific theories]{.underline} and the discovery of natural laws
[refer to real properties]{.underline} and causal powers of structured
entities, [not empirical events and regularities]{.underline} (Bhaskar
1997).

[What are the implications]{.underline} of this non-positivist theory of
science for social inquiry[?]{.underline} [The fact of human reflexivity
rules out the possibility of experiment and prediction in social
inquiry]{.underline}, because it is impossible to establish closure in
the social world 26 . [Ideas are causally efficacious]{.underline}:
through informing social action ideas have causal efficacy in
codetermining or influencing what actually happens, including (usually
as an unintended outcome) the reproduction of social relations. [This
means that ideas are part of the object of social inquiry, as is
fore-grounded by all variants of so-called reflexive approaches in
International Relations]{.underline} (Keohane 1988). When we study
society part of what we study includes the ideas that are held in that
society. But we also study other aspects of society which are
irreducible to ideas or individuals -- real but non-empirical structures
of social relations, historically-specific socially-produced material
conditions, and so on.

This non-positivist theory of knowledge and the world gives rise to a
notion of objectivity which does not entail the positivist commitment to
value-free neutrality. Philosophical realism holds that the world
consists of natural and social objects or entities which exist and have
particular properties and causal powers independently of what, if
anything, is known about them 27 . Knowledge about different aspects of
the material and social world can be non-existent, partial, more or less
adequate, more or less right or wrong. This informs a notion of
objectivity which refers to what is the case, regardless of what is
thought or believed to be the case:

[The first and central use of the word "objectivity" is to refer to what
is true independently of any subject judging it to be true]{.underline}.
[To say that it is an objective fact that the Earth is the third planet
from the Sun is to say that this is so whether or not anyone knows or
believes it, or even is able to formulate the statement]{.underline}. To
say that kindness is an objective value is to say that it is a value,
whether or not anyone judges it to be a value; it would be a value even
if the whole of society regarded it as a culpable weakness and it was
only practised shamefacedly as a private foible. (Collier 2003: 134-5).

This notion of objectivity does not entail a belief that human beings
can acquire absolute truth and certain knowledge about either social or
natural phenomena. [It is possible to acknowledge that knowledge is
always inherently fallible and socially constructed while retaining a
notion of the objective reality which ideas are about]{.underline}. This
allows commitment to judgemental rationality -- the possibility of
judging between different ideas on the basis of their relative adequacy,
in terms of their relation to objective reality 28 . In social inquiry
objectivity does not imply some form of external position of
independence 'outside' society 29 . All knowledge is socially produced;
but all knowledge is also about something which exists independently of
the knowledge about it. (This is the case even for knowledge about
ideas).

[The 'common-sense' view]{.underline} pervading recent discussions of
epistemology, ontology and methodology [in IR asserts that objectivity
implies value-free neutrality]{.underline}. [However, **objective social
inquiry has an inherent tendency to be critical**]{.underline}, in
various senses. **[To the extent that objective knowledge provides a
better and more adequate account of reality than other ideas, such
knowledge is inherently critical (implicitly or explicitly) of those
ideas]{.underline}**. 30 In other words **[critical social inquiry does
not (or not only) manifest its 'criticalness' through self-claimed
labels of being critical or siding with the oppressed, but through the
substantive critique of prevailing ideas]{.underline}**. [Objective
social knowledge constitutes a specific form of criticism: **explanatory
critique**]{.underline}. The critique [of dominant ideas or
ideologies]{.underline} is [elaborated through providing a more adequate
explanation of aspects of the world]{.underline}, [and in so doing
**exposing what is wrong with the dominant ideology**]{.underline}. This
may also entail revealing the social conditions which give rise to
ideologies, thus exposing the necessary and causal relation between
particular social relations and particular ideological conceptions.

In societies which are constituted by unequal structures of social
relations giving rise to unequal power and conflicting interests, [the
reproduction of those structured relations is in the interests of the
powerful, whereas transformation]{.underline} of existing structured
relations [is in the interests of the weak]{.underline}. **[Because
ideas inform social action they are casually efficacious]{.underline}**
[either in]{.underline} securing [the reproduction of existing social
relations]{.underline} (usually as an unintended consequence of social
practice), [or in]{.underline} informing social action aimed at
[transforming social relations]{.underline}. This is why **[ideas cannot
be 'neutral']{.underline}**. Ideas which provide a misrepresentation of
the nature of society, the causes of unequal social conditions, and the
conflicting interests of the weak and powerful, will tend to help secure
the reproduction of prevailing social relations. Ideas which provide a
more adequate account of the way society is structured and how
structured social relations produce concrete conditions of inequality
and exploitation can potentially inform efforts to change those social
relations. In this sense, [ideas which are false are ideological and, in
serving to promote the]{.underline} reproduction of the [status quo and
avoid]{.underline} attempts at [radical change]{.underline}, [are in the
interests of the powerful]{.underline}. An account which is objective
will contradict ideological ideas, implicitly or explicitly criticising
them for their false or flawed accounts of reality. The
[criticism]{.underline} here [arises]{.underline} not, or [not only,
from]{.underline} pointing out the coincidence between ideologies and
the interests of the powerful, nor from [a prior normative stance of
solidarity with the oppressed]{.underline}, **[but from exposing the
flaws in dominant ideologies through a more adequate
account]{.underline}** [of the nature and causes of social
conditions]{.underline} 31 .

**[A normative commitment to the oppressed must entail a commitment to
truth and objectivity, because true ideas are in the interest of the
oppressed, false ideas are in the interest of the
oppressors]{.underline}**. In other words, **[the best way to declare
solidarity with the oppressed is to declare one's commitment to
objective inquiry]{.underline}** 32 . [As Nzongola-Ntalaja]{.underline}
(1986: 10) [has put it]{.underline}:

[It is a question of whether one analyses society from the standpoint of
the **dominant groups**, who **have a vested interest in mystifying**
the way **society** works, or from the standpoint of ordinary people,
who have nothing to lose from truthful analyses of their
predicament]{.underline}.

[The **philosophical realist theory of science**, objectivity and
explanatory critique]{.underline} thus [provides an **alternative
response to the relationship between knowledge and power**]{.underline}.
[**Instead of choosing perspectives on the basis of our ethical
commitment to the cause of the oppressed** and to emancipatory social
change, **we should choose between contending ideas on the basis of
which provides a better account of objective social
reality**]{.underline}. [This will inherently provide a critique of the
ideologies which]{.underline}, by virtue of their flawed account of the
social world, [serve the interests of the powerful]{.underline}.

Exemplars of explanatory critique in International Relations are
provided in the work of scholars such as Siba Grovogui, James Gathii,
Anthony Anghie, Bhupinder Chimni, Jacques Depelchin, Hilbourne Watson,
Robert Vitalis, Sankaran Krishna, Michel-Rolph Trouillot 33 . Their work
provides critiques of central categories, theories and discourses in the
theory and practice of IR and narratives of world history, including
assumptions about sovereignty, international society, international law,
global governance, the nature of the state. They expose the ideological
and racialised nature of central aspects of IR through a critical
examination of both the long historical trajectory of imperial
ideologies regarding colonized peoples, and the actual practices of
colonialism and decolonisation in the constitution of international
orders and local social conditions. Their work identifies the flaws in
current ideas by revealing how they systematically misrepresent or
ignore the actual history of social change in Africa, the Caribbean and
other regions of the Third World, both past and present -- during both
colonial and neo-colonial periods of the imperial world order. Their
work reveals how racism, violence, exploitation and dispossession,
colonialism and neo-colonialism have been central to the making of
contemporary international order and contemporary doctrines of
international law, sovereignty and rights, and how such themes are
glaring in their absence from histories and theories of international
relations and international history.

[Objective social knowledge which accurately depicts and explains social
reality has these qualities by virtue of its **relation to its object,
not its subject**]{.underline}. As Collier argues, "The science/ideology
distinction is an epistemological one, not a social one." (Collier 1979:
60). So, [for example, in the work of Grovogui, Gathii and Depelchin,
the general perspective]{.underline} and knowledge [of]{.underline}
conditions in and [the history of Africa might be due]{.underline}
largely [to the African social origins of the authors]{.underline}.
[However the judgement that their accounts are superior]{.underline} to
those of mainstream IR [rests not on the fact that the authors are
African, but on the greater adequacy of their accounts]{.underline}
[with respect to]{.underline} the actual [historical and contemporary
production of conditions and change in Africa]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [elsewhere]{.underline} in the Third World. The
criteria for choosing their accounts over others derives from the
relation between the ideas and their objects (what they are about), not
from the relation between the ideas and their subjects (who produced
them). It is vital to retain explicitly some commitment to objectivity
in social inquiry, to the notion that the proper criterion for judging
ideas about the world lies in what they say about the world, not whose
ideas they are.

[A fundamental problem which underlies]{.underline} the origin and
reproduction of IR's [eurocentricity]{.underline} [is the overwhelming
dominance of ideas produced in and by the west, and the
wilful]{.underline} and determined **[silencing of the voices and
histories of the colonised]{.underline}**. **[But the result of this
fundamental problem is flawed knowledge about the world]{.underline}**.
**[Eurocentricity is therefore a dual problem concerning both the
authors and the content of knowledge, and cannot be resolved through
normative commitments alone]{.underline}**. It is not only the voices of
the colonised, but the histories of colonialism, which have been glaring
in their absence from the discipline of International Relations.

[Overcoming eurocentricity therefore requires not only concerted effort
from the centre to create space and listen to hitherto marginalised
voices, but **also commitment to correcting the flaws in prevailing
knowledge**]{.underline} -- **[and it is not only 'the Other' who can
and should elaborate this critique]{.underline}**. A vitally important
implication of objectivity is that **[it is the responsibility of
European and American, just as much as non-American or non-European
scholars, to decolonise IR]{.underline}**. [The importance of
objectivity]{.underline} in social inquiry defended here
[can]{.underline} perhaps **[be seen as a form of epistemological
internationalism]{.underline}**. **[It is not necessary to be African to
attempt to tell a more accurate account of the history of Europe's role
in the making of the contemporary Africa]{.underline}** and the rest of
the world, for example, [or to write counter-histories of
'the]{.underline} expansion of international society' which detail the
[systematic barbarity of]{.underline} so-called [Western
civilisation]{.underline}. It is not necessary to have been colonised to
recognise and document the violence, racism, genocide and dispossession
which have characterised European expansion over five hundred years.

### 2ac psychoanalysis racist

#### Psychoanalysis is antiblack.

Sciences, History and Philosophy, Birkbeck College, London, UK. Journal

Colonialism, Racism" 2013, Vol. 33, No. 3, 141--154

This article explores the prospects for a psychological contribution to
postcolonial thought through the mediation of psychoanalysis. It does
not attempt to deconstruct or historicize postcolonialism itself, at
least to any significant extent, further than to state the need for a
postcolonial theory of the subject that incorporates an understanding of
affective and "subjective" issues---precisely the area with which
psychoanalysis is primarily concerned. [The positioning of
psychoanalysis as a progressive, critical approach is not, however, a
particularly secure one]{.underline}. The central difficulty is the way
**[[psychoanalysis]{.mark} has [frequently aligned]{.mark} itself
[with]{.mark} conformist and even "[repressive" tendencies that
reproduce colonial]{.mark} [and]{.mark} at times [racist
tropes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [often in the context of psychological
individualism, but sometimes in an explicitly political
manner]{.underline} (Jacoby, 1983; Frosh, 1999). [**[This is
despite]{.mark}** the existence of **[a contrary urge in
psychoanalysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially reflected in the
"critical theory" tradition that made use of it in the 1950s and 1960s
(e.g., Marcuse, 1955) **[but also in the work of several followers of
Lacan]{.underline}** (Stavrakakis, 2007) and some British social
reformists (Rustin, 1991). The tendency of American ego psychology to
give prominence to "adaptationist" perspectives has been widely noted
and has been criticized both by political radicals (e.g., Jacoby, 1975,
1983) and by Lacanians (cf. Roudinesco, 1990, p. 175: "According to
\[Lacan\] such a psychological science had been affected by the ideals
of the society in which it was produced"). The adoption of a strong
antihomosexual bias by orthodox mid-20th century psychoanalysts has had
particularly damaging consequences for the practice and reputation of
psychoanalysis as a whole, even though recent attempts to reconcile
psychoanalysis and queer theory are beginning to bear fruit (Frosh,
2006; Campbell, 2000). Psychoanalytic assumptions about the nature of a
civilized mind will be briefly discussed below; but **[[overt]{.mark}
forms of [racism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, notably antisemitism, **[have
also on occasions been evident in its institutional
practices]{.underline}** (Frosh, 2005, 2012). Most relevantly,
**[[colonialism is]{.mark} a [deeply problematic]{.mark} issue
[for]{.mark} [psychoanalysis]{.mark}, because [it is engrained
in]{.mark} much [psychoanalytic thinking and terminology]{.mark}, and
this [has effects on contemporary theory and practice]{.mark} [in ways
that are not]{.mark} always [recognized]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For
example, as discussed further below, psychoanalysts often draw on the
language of the "primitive" to refer to unreasoning elements of people's
psychic lives. Thus, [a notion that someone might be evincing a
"primitive fantasy of destruction" is a very familiar one, but what is
not acknowledged is that this terminology not only has its roots in a
colonial opposition between primitive and civilized, but it also
reproduces this division "unconsciously" when it is used]{.underline}.
This is to say, the terminology is full of associations that position
some ideas as civilized and some as primitive, [reinforcing a
developmental scheme that is heavily inflected by assumptions about the
relationship between seemingly irrational and rational thought
processes--- and in particular who might "own" them. The
[history]{.mark} [of this stretches]{.mark} back [to the beginnings
of]{.mark} [psychoanalysis]{.mark}]{.underline}, reflecting the colonial
and racist (including antisemitic) assumptions prevalent in the Europe
out of which psychoanalysis arose. Freud deployed the idea that the
thinking of what he called "savages" was not only contrasted to
"civilized" mentality, but also revealed the origins of mental life both
for the culture as a whole (the contemporary savage being a throwback to
the precursors of modern "man") and for the individual (the savage mind
being like that of a child). For example, at the beginning of Totem and
Taboo, subtitled Some Points of Agreement between the Mental Lives of
Savages and Neurotics, he wrote, There are men still living who, as we
believe, stand very near to primitive man, far nearer than we do, and
whom we therefore regard as his direct heirs and representatives. Such
is our view of those whom we describe as savages or half-savages; and
their mental life must have a peculiar interest for us if we are right
in seeing in it a well-preserved picture of an early stage of our own
development. (Freud, 1913, pp. 1) The repetitive first person plural
pronoun is notable here: "we believe," "we do," "we regard," "our view,"
"we describe," "us," "our own development". The savage is the other, the
not "us"; though as will be outlined briefly below, there is quite a
degree of subtlety in what this might mean. Freud also was explicit
about how "savages" share attributes with children, both in terms of how
they think, and how they are thought about by "we adults". "It seems to
me quite possible," he wrote (p. 99), "that the same may be true of our
attitude toward the psychology of those races that have remained at the
animistic level as is true of our attitude toward the mental life of
children, which we adults no longer understand and whose fullness and
delicacy of feeling we have in consequence so greatly underestimated".
The adoption of a binary between savage and civilized is not perhaps
intrinsically racist and colonialist, but the assumption that the latter
always displaces the former and, more importantly, that the terms can be
applied to different people, is. In Freud's thought, savage societies
hold to various types of irrational thinking (concreteness, mystical
attitudes to death, etc.), processes reviewed throughout Totem and Taboo
(Freud, 1913) and explicitly linked with children in more "civilized"
societies. For instance, in writing of wish fulfillment (p. 84), Freud
commented, If children and primitive men find play and imitative
representation enough for them, that is not a sign of their being
unassuming in our sense or of their resignedly accepting their actual
impotence. It is the easily understandable result of the paramount
virtue they ascribe to their wishes, of the will that is associated with
those wishes and of the methods by which those wishes operate. These
ways of thinking make them "primitive" in the developmental sense that
they should normatively be overcome by more advanced modes of being---a
theme also taken up in the analysis of religion in The Future of an
Illusion (Freud, 1927). Although Freud himself does not press for
political action that does this--- he was interested rather in how
science might overcome superstition---the general approach is consistent
with the justification of colonialism and even slavery on the grounds of
the inherent inferiority of the primitive. There is another subtle turn
here, however, that is specific to Freud and the early history of
psychoanalysis, relating to the intense antisemitism of Freud's time.
Gilman (1993) showed how deeply rooted antisemitism was in the beliefs
of many Europeans, markedly so in the Viennese among whom psychoanalysis
grew up, and how widespread were ideas such as that Jews were castrated
(hence, feminine), that they were "oriental" and maybe even "black," and
that they were primitive in the religious sense (Christianity having
displaced Judaism) but also psychologically, socially, and racially.
Gilman suggested that Freud, consciously or unconsciously, constructed
some of the most conspicuously radical elements of his theory in
response to this. For instance, Gilman argued that the trope that Jewish
men are castrated through circumcision is replaced in psychoanalysis by
the idea that the castration complex is universal, so that all people---
including the most gentile---follow a model set by the Jews. This
Freudian impulse to disarm antisemitism by positioning the Jews as the
truly civilized people (which was mirrored in the idea that as
nationalism took hold in Europe at the end of the 19th century, the Jews
might be the only "true Europeans" oriented toward a transnational
comity) results in a shifting of the "other" of European society away
from the Jew and toward the "savage," that is, the colonized, Black
"primitive" of slavery and the European imagination. This theoretical
move attempts to relieve Jews from the opprobrium of primitivity
(unsuccessfully, as was demonstrated unequivocally just a few years
later) by passing it onto the colonized other. There is always a danger
with summary accounts such as this one, that the history it sketches
simplistically reduces a tension-filled and ambiguous process to a
linear narrative. It is certainly the case, for example, that
psychoanalysis was from the start full of impulses that challenged and
subverted the assumptions of the societies in which it found itself.
Indeed, this is one reason for the mixture of explosive embrace and
resistance that characterized the response to psychoanalysis: On the one
hand, it fuelled enormous shifts in self-perception, artistic creativity
and even political and economic thought (not confined to outspoken
radicals--- see, e.g., John Maynard Keynes', 1919, 1936, post-World War
1 use of Freudian ideas to argue for the importance of emotional factors
in economics). In many respects, it is precisely in the tension between
what Toril Moi (1989, p. 197) called, in relation to the attitude of
psychoanalysis to femininity, Freud's "colonizing impulse" and its
contrary acceptance of "the logic of another scene"---the specific
expressiveness of unconscious life---that the creativity of
psychoanalysis inheres. Nevertheless, consideration of the rootedness of
much psychoanalytic thought in colonial assumptions is important not
merely to sweep away the ideological detritus, but also to identify
where the investments of psychoanalysis can provide leverage for
understanding the place of psychosocial theory in the postcolonial
project. A further example of the "detritus" might be found in some work
by Celia Brickman (2003), which offers an extensive account of how the
language of primitivity infects psychoanalysis. Like Gilman, she notes
how Freud's "universalizing reconfigurations" (p. 165) turn the despised
Jewish body into the model for humanity as a whole. From the perspective
of postcolonialism, however, this move, which is subversive in relation
to antisemitism, is "made at considerable expense," because "the
modalities of inferiority previously ascribed to the Jews did not simply
disappear but were ambivalently displaced onto a series of abjected
others: primitives, women and homosexuals". Brickman elaborated on how
the assimilation of the Jewish other to Europeanism positions
psychoanalysis as a colonialist discipline and incorporates racism into
its fabric of argumentation. Categorized as a member of a primitive
race, Freud repudiated primitivity, locating himself and his work within
European civilization, with both its scientific and colonizing
enterprises, and replacing the opposition of Aryan/Jew with the
opposition of civilized/primitive (p. 167). In relation to
psychoanalytic practice, primitive usually means either or both of
fundamental and irrational. [A primitive impulse is never a rational
one; it always arises unmediated from the unconscious and hence has not
been worked over by the secondary processes of thought. The sleight of
hand then is to link this kind of primitivity with the irrationality of
the colonized other and then to make rationality itself the marker of
civilized human society]{.underline}--- or even of what it means to be
human at all. After all, when one loses one's power of reason, one
ceases to be able to function as human at least to the degree that equal
citizenship is at risk. [In the colonial context, this justifies
colonization: irrational primitives cannot be trusted to run their own
affairs; the civilized European is justifiably superior, for everyone's
good]{.underline}. Commenting on Freud's anthropological speculation,
Brickman (2003) noted how the psyche comes to be envisaged as a
representation of colonialism and hence how Freud explicitly parallels
the structure of the mind with that of (colonial) society: \[By\]
correlating the progression of narcissism, the oedipal stage, and
maturity with animism (savagery), religion (barbarianism), and science
(civilisation), Totem and Taboo transposed the racial assumptions of the
cultural evolutionary scale onto the modern psyche . . . The
psychoanalytically conceived norm of mature subjectivity was, by virtue
of the correlation of libidinal development with the cultural
evolutionary scale, a rationalism whose unstated color was white, just
as its unstated gender was male. (p. 72) **[[Even though these Freudian
assumptions are mainly unstated]{.mark}, [the terminology and the
conceptual baggage of the savage" and the barbarian remained with
psychoanalysis for some time and is still lying only just-dormant in
those references to "primitive feelings]{.mark}]{.underline}**" that
often can be found in clinical psychoanalytic discussions. [[A]{.mark}
certain **[mode of rationality]{.mark}** [is given]{.mark} [priority
here]{.mark}, **[which is attached to masculine "reason"]{.mark}** as it
has developed over the period of industrial modernity]{.underline}
(Frosh, 1994). [That which falls short of it---[the]{.mark}
**["unreason" attributed to women, children, and primitive
cultures]{.mark}**---[is derogated and made subject to reason's
imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not, of course, to imply that
one should fully affirm unreason as a simple alternative to colonial
reason; it is rather to claim that the reason-- unreason opposition is
itself rooted in a colonial mentality that supports it and narrows the
range of what is culturally validated. In a similar vein, Neil Altman
(2000, p. 591) commented, "When Freud the ego psychologist said, 'Where
id was, there ego shall be,' he defined the goals of psychoanalysis in
terms reminiscent of the colonial mentality. In this sense, the
structure of racism is built into structural psychoanalytic theory,
particularly in its ego-psychological form". This claim is itself
resonant of the critique of ego psychology mentioned earlier. The
argument runs that because this form of psychoanalysis assumes reason to
be superior to unreason, its concurrent assumption that unreason is
characteristic of "primitives" means that it is promoting a colonizing
process (reason trumping unreason; civilized displacing primitive) that
is embedded in a racist paradigm. As an instructive aside, it is perhaps
worth noting that ego psychology itself has a complex set of origins,
one of which regularly gets lost when its notions of adaptation are
pronounced solely conformist and colonialist. The occlusion here is of
the personal history of most of the postSecond World War American ego
psychologists as migrants or refugees from Nazi Europe. Their concerns
were indeed to find creative ways to adapt to a new society; in
addition, they were exercised by the explosion of irrationality that had
overwhelmed their lost homelands, and their impulse to find ways to fend
this off and protect future societies from its recurrence was perhaps
understandable.

[as though to interpret the world is more important than to change it,

[alibis]{.underline} for themselves in the very work they

[psychoanalysis]{.underline}. What Marshall Berman says of Foucault
seems true also of **[[psychoanalysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**; that it
**[[offers \`a]{.mark} world-[historical alibi\' for]{.mark} the
[passivity]{.mark} and helplessness]{.underline}** felt by many in the
1970s, **[[and]{.mark} that [it has nothing but contempt for those
naive]{.mark} enough [to imagine that it might be possible for]{.mark}
modern [human-kind to be free]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [At every turn for
such theorists,]{.underline} as Berman argues, whether in sexuality,
politics, even our imagination, [we are nothing but
prisoners]{.underline}: there is no freedom in Foucault\'s world,
because his language forms a seamless web, a cage far more airtight than
anything Weber ever dreamed of, into which no life can break . . .
**[[There is no point in trying to resist]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[oppression]{.mark}s]{.underline}** and injustices of modern life,
[since even our dreams of freedom only add more links to our
chains]{.underline}; [[however, once we grasp]{.mark} the
[futility]{.mark} of it all, [at least we can
relax]{.mark}]{.underline}.59 Cohen\'s **[political
[defeatism]{.mark}]{.underline}** and his conviction in the explanatory
power of his new faith **[[of psychoanalysis lead him to
be]{.mark}]{.underline}** contemptuous and **[[dismissive of any attempt
at]{.mark} political solidarity or [collective
action]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [For him, \`communities\' are always
\`imagined\']{.underline}, which, in his view, means [based on
fantasy]{.underline}, while different forms of working-class
organisation, from the craft fraternity to the revolutionary group, are
dismissed as \`fantasies of self-sufficient combination\'.60 **[[In this
scenario, the idea that people might come
together]{.underline}]{.mark}**, think together, analyse together **[and
act together as rational beings [is impossible]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[The idea of a genuine community of equals becomes a pure
fantasy]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [a \`symbolic retrieval\' of something
that never existed in the first place:]{.underline} \`Community is a
magical device for conjuring something apparently solidary out of the
thin air of modern times, a mechanism of re-enchantment.\' As for
[history]{.underline}, it [is always false]{.underline}, since \`We are
always dealing with invented traditions.\'61 Now, **[[this
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** not only non- sense, but **[[dangerous
nonsense]{.underline}]{.mark}** at that. Is history \`always false\'?
Did the Judeocide happen or did it not? And did not some people even try
to resist it? Did slavery exist or did it not, and did not people resist
that too and, ultimately, bring it to an end? And are communities always
\`imagined\'? Or, as Sivanandan states, are they beaten out on the
smithy of a people\'s collective struggle? Furthermore, all attempts to
legislate against ideology are bound to fail because they have to adopt
\`technologies of surveillance and control identical to those used by
the state\'. Note here the Foucauldian language to set up the notion
that all \`surveillance\' is bad. But is it? No society can function
without surveillance of some kind. The point, surely, is that there
should be a public conversation about such moves and that those
responsible for implementing them be at all times accountable. To
equate, as Cohen does, a council poster about \`Stamping out racism\'
with Orwell\'s horrendous prophecy in 1984 of a boot stamping on a human
face is ludicrous and insulting. (Orwell\'s image was intensely personal
and destructive; the other is about the need to challenge not
individuals, but a collective evil.) [Cohen reveals himself to be deeply
ambivalent about punitive action against racists]{.underline}, as though
punishment or other firrm action against them (or anyone else
transgressing agreed social or legal norms) precluded \`understand-
ing\' or even help through psychotherapy. It is indeed a strange kind of
\`anti-racism\' that portrays active racists as the \`victims\', those
who are in need of \`help\'. But this is where Cohen\'s argument ends
up. **[[In their move from politics to the academy]{.mark} and the world
of \`discourse\', the [postmodernists]{.mark} may have simply [exchanged
one]{.mark} grand [narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}**, historical
materialism, **[[for]{.underline}]{.mark}** another,
**[[psychoanalysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**.62 For
[psychoanalysis]{.underline} is a grand narrative, par excellence. It is
a theory that seeks to account for the world and which [recognises few
limits on its explanatory potential]{.underline}. And [the claimed
radicalism of psycho- analysis]{.underline}, in the hands of the
postmodernists at least, [is]{.underline} not a radicalism at all but [a
prescription for a politics of quietism, fatalism and
defeat.]{.underline} **[[Those wanting to change the world]{.mark}, not
