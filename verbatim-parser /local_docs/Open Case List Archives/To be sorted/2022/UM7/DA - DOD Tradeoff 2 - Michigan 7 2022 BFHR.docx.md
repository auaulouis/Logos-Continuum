#### Pivot to Asia is strong, despite Ukraine

College (Trisha, "Commentary: The US 'pivot to Asia' is back, but will
it be enough?: **[Despite]{.underline}** war in

[With the situation in Ukraine, there were fears that an international
crisis elsewhere]{.underline} in the world [would]{.underline} once
again [push Asia off America's agenda]{.underline}. The Iran nuclear
deal under Obama or the withdrawal from Afghanistan early in Biden's
presidency seemed to draw attention away. **[However]{.underline}**, the
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** war seems to have
**[strengthened]{.underline}** **[the administration's]{.underline}**
resolve and **[alliance]{.underline}** **[building]{.underline}**.
[Biden's careful outreach to re-engage traditional allies]{.underline}
early in his presidency [allowed him to effectively build a coalition of
European and Asian partners]{.underline} to isolate Russia after its
invasion. The show of unity and speedy coordination may change security
calculations in the Indo-Pacific. [Security issues were part of the
backdrop to Biden's first trip to Asia]{.underline}, especially given
the parallels between Taiwan and Ukraine that many have drawn. [The trip
reinforced a renewed sense of US engagement]{.underline}, after previous
trips to the region by Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State
Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Austin. [Biden's meetings both
with]{.underline} the leaders of South Korea and Japan and [the
Quad]{.underline} were meant to **[reassure]{.underline}** [allies of US
commitment]{.underline}, but also produced concrete outcomes like
Japan's plan to raise defence spending substantially. On the heels of
Biden's trip, Austin met his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe, in person
for the first time at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. While Austin
pushed back against China's "more coercive and aggressive approach to
its territorial claims" when addressing the conference, he also
highlighted the importance of security alliances and partnerships in the
region, such as AUKUS with Australia and the United Kingdom. WHY PIVOT
TO ASIA IS STILL THE RIGHT STRATEGY FOR US **[Asia will remain the
central focus for the US]{.underline}** -- it has no choice if it wants
to share in the region's economic growth and tap on regional partners to
counter China. In the important areas of trade and security, the US
position has seemed inconsistent or mercurial in recent years. **[The
Biden]{.underline}** administration's current focus on policies like
IPEF, and careful cultivation of traditional regional partners may seem
like a watered-down version of the much vaunted **[pivot]{.underline}**.
But after the administration changes, any clarity on the US stance,
particularly on trade, **[is welcome]{.underline}**. A return to
multilateralism certainly is. Ideally, the US would offer more concrete
and far-reaching policies, to show up as a more attractive partner than
China and reassure the region of its long-term commitment. But as
veteran diplomats have said, the United States is a necessary part of
the strategic balance in Asia regardless. [Biden's]{.underline} version
of the [pivot may lay the foundations for **sustainable**,
**productive**, and **cooperative** engagement with the
region]{.underline}.

[The United States "pivot to Asia" **is back**]{.underline}. [The shift
in US foreign]{.underline}, economic and security [policy to Asia has
been re-energised **over the past month**]{.underline}, after being
sidelined by both domestic politics and foreign crises since it began
about a decade ago under the Obama administration. US President Joe
[Biden hosted leaders o]{.underline}f the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations ([ASEAN]{.underline}) [in Washington]{.underline} for a two-day
summit, which last took place in 2016. It ended with an agreement to
upgrade US-ASEAN ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and a
nominee for US ambassador to ASEAN, a post vacant since 2017. [This was
quickly followed by Biden's inaugural trip to Asia]{.underline}, with
visits to South Korea and Japan, including a Tokyo summit of the Quad,
the informal alliance of the US, Japan, Australia and India. More
recently, US Secretary of Defence Lloyd [Austin addressed
the]{.underline} Shangri-La Dialogue, the [annual Asian security
conference]{.underline} in Singapore that concluded **[on Jun
12]{.underline}**, [reaffirming that the Indo-Pacific is "our **centre
of strategic gravity**]{.underline}". [This focus by the Biden
administration comes at a time of war in Ukraine]{.underline} and
domestic political problems. It is meant [to reassure the region that
the US **isn't too busy in Europe** or distracted at home to prioritise
relationships with Asia and push back against China]{.underline}.

[The war in Ukraine]{.underline}, and Allied efforts to assist Ukraine
and to bolster deterrence in the East, [seem to have led to a revival of
the transatlantic relationship, and a renewed focus on Europe, including
for the United States]{.underline}. **[Yet contrary to what one may
instinctively think]{.underline}**, the war in **[Ukraine is unlikely to
alter the]{.underline}** steady shift **[in the centre of global
strategy and politics]{.underline}** -- **[or]{.underline}**, for that
matter, of **[US geostrategy]{.underline}** -- **[towards the
Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}**. Rather than halt a shift towards the
Indo-Pacific, the Ukraine crisis and the response to it so far, provide
a powerful illustration of how European geopolitical and security
dynamics are increasingly affected by extra-European ones.

There are, however, several dynamics that reveal the limits of the
fail-deadly and fail-safe logics underlying NATO's collective defense
initiatives. In short, these strategic logics only apply to a narrow set
of threats; they will not apply to the full spectrum of threats
presented by the cyber domain. Fail-deadly deterrence is only likely to
succeed in preventing state-level adversaries from undertaking
resource-intensive cyber operations that reach the threshold of armed
conflict with physical, destructive effects and that are quickly
attributable.38 Fail-safe defensive measures also face several political
and technical challenges, all of which point to a role for cyber
resilience.

Three main complications limit the applicability of the fail-deadly
logics underpinning collective defense efforts in cyberspace. The first
is deciding which actors are to be deterred. Compared to traditional
warfighting domains, there are relatively low entry costs for conducting
operations in the cyber domain.39 As such, both state and non-state
actors can target the Alliance. There are also asymmetric operational
costs---actors are faced with multiple avenues for potential gains and
few risks. This means that it will be near-impossible to change the
decision calculus of a malicious actor deploying low-cost, low-risk
techniques such as distributed denials of service. Conversely,
sophisticated [cyber operations that can produce strategic
effects]{.underline} equivalent to those of conventional military
attacks [will have both significant and costly intelligence requirements
that can only be borne by state actors. These high]{.underline}er
['start-up' costs]{.underline} mean it may be possible to [change the
decision calculus of actors seeking to conduct highly sophisticated
cyber operations]{.underline}. Due to this asymmetry, only state actors
undertaking costly cyber operations are likely to be deterred. In all
other circumstances, deterrence will be more prone to failure.40

#### Enhanced [shared OCOs]{.underline} drain military resources

[The Pentagon's new commitment also reflects changes in how Europe talks
about cybersecurity]{.underline} and characterizes the Russian threat.
[The last two years have seen a trend toward more open discussion of
offensive cyber operations and the possibility of the alliance adopting
more assertive postures]{.underline} to counter cyber operations against
its members. After years of devastating ransomware attacks and
cyber-enabled information attacks, NATO members are more willing to
explore cyber triggers to Article 5. They have also been more willing to
articulate the cyber threat against the alliance. In addition to last
week's denunciation by Dutch, UK, and U.S. authorities, Russian state
actors are widely suggested to be responsible for an increasingly brazen
series of operations, including targeting German government ministries,
French and British TV stations, and more.

Sharing offensive cyber capabilities raises the question of whether
cyber operations can extend effective deterrence to NATO partners. There
seems to be little focus on using these operations to deter conventional
or nuclear attacks on NATO countries, but this may evolve. [The United
States seems to want NATO to use cyber operations to deter other cyber
operations]{.underline}, particularly those falling under the threshold
of armed conflict. Cyber operations have all sorts of problems for
deterrence: signaling is difficult, they can be perceived as a cheap
threat, and their effects are largely uncertain. By contrast, moving new
military forces in Eastern Europe or conducting ground exercises are
credible signals of extended deterrence, but are costly and time
consuming. **[Cyber capabilities aren't]{.underline}** free, nor are
they necessarily **[cheap]{.underline}**, but the promise to use them
can add new credibility to a deterrent threat without the same
investment and delay as conventional alternatives. Sharing cyber
capabilities may be a cheaper way to signal alliance commitment than
other options and might signal a further maturation, and acceptance, of
cybersecurity into geopolitics.

### !\-\--Turns Case

#### Asian war decks US commitments to NATO

Security Council, State Department, and the National Defense University;

Beyond, (131-156), 2021.

[The United States\' relationship with the Alliance]{.underline} a
decade from now [will depend upon]{.underline} at least four variables.
First, will the return to solid US support for the Alliance seen during
President Biden\'s Summit meetings in June 2021 be sustained for the
next decade, or will US populism grow and return the nation to some form
of America First? The outcome is uncertain, but the resurrection of a
populist United States cannot be ruled out; Europe needs to begin
planning for this contingency. Second, will the military threats to the
United States and its NATO Allies continue to expand? Major power
threats from Russia and **[China]{.underline}** appear to be on the
rise, with both nations increasing their defense cooperation. North
Korea and Iran appear to pose increasing nuclear proliferation risks and
are drawing closer to both of these two major power adversaries. The
threat of extremism from the Middle East is also likely to continue.
[America risks being overextended in dealing with]{.underline} these
**[multiple challenges]{.underline}**. This dynamic will require that
America\'s global alliances thrive. But [since the military challenge in
Asia is greatest, the United States might]{.underline} again [be
**forced to pivot much of its attention to Asia**]{.underline}. Third,
the scope of the non-military or unconventional challenges facing NATO
will probably also continue to expand. These challenges include
cyberattacks, disinformation, other forms of unconventional warfare,
coercive diplomacy, global warming, and public health issues. To remain
relevant, the scope of NATO\'s missions will need to continue to expand
to address these non-military challenges. And fourth, with the above
three factors in play, the final variable is: can European members of
the Alliance increase their political cohesion and their defense
contributions to meet their share of these growing challenges? The
requirement is there but European willpower is also uncertain.

### AT: Deficit Spending 

#### Normal means is not deficit spending\-\--Ukraine.

in Ukraine aid\"; POLITICO; Published: 6-2-2022; Accessed: 6-21-2022;

KL\]

[The Pentagon was **already struggling** to keep up with Congress'
demands for oversight of its spending]{.underline}. Then, lawmakers
earmarked an extra \$40 billion for Ukraine.

Concerns are mounting on Capitol Hill about the Biden administration's
ability to properly account for the unprecedented wave of cash and to
track the thousands of U.S. weapons heading to Ukraine for its war with
Russia. And [given the Pentagon's recent **track record** concerning
congressional oversight, it's coming under **increased
scrutiny**]{.underline} [from members of **both parties**]{.underline}
--- [from]{.underline} progressive Elizabeth [**Warren** to]{.underline}
libertarian **[Rand Paul]{.underline}**.

Some lawmakers are already warning the Biden administration that [a
**future** aid package could **lose**]{.underline} the overwhelming
**[congressional support]{.underline}** that has been a hallmark of the
previous efforts. A key barometer will be [the Pentagon's]{.underline}
handling and complete [accounting of the funds]{.underline}, which [has
**lagged**]{.underline} in other areas, [**sparking scrutiny** from
congressional committees]{.underline}.

Sen. Warren (D-Mass.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, said in
an email that a full accounting of the already-appropriated funding will
be "critically important for both past and future funding requests."

"The U.S. government is sending billions in humanitarian, economic, and
military assistance to help the Ukrainian people overcome Putin's brutal
war, and the American people expect strong oversight by Congress and
full accounting from the Department of Defense," she added.

Pentagon spokesperson Marine Corps Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth said the
department is "committed" to transparency with the public and with
Congress about the security assistance funds. But he stressed that war
involves risk, and called on Russia to end the conflict.

"Risk of diversion is one of many considerations that we routinely
assess when evaluating any potential arms transfer," Semelroth said. "In
this case, risk would be considerably minimized by the full withdrawal
from Ukraine by Russian forces."

While all Democrats and most Republicans voted for the aid package in
May, [it's **unclear**]{.underline} [whether that coalition can stick
together if]{.underline} President Joe [Biden asks Congress for more
money]{.underline} before the end of the fiscal year, as many on the
Hill predict will be the case. The Pentagon already owes Congress a
backlog of reports on its spending for European security, and
[progressives and conservatives]{.underline} alike have [said they'll be
looking]{.underline} for more cooperation [before approving another cash
infusion.]{.underline}

Amid the Pentagon-Hill squabbling, Biden announced on Wednesday the
first tranche of military assistance from the massive funding bill that
cleared both chambers last month. And oversight concerns are at the
forefront, as the newly announced \$700 million package for the first
time includes a more advanced, precision-guided rocket system that will
allow Ukraine to strike targets even further away --- potentially in
Russia.

The Biden administration deliberated for weeks over whether to send the
High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, and medium or
long-range munitions. Officials worried that providing longer-range
rockets could provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin into escalating
the conflict. They ultimately decided to send the shorter-range rockets,
which can reach 48 miles, instead of the longer-range munitions, which
can fly 190 miles.

Officials worry about the department's ability to keep track of all the
weapons the U.S. is providing, including the HIMARS, as well as ensuring
they are being used effectively. Kyiv has given Washington "assurances"
that it will only use the rockets on the battlefield in Ukraine, and not
to strike targets in Russia, senior administration officials said. But
they did not detail those assurances, and there is concern that the
Pentagon has no way to monitor the use of the weapons.

Semelroth said the department is "confident in the Ukrainian
government's ability to appropriately safeguard and account for
transferred U.S.-origin defense equipment," noting that Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin has underscored the importance of
"accountability" to his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov.

"Ukrainian leadership have assured us that they understand the
importance of accountability, and we are committed to working with them
to further enhance accountability in the future," Semelroth said.

A senior congressional official familiar with the oversight process
described it as "quite robust" and said the administration has been
briefing Hill committees regularly.

"In most cases, it's munitions going out of our stocks and into the
hands of Ukraine. One Howitzer out for us, one in for them," the
official said, granted anonymity to speak about sensitive briefings.

The \$40 billion legislation includes several measures aimed at beefing
up oversight of the cash. It requires the Pentagon inspector general's
office to review how the Defense Department spends the emergency
funding. It also requires the Pentagon, in coordination with the State
Department, to report to Congress on how weapons and equipment sent to
Ukraine are being accounted for.

Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a member of the Armed Services Committee,
acknowledged that U.S. weapons sent to war zones have often gone missing
or unused, but said "Ukraine is a different story" because its forces
are well-trained and have been using the weapons for several years
already.

"Obviously, we always have to be on the lookout, but this is not the
same scenario that we have in the past," Gallego said. "There have been
agreements between our governments about \[some of the weapons'\] usage.
And I believe so far Ukraine has abided by all of them."

The Biden administration is using several metrics to determine how best
to allocate the money, including the selection of systems that will help
beat back Russia, but not fuel a wider conflict. Another consideration
is not sending Ukrainians cutting-edge technology, given U.S. concerns
the weapons could fall into Russian hands. If that happened, the
Russians could reverse-engineer those systems and create new weapons for
its military, according to an official with knowledge of the discussions
who was not authorized to speak on the record.

"We in the administration have to very prudently measure those risks ...
and to think very carefully about how can we best ... give the Ukrainian
military what they need," Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told the
Atlantic Council on Tuesday.

The White House is hoping the latest emergency funding measure is enough
to sustain Ukraine through the next several months of the conflict, but
Congress is already bracing for the next cash fight.

At a confirmation hearing last week, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, Biden's
nominee to lead U.S. European Command, indicated that he believed that
Americans are owed "a thoughtful application of those funds and a full
accounting of them."

That's going to be a heavy lift for the Pentagon, which already owes the
Senate Armed Services Committee "several years" worth of reports,
according to Warren. That includes billions of dollars already allocated
for the European Deterrence Initiative, a program aimed at bolstering
U.S. presence on the continent following Russia's 2014 seizure of
Crimea. Warren said she was "getting sick of the run-around here" and
said the Pentagon "has not complied with the law."

In a recent letter to the Pentagon's finance chief obtained by POLITICO,
Warren wrote that "tracking this spending is a key part of how we
protect American interests and support of our allies."

Although every Democrat in both the Senate and House voted for the \$40
billion aid package last month, [several progressives were **reluctant**
to support it given their existing concerns about a **bloated
Pentagon**]{.underline}, as well as their general opposition to flooding
a war zone with new weapons. Congressional leaders significantly boosted
the humanitarian assistance portion, mollifying lawmakers who had
considered voting against the bill.

[Sen. Paul]{.underline} (R-Ky.), who [held up the]{.underline} \$40
billion aid [package amid his demands that Congress tap a special
inspector general to **monitor**]{.underline} [the spending]{.underline}
of the Ukraine funds, has raised similar concerns.

[A **fiscal hawk**]{.underline}, [Paul joined **10** other GOP senators
and **57** House Republicans in voting **against** the aid bill, with
several arguing that there wasn't stringent enough
**oversight**]{.underline} of the money. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) argued
the money "comes \[with\] no meaningful oversight."

The latest round of emergency funding dwarfs an earlier \$14 billion
package enacted by Congress in March and supersizes several programs to
aid Ukraine's military, including \$6 billion for the Ukraine Security
Assistance Initiative, a Pentagon program that helps arm the Ukrainian
military. In a government-wide funding deal passed in March, by
contrast, lawmakers allocated \$300 million for the account.

The package also raises the total authority to ship weapons to Ukraine
from U.S. military inventories to \$11 billion. Additionally, the
Pentagon was granted nearly \$9 billion in new funding to replace
weapons that have been sent into the fight.
