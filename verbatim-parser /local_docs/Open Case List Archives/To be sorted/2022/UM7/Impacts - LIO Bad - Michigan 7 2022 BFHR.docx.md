**Global Governance:** Chinese backlash to the LIO causes global
governance collapse. Only inclusion into global norms allows for a) a
wider variety of problem solving and b) prevents total collapse from

perspectives

**China Backlash:** China is not revisionist, but if they are forced out
of the international order (not LIO) or the US keeps its leadership
their only option is to violently react rather than cooperate which is
more escalatory

#### Trying to maintain the [US LED]{.underline} order fails and [ensures extinction]{.underline}. China can be [integrated]{.underline} into the world order BUT only if the US takes a step back

[It may be easy]{.underline}, and perhaps natural, [for the would-be
architects]{.underline} of the new system to [organize it around
Washington]{.underline}. But **[that would be a mistake]{.underline}**.
[The enemies of this new order]{.underline}, **[united by their
resentment of the United States]{.underline}**, [will seek to discredit
it]{.underline} **[as just another effort to dominate global
affairs.]{.underline}** For this new order to be viable[, it must be
conceived in such a way that]{.underline} **[the charge is
false.]{.underline}**

The new order [must also be decentralized to be effective]{.underline};
the [resources and wisdom needed to solve many vexing
problems]{.underline} are **[not concentrated in the United
States]{.underline}**. For instance, on the enormous issue of defining
rules for a digitized world, [Washington has been **confused and
passive,**]{.underline} despite---or perhaps because of---its dominance
in such commerce. It is the European Union that has led the way. The
EU's General Data Protection Regulation, its Digital Services Act, and
its Digital Markets Act created the standards that influence most of the
world, including the Americas. Decentralized leadership has also proved
critical to responding to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The [nucleus
of the emerging pro-Ukraine coalition]{.underline}, for instance, is
[not just the United States but the entire G-7,]{.underline} including
the European Commission. South Korea and Australia should be invited to
join this coalition as well.

Yet a [revised system of world order shouldn't be limited]{.underline}
**[to the United States and its traditional allies]{.underline}**. [It
must be open to any countries that can and will help attain its common
objectives. I]{.underline}ndia should have a place at any symbolic high
table, for example, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
But India's leaders are still making their choices about their will and
capacity to work on common problems. Even **[China should be welcome at
the table.]{.underline}** After much internal debate in the early 1990s,
[China's leaders chose to play a major and often **constructive role in
the global commonwealth system**]{.underline} that emerged after the end
of the Cold War. In 2005, Zoellick famously urged Beijing to become a
"responsible stakeholder." As late as 2017, Kurt Campbell, who now leads
Asia policy for the Biden White House, thought this invitation was a
wise move.

But Zoellick's words were a challenge, one that Beijing is failing to
meet. China's partnership with Putin---whom Xi described to the Russian
press as "my best and bosom friend"---is the opposite of responsible.
Instead, it shows that China and Russia lead a primarily Eurasian
grouping of dangerous states, including the likes of Iran, North Korea,
and Pakistan. Their loose confederation has its cross-purposes and is
united mainly by hostility toward the United States. But it is building
tighter links, better divisions of labor, and more effective
coordination than existed among the Axis powers before or during World
War II.

For these and other reasons, [pessimists believe China is irredeemably
hostile]{.underline}. They argue that China has written off the United
States as a country determined to resist China's rise and that Chinese
leaders may feel they have little to lose by embracing confrontation. In
this pessimistic view, China is trying to shift from the post--Cold War
era's emphasis on global interdependence toward a Chinese grand strategy
of Eurasian dominance and growing national self-sufficiency. China's
leaders are now using the pandemic to keep a chokehold on international
travel and strengthen domestic surveillance.

That does seem to be China's current plan. But it is **[unclear whether
this plan will work]{.underline}**. It [rests on unproven social,
political, and economic premises]{.underline} that are [starting to
deeply disturb parts of Chinese society]{.underline} essential to its
past and future success---such as the many residents of Shanghai who
have been trapped during the city's draconian recent lockdown.

[Chinese leaders may]{.underline} also have [noticed that, in backing
the Putin regime]{.underline}, they have [tethered themselves to an
adventurist Russian government]{.underline} that, for 30 years, has
treated its neighbors much as Japan treated China between 1915 and 1945.
For instance, Putin insists that Russia is not invading Ukraine. There
is no war, he declared; there is only a "special military operation."
Many Chinese people will recall that, from 1937 to 1941, Japan insisted
that it, too, was not invading China. There was no war, the Japanese
said; there was merely a "China incident."

Throughout the years of Japanese aggression, the United States defended
China's territorial integrity. Even amid times of misjudgment and
weakness, Washington maintained that stance, refusing in November 1941
to make a deal with Japan at China's expense. Ten days later, Japan went
to war against the United States. As they watch what is happening in
2022, Chinese leaders can still reflect on this past and consider what
decisions to make.

[If Beijing charts a new course,]{.underline} it **[would not be the
first time it has chosen to change.]{.underline}** But [if China does
rejoin a system of world order**, it should be a new one**]{.underline}.
Th[e old system has **fractured and must be remade**]{.underline}.
Facing tragic realities, [the citizens of the free world must rebuild a
global order]{.underline} that is **[practical enough to address the
most vital common problems]{.underline}**, even if it cannot and does
not promise progress on all the values and concerns people face. [This
system will be far more effective if]{.underline} **[the world's most
populous country joins it, and China faces another time of
choosing]{.underline}**. Regardless of China's participation,
responsible actors must begin the hard, substantive work of [protecting
the planet from]{.underline} **[war, climate, economic, and health
risks]{.underline}**. The time for rhetoric and posturing is over.

#### Chinese led order is key to prevent [great power war]{.underline}\-\--transition is [possible and peaceful]{.underline} ONLY if there is not [US backlash]{.underline}

Both [Russia's scorched-earth invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} and the
[swift fury of the U.S.]{.underline} and European Union-led global
response **[seem to have come as a shock to Beijing]{.underline}**.
[China's]{.underline} ambiguous stance---clearly
[anti-American]{.underline} but not explicitly pro-Russian or
anti-Ukrainian---in part [comes]{.underline} **[because the West's
surprisingly strong response has frustrated Chinese
ambitions.]{.underline}**

It may not have fully sunk in yet in Beijing, but the resurgence of an
economic and strategically unified West, and the risk of the financial
and political liability of protecting a dependent, wrecked petrostate,
should lead Chinese President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping to [see the
wisdom of]{.underline} **[cooperating with the global economic
order]{.underline}**, [albeit with a **larger Chinese
voice**]{.underline} and modest distancing from its partner in Moscow.
Despite its echoing of Russian disinformation, [Beijing]{.underline} has
cautiously [cut off A]{.underline}sian [I]{.underline}nfrastructure
[I]{.underline}nvestment [B]{.underline}ank [loans and trade financing
to Moscow,]{.underline} and China's state-run Sinopec halted gas and
petrochemical projects in Russia. With \$3 trillion in mostly dollar and
euro assets and watching the United States disappear Russian Central
Bank assets overnight, Beijing's caution is understandable.

But **[would the United States accept inclusion of a more
cooperative]{.underline}** China if Beijing changed course and used it
leverage to help resolve the Ukraine question? Given
[relentless]{.underline} U.**[S. indictment of Chinese
behavior]{.underline}** on Ukraine, even before China has taken any
actual moves to aid Moscow, [Xi could be forgiven for thinking that the
answer is]{.underline}: probably **[no]{.underline}**t.

I've never quite understood the endgame of the many
[efforts]{.underline} to forge common cause solely with democracies on
global trade, technology, and all things digital. I thought the point
was to position the United States to shape global rules and
standards---which means [accepting]{.underline} major **[authoritarian
economies]{.underline}** [in that order]{.underline}, **[lest a
dangerous race to the bottom]{.underline}** [from a]{.underline}
**[fragmented order]{.underline}** of competing rules and standards
ensues.

The [unified public and private sector sanctions]{.underline} placed on
Russia underscore the imperative of reaching consensus on rules and
standards with allies and like-minded partners to the degree possible.
It's a smart U.S. starting point, a force multiplier for U.S. leverage.
And in strategic areas of supply chain security and technology like 5G,
it can be a viable end goal. But what jumped out at me watching U.S.
President Joe Biden's Summit for Democracy last December was the
question of whether this is viewed as an end in itself across the board.
If the United States can, for example, reach a consensus with the EU and
Japan on World Trade Organization (WTO) reform or standards for
artificial intelligence[, should]{.underline}n't this [provide leverage
to **negotiate**]{.underline} with China, Russia, [and]{.underline}
others to shape [global norms?]{.underline}

Instead, the opposite appears more the conventional wisdom. In February,
when asked about consulting with the region on the recently released
U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel
Kritenbrink said emphatically, "There is currently no intention to
engage the People's Republic of China on the Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework."

This is not a one-off aberration but tracks with the responses I get
when I ask senior administration officials, "Won't [this lead
to]{.underline} **[a more dangerous, divided world]{.underline}**? So
why not [test China's intentions at the **negotiating
table**]{.underline}?" The response, as one official put it, was, "Yeah,
we assume China won't change." Richard Fontaine, the CEO of the Center
for a New American Security, seemed to embrace this assumption in a
recent essay in Foreign Affairs, writing, "The aim of U.S. policy toward
China should be to ensure that Beijing is either unwilling or unable to
overturn the regional and global order." That assumes China seeks not
just to tilt rules in its direction but overturn the order on which its
economy depends.

Yet [China is **hardly impervious to change**]{.underline}. Aside from
12 major (and dozens of minor) dynasties over the past 4,000 years,
since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took power in 1949, there have
been no shortages of major shifts. There was Mao Zedong's Great Leap
Forward, a catastrophic collectivization campaign launched in 1958 that
led to some 30 million Chinese starving to death. That was preceded by
Mao's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" campaign to encourage diverse, new
thinking---but then Mao cut the flowers with an anti-rightist campaign
against those who spoke out.

In 1966, to reassert control over what he feared was a bureaucratizing
CCP government, Mao started the disastrous Cultural Revolution,
empowering Chinese youth (so-called Red Guards) to attack the CCP
bureaucracy, institutions, and intellectuals. Nearly 2 million people
were killed and millions imprisoned or tortured, disrupting a generation
and setting China back. The led to the reform period. After Mao had a
stroke in 1972, Deng Xiaoping gradually took the reins of power,
following internal CCP struggles against Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, and the
"Gang of Four." Market-oriented reforms took off, first with incremental
experiments and then writ large, with Deng proclaiming, "To get rich is
glorious." Collective leadership followed, implementing change, until
Xi's rise and his "rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," undoing some
market reforms and Deng's restrained foreign policy. The reactionary
trend of policy under Xi is, in fact, a sign that [China is capable of
change---in both directions.]{.underline}

But [even a post-Xi leadership is **unlikely to see any incentive to
change** if it believes the United States]{.underline} **[has no
interest in seeing it or in reaching accommodations with China in a
viable international order.]{.underline}** Despite the wild political
roller coaster of CCP rule, much of the deluge of commentary by the
post-engagement commentariat seems to view the party as a monolithic,
relentless force. There may be some truth in Xi's own inflexibility.
Though he has eliminated many rivals, Xi has his share of enemies and,
as noted above, a CCP history of course changes. There are hints of
discontent: Recent extraordinary articles by a Central Committee member
and a leading party school official, respectively, praising Deng's
reforms and not mentioning Xi were widely discussed in China.

[If the United States wants an international order,]{.underline} [rather
than,]{.underline} as Princeton University's Aaron Friedberg recently
proposed, [a "partial liberal order]{.underline}," [it has to offer
states such as China **some stake in that order**]{.underline}. [The
logic of "democracies only]{.underline}" could **[lead to a bifurcated
or maybe trifurcated world]{.underline}** (the EU has a different
philosophy on regulation) with dueling trade rules and tech standards.

#### Global governance prevents [extinction]{.underline}\-\--pandemics, climate change, emerging tech, and global peace

[Global governance]{.underline} is [necessary]{.underline} because
[humanity increasingly faces]{.underline} both
**[problems]{.underline}** and opportunities that are **[global in
scale]{.underline}**. Today, [transnational problems such]{.underline}
as **[violence and pandemics]{.underline}** routinely **[reach across
borders]{.underline}**, affecting us all. At the same time, the
[increasingly integrated global system]{.underline} has also [laid the
necessary foundations for **peace and spectacular prosperity**.
Effective global governance]{.underline} will [allow us to **end armed
conflict**]{.underline}, [deal with]{.underline} new and emerging
problems such as **[technological risks]{.underline}** and automation,
and to [achieve levels of prosperity]{.underline} and progress **[never
before seen]{.underline}**.1

The [most important challenge for humanity to overcome is]{.underline}
that of **[existential risks]{.underline}**. [One way to look at the
danger of an existential risk is to quantify]{.underline} the **[level
of global coordination needed to deal with it]{.underline}**. While
best-shot risks, at one end of the spectrum only require that a single
nation, organization or even individual (i.e., superhero) has the means
and the will to save everyone, weakest-link risks, at the other end of
the spectrum, are dangers that might [require]{.underline} literally
**[every country to take appropriate action]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[prevent catastrophe]{.underline}**, with no room for
failure.2 3

We've always been at risk of natural disaster, but [with advances in our
level of **technology**]{.underline} the [risk we pose to]{.underline}
ourselves as a species [becomes ever greater.]{.underline} **[Nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** are a well-known risk that we still live with to
this day. The progress of technological research exposes us to new
dangers such as **[bioengineered superbugs,]{.underline}**
nanotechnological menaces, and the risk of an **[out-of-control
artificial intelligence]{.underline}** with ill-intent. **[Increased
levels of global coordination]{.underline}** are **[needed to combat
many of these risks]{.underline}**, as described in our article on the
cooperation possibilities frontier.

There are other problems that don't necessarily threaten the species or
even civilization as we know it, but which are holding back the
development of prosperity and progress. Armed conflict, around since the
dawn of history, still haunts us today. Even though wars between great
powers appear to be a thing of the past, regional conflicts still
account for tremendous human suffering and loss of life in parts of the
world without stable governance.4

Other problems have emerged precisely because of our successes in the
past. The unprecedented advancement of human wellbeing and prosperity
over the past century has been based in large part on the use of fossil
fuels, thus exposing us to climate change. Widespread automation,
already a stressor on society, will put increased pressure on the social
and economic fabric of our societies over the next few decades. Global
governance can help alleviate these issues in various ways -- we refer
the interested reader to the very detailed work in Ruling Ourselves.

Finally, global governance will increasingly be judged not only by the
extent to which it prevents harm, but also by its demonstrated ability
to improve human wellbeing.5 Progress has let us set our sights higher
as a species, both for what we consider to be the right trajectory for
humanity and for our own conduct.6 Major advances in human wellbeing can
be accomplished with existing technology and modest improvements in
global coordination.

[Effective global governance]{.underline} is global governance that
[tackles these issues **better than the regional
governments**]{.underline} of the world [can independently]{.underline}.
Global governance is **[key to solving global problems.]{.underline}**
Without it, [we may not be able to avoid weakest-link **existential
risks**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[regulate new and dangerous
technologies]{.underline}**. With it, we may be able to prosper as we
never have before. The next step is to determine how effective global
governance can be achieved.

More "order" than "liberal"?

This is the basic origin story of [the liberal international
order]{.underline}. But it [might be **more order than
liberal**]{.underline}. Sovereignty and the principle of
non-interference was a cornerstone of that order, and while it was
routinely violated, almost all states accepted that a world of
sovereignty was necessary for stability. To help matters along, the
United Nations (UN) established the norm of the use of force only in
self-defense; and while it, too, was repeatedly violated, it did cause
many states to pause before attacking and to look for nonviolent ways to
accomplish their goals. [States and the UN also created institutions and
rules to help create a path for peaceful change]{.underline}, **[but
they were hardly liberal]{.underline}**. The UN helped the world make
the transition from a world of empires to a world of sovereign states,
but [liberal]{.underline} (imperial) [states]{.underline} [**can hardly
be given credit** for hurrying along the decolonization
process]{.underline}. [There was broad attachment to
multilateralism]{.underline}, which meant more than simply three or more
states involved in creating cooperative arrangements. It meant eschewing
unilateralism in favor of mutual accommodation. It meant steering away
from narrow self-interest in recognition of the value of diffuse
reciprocity and collective welfare. It meant operating according to
generalized principles of conduct that extended to all. It meant
accepting principles of nondiscrimination. This form of multilateralism
would help maintain international order. According to some, liberal
states were especially critical for creating this multilateral
worldview, but multilateralism had principles that were hardly owned and
operated by liberalism.

[There was a postwar order, but was it liberal]{.underline}? Like most
political orders, **[it looked much better on paper than it did in
practice]{.underline}** [and to the core members of the order than those
on the **margins**.]{.underline} Scholars of liberalism disagree about
the core attributes of liberalism and how they combine to produce a
stable order, but, for the sake of argument, it contains the following.
There is a fundamental belief that all humans are equal and are of equal
worth. Liberty is central to liberalism, with an emphasis on individual
autonomy and freedom. These principles translate into the rule of law,
private property, and human rights. Rule-based restraints on the
arbitrary exercise of power are critical because they give the weak more
protections than they otherwise would have and limit the ability of the
powerful to maximize their ability to exploit the system for their
individual benefit. The powerful accept such an arrangement for various
reasons, including because it injects the order with legitimacy. Thus, a
liberal order is not only a rule-based system but also a consent-based
system, and the existence of consent means that order can be maintained
without the continued threat and use of force. Additionally, how we see
the world, diagnose problems, and render solutions became a product of
reason and not superstition, religion, or folk wisdoms. Because reason
is the basis of acting, we are capable of learning from our mistakes and
improving the human condition. Such is the basis for progress.

These [liberal values]{.underline} were **[only remotely attached to the
postwar institutions]{.underline}**. [Sovereign equality did not
translate into a liberal world order]{.underline}. The [postwar
institutions]{.underline} were **[run by the most powerful
countries]{.underline}**, with [middle and lesser powers either shunted
to the back of the room]{.underline} or locked out altogether. The most
"liberal" institutions were committed to the protection and spread of
unfettered markets and global trade. The Washington Consensus fully
embraced liberalism, but it was a neoliberal model. The United States
and the Soviet Union made many of the most important order-making
decisions, and while each presented themselves as representing universal
values, they did their best to not let ideology complicate the more
pragmatic search for stability. The Third World now comprised most of
the world's states, but it was on the outside looking in. Western states
enjoyed democracy and the rule of law, but the U.S. and the former
colonial masters undermined rather than supported democracy and human
rights elsewhere. Some [Western states]{.underline} and analysts
presumed that the global order must have some legitimacy because there
were no great (or at least successful) revolts by the Third World, but
they [mistook]{.underline} **[coercion]{.underline}** [and the lack of
alternative]{.underline} **[for consent.]{.underline}**

[When scholars]{.underline} and policymakers [attempt to locate the
liberal]{.underline}, they tend to [narrow their gaze to arrangements
established among Western states]{.underline}. But even here it is worth
asking: what made them liberal? One view is that liberal states adopted
liberal foreign policy practices. There has been a slew of work along
these lines, and the democratic peace claim is the most researched. But
this is an argument about how democratic states get along with each
other, with a recognition that their pacific-leaning practices do not
extend to illiberal states. As previously noted, [when faced to choose
between security and human right]{.underline}s, the U.S. and other
**[Western states almost always choose the former.]{.underline}**
Another view is that [liberal states formed their own **exclusive
associations**]{.underline}. Many of the most important economic and
security institutions either are a club of or are controlled by liberal
states. [This is not a liberal world o]{.underline}rder; instead, **[it
is a world order created by and for liberal states.]{.underline}** A
third view is that institutions are run according to liberal principles.
A standard argument is that forward-thinking postwar U.S. leaders
created institutional rules that led the U.S. to self-bind, that is, to
adopt rules to restrain its power and create more opportunities for the
weak to voice their views. Which view comes closest to the historical
mark? A combination of the second and third view, with the recognition
that these principles were limited to those states that recognized each
other as having a liberal identity.

Toward history's end, or coming back full circle?

[Only a few scholars and practitioners referred to the postwar
international order as liberal prior to the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}. Instead, the designation seems to have taken off
beginning in the 1990s, and mainly among those in the West. Does the
name fit after the end of the Cold War any better than before? Yes, for
several reasons. Now that the Cold War was over, there was a growing
self-consciousness among Western states that they were joined by shared
liberal principles -- and these principles clearly distinguished them
from other kinds of states. Second, there was an increasingly accepted
claim that liberal states were fundamentally superior to illiberal
states in all kinds of ways: this is the moment when the democratic
peace thesis takes off and advanced democracies are lauded for having
qualities that make them more legitimate, peaceful, and prosperous.
Third, many Western states began adopting policies to export the liberal
model to non-Western states, especially evident in their post-conflict
reconstruction policies, as they attempted to transform war-torn states
into liberal states. Fourth, there were various states in former Eastern
bloc and the global South that are expressing an interest in adopting
liberal principles. And, finally, many of the grand proposals for the
post-Cold War order are crafted around liberal principles: democracy,
markets, and the rule of law. Human rights became one of the defining
anthems at this moment. Liberal states might not represent the end of
history, but the arc of history certainly bends in their direction.
Western, liberal states were feeling pretty good about themselves and
fairy confident that they showed the rest of the world its future.

But [because more states were envisioning a liberal international
order]{.underline} and using liberal principles to define its content
and legitimacy, [did this mean that a liberal international
existed?]{.underline} **[Not necessarily]{.underline}**. Wanting a
liberal international order and having an international order governed
by liberal principles are two different things. There was clear evidence
that many global institutions were under pressure to adopt more liberal
principles, especially as they increasingly accepted norms of
accountability, transparency, participation, and inclusion.
Multilateralism and the view that only states count began to yield to
multistakeholderism and the view that all those who are affected should
have a voice; but the evidence suggests that the latter has become
something of a fig leaf for the former. [There were more states holding
elections]{.underline}, but in [many cases]{.underline} **[they were
hardly free and fair]{.underline}**, making U.S. elections look fairly
good by comparison. [Western states]{.underline} [attempted to use their
aid packages to promote liberal reforms]{.underline}, but [these were
quite piecemeal and patchy]{.underline}, with [relatively little
evidence]{.underline} that the [aid created the conditions for a more
inclusive polity]{.underline} and economy. Some might consider the 1990s
as a highwater mark of the liberal international order, but my view is
that the international order got closer to having a liberal quality but
never quite passed the threshold.

It would give too much credit to al-Qaeda and the Bush administration's
response to the terrorist attacks to claim that the beginning of the end
came on [September 11th]{.underline} 2001. But this clearly was a
turning point, an event that [made liberalism seem like a
**luxury**]{.underline} compared to the dirty business of fighting a
global war on terror. But there were many other contributing factors.
[China's meteoric rise required accommodation, and]{.underline} most of
the energy went [into turning it into a status quo power and not a
liberal polity.]{.underline} The 2007 [financial collapse]{.underline},
coupled with the growing disquiet with globalization, fueled a renewed
[debate over the virtues of an open economy]{.underline}. With good
reason, scholars began pointing to the interwar period and digging out
their copies of Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation. The frailer
liberal states became, the more insistent they became on the virtue of a
liberal international order, suggesting the presence of a romantic
nostalgia. And then came Brexit, the election of U.S. President Trump,
and unapologetic authoritarianism. Whether or not one is a card-carrying
liberal, it is quite difficult to hear leaders and followers no longer
holding basic norms of decency and dignity for others, subjecting
immigrants and others to tremendous cruelty, and boasting of their
willingness to use violence to get their way. The domestic wheels have
been coming off the liberal states that were supposed to pull forward
the liberal international order. The recent turn of events has caused
some scholars to become wistful about liberal international order. But I
am suggesting that [the liberal international order]{.underline} **[was
never all that liberal is reinforced by recent
scholarship]{.underline}** that attempts to identify its core principles
for the sake of better measuring what might be lost with its demise.
Many discussions emphasize the possible weakening of sovereignty,
self-determination, legal equality, and free trade. John Ikenberry, who
has done more work on the liberal international order than any other
scholar, recently identified the following attributes: openness; loosely
rule-based relations to generate cooperation; the possibility of reform;
a progressive direction toward liberal democracy; self-restraint; and
consent and a rule-based order. [Liberal attributes]{.underline} are
included, but [arguably they take a backseat to
cooperation.]{.underline} And, importantly, [most]{.underline} of the
[other attributes]{.underline}, and especially those that are an anchor,
**[are not exclusively liberal.]{.underline}** Specifically, [illiberal
states have organized their relations around sovereignty and accepted
many of the fundamental institutions of international
society]{.underline}. They have [shown]{.underline} the **[capacity to
cooperate]{.underline}** when it suits their interests. Importantly,
[they also will play by the rule]{.underline}s, **[they just want rules
that are to their liking]{.underline}** as all states do. Indeed, at
this moment it is liberal United States that is shaking some of the
international rules and illiberal China that is coming to the defense of
a rule-based order. But always beware those who want to play by (their)
rules.

The suggestion, then, is that [if the international order is having
greater difficulty creating rule-based governance]{.underline}, it
[might have less to do with the weakening of liberalism and
more]{.underline} to do with [the fact that the rules that have been in
place for decades were **overdue for an overhaul,**]{.underline} and
[especially given a shift in power from]{.underline} the **[West to the
East]{.underline}**. But there is little evidence that there will be an
abandonment of the fundamental institutions of international society.
Sovereignty, as an organizing principle of world order, appears to be
here to stay. Indeed, to the extent that liberalism often provided a
push toward foreign intervention, the decline of liberalism could help
reinforce sovereignty. Glob[al debates are less likely to reference
liberal values, **but their impact has been greatly
exaggerated**]{.underline}. And [because liberalism is so closely
associated with a hegemonic West]{.underline}, and thus poisons debate,
perhaps [fewer **explicit references to liberalism**]{.underline} [might
help create a more level-headed **negotiating
environment**]{.underline}. Will the retreat of liberal states cripple
the ability of states to solve big problems in the world, such as
climate change? Perhaps. But [most analyses do not seem to think that
liberalism is the answer]{.underline}. **[Global
governance]{.underline}** might be more difficult, but it has [been
difficult for a while]{.underline} and the rumored demise of the liberal
international order is incidental to its problems. Indeed, [many believe
that global governance is **quite alive**]{.underline} and well [because
there is more **experimentation, more kinds of actors**]{.underline},
including corporations and nongovernmental organizations, and more
willingness to develop alternative architectures. Global governance
might not depend wholly on either sovereign states or liberal values.

Over the past few years, the position of China on the international
stage has gradually evolved, following its rise as an economic power,
visible in its rapidly increasing trade and investment flows. [China's
evolving role has]{.underline} also had **[implications for its place in
global governance]{.underline}**, [through a greater involvement in
activities ranging from]{.underline} United Nations [peacekeeping
operations]{.underline} (China is by far the biggest contributor of
personnel, with more than 3,000 troops and police committed) [to
contributions to de**velopment funds**]{.underline} (Xi Jinping pledged
\$2 billion in support for the development of poor countries at the
Sustainable Development Summit in 2015). Numerous Chinese scholars have
started to rethink China's role and consider new strategies that would
help the country [offer]{.underline} **[alternative
models]{.underline}** [for **international cooperation**
and]{.underline} **[governance]{.underline}** for development. Cui
Wenxing, a post-doctoral fellow at Fudan University, writes that there
have been three main stages of evolution in China's development policy.
Firstly, under Mao, when the country's south-south cooperation was
essentially based on political considerations (such as providing
assistance to socialist countries).\[20\] Secondly, after the reform and
opening up, when China shifted its focus essentially to economic
cooperation with other countries (in all directions), and, finally, the
acceleration of the "going out" movement (走出去 zouchuqu) in the 21st
century, when south-south cooperation became a way for China to
encourage its enterprises to go abroad and to take part in global
development.\[21\] Cui believes that both the "going out" movement and
China's development agenda provided opportunities for Chinese
enterprises for more economic cooperation (for instance, via low
interest loans provided to Chinese enterprises in developing countries).
For Xu Qiyuan, associate research fellow at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, and Sun Jingying, postdoctoral fellow at Beijing
University, even if "it is clear that China is still a developing
country", its role has evolved from that of recipient country to one of
donor country, and [China has **become an important partner of
international development agencies.\[**]{.underline}22\] China's role in
the development of **[south-south cooperation]{.underline}** has been
increasing tremendously. The [time has come]{.underline}, say these
authors, [for China to build]{.underline} a **["new global partnership
for development]{.underline}**" (建新型全球发展伙伴关系 jian xinxing
quanqiu fazhan huoban guanxi), arguing that this new approach should put
aside political issues but [focus partnerships on pragmatic
interests]{.underline}.\[23\] Chinese [criticism of the **UN development
agenda**]{.underline} Chinese scholars point to the imperfections of the
development framework that the United Nations has promoted since its
foundation in 1945. Some Chinese scholars, such as Xu and Sun, recognise
that the UN's development framework managed to gradually mobilise the
international community, that it has achieved some level of agreement on
key concepts relating to development ([such **as environmental issues,
climate change, or sustainable development goals**]{.underline}), and
that it has contributed to the formulation of the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). However, several problems remain in the view of these
authors. Among other issues, they note that the MDGs [have
had]{.underline} **[mixed results]{.underline}**, [such as uneven
progress geographically, and areas of development lagging
behin]{.underline}d, such as universal access to primary education,
maternal healthcare, and environmental sustainability. In addition, they
believe that the [development framework has sometimes focused too much
on political issues]{.underline} -- for instance, the controversial
conditions attached to aid, which relate to governance, transparency,
and human rights. In their view these issues should be separated from a
country's development goals. In particular, Xu and Sun argue that [donor
countries often link environmental aspects of sustainable development to
political aspects]{.underline} that oppose the principle of "common but
differentiated responsibilities", a phrase which is important to
developing countries. Developed countries ("traditional aid countries")
indeed usually put emphasis on a "universal" principle of environmental
responsibility, resulting in environmental sustainability goals being
placed at the forefront of priorities.\[24\] In addition, for Cui, the
"shock therapy" of the World Bank has had significant downsides, by
forcing countries to adopt austerity policies and to engage in market
liberalisation over short periods of time, instead of progressively
changing policies based on long-term research and experimentation.\[25\]
China's development agenda and the UN In the view of Xu, Sun, and Cui,
[China has implemented a successful]{.underline} **[economic development
model]{.underline}** and it has [performed well in its progress towards
the MDGs,]{.underline} all of which (in their view) relate to Deng
Xiaoping's development paradigm "crossing the river by feeling the
stones" (摸着石头过河 mozhe shitou guohe), [which]{.underline}
**[provided a smoother alternative]{.underline}** [to the shock therapy
of the World Bank]{.underline}.\[26\] However, the author/authors
believes that [there is a role for China to play in **redefining a more
balanced global partnership for development**, that would better reflect
the rise of south-south cooperation and the growing role of emerging
economies]{.underline}.\[27\] Xu, Sun, and Cao Jiahan (assistant
research fellow at the Research Institute of Comparative Politics and
Public Policy) recognise that the new role that China could play at the
global level should take into account organisations which already exist,
such as the development agencies of traditional aid countries or the UN
agencies in charge of implementing the 2030 Development Agenda. For
them, connecting Chinese development initiatives to the agenda of these
organisations could indeed help increase trust in these initiatives.
[The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI]{.underline}), in particular, has
recently raised some concerns in the international community, in Western
countries in particular. For Cao, connecting the BRI agenda to the
United Nations' 2030 Development Agenda could be a way to "increase
trust and dispel doubts" ( 增信释疑 zengxin shiyi) and to exert greater
international influence, as the BRI [represents]{.underline} "an
[attempt by China to explore a **new model of international cooperation
for development and global governance**]{.underline}". \[28\]

#### Chinese leadership solves extinction. 

Shen **Yamei 18**, Deputy Director and Associate Research Fellow of
Department for American Studies, China Institute of International
Studies, 1-9-2018, \"Probing into the "Chinese Solution" for the
Transformation of Global Governance,\" CAIFC,
http://www.caifc.org.cn/en/content.aspx?id=4491

[As the world is in a period of great development, transformation and
adjustment, the international power comparison is undergoing profound
changes, global governance is reshuffling and traditional governance
concepts and models are confronted with challenges. The international
community is expecting China to play a bigger role in global governance,
which has given birth to the Chinese solution.]{.underline} A. To Lead
the Transformation of the Global Governance System. [**The
"[shortcomings" of the existing global governance system are
prominent]{.mark}, [which can hardly ensure]{.mark} global
[development]{.mark}. First, the [traditional dominant forces are
seriously imbalanced]{.mark}**. The US and Europe]{.underline} that used
to dominate the global governance system [have been beset with
structural problems]{.underline}, with their economic development
stalling, social contradictions intensifying, populism and secessionism
rising, and states trapped in internal strife and differentiation.
[These countries have not fully reformed and adjusted themselves well,
but rather pointed their fingers at globalization and resorted to
retreat for self-insurance or were busy with their own affairs without
any wish or ability to participate in global governance, which has
encouraged the growth of "anti-globalization" trend into an interference
factor to global governance]{.underline}. [Second, the global governance
mechanism is relatively lagging behind.]{.underline} [Over the years of
development, the strength of emerging economies has increased
dramatically, which has substantially upset the international power
structure, as the developing countries as a whole have made 80 percent
of the contributions to global economic growth]{.underline}. [These
countries have expressed their appeal for new governance and begun
policy coordination among themselves]{.underline}, which has initiated
the transition of global governance form "Western governance" to
"East-West joint governance", but [**the [traditional]{.mark} governance
[mechanisms such as the World Bank, IMF]{.mark} and G7 [failed to
reflect the demand of the new pattern]{.mark}, [in addition to their
lack of representation]{.mark} and inclusiveness.** Third, the global
governance rules are developing in a fragmented way, with governance
deficits existing in some key areas.]{.underline} With the
diversification and in-depth integration of international interests, the
domain of global governance has continued to expand, with actors
multiplying by folds and action intentions becoming complicated. [As
relevant efforts are usually temporary and limited to specific partners
or issues, global governance driven by requests of "diversified
governance" lacks systematic and comprehensive solutions]{.underline}.
[Since the beginning of this year, [there have been risks]{.mark} of
running into an acephalous state **[in such key areas as]{.mark} global
[economic governance and climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[Such
emerging issues as [nuclear security and]{.mark} international
[terrorism]{.mark} have suffered injustice because of power
politics]{.underline}**. **[The governance areas in deficit, such as
[cyber security]{.mark}, [polar region and oceans]{.mark}, have
"reversely forced" certain countries and organizations to respond
hastily]{.underline}**. [All of these have made the global governance
system trapped in a dilemma and call urgently for a clear direction of
advancement.]{.underline} B. To Innovate and Perfect the International
Order. Currently, whether the developing countries or the Western
countries of Europe and the US are greatly discontent with the existing
international order as well as their appeals and motivation for changing
the order are unprecedentedly strong. The US is the major creator and
beneficiary of the existing hegemonic order, but it is now doubtful that
it has gained much less than lost from the existing order, faced with
the difficulties of global economic transformation and obsessed with
economic despair and political dejection. [Although the developing
countries as represented by China acknowledge the positive role played
by the post-war international order in safeguarding peace, boosting
prosperity and promoting globalization, they criticize the existing
order for lack of inclusiveness in politics and equality in economy, as
well as double standard in security, believing it has failed to reflect
the multi-polarization trend of the world and is an exclusive "circle
club]{.underline}". Therefore, there is much room for improvement. For
[China, to lead the transformation of the global governance system and
international order not only supports the efforts of the developing
countries to uphold multilateralism rather than unilateralism, advocate
the rule of law rather than the law of the jungle and practice democracy
rather than power politics in international relations]{.underline}, [but
also is an important subject concerning whether China could gain the
discourse power and development space corresponding to its own strength
and interests in the process of innovating and perfecting the framework
of international order.]{.underline} C. To Promote Integration of the
Eastern and Western Civilizations. Dialog among civilizations, which is
the popular foundation for any country's diplomatic proposals, runs like
a trickle moistening things silently. Nevertheless, [[in the existing
international system guided by the "Western-Centrism", the Western
civilization has always had]{.mark} the self-righteous
[superiority]{.mark}, conflicting with the interests and mentality of
other countries and having failed to find the path to co-existing
peacefully and harmoniously with other civilizations]{.underline}. **[So
to speak, [many problems of today]{.mark}, including the growing gap in
economic development between the developed and developing countries
against the background of globalization, the Middle East trapped in
chaos and disorder, the failure of Russia and Turkey to "integrate into
the West", etc., [can be directly attributed to lack of exchanges,
communication and integration among
civilizations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Since the 18th National Congress
of CPC, Xi Jinping has raised the concept of "Chinese Dream" that
reflects both Chinese values and China's pursuit, re-introducing to the
world the idea of "all living creatures grow together without harming
one another and ways run parallel without interfering with one another",
which is the highest ideal in Chinese traditional culture, and striving
to shape China into a force that counter-balance the Western
civilization. He has also made solemn commitment that "we respect the
diversity of civilizations ...... cannot be puffed up with pride and
depreciate other civilizations and nations"; "facing the people deeply
trapped in misery and wars, we should have not only compassion and
sympathy, but also responsibility and action ...... do whatever we can
to extend assistance to those people caught in predicament", etc.
[[China will rebalance the]{.mark} international [pattern from a more
inclusive civilization perspective]{.mark} and with more far-sighted
strategic mindset, or at least correct the bisected or predominated
world order so as to promote the parallel development of the Eastern and
Western civilizations through mutual learning, integration and
encouragement.]{.underline} D. To Pass on China's Confidence. Only a
short while ago, some Western countries had called for "China's
responsibility" and made it an inhibition to "regulate" China's
development orientation. [Today, China has become a source of stability
in an international situation full of uncertainties. Over the past 5
years, China has made outstanding contributions to the recovery of world
economy under relatively great pressure of its own economic
downturn.]{.underline} [Encouraged by the "four confidences", the whole
of the Chinese society has burst out innovation vitality and produced
innovation achievements]{.underline}, making people have more sense of
gain and more optimistic about the national development prospect. It is
the heroism of the ordinary Chinese to overcome difficulties and realize
the ideal destiny that best explains China's confidence. When this
confidence is passed on in the field of diplomacy, it is expressed as:
first, China's posture is seen as more forging ahead and courageous to
undertake responsibilities \-\-\-- proactively shaping the international
agendas rather than passively accepting them; having clear-cut attitudes
on international disputes rather than being equivocal; and extending
international cooperation to comprehensive and dimensional development
rather than based on the theory of "economy only". In sum, China will
actively seek understanding and support from other countries rather than
imposing its will on others with clear-cut Chinese characteristics,
Chinese style and Chinese manner. Second, China's discourse is featured
as a combination of inflexibility and yielding as well as magnanimous
\-\-\-- combining the internationally recognized diplomatic principles
with the excellent Chinese cultural traditions through digesting the
Chinese and foreign humanistic classics assisted with philosophical
speculations to make "China Brand, Chinese Voice and China's Image get
more and more recognized". Third, [[the Chinese solution is more
practical and intimate]{.mark} to people [as well as emphasizes
inclusive cooperation]{.mark}, as China is full of confidence to break
the monopoly of the Western model on global development, "offering
mankind a Chinese solution to explore a better social system", and
"providing a brand new option for the nations and peoples who are hoping
both to speed up development and maintain independence".]{.underline}
II.Path Searching of the "Chinese Solution" for Global Governance [Over
the past years' efforts, China has the ability to transform itself from
"grasping the opportunity" for development to "creating opportunity" and
"sharing opportunity" for common development, hoping to pass on the
longing of the Chinese people for a better life to the people of other
countries and promoting the development of the global governance system
toward a more just and rational end. It has become the major power's
conscious commitment of China to lead the transformation of the global
governance system in a profound way.]{.underline} A. To Construct the
Theoretical System for Global Governance. The theoretical system of
global governance has been the focus of the party central committee's
diplomatic theory innovation since the 18th National Congress of CPC as
well as an important component of the theory of socialism with Chinese
characteristics for a new era, which is not only the sublimation of
China's interaction with the world from "absorbing and learning" to
"cooperation and mutual learning", but also the cause why so many
developing countries have turned from "learning from the West" to
"exploring for treasures in the East". In the past 5 years, the party
central committee, based on precise interpretation of the world pattern
today and serious reflection on the future development of mankind, has
made a sincere call to the world for promoting the development of global
governance system toward a more just and rational end, and proposed a
series of new concepts and new strategies including engaging in major
power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, creating the human
community with common destiny, promoting the construction of new
international relationship rooted in the principle of cooperation and
win-win, enriching the strategic thinking of peaceful development,
sticking to the correct benefit view, formulating the partnership
network the world over, advancing the global economic governance in a
way of mutual consultation, joint construction and co-sharing,
advocating the joint, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable
security concept, and launching the grand "Belt and Road" initiative.
[The Chinese solution composed of these contents, not only fundamentally
different from the old roads of industrial revolution and colonial
expansion in history, but also different from the market-driven
neo-liberalism model currently advocated by Western countries and
international organizations, stands at the height of the world and even
mankind, seeking for global common development and having widened the
road for the developing countries to modernization, which is widely
welcomed by the international community.]{.underline} B. To Supplement
and Perfect the Global Governance System[. Currently, the international
political practice in global governance is mostly problem-driven without
creating a set of relatively independent, centralized and integral power
structures, resulting in the existing global governance
systemcharacterized as both extensive and unbalanced]{.underline}.
[China has been engaged in reform and innovation, while maintaining and
constructing the existing systems, producing some thinking and method
with Chinese characteristics. First, China sees the UN as a mirror that
reflects the status quo of global governance, which should act as the
leader of global governance, and actively safeguards the global
governance system with the UN at the core. Second, China is actively
promoting the transforming process of such recently emerged
international mechanisms as G20, BRICS and SCO]{.underline}, perfecting
them through practice, and boosting Asia-Pacific regional cooperation
and the development of economic globalization. China is also promoting
the construction of regional security mechanism through the Six-Party
Talks on Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, Boao Forum for Asia, CICA and
multilateral security dialog mechanisms led by ASEAN so as to lay the
foundation for the future regional security framework. Third, China has
initiated the establishment of AIIB and the New Development Bank of
BRICS, creating a precedent for developing countries to set up
multilateral financial institutions. The core of the new relationship
between China and them lies in "boosting rather than controlling" and
"public rather than private", which is much different from the
management and operation model of the World Bank, manifesting the
increasing global governance ability of China and the developing
countries as well as exerting pressure on the international economic and
financial institution to speed up reforms. **[Thus, in leading the
transformation of the global governance system, [China has not
overthrown the existing systems]{.mark} and started all over again, [but
been engaged in innovating and perfecting]{.mark}; [China has
proactively undertaken international responsibilities]{.mark}, [but
has]{.mark} to do everything in its power and [act according to its
ability.]{.mark}]{.underline}** C. To Reform the Global Governance
Rules. [Many of the problems facing global governance today are deeply
rooted in such a cause that the dominant power of the existing
governance system has taken it as the tool to realize its own national
interests first and a platform to pursue its political
goals.]{.underline} Since the beginning of this year, the US has for
several times requested the World Bank, IMF and G20 to make efforts to
mitigate the so-called global imbalance, abandoned its commitment to
support trade openness, cut down investment projects to the
middle-income countries, and deleted commitment to support the efforts
to deal with climate change financially, which has made the
international systems accessories of the US domestic economic agendas,
dealing a heavy blow to the global governance system. [On the contrary,
the interests and agendas of China, as a major power of the world, are
open to the whole world, and China in the future "will provide the world
with broader market, more sufficient capital, more abundant goods and
more precious opportunities for cooperation", while having the ability
to make the world listen to its voice more attentively.]{.underline}
[With regard to the subject of global governance, China has advocated
that what global governance system is better cannot be decided upon by
any single country, as the destiny of the world should be in the hands
of the people of all countries. In principle, all the parties should
stick to the principle of mutual consultation, joint construction and
co-sharing, resolve disputes through dialog and differences through
consultation]{.underline}. Regarding the critical areas, opening to the
outer world does not mean building one's own backyard, but building the
spring garden for co-sharing; the "Belt and Road" initiative is not
China's solo, but a chorus participated in by all countries concerned.
**[[China has]{.mark} also [proposed]{.mark} international [public
security views on nuclear security, maritime cooperation and cyber space
order, calling for efforts to make the global village into a "grand
stage for seeking common development"]{.mark} rather than a "wrestling
arena"; we cannot "set up a stage here, while pulling away a prop
there", but "complement each other to put on a grand
show"]{.underline}**. From the orientation of reforms, efforts should be
made to better safeguard and expand the legitimate interests of the
developing countries and increase the influence of the emerging
economies on global governance. Over the past 5 years, China has
attached importance to full court diplomacy, gradually coming to the
center stage of international politics and proactively establishing
principles for global governance. By hosting such important events as
IAELM, CICA Summit, G20 Summit, the Belt and Road International
Cooperation Forum and BRICS Summit, China has used theseplatforms to
elaborate the Asia-Pacific Dream for the first time to the world,
expressing China's views on Asian security and global economic
governance, discussing with the countries concerned with the Belt and
Road about the synergy of their future development strategies and
setting off the "BRICS plus" capacity expansion mechanism, in which
China not only contributes its solution and shows its style, but also
participates in the shaping of international principles through
practice. On promoting the resolution of hot international issues, China
abides by the norms governing international relations based on the
purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and insists on justice,
playing a constructive role as a responsible major power in actively
promoting the political accommodation in Afghanistan, mediating the
Djibouti-Eritrea dispute, promoting peace talks in the Middle East,
devoting itself to the peaceful resolution of the South China Sea
dispute through negotiations. In addition, China's responsibility and
quick response to international crises have gained widespread praises,
as seen in such cases as assisting Africa in its fight against the Ebola
epidemic, sending emergency fresh water to the capital of Maldives and
buying rice from Cambodia to help relieve its financial squeeze, which
has shown the simple feelings of the Chinese people to share the same
breath and fate with the people of other countries. D. To Support the
Increase of the Developing Countries' Voice. The developing countries,
especially the emerging powers, are not only the important participants
of the globalization process, but also the important direction to which
the international power system is transferring. With the accelerating
shift of global economic center to emerging markets and developing
economies, the will and ability of the developing countries to
participate in global governance have been correspondingly strengthened.
[As the biggest developing country and fast growing major power, China
has the same appeal and proposal for governance as other developing
countries and already began policy coordination with them, as China
should comply with historical tide and continue to support the increase
of the developing countries' voice in the global governance system. To
this end, China has pursued the policy of "dialog but not confrontation,
partnership but not alliance", attaching importance to the construction
of new type of major power relationship and global partnership network,
while making a series proposals in the practice of global governance
that could represent the legitimate interests of the developing
countries and be conducive to safeguarding global justice, including
supporting an open, inclusive, universal, balanced and win-win economic
globalization; promoting the reforms on share and voting mechanism of
IMF to increase the voting rights and representation of the emerging
market economies; financing the infrastructure construction and
industrial upgrading of other developing countries through various
bilateral or regional funds; and helping other developing countries to
respond to such challenges as famine, refugees, climate change and
public hygiene by debt forgiveness and assistance.]{.underline}

solutions to armed conflict found in global governance?,\" Vision of
Earth \| Shaping a happy, healthy, and prosperous future, 2-12-2019,
https://www.visionofearth.org/politics/long-peace-potential-solutions-armed-conflict-global-governance/,
accessed 7-6-2022, WMK

In our [work on the cooperation]{.underline} possibility frontier, we
have [demonstrated that as the framework for **coordination and trust**
between nations increase]{.underline}s, so too does our [threshold for
solving **problems**]{.underline} of a global nature. It is in
humanity's best interest to expand this frontier -- thus improving
global cooperation and coordination. But there is only reason to do so
if the underlying assumption, that there are challenges of a global
scale facing humanity, is valid. If that assumption is valid, then
global governance in the form of a solid framework for the
aforementioned coordination should be a major goal.

In a previous post, we talked about [the need for global governance in
order to effectively tackle]{.underline} said global challenges. In the
next few posts, we'll look at some of these challenges in detail,
beginning with **[armed conflict.]{.underline}**

Over the last few generations, we have [experienced such a prolonged era
of peace between great powers that]{.underline} it is tempting to
dismiss armed conflict as a global issue worth further consideration.
Why invest resources in solving this issue when it appears to have
already been solved?

It's important to understand how [recent this peace is and why it is so
unprecedented]{.underline}. Throughout the ages, h[umans have had the
tendency to murder, maim, and torture]{.underline} one another. In fact,
it's really only in relatively recent history that violence and sadism
has become the exception rather than the norm in the human experience.1

Over the past few centuries, **[violence has declined
dramatically]{.underline}** in various ways -- two of which are
particularly worth noting. First, there has been a decline in
interpersonal violence within societies that began millenia ago and has
continued up until the present day. Second, over recent decades there
has been an enormous reduction in interstate conflicts, particularly
between great powers.1\]

The reduction of interpersonal violence came in several waves, beginning
millennia ago with the creation of the first states. Throughout history
there have been several additional factors in the decline of violence,
including the spread of civilizing norms like table manners, the
invention of the printing press, and the Enlightenment, which began in
Europe in the 18th century and spread to the rest of the world from
there.2 The further implementation of strong centralized governments
throughout much of the world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
continued the reduction in overall lawlessness.

The [decline in **interstate conflicts**]{.underline} is [much more
recent]{.underline}. [Crucial factors for this decline include **norms
against war,**]{.underline} the spread of democracy, and the shattering
destruction of the two world wars. The Long Peace following the
conclusion of the world wars has been the most peaceful time in human
history.3 Thus, it's worth exploring why this peace came about in the
wake of World War II.

The [world wars were unprecedented in terms of their material
destructiveness]{.underline} and ended with the [unleashing]{.underline}
of **[the most terrible weapon yet seen by humanity]{.underline}**. As
such, they serve as a profound cautionary tale for all great powers that
no one is keen on repeating. It should be no surprise then, that at the
conclusion of those wars, a body of incentives and political structures
was assembled that could create significant and lasting peace -- or at
least peace that has at least lasted until the present. This peace has
been maintained not only through Mutually Assured Destruction between
nuclear superpowers, but also by other factors, such as the fact that
democracies do not typically go to war with each other. This peace is
significant in that no great powers have warred directly with each other
in more than half a century.

[Conflict]{.underline}, however[, still exists]{.underline} -- in the
form **[of civil wars, proxy conflicts, genocides, and
terrorism]{.underline}**. External factors now play a major role in
shaping hostilities around the world -- often leading to their
perpetuation or escalation.4 [Major powers]{.underline}, unable to set
aside their conflicting interests, are often **[unwilling to work
together in order to prevent or end conflict.]{.underline}** Even if
they do so on the surface, they cannot agree about the strategy best
taken. One only need look at the most recent and prominent international
proxy conflict -- the Syrian Civil War -- for a potent example of this
issue.5

There is also the issue of **[emerging technologies]{.underline}**
[making conflic]{.underline}t a **[greater threat to
humanity.]{.underline}** [Ballistic missile defense and combat drones
may]{.underline} **[weaken global military restraint]{.underline}** -- a

be possible.

The authors argue instead for "**[liberal
internationalism,]{.underline}**" [better characterized as]{.underline}
primacy, or **[armed global dominance]{.underline}**, of the liberal
variety. However, [liberal primacy]{.underline}, a major influence in
Washington for decades, is itself partly **[responsible]{.underline}**
[for the]{.underline} [**crises of the current world order** and
is]{.underline} now **[enhancing risks of great power
conflict.]{.underline}** Moreover, liberal primacy
[marginalizes]{.underline} **[alternative]{.underline}** and quite
different **[versions of internationalism]{.underline}**, including
those well within the American tradition, [which]{.underline} have much
to contribute to [achieve]{.underline} a **[world of
security]{.underline}** and prosperity.

Deudney and Ikenberry's main arguments are as follows: The restraint
camp remains hostage to its critique of the American "blunder" in Iraq.
It is moreover incoherent due to its dissimilar factions of
libertarians, balance-of-power realists, and progressives, and thereby
offers only a negative agenda for shaping the future world order.
Restrainers purportedly provide no solutions to problems generated due
to industrialization and high interdependence, such as inequality and
climate change. Moreover, they resist defending and promoting democracy
in a world threatened by a rising and authoritarian China. "Liberal
internationalism" with its focus on democracy promotion, institutions,
and regulated capitalism is the only model that can solve the world's
problems.

Let us put aside for a moment the authors' misrepresentation of
positions of restrainers more generally, and those of the Quincy
Institute specifically. Let us also acknowledge the positive aspects of
the broader liberal project, which do not contradict a grand strategy of
restraint (and which the Quincy Institute supports.) Individualism and
democracy are welcome antidotes to social and political repression,
diversity mostly enriches societies, institutions help solve problems,
and versions of capitalism have proven superior to communism. Liberal
primacists' prioritization of collective action problems such as climate
change is also on the mark. But a closer examination reveals that some
of these supposed achievements are more rhetorical than real.

[Liberal primacy's stress on democracy would be credible]{.underline}
**[--- if only its deeds matched the claim]{.underline}**s. [Washington
is]{.underline} tough, **[even]{.underline}** militant, [on violations
of rights by its geopolitical adversaries,]{.underline} with sanctions
and harsh rhetoric routinely employed as a tool. Liberal primacists
indeed seem to be concerned with the fate of democracy in what they call
the "core" --- a reference to European allies. But [when it comes to
U.S. allies and partners]{.underline} in the Global South, **[they
rarely go beyond nudges and occasional slaps on the
wrist.]{.underline}**

Objective observers can conclude that, [outside of the Atlantic
area]{.underline}, **[democracy and human rights are only of marginal
importance]{.underline}** in the liberal primacy project, [except when
they can act as]{.underline} **[force-multipliers in the great power
competition framework]{.underline}**. Restrainers on the other hand
genuinely support democracy by directing the United States to perfect
its own model at home so that it can lead by example. Restrainers also
have a well-founded suspicion of the true motives of Washington's
actions (or any power that claims to be acting out of altruism) and, in
general, hold a pessimistic view of achieving changes in the domestic
politics of other societies through coercive measures.

Deudney and Ikenberry greatly stress liberal primacy to achieve global
economic equity and avert environmental catastrophe. However, [under
liberal primacy's]{.underline} long [innings]{.underline} in Washington,
these **[challenges have only multiplied]{.underline}** at home and
abroad. The [United States]{.underline}, under the major influence of
primacists of all shades, did not by itself create all these problems.
But its **[disproportionate power]{.underline}** and wealth [means that
it is]{.underline} more **[responsible]{.underline}** than any other
single actor. Moreover, [when liberal]{.underline} and other primacists
make extraordinary claims of global leadership and explicitly seek to
preserve unipolarity, they should also accept a corresponding level of
responsibility for all that has gone wrong under their watch.

Liberalism is also by no means necessarily tied to U.S. primacy. The
work of scholars such as Stephen Wertheim (a co-founder of the Quincy
Institute) and Michael Kazin has cogently highlighted a very different
American internationalism in the pre-WW II era that opposed primacy in
the long national tradition (notwithstanding a few exceptions) of
staying away from foreign wars and advocating diplomacy to resolve
disputes in extra-hemispheric conflicts. Nowhere do Deudney and
Ikenberry seriously engage the core argument of restrainers of armed
dominance detracting from domestic priorities and raising risks of
regional and global conflict.

Liberal primacists have belatedly come around to reducing (though not
eliminating) the U.S. military footprint in the Middle East. But, as
Quincy Institute president Andrew Bacevich has laid out, few lessons
appear to have been learned from the Iraq war, which was not so much a
"blunder" as a flagrant violation of international law and American
values. Nearly two decades after that fateful step, primacists (liberal
and otherwise) show little desire for accountability from actors who
supported and executed this war ridden with illegal actions, a
reluctance that severely undermines their justifications for prosecuting
violations of other states.

[It is on Chin]{.underline}a, however, [that liberal primacists flirt
with the **greatest danger to**]{.underline} the international order. A
[rising China is **framed as a threat**]{.underline}, predominantly due
to its authoritarian system as also its recent actions in the region.
Domestic and foreign policies of most states are indeed linked, but they
may manifest in apparently inconsistent ways. For example, [powerful,
authoritarian states]{.underline} **[may not necessarily seek global
conquest]{.underline}** or even dominance (for example, China in the
15th century) just as major democratic states may disavow global
hegemony (the United States itself from the late 19th century until
World War II). [Democratic powers **may also empower
tyranny**]{.underline}, as was seen with Israel's export of the
cyber-weapon Pegasus to several authoritarian governments recently.
[Liberal primacy has a]{.underline} **[deterministic]{.underline}**,
[inflated view of Chinese power]{.underline} and threat and [little
space for the **major uncertainty in Chinese capabilities**]{.underline}
and intentions two or three decades in the future.

Whereas Washington is stepping up on **[framing China in stark cold
war-type language,]{.underline}** much of the world, including many U.S.
partners, has a much more nuanced viewpoint of the competition. The
reluctance of Southeast Asia or treaty ally South Korea to join the
U.S.-led Quad and the general lack of support across much of the world
for the monochromatic view of China's Belt and Road Initiative as an
exploitative debt trap are two examples. Prominent Southeast Asian
voices in particular are increasingly worried at the turn liberal
primacists' China strategy is taking.

Whittling away at the time-tested One-China policy, over-militarization
of relations with the Quad states, and aggressive, publicly announced
military FONOPs close to the Chinese coast are only some of the ways in
which liberal and other primacists are [helping]{.underline} **[raise
risks of great power conflict.]{.underline}** [China is **not an
existential threat to the United States. This**]{.underline} is not to
say that China's excessive claims in the South China Sea, coercive
pressure on U.S. partners including Taiwan and India, exploitative
deep-sea fishing, cyber-attacks on the homeland, and certain trade
practices should not be of major concern. But [it takes **two hands to
clap.**]{.underline} When it comes to China, [liberal primacy's
reign]{.underline} in Washington **[feels as escalatory
as]{.underline}** the **[Trump]{.underline}** era.

[Liberal primacy is]{.underline} also [**less than international**, with
its]{.underline} continuing Euro- and Global [North-centric
tendencies]{.underline}. **[Alternative internationalisms]{.underline}**
[include those from the Global South, **where most of humanity
lives.**]{.underline} Southern internationalism matters to the U.S.
national interest because, in [an increasingly multipolar
world]{.underline}, [regional and middle powers have enhanced
autonomy]{.underline} and capability [to exercise veto power if their
views of the world order are not taken into account.]{.underline}

As seen from the South, spreading democracy, managing interdependence,
and containing the rise of China --- Deudney and Ikenberry's principal
problematiques --- is a part-erroneous, part-limited list. A view from
Johannesburg, Dhaka, or Jakarta might argue that achieving domestic
stability, economic "catch-up" with the wealthy world, and avoiding
another militarized great power competition are more pressing concerns
(along with those of climate change and pandemics, correctly identified
by Deudney and Ikenberry). Moreover, [U.S. interventionism and coercive
strategies]{.underline} of extraterritorial sanctions (often backed by
liberal primacists) [might be seen as]{.underline} equally or **[more
threatening than the rise of China]{.underline}**. In general, Southern
internationalism stresses sovereignty, solidarity, and a search for
compromise rather than coercion in great power disputes.

[Southern internationalism has led to]{.underline} **[many
initiatives]{.underline}** of varying success -- from decolonization
itself, to Afro-Asian frameworks such as Bandung, the push for a New
International Economic Order, Tricontinentalism, and the Nonaligned
Movement. More recent examples include the Like-Minded Developing
Countries coalition in global climate negotiations. While some
practitioners of Southern internationalism were domestic autocrats,
paradoxically, their banding together also enabled a somewhat more
democratic world order by placing limits on the extent of bipolarity or
unipolarity[. Liberal primacists, either largely ignore or oppose other
internationalism]{.underline}s, domestic and foreign, [thereby revealing
their own paradox -- while democracy is backed at hom]{.underline}e, a
**[diversity of ideologies across states is distinctly
unwelcome.]{.underline}**

Deudney and Ikenberry are correct in that there are differences among
restrainers. But coming from advocates of the "Roosevelt School" this is
downright bizarre if not a sign of amnesia. FDR's multi-decade imprint
owed largely to his phenomenal success at crafting a diverse coalition
at home to address the central challenges of his time. Building -- and
sustaining -- such coalitions signifies maturity, not incoherence.

Restraint is a grand strategy comprised of first and foremost disavowing
armed global primacy and stressing diplomacy for conflict reduction and
management. This, by itself, is an enormous task that, if achieved,
would be a major accomplishment and greatly diminish risk of a great
power war. But beyond this common agenda, the young coalition will
naturally engage deeply with itself over time as it grows. Indeed,
primacists of the liberal and non-liberal variety who have been at this
for much longer than restrainers, are themselves characterized by
differences. The Quincy Institute, for its part, has laid out positive
agendas for achieving peaceful co-existence in East Asia (including its
maritime domain), South Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. These involve
reversing armed global dominance, stressing diplomacy and institutions,
letting regional players lead in solving their problems, abandoning
coercive attempts to spread American political values, and energetically
constructing confidence-building measures with major powers China and
Russia.

In sum, [liberal primacy,]{.underline} at best, is [mostly a
status-quoist ideology]{.underline} that is **[likely to only compound
emerging global challenges]{.underline}**. At worst, it is a thin veneer
over a deeper intent of perpetuating unipolarity for its own sake.
Either way, [it is an outmoded approach to our time of uncertainty,
**increasing multipolarity, and a planetary crisis**]{.underline}.
Restraint may be, as Deudney and Ikenberry state, a "radical challenge
to the main course of American foreign policy." But it is exactly the
[corrective we need to American grand strategy **that can pave the way
for a more secure and prosperous world order.**]{.underline}

[Despite conventional wisdom that the AIIB represents a challenge to the
liberal international order]{.underline} and Chinese ambitions to
establish a Sinocentric international order, the AIIB is [an example of
**contested multilateralism**]{.underline}. Specifically, it is a
[strategy of]{.underline} [competitive regime creation]{.underline} to
[better reflect the interests of China]{.underline} [**in the
multilateral development sector** without challenging the]{.underline}
**[constitutional structure and the fundamental institutions of the
liberal international order]{.underline}**. In fact, the AIIB has been
[working **collaboratively with parallel institutions**]{.underline}
within the regime complex such as [the World Bank, the IMF,
the]{.underline} European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
([EBRD]{.underline}), and the ADB. In assessing whether the AIIB
signifies deconcentration and delegitimation of the U.S.-led liberal
order, it is too early to tell whether the AIIB will evolve into a
multilateral development bank that serves as an instrument to export a
Chinese model of economic statecraft such as state capitalism. Moreover,
this paper examines only the AIIB as an example of Chinese contestation
of the liberal international order and future research can test the
contestation-challenge distinction of revisionist state behavior with
other case studies in different issue-areas to corroborate the argument
laid out in this paper. Moreover, the task remains on sophisticated ways
to distinguish contestations from challenges in the security domain.

Certainly, the developmental model, emphasizing export promotion with a
high degree of state intervention, is touted as an alternative pathway
to achieve economic growth, especially after the experiences of the 1997
Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis. However,
[it is hard to disregard the possibility of China using these
infrastructure projects as ways to promote Chinese
interest]{.underline}s, by exporting excess capacity in domestic
industries while paving the way for increased connectivity along the
lines of land and sea communications. After all, [even if China had the
intention to construct a regional sphere of influence and an exclusive
China-led international order, the success of such endeavor would rely
on **China's ability to continue its material rise** and to buy
voluntary compliance of secondary power]{.underline}s, earning
legitimacy of a renewed Chinese leadership in the region by presenting
an alternative order[. An early assessment of Chinese efforts at
order-building in the multilateral development domain,]{.underline}
reveals that [secondary powers are]{.underline}, **[gradually, finding
the shortcomings of China-led initiatives]{.underline}**, ranging from
the lack of transparency to the incurrence of exorbitant national debts.
At the same time, the [introduction of]{.underline} the '[Build Back
Better World]{.underline} (B3W)' partnership, by the Biden
administration, [may restore U.S. leadership in the global
infrastructure development]{.underline} sector with emphasis on liberal
values such as transparency, good governance, and environmental
safeguards (The White House, 2021).

If [China is **contesting, not challenging**]{.underline} [the liberal
international order]{.underline}, the countermeasures of the United
States, as the guardian of the liberal international order, become
equally dependent upon the question of whether China will transform into
a 'revolutionary' revisionist power from today's 'reformist' revisionist
power. [A strategy of '**hard' containment** and the use of **coercive
measures to**]{.underline} [suppress Chinese influence]{.underline} in
the region **[will further aggravate Chinese dissatisfaction towards the
liberal international order.]{.underline}** This will [motivate China
to]{.underline} actively [**seek counter-hegemonic military coalitions**
with strategic partners, **such as Russia**]{.underline}, [to challenge
the United States at all levels.]{.underline} Therefore, [it
is]{.underline} [important for the United States to **accommodate
China's legitimate demands**]{.underline} within established
institutions that reflect the changes in the distribution of
capabilities.

Considering [the liberal international order]{.underline} in its
idealized form, it **[seems to be trapped in a deepening
crisis]{.underline}**. The [first sign of crisis is evident **in the
decline of the United States**]{.underline} and its **[gradual
disengagement]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} **[international
affairs]{.underline}**, especially after Trump took office. During his
first term, Trump withdrew from the Paris Accord; the Trans-Pacific
Partnership; the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO); and the United Nations Human Rights Council
(UNHRC). Moreover, he has **[generated tensions]{.underline}** [with
long-term allies in Europe]{.underline} and **[tarnished the image of
the liberal order.]{.underline}** As expressed by Trump in his speech at
the UN General Assembly, "[America will always choose independence and
cooperation over global governance, control, and
dominatio]{.underline}n" \[20\]. It seems that the United States is
stepping back from its role as a world leader. Some scholars lament
that, without a broader vision as defender of the free world, and with a
new focus on pursuing narrow national interest, Trump's America is
abandoning its "global leadership" as the "long-time champion" of the
liberal international order \[21\]. Even worse, Trump has [launched a
direct attack on this order---the system of multilateral trade and
alliances that the United States built]{.underline} to serve its
interests and attract others to its "way of life" \[22\]. Cooley and
Nexon's assessment further demonstrates that the unravelling of American
hegemony was already underway before Trump's presidency. Trump only sped
up America's retreat in the liberal international order \[23\].
Moreover, the doubt cast on America's leadership by its allies in
Europe, the loss of "a vision of how the world is supposed to work", and
the challenge from internal fragmentation all contributed to "the
eclipse of the West" \[24\].

[The second sign of crisis is]{.underline} the **[rise of China and
Russia]{.underline}** in the international arena. Scholars had already
sounded alarms before Trump took office. Besides their military power,
challengers like [China and Russia threaten]{.underline} t**[he existing
liberal order by disrupting it with their own political
systems]{.underline}**, interests, and ideologies \[25\]. According to
Stephens, the rise of revisionist powers, including China, Russia, and
Iran, have posed [serious challenges to America's claims on "both the
goodness and the success of the liberal-democratic model"]{.underline}.
[As these powers become increasingly]{.underline} [**assertive and
ambitious**, the U.S.-led order is]{.underline} **[in deep trouble
\[]{.underline}**26\]. Moreover, [a larger group of
challenger]{.underline}s---**[the emerging economies in the BRICS
countries (]{.underline}**Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South
Africa)---are [increasingly undermining]{.underline} the Western
dominance, especially after the financial crisis in 2008 \[5, 6\]. In
particular, in recent years, China has moved from a reformist of the
liberal international order to a revisionist that seeks to establish
"new systems of governance and international cooperation" \[27: 14\].
The factors behind this change include [China's renewed
self-confidence]{.underline} and **[awareness of a greater role in
global arena]{.underline}**, [the reluctance of the West to
reform]{.underline}, the weakening of the United States after the 2008
financial crisis, [and the dominant powers' alienation of developing
countries]{.underline} \[27\]. Although scholars disagree on the extent
of disruption that China may bring to the liberal international order,
there are evident concerns that the U.S.-led order may be replaced by a
new one dominated by China \[26--28\].

To many Western scholars, these two trends---the retreat of the United
States and the rise of powerful challengers---are indeed worrisome, as
reflected in their warnings of a "new global disorder" \[25\] or "a
descent into the chaos of a world without effective institutions that
encourage and organize cooperation."2 In Stephens's words, the only
alternative to Pax Americana would be global disorder \[26\]. And it is
likely to bring about "a highly competitive international environment"
that may result in "unprecedented global calamity" \[29\]. The main
problem with this line of argument is that, the liberal international
order discussed by these [scholars]{.underline} tends to [mix its
normative aspect with the observed reality]{.underline}. Their [emphasis
on the normative or idealized aspect of the liberal international
order]{.underline} often [leads to the assumption that this order is a
unitary and cohesive]{.underline} whole that needs to be preserved in
its original form, including perpetuating the American dominance. As
such, [any existing alternatives or emerging experiments are considered
as **disruptive**]{.underline} to the order or sowing the seeds of
disorder. In particular, an illiberal order would be considered as the
opposite of all the good things brought together in the liberal order.
It will be "politically and economically divided and closed,
authoritarian, uncooperative, coercive, and disrespectful of rules and
norms" \[30: 5\].

However, to understand the depth of the crisis of liberal international
order, it is necessary to examine the differences between the normative
order and the empirically observed order. As Rosenau notes, to be
insensitive to their distinctions will "run the risk of either clouding
sound analysis with preferred outcomes or confounding preferred outcomes
with empirically faulty recommendations" \[31: 10\]. Sch[olars need to
distinguish observations of the reality of the international order from
judgments and visions of such ord]{.underline}er. In Buzan's words,
adopting the normative aspect of such a concept could be seen as an
effort to consider what is possible and advocate what is desirable \[32:
300\]. However, it is necessary to acknowledge that [the reality on the
ground may not approximate the desired ideal.]{.underline} [Regarding
the current liberal international order]{.underline}, its [advocates
often offer a **narrow and highly selective view of
history**]{.underline}. They tend to [ignore aspects of]{.underline}
**[coercion, violence, and instability in the post-war
era]{.underline}**, while emphasizing the order's unwavering support for
democracy, freedom, and human rights \[1\]. This tendency has led to
what Allison calls the "myth of the liberal order". In his words, the
[liberal international order is]{.underline} essentially "**[an imagined
past in which the United States molded the world in its
image"]{.underline}** \[33\]. Moreover, the nostalgic view of the
liberal order is ahistorical as it ignores the process of ordering that
was marked by episodes of violence, coercion, and resistance, as well as
the imperial prerogatives of the [United States]{.underline} that had
**[often disregarded rules and accommodated illiberal
forces]{.underline}** \[30\].

[Beneath]{.underline} the **[surface of "stability" and
"peace]{.underline}**", [the liberal international order is]{.underline}
**[rife with tensions]{.underline}**, the first of which comes from the
competition between different political-economic models. That is, the
[liberal model,]{.underline} supported by dominant Western powers, [is
challenged by the so-called illiberal models]{.underline} promoted by
major challengers like China. These models are by no means pure in their
forms and practices. There are evident contradictions within each model.
J[ust as the liberal model has elements of coercion and violence,
t]{.underline}he **[illiberal model also contains elements of
cooperation and rule]{.underline}**. The second tension arises between
[states seeking to **assert their agency**]{.underline} [against
the]{.underline} seemingly **[inexorable and homogenizing forces of
globalization promoted by the liberal order.]{.underline}** [States
refuse to be hollowed out by the globalizing force]{.underline}s and
**[seek to assert their authority and legitimacy]{.underline}** both
within their territorial boundaries and in transnational processes. [In
the context of external shock and rising nationalism]{.underline},
states would [prioritize their]{.underline} **[national
interests]{.underline}** and make choices that are most aligned with
their material and ideological preferences. Finally, the third tension
lies between the defenders and challengers of the existing order.
[Countries with increasing military and economic power may seek to
transform the current international order]{.underline} to [better
reflect their own ideologies and serve their interests]{.underline}. The
competition between major powers could be intensified by triggers like
financial crisis or pandemic crisis.

The Challengers' Perspectives

If the existing order rests upon widening economic discrepancies among
actors, **[there will be growing pressure for change]{.underline}**. If
the material conditions, including the distribution of resources among
actors, undergo substantial change, the c[urrent arrangement could
potentially reconfigure]{.underline}, **[leading to a breakdown or
restructuring of prevailing order]{.underline}** \[31\]. Moreover, [the
image presented by the liberal world]{.underline} has been and **[will
continue to be questioned by the emerging powers]{.underline}**,
[further deepening the]{.underline} [**ideological divisions between
them.** The rising powers could also promote their images and profiles
globally]{.underline}, provide political, economic and military goods to
their clients and partners around the world, and [rally support for
their alternative political-economic models]{.underline} in the global
arena. In other words, they compete with each other to sell their models
in the global market of economic resources, security, aid, and ideology.

By highlighting the influence of ideas on the international arena, the
constructivists' account of international relations has filled in the
gap left by the liberals and realists and it offers important tools for
scholars to analyze the changing dynamic of the international order.
According to the constructivists, ideas can generate identities and
interests, help states and other actors find common solutions to
problems, and shape their understandings of threats and expectations of
the others' behavior \[34\]. The influence of ideas can work through at
least three pathways: Beliefs can serve as roadmaps for decision-making;
shared ideas can serve as focal points in facilitating cooperation; and
ideas, enhanced by the international norms and rules and embodied in the
institutional frameworks, can constrain the actors' choices \[14\].
Being embedded in the dense networks of international social relations,
states could be "socialized to want certain things" \[35: 2\].

In other words, states and other actors can choose to play the game in
the current order, respond to the changing environments, or develop
their own rules of the game to suit their purposes. The circulation of
different beliefs and ideas about how the world should be organized has
turned the international arena into a contested field. Instead of
conforming to the expectations by dominant Western countries, powerful
challengers may push for more space for multiple models of governance in
the international order. The convergence of beliefs and ideas can
reinforce the popular appeal of certain models and could serve as focal
points for different actors to coordinate their actions and reshape the
international norms. Moreover, the creation and extension of
international social networks by new institutional platforms or linkages
can facilitate socialization between states and encourage state leaders
to "want certain things", which could include access to alternative
sources of economic power, security, aid or ideology.

The [rising challengers]{.underline} have benefited from the
Western-dominated order. But they also [challenge the mythologized
liberal international order]{.underline} and [expose the contradictions
in the dominant Western mode]{.underline}l which often needs to
reconcile its proclaimed liberal values with illiberal behaviors. The
idealized image of liberal international order does not always align
with reality, especially in the case of the order's most powerful
leader. As Strange \[36: 573\] observed, there was a clear gap between
America's rhetoric in preaching liberalism, internationalism, and
multilateral decision-making, and its "inconsistent, fickle, and
unpredictable" conduct of foreign policy. Other scholars have noted
that, [there were plenty of illiberal behaviors by the countries that
**proclaimed liberal values**]{.underline}. For instance, the United
States supported authoritarian rulers throughout the Cold War, and
afterwards; it also dismantled the Bretton Woods, and invaded
Afghanistan and Iraq, etc. \[1, 37\]. Some scholars suggest that the
so-called liberal international order has "never existed". Even after
the end of the Cold War when liberal principles were promulgated to more
countries, the liberal international order only "got closer to having a
liberal quality but never quite passed the threshold" \[38\].

By treating the potential change in the current international order as a
crisis, many prominent scholars reveal their Western-centric, and
especially the U.S.-centric, views of IR. As Hobson points out, many IR
scholars continue to reproduce the discourse of power through their own
works. For instance, one prominent scholar who signed the public
statement has argued on another occasion that, humanitarian
interventionism and structural adjustment programs are essential for
keeping the non-Western world on track toward Western-style liberal
capitalism and democracy. Without interventions by the West, these
countries are denied the opportunities and "privileges" to imitate the
advanced Western model \[39: 17--18\]. This argument echoes the tone in
the public statement, which emphasizes how the existing order has served
the United States and its allies well for more than seven decades and
brought unprecedented levels of prosperity and peace to the world.3 In
the meantime, there is no mention of what kind of reform and change is
needed.

In the challengers' eyes, such [reform]{.underline} **[has been delayed
for too long]{.underline}**. The [pressure on the current international
order began building during the financial crisi]{.underline}s in 2008.
Before that, advanced countries in the Group of Seven ([G7]{.underline})
promised to give more voices to emerging economies in international
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But they
[failed to deliver on promised reforms]{.underline}. Instead of
embracing "the dawn of a new era of multilateralism", the world is
witnessing "the last gasp of an old-fashioned concert of great powers"
\[5: 51\]. Another example is the World Bank, which Weaver \[4: 3\]
illustrates as mired in "bureaucratic 'pathologies', dysfunctions, and
legitimacy crises", unable to make substantive changes in its
structures, policies, ideologies, and behaviors. As a result, a new
order less reliant on these traditional international institutions, such
as the IMF and the World Bank, may be emerging.

Similarly, Stephen argues that existing international institutions are
often too "sticky" to adapt to the new distribution of power and the
preferences brought by the diverse group of emerging powers. The
challenges from the BRICS countries may bring about an order that is
"strongly contested, less universal, less liberal, and more fragmented"
\[6: 484\]. Ikenberry notes that the old U.S.-led order may be in the
"crisis of transition" whereby "a new configuration of global power, new
coalitions of states, new governance institutions" will emerge \[10:
8\]. As Acharya observes, a key driving factor to this fragmentation is
"the outdated system of privilege enjoyed by the Western countries and
their abuse of existing rules and norms and resistance to the lack of
reform of multilateral institutions" \[3: 457\]. In a post-hegemonic
multiplex world, the United States must relinquish certain privileges
and share its power and authority with emerging powers \[40\]. However,
the United States has already shown its reluctance to share its power
and privileges, despite its gradual retreat from global leadership.

In a white paper that focuses on the relation between China and the
world, China criticizes the theory that assumes China will seek hegemony
as it gets stronger and pose serious threat to the world. The report
points out that this interpretation is driven by "cognitive
misunderstanding, deep-rooted prejudice, a psychological imbalance
brought about by the prospect of falling power, and deliberate
distortions by vested interests" \[41\]. One the one hand, the report
emphasizes China's contribution to the world economy as "a stabilizing
force and power source" and "an important promoter of global openness
and a dynamic market". It further states that, China has benefited from
the international community and in return provides it with more and
better public goods. On the other hand, the report points out the
dangers of blindly copying or being forced to adopt the Western model,
which had led to "social unrest, economic crisis, governance paralysis,
and even endless civil war". The report proposes to build "a global
community of shared future" that opposes "the law of the jungle, power
politics and hegemonism" \[41\].

As stated in the report, [in a new model of international relations,
there should be]{.underline} 1) **[mutual respect based on equality
among all countries]{.underline}** and **[respect of other's political
systems]{.underline}** and developmental paths; 2) [equal right and
equal access]{.underline} to opportunities and [proper balancing of
national interests and contribution]{.underline} to international
community; and 3) [mutually beneficial cooperation]{.underline}. More
importantly, the world should uphold the international order or global
governance system with the United Nations as its core, rather than the
United States. According to the report, China has no intention of
replacing the United States. But [the United States also needs
to]{.underline} "**[abandon the Cold War mentality,]{.underline}** and
develop a proper understanding of itself, China, and the world",
adapting to the development and prosperity of other countries and living
in harmony with them \[41\]. If it fails to do so and tries to maintain
its strength by suppressing other countries, any serious strategic
miscalculation may lead to conflict and confrontation between major
countries.

#### Only [inclusion]{.underline} of China into the world order solves [every global threat]{.underline}\-\--its [cooperate or die]{.underline}

\"Existential Gap: Digital/AI Acceleration and the Missing Global
Governance Capacity,\" Centre for International Governance Innovation,
2-14-2022,
https://www.cigionline.org/articles/existential-gap-digitalai-acceleration-and-the-missing-global-governance-capacity/,
accessed 7-7-2022 WMK

We are [facing]{.underline} an **[ever-growing gap]{.underline}**
[between the phenomenal **acceleration of technology**]{.underline} and
of connectivity, [and the human capacity to **manage these
trends**]{.underline}. The gap is well-documented in the [fields of
**finance, climate change, pandemics and nuclear risks.**]{.underline}
But the contrast between the exponential growth of disruptive technology
and the lacklustre supply of governance mechanisms is starkest in the
fields of digital governance and artificial intelligence (AI).

That [gap becomes **existential**]{.underline} [when we consider the
likely future development of]{.underline} **[artificial]{.underline}**
general **[intelligence]{.underline}** (AGI) (Ord 2020) or
superintelligence (Bostrom 2015) [that can be
**misaligned**]{.underline} with human values or even the goal of
ensuring the continuity of human existence. This [question of the
governance of life with AI may be the most essential question of our
tim]{.underline}e (Tegmark 2017), but [you would not know it from the
**current output of global governance**]{.underline} in this field.
Summarizing the judgement of many scientists in the field, Toby Ord
argues that unaligned AGI is actually the number-one global existential
risk for humanity, with a 10 percent chance of human extinction within
100 years. The prophesized existential threats posed by extreme and
accelerated technological advancement and expansion have never been as
close to reality as they are now. As noted by Yuval Noah Harari and
Daniel Kahneman (2021) in a recent conversation, [the task of taming and
governing the digital/AI **revolution is daunting**]{.underline}.
Humanity may have no slack for a mistake this time around, [given the
**existential consequences of**]{.underline} such **[a
mistake.]{.underline}**

Today, we already benefit from tremendous digital or AI innovations in
e-commerce, social media and communication, home management, work,
health care, education, transportation, and entertainment (West and
Allen 2020). We can foresee that AI-driven algorithms may soon be able
to correct human judgement flaws (or noise) caused by fatigue,
irregularity, emotions and other weaknesses, afflictions that can
generate variation in decisions by up to 50 percent (Kahneman, Sibony
and Sunstein 2021). Within two decades, we can envisage a world with
generalized deep learning and virtual reality, computer vision,
contactless love, fully autonomous vehicles in most advanced and
emerging economies, autonomous weapons in militaries and a dream of
plenitude (Lee and Chen 2021).

Yet, today, we witness tremendous havoc created by the explosion of
social anger, exacerbated by sophisticated social media algorithms, deep
polarization, the return of tribal politics, the loss of agreed truths
and the spread of misinformation and dangerous conspiracies, the loss of
privacy, the rise of massive and uber-powerful tech companies, and
massive job displacement and inequality (Bartlett 2018). Influence
operations by foreign states have also amplified such social anger and
polarization in many democracies, adding a degree of external threat and
urgency. [We also live with a world of
security]{.underline}-[driven]{.underline} digital
**[decoupling]{.underline}** [between]{.underline} **[the United States
and China]{.underline}** (Ma 2021). In other words, the digital
revolution is moving faster than the human capacity to cope with it,
embed it within a public good-oriented framework and steer its
disruptive power toward a non-destructive direction.

The [problem]{.underline} is visible at the national level but
**[particularly salient at the global level.]{.underline}** Digital/data
[governance]{.underline} is **[fragmenting among at least four
poles]{.underline}**: [a US model]{.underline} with maximum innovation
and limited regulation; [an EU model with a strong regulatory balance;
a]{.underline}n [India model]{.underline} with an [emphasis on digital
sovereignty]{.underline} and infant industry protection (applicable to
other developing countries); and a [Chinese model with both rapid
innovation, strong state control and surveillance]{.underline}. Our
[global governance capacity]{.underline} is **[affected by multiple
splits]{.underline}**: a US-EU split over privacy, tax and anti-monopoly
regulations; an India-West split over data ownership and first-mover
advantage; and, worst of all, a potential digital cold war between the
United States (and its allies) and China. In response to this dire need
for governance, Rohinton P. Medhora and Taylor Owen (2020) have proposed
a need for a new fundamental effort at coordinated governance --- or a
"digital Bretton Woods." While fundamental international conditions and
global distribution of power today differ drastically from the Bretton
Woods era, a high-stake and fragmented [digital world]{.underline} is
**[in dire need of]{.underline}** such renewed **[cooperative
spirit.]{.underline}**

Recognizing the gap in digital governance, we ask the following
questions: What is the scale of the gap in governance relative to
requirements needed to keep the digital economy afloat? And what could
be a pathway forward in the context of the growing securitization and
increasing divides?

[It is urgent to **raise a sense of awareness**]{.underline}, mobilize
all social and public actors around this urgent dilemma and catalyze a
multi-level effort to address this conundrum. We argue that no global,
regional or national institution alone will be able to deliver the right
governance capacity. Instead, we recommend a highly reactive, innovative
and competitive model of networked governance that operates at multiple
levels with key nodes and catalysts.

**[Governance innovation]{.underline}** [must keep pace with
**technological innovation**]{.underline}. Given how far the digital
cold war has already proceeded and the currently low capacity to
cooperate between the United States and China, part of the [solution
will need]{.underline} to involve clubs and alliances of countries and
non-state actors. At the same time, some level of **[global
coordination]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**basic rules for global
co-existence** are crucial for **success in managing this existential
threat**]{.underline}. The Group of Twenty (G20) is one critical venue
for such work, even though it has not delivered so far.

### 1nc -- China War and Relations

#### LIO causes miscalc -- most likely scenario for war and collapses US-China relations 

**Glaser, PhD, 19**

(Charles, PublicPolicy@Harvard, ProfPoliSci@GeorgeWashington, A Flawed
Framework: Why the Liberal International Order Concept Is Misguided,
International Security, 43:4, 51-87)

[To improve analysis and debate of U.S. foreign policy,
scholars,]{.underline} policy analysts, [and [policymakers should
**discontinue use of the term "liberal international order**"]{.mark}
and its variants]{.underline}, including "hegemonic liberal order."
First, for reasons discussed above, [the LIO concept provides little
analytic leverage; it is inward looking, and]{.underline} certain of
[its arguments are theoretically weak]{.underline}. Second, the [LIO
discourse is a source of significant confusion]{.underline} about both
the evolution of global politics and U.S. policy. As I argued at the
outset, [[scholars]{.mark} and commentators [do not have an agreed
understanding about what the LIO includes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [More
important, [the **LIO terminology clouds analysis of international
policy** by obscuring what is actually occurring]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Consider, for example, the common observation that the LIO faces growing
threats as a result of China\'s rise and Russia\'s assertive foreign
policies. These dangers, however, have actually strengthened U.S.
alliances and, in turn, the LIO. At least until the Trump
administration, China\'s rise was increasing the depth and cohesion of
U.S. alliances in Northeast Asia. Similarly, Russia\'s increasingly
aggressive behavior in Ukraine and elsewhere was helping reinvigorate
NATO. In short, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is facing
growing threats to its security, not to the LIO]{.underline}. Although
perhaps counterintuitive, it was the early post--Cold War decades that
posed the greatest threat to the security elements of the LIO---the lack
of major power threats to U.S. security weakened U.S. alliances. It
should also be noted that China is much more integrated into the
international economy, including importantly via the WTO, than the
Soviet Union ever was. Whether China\'s economic inclusion is a net
positive for the United States remains an open question, but it
certainly strengthens the economic pillar of the LIO. Third, [framing
analysis of U.S. policy in terms of the LIO builds in a significant
status quo bias]{.underline}. Much of the [discussion of the LIO starts
from the premise that it is desirable and needs to be
preserved]{.underline}.95 [During periods of significant change in the
distribution of power,]{.underline} however, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should be reconsidering whether to preserve
its]{.underline} international [commitments and exploring how best to
achieve its]{.underline} fundamental [interests]{.underline} in the
decades ahead.96 Fourth, [by viewing the LIO as an unalloyed good, U.S.
leaders]{.underline} risk [fail]{.underline}ing to
[appreciate]{.underline} fully [that adversaries of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [view central pillars of the
LIO]{.underline}---its alliances, in particular---[as a source of
competition and threat.]{.underline} [For example]{.underline}, the LIO
perspective contributed to U.S. enthusiasm for [expanding
NATO]{.underline} eastward to spread democracy, while giving too little
weight to Russia\'s understanding of expansion\'s negative implications.
Similarly, it likely contributes to U.S. underappreciation of the threat
that the U.S.-Japan alliance, especially the [broadening of Japan\'s
responsibilities]{.underline} in the alliance, poses to China.
[These]{.underline} U.S. [misperceptions [increase the probability that
the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will
misinterpret adversaries' policies by failing to understand them as
**reactions to threatening U.S. policies.**]{.mark} **[The LIO\'s status
quo bias and its contribution]{.mark} t**o]{.underline} these [U.S.
misperceptions are]{.underline} potentially [dangerous, because they
[encourage]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
[exaggerate the]{.mark} threats it faces and to pursue unduly
competitive policies]{.underline}. [Framing China as a threat to the LIO
reflects and combines both of these dangers,]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} thereby **[[unnecessarily aggravates U.S.-China
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**.97 For all of these reasons, [scholars
and policymakers should use LIO terminology, at most, for descriptive
purposes]{.underline}. The LIO [would simply refer to the international
situation, including]{.underline} the [key]{.underline} international
[institutions]{.underline}, the [rules]{.underline} that support them,
[and the regime types of its members]{.underline}. [It **would not imply
desirability or the ability** to]{.underline} generate, [even contribute
to, specific international outcomes, beyond those generated by its
individual elements]{.underline}. **[Even this usage has
disadvantages]{.underline}**, among others [that there is **no agreement
on which elements the LIO includes**.]{.underline} ADVANTAGES OF A
GRAND-STRATEGIC LENS [To generate]{.underline} greater [clarity
about]{.underline} the [international challenges facing the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its options for
confronting them, **[analysts should employ a grand-strategic
lens]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [By grand strategy, I mean [the broad
policies---military, diplomatic, and economic---that a state pursues to
achieve its vital interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.98 **[[The LIO is
simultaneously a product of]{.mark} U.S. grand strategy [and a part of
U.S. grand strategy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The U.S. Cold War grand
strategy of containment called for protecting Western Europe from the
Soviet Union; NATO was created for this purpose and is a key component
of the LIO. The economic dimension of U.S. grand strategy is the liberal
international economic system, which is a second key component of the
LIO; it reflects long-held U.S. beliefs in both the economic benefits of
openness and the potential of openness to support peace. [[Adoption of a
grand-strategic lens would improve]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[analysis]{.mark} of issues raised by the LIO discourse]{.underline} by
[[placing them in the wider context of U.S. options]{.mark} for dealing
with current geopolitical challenges.]{.underline} It would have three
specific advantages. First, [it would improve analysis of U.S. interests
and threats to those interests]{.underline}. [The initial
step]{.underline} in any analysis [of grand strategy is to [identify a
state\'s fundamental interests]{.mark}]{.underline}; typically, security
and prosperity rank highest. [The next step is to [consider threats to
these interests]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The **LIO
lens**]{.underline}]{.mark} essentially [**[skips these steps]{.mark}**
by [assuming that the LIO is a fundamental U.S.
interest]{.mark}]{.underline}; [anything that threatens the LIO is
therefore a threat to U.S. interests]{.underline}. As I explained at the
outset, however, **[[the LIO is not an end/interest; instead, it is a
means for achieving U.S. interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[Shifting to
a grand-strategic framework]{.mark} should [impose]{.mark} the
**[analytic discipline]{.mark}** required to avoid these
errors.]{.underline} Second, [adoption of a grand-strategic framework
[would require]{.mark} [engaging with]{.mark}]{.underline} theories and
[[theoretical disputes relevant to]{.mark} the formulation of
[U.S]{.mark}. international [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Grand
strategy reflects]{.underline} beliefs/[theories that play a central
role in identifying threats and provide the logical connection between a
state\'s interests and the available means for achieving
them]{.underline}. [The LIO concept includes some
theories]{.underline}/mechanisms about the nature of threats to U.S.
interests and about possible solutions: [authoritarian regimes are
dangerous,]{.underline} democracies are not; [economic engagement can
reduce]{.underline} incentives for [war]{.underline}; economic growth
will convert authoritarian regimes to democracies; [and so
on]{.underline}. The [[LIO discourse **proceeds as though these theories
are widely accepted**]{.mark}**,** [when in fact scholarly
debate]{.mark} over them [continues]{.mark}.]{.underline} In addition,
[[a range of **additional theories must be employed to adequately
analyze U.S.**]{.mark} **international [policy]{.mark}**]{.underline},
including those [that address deterrence, power transitions, alliance
formation, the security dilemma, and other causes of war]{.underline}.
Employing [a [grand-strategic framework should result in]{.mark} this
**[more complete and transparent theoretical
analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}.99 Third[, a grand-strategic framework
would identify the full spectrum of]{.underline} broad [options for
achieving U.S. security]{.underline} and prosperity, [ranging from
neo-isolationist policies]{.underline} that would terminate U.S.
alliances [to global hegemony]{.underline} that requires intense
military and economic competition with China. In contrast, [[the LIO
lens starts with **a single option and the assumption that it is
desirable**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A [[grand-strategic lens would
generate **comparisons and assessments** of the range of
possible]{.mark} grand [strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Preface: **[[Global Future Depends on Depth of China-US
Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The [world]{.underline} has achieved unprecedented peace, prosperity,
and inter-dependence, but past achievements --- and further
[progress]{.underline} --- [are threatened by]{.underline} a host of
[looming challenges]{.underline}. Global institutions that served us
well and transformed the world are becoming victims of their own success
and must be reformed or replaced to deal with new challenges and take
advantage of new opportunities. Governments everywhere face rising
expectations and increasing demands but find themselves less able to
manage the challenges they face. [The next round of
challenges]{.underline} [can only be managed successfully
if]{.underline} nations, especially [major powers,
cooperate]{.underline}. Moreover, [the most difficult and most
consequential challenges]{.underline} [cannot be managed]{.underline}
effectively **[without sustained cooperation between]{.underline}** the
largest developing country, **[China, and]{.underline}** the largest
developed country, **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. Stated another way, [the ability of China and
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to work
together]{.underline} on critical global challenges will
[determine]{.underline} [whether the world is able to]{.underline}
sustain and enhance mutually beneficial developments or fails to [cope
with]{.underline} the [issues critical to]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
**[global future]{.underline}** and to the security and prosperity of
the United States and China. This shared conviction persuades us that we
must do more than just hope that our countries will find ways to
cooperate. This report represents a joint effort to develop both the
rationale and concrete mechanisms for sustained, proactive collaboration
to address challenges resulting from long-term global trends and
consequential uncertainties. It builds on the findings of independent
efforts to identify megatrends and potential game-changers with the goal
of developing a framework for the US-China relationship that will better
enable us to meet the challenges facing the global community and the
strategic needs of both countries. [The]{.underline} Joint Working
[Group recognizes]{.underline} that China and the United States hold
different views on many bilateral and international issues, and that
[our relationship is constrained by]{.underline} mutual
[suspicion]{.underline} [and]{.underline} strategic
[mistrust]{.underline}. [Nevertheless]{.underline}, our **[common
strategic interests]{.underline}** and responsibility as major powers
[are more important]{.underline} than the specific issues that divide
us; we must not make cooperation on critical global issues contingent on
prior resolution of bilateral disputes. Our disagreements on bilateral
issues are important, but they are not as important to our long-term
security and prosperity as is our ability to cooperate on key challenges
to global security and our increasingly intertwined futures. We must
cooperate on global challenges not as a favor to one another or because
other nations expect us to exercise leadership in the international
system. We must do it because failure to cooperate on key global
challenges will have profoundly negative consequences for the citizens
of our own countries. The Joint Working Group has no illusions about how
difficult the task ahead will be. Leaders in both countries face
relentless domestic pressures to focus on near-term issues, often to the
detriment of long-term interests, as well as on looming US-China
bilateral differences and mutual suspicions. This report seeks to
illustrate why it is imperative and how it is possible to pursue long-
and short-term interests at the same time.

How We Reached Key Assessments and Recommendations

Generous support from the China-United States Exchange Foundation
enabled the Atlantic Council and the China Institute of International
Studies (CIIS) to establish a Joint Working Group of experts from both
countries. The members of the group met in Beijing and Washington in the
spring and summer of 2012 to compare and integrate the findings of
separate Chinese and US draft reports on global trends. The Chinese
projection of trends, entitled Global Trends to 2030 and the Prospects
for China-US Relations, was prepared by CIIS with contributions from the
School of International Studies at Peking University. The US report,
Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds, was prepared by the US National
Intelligence Council (NIC).\[1\] The Atlantic Council contributed to the
NIC report and members of the NIC team attended (as observers) the joint
assessment meetings. This review confirmed that the independently
developed reports were generally consistent in their assessments of
global trends and provided a solid basis for development of scenarios to
illustrate what might happen under different assumptions about
cooperation between China and the United States. The scenarios in both
analyses depict markedly different outcomes for China, the United
States, and the world. When China and the United States cooperate to
meet looming challenges, both countries benefit. When they fail to
cooperate and pursue narrow interests or win-lose or zero-sum outcomes,
both countries lose. Continuing down the path of drift and episodic
cooperation that we are on now also leads to lose-lose outcomes. The
obvious advantages of win-win outcomes and dangerous implications of
behaviors that eschew or minimize cooperation create strong incentives
to focus on megatrends, critical challenges, and enhancing the
likelihood of success and mutual benefit through close and continuous
collaboration. This report outlines the case for collaboration and makes
several specific recommendations to make cooperation both possible and
fruitful. It was drafted and circulated among group members for
revisions and to ensure consensus. China and the United States have
different interests, objectives, and perspectives on many matters, and
the number of issues in dispute may well grow as we broaden our
bilateral relationship and at times disagree with one another on the
world stage. Resolving some of these issues will be difficult and
require much time and effort. The resolution of these contentious issues
in the US-China relationship, however, must not be made a prerequisite
for cooperation on a limited but arguably more important set of issues
with the clear potential to harm both of our interests. Continued drift
toward strategic competition and failure to find a balance of interests
on core issues will undermine support in both countries for cooperation
on major global issues of mutual interest and benefit. Cooperation on
shared global challenges may build trust and make it easier to resolve
nettlesome bilateral issues. But that would be an ancillary benefit and
should not be the primary reason for collaboration on the global
challenges identified in the independently prepared studies and
summarized elsewhere in this report. The primary reasons we need to work
together on the [global challenges]{.underline} are that they [cannot be
addressed successfully]{.underline} [unless we do,]{.underline} and that
[failure to deal effectively with]{.underline}
[[consequential]{.underline} **[megatrends]{.underline}** [will have
deleterious consequences for]{.underline}]{.mark} China, the United
States, and [the world]{.underline}. [It is difficult to envision a
stable, prosperous global system absent a US-China relationship that
is]{.underline} largely a [cooperative]{.underline} one. Forces and
[megatrends]{.underline} that are visible but not well understood today
will shape the futures of people everywhere. The list
[[includes]{.underline}]{.mark} consequences of globalization that
increase prosperity but also increase **[[demand for water, food, and
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It also includes demographic change and
**[[effects of climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [**[will
intensify]{.mark}** the consequences]{.underline} of other megatrends
and make them more difficult to manage. Some of [the
megatrends]{.underline} and the way they interact will
[[threaten]{.underline}]{.mark} social and political
[**[stability]{.underline}** [unless managed
effectivel]{.underline}]{.mark}[y]{.underline}. [All have profound
implications for]{.underline} governance and **[global
stability]{.underline}**. How effectively governments meet and manage
these challenges in the next ten to twenty years will determine how
beneficial or detrimental they will be for our countries and our
children. Successfully navigating the turbulent waters ahead will
require understanding the challenges we face and foresight about the
implications of alternative paths. Our common goal must be to avert or
ameliorate negative outcomes, and to maximize the chances of achieving
desirable outcomes. To accomplish this goal, China and the United States
must establish and draw on a continuing dialogue on the evolution,
implications, and possible policy responses to the most consequential
megatrends, key uncertainties, and disruptive change. The framework and
policy recommendations of this report seek to jumpstart that process by
suggesting mechanisms for collaboration that begin bilaterally but
eventually include other nations critical to finding paths to a better
future for all.

I. Critical Importance of China-US Cooperation

[[The global future is likely to be]{.mark} **[increasingly volatile and
uncertain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The rate of change is increasing,
driven by the accelerating pace of technological development,
unprecedented urbanization and growth of the global middle class, and a
wide range of challenges beyond the control of any one country but
potentially affecting the prosperity and security of all countries.
Disruptive change in one geographic or functional area will spread
quickly.. [No country]{.underline}, and certainly not those with the
largest populations and largest economies, [will be immune]{.underline}.
[Global challenges]{.underline} like climate change, **[food and water
shortages, and resource scarcities]{.underline}** will shape the
strategic context for all nations and [require
reconsideration]{.underline} [of traditional national
concerns]{.underline} such as sovereignty and maximizing the ability of
national leaders to control their country's destiny. [What China and the
United States do]{.underline}, individually and together, [will have
a]{.underline} [**major impact** on the future]{.underline} [of the
global system]{.underline}. As importantly, [our]{.underline} individual
[fate]{.underline}s [will be]{.underline} **[inextricably
linked]{.underline}** to how that future plays out. The three
illustrative scenarios sketched out below underscore how critical the
future of the US-China relationship is to each country and to the world.
, Global Drift and Erosion ([the present world trajectory]{.underline}):
In a world in which [nations fail to resolve global
problems]{.underline} and strengthen mechanisms of global cooperation,
governments gradually turn inward. Each nation seeks to protect and
advance its own narrow national interests or to preserve an
unsustainable status quo that is rapidly changing in ways that erode the
international order. The international community's lack of ability to
cooperate to meet global challenges leads to international crises and
instability. , Zero-Sum World: Unsustainable drift leads to a world of
predominantly zero-sum competition and conflict in the face of severe
resource constraints. The result is economic crises and internal
instability as well as interstate confrontation. There is risk of
military conflict between major powers, which increases global mistrust
and uncertainty and fosters an "each nation for itself" mentality that
further undermines the ability of states to cooperate in the face of
growing common challenges. , Global Revitalization and Cooperation: [To
escape the perils]{.underline} [of drift]{.underline} or zero-sum
competition, [leaders]{.underline} in countries with the most to lose
**[work together]{.underline}** [to manage]{.underline} and take
advantage of global challenges and [megatrends]{.underline}.
[Cooperation makes it possible to achieve]{.underline} [win-win outcomes
that avoid or mitigate negative consequences]{.underline} [of increased
demand for resources and the impact of climate change]{.underline} as
well as to harness new technologies to improve living conditions through
sustainable development. Cooperation creates and utilizes new
transnational institutions to prevent conflict and enhance security for
all. China and the United States become more prosperous as we work
together. The possible futures sketched out above (and developed at
greater length below) are intended to stimulate thinking about how
current trends and uncertainties could lead to very different global and
national outcomes. For many reasons, the United States and China will
have greater ability and incentives than other countries to cooperate in
determining and shaping developments over the next two decades. Indeed,
it is very difficult to imagine a pathway to "global revitalization and
cooperation" in which China and the United States do not cooperate and
provide critical international leadership. [Many factors]{.underline}
will [shape the future]{.underline}, some of which are beyond the
control of any nation state, [but]{.underline} China and the United
States --- and [the character of the US-China relationship]{.underline}
--- [will be]{.underline} **[critical]{.underline}**. The mutual
dependence on each other's economic performance and the success of the
global economy as a whole was demonstrated during the 2008 financial
crisis that began in the United States but quickly spread around the
world. US and Chinese leaders recognized that they were in the "same
boat" strategically and engaged in a closely coordinated response to the
crisis, which played a key---if not decisive---role in preventing the
situation from becoming much worse. The need for joint and coordinated
responses to economic crises and to mounting economic challenges and
threats is certain to increase as globalization continues and
interdependence deepens.

II\. Critical Megatrends

There are many global trends that are positive, including greater
prosperity; global economic reconvergence after two centuries of Western
economic preponderance; profound social changes driven by rapid
scientific and technological changes; a growing global middle class;
widespread improvement in global health and life expectancy; and overall
reduction in war and violent deaths. The great advances in human
prosperity over the last several decades and the potential for greater
gains in the future are to be celebrated, but they also create new
challenges shaped by megatrends in the "global operating environment".
[These megatrends include]{.underline}: , Individual empowerment is an
increasingly important factor both within states and internationally.
The empowerment of individuals is fueled by education, rising
prosperity, and a host of technologies. Empowered individuals, the
growing middle class, and domestic NGOs are more willing to engage in
political activities as well as to make more demands on government. [The
[sense of national identity]{.mark}]{.underline} is [[becoming
stronger]{.underline}]{.mark} in many places but so too are social
identities based on ethnicity, religion, culture, political concerns,
and shared causes such as the environment and public health. This trend
sometimes also [[fuels]{.mark} **[extremism and
separatism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. , Power will be increasingly diffused
as the number of players with actual or nascent capacity to influence
international deve-lopments is increasing. [The international system
evinces increasing signs of fragmentation and
stratification.]{.underline} In addition to the rise of China, India,
and Brazil, middle powers such as Turkey, Indonesia, South Africa, and
Mexico are playing an ever more important role in the international
arena. Further, the growing numbers and types of non-state actors such
as international NGOs, multinational enterprises, and regional
organizations mean states themselves no longer control the system. ,
[[Aging]{.underline}]{.mark} and urbanizing
[[populations]{.underline}]{.mark}, [accompanied by waves
of]{.underline} domestic and international [migration]{.underline}, will
transform societies and [[strain capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[More than one billion people]{.underline} [will be added]{.underline}
to the global population [by 2030]{.underline} and an equal or greater
number will move to cities. Rising incomes will enable as many as two
billion more people to join the global middle class. Nearly all of the
growth in the global population, urban dwellers, and the middle class
will occur in developing countries. Critical demographic shifts will age
populations and shrink the percentage of working-age cohorts in most of
the developed and, increasingly, in parts of the developing world as
well. China will be one of the developing countries with an aging
population. [[Waves of immigration]{.underline}]{.mark} will create or
[[exacerbate significant social]{.mark} [problems]{.mark}]{.underline},
but there also will be a huge international marketplace for skilled and
talented workers. , [There will be increasing stresses]{.underline} and
strains [on the global commons]{.underline}. Many challenges to the
**[environment]{.underline}** and human security will be intensified by
rapidly increased **[food, water]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
natural **[resource consumption]{.underline}** due to growing
population, urbanization, and rapid expansion of the middle class[. [If
not managed well]{.underline}, [these challenges could have a
significant and long-term adverse impact]{.underline}]{.mark} on all
nations and the global system. , There is increasing concern that global
climate change poses an existential threat to humanity**[. Climate
change exacerbates water shortages and food production
challenges]{.underline}**; [sparks greater migration and social
conflict]{.underline}; acidifies the oceans; [and leads to more extreme
weather events]{.underline}, including sea-level rises magnifying the
impact of storm surges threatening coastal cities and infrastructure.
There is likely to be [more focus by the international
community]{.underline} [on]{.underline} climate change **[consequence
management, adaptation, and mitigation.]{.underline}**

III\. Key Uncertainties

The megatrends summarized above constitute a relatively predictable set
of challenges facing individuals and nations, especially China and the
United States. But they are not the only factors that will influence
developments in the next two decades. The relatively predictable
megatrends will interact with a number of critical uncertainties.
Examples include: , **[[The future of the global economy is
volatile]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The developed countries, especially in
the Eurozone, may face a prolonged period of recovery. The developing
countries, including China and India, face a "middle income trap". [The
world could experience growing economic nationalism]{.underline} [and
trade protectionism]{.underline} as well as an accelerating adjustment
of international industrial division of labor as China refocuses on
domestic consumption-led growth, other nations increasingly displace
China as the low-cost provider, and new manufacturing technologies and
lower energy costs encourage the return of manufacturing to the United
States and other developed countries. In addition, major economic crises
could result from the increasing pressure on resource availability
discussed previously. , The [accelerating pace of technological
development is likely to change the global operating environment for
foreign policy and national security over the next two decades with
uncertain consequences]{.underline}. A wide range of [emerging
technologies]{.underline} will affect the political, social, economic
and security trajectories of states, international relations, and the
international system, as have the Internet, mobile communications
technology, and social media. These technologies range from new energy
systems and manufacturing technologies such as 3D printing to bio- and
nanotechnology breakthroughs affecting agricultural productivity, human
enhancement, robotics, and information availability. On the negative
side of the ledger, [**[cyber hacking, cyber warfare, and
genomics-enabled bioterrorism have the potential to be highly
disruptive.]{.mark}** ,]{.underline} [Nationalistic responses
to]{.underline} [increasing mutual vulnerability]{.underline} are likely
as growing global interconnectedness and interdependence ensure that
developments anywhere in the world, from slowly-developing threats like
climate change to short-term crises like the 2008 financial crisis, can
affect most nations and citizens yet be largely, if not completely,
outside the control of individual states. National responses to common
challenges and threats could be "each nation for itself" actions to
achieve narrow national interests at the expense of other states and the
common good. , [Unpredictable events]{.underline} such as **[[natural
disasters, extreme weather]{.underline}]{.mark}** events,
**[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or [**[nuclear weapon use by
terrorists could be game-changers]{.mark}**. An H5N1 or similar pandemic
could shut down global transportation and kill tens of millions or
more]{.underline} with a huge impact on the global economy, politics,
and security. A series of extreme weather events, foreshadowed by
Hurricane Sandy's impact on the United States, could change the
trajectories of global political efforts to deal with the consequences
of climate change. , The future of both China and the United States is
uncertain. China has many internal challenges that could limit its
willingness to be a "joint responsible stakeholder" with the United
States to meet global challenges and resolve regional conflicts.
Similarly, the United States faces major economic challenges that could
lead to long-term slow growth, a more inward focus, and a less active
and influential role in catalyzing cooperation on global challenges.
Conversely, one or both countries could achieve considerable success in
its/their domestic arena(s) and feel emboldened to lead the
transformation of the global system. , **[[Conflicts could become more
common]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and more intense]{.underline}
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} a result of **[[social unrest, religious
extremism,]{.mark} reduced]{.underline}** provision of **[public goods,
power [shifts]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and individual empowerment. [The
world's [security and stability may become increasingly fragile as a
result of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[state failure, nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or dramatic acts of
**[terrorism]{.underline}**, [especially in unstable regions like the
Middle East and South Asia.]{.underline} , [Regional
instability]{.underline} may [have global impact]{.underline}. [A major
conflict in the Middle East]{.underline}, including over Iran's nuclear
weapons, [could]{.underline} **[[draw in outside
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, disrupt oil supplies, and send the global
economy into recession. [Failure to resolve]{.underline} or indefinitely
shelve [[territorial disputes]{.underline}]{.mark} [in]{.underline} East
and Southeast [Asia]{.underline} could limit the ability of regional
states to cooperate in global as well as regional efforts to cope with
global challenges. [Military conflict]{.underline} over these disputes
also **[[could destabilize]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Asia-Pacific
region with grave consequences for the global economy and international
stability. An existential crisis of the European Union could disrupt the
cohesiveness of what is now the world's largest economy.

IV\. Governance and Cooperation Challenges of Megatrends and
Uncertainties

Although no one can predict with confidence exactly how events will play
out in the years ahead, [we can be confident that the
challenges]{.underline} and choices facing decision-makers at all levels
and in all countries [will be shaped by]{.underline} the interplay of
megatrends, known uncertainties, **[[unexpected "black swan"
events]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the decisions of governments and
nongovernmental actors. [Waiting to see how events unfold
is]{.underline} a possible but [undesirable]{.underline} choice because
waiting is, in effect, a decision to do nothing and hope for the best.
[We can and must do better than that by working to shape events in ways
that reduce uncertainty]{.underline}, [avoid or ameliorate undesirable
trajectories, and increase the likelihood of win-win
outcomes.]{.underline} Some of the challenges posed include: , Volatile
global economy: Slower economic growth and potential crises such as a
Eurozone meltdown, another global financial crisis, or a sustained spike
in food prices could slow or reverse progress toward greater prosperity
and better lives for more people. Growing inequality (worsening GINI
coefficients\[2\]) could further compound the challenges. Although the
rich and the poor alike may become richer, the absolute gaps between
them likely will widen, both within and among countries and regions.
Moreover, the middle class may continue to be squeezed not only in
developed countries but also in developing countries despite more rapid
economic growth, especially as the gap widens between the middle class
and the super rich. , Increasing internal pressures on governments:
Demands on governments at all levels likely will increase faster than
the availability of resources required to satisfy them. More people with
rising expectations and greater awareness of conditions at home and
elsewhere will have more tools, especially social media, to organize and
put pressure on governments to provide more services and opportunities.
The rising middle class in the emerging economies likely will expect and
demand more and better quality food and water, more reliable supplies of
cleaner energy, improved infrastructure, and healthier environments.
Governments could find it difficult to meet rising expectations,
however, especially growing demand for increasingly limited resources,
which will push prices upward and exacerbate economic and social
instability. At the same time, some of the poorest countries with
ineffective governments may be pushed into internal conflict and state
failure by tribal, ethnic, and religious strife as well as economic and
environmental stresses. These internal conflicts could lead to regional
instability as environmental and economic migrants spill into
neighboring states. Global cooperation gap widening: Increasing
globalization and interdependence could make it more difficult for
national govern-ments to manage new challenges on their own, but
transnational institutions will be increasingly ill-suited or even
incapable of meeting twenty-first century challenges. To meet the
growing challenges, existing global mechanisms, most of which are legacy
institutions from the post-World War II era designed to solve problems
from the inter-war period, must be reformed or replaced. That will not
be easy. There are 140 more countries today than there were when the
global system was last reformed in the 1940s and all feel entitled to a
seat at the table when decisions are made that will affect their own
destinies. This widely shared ethos of democratic participation of all
nations makes it difficult to strike a balance between equity of
representation and efficacy of decision-making. , Domestic pressures and
weak national governments: Gov-ernments may become less willing or able
to cooperate with other nations as a result of domestic pressures on
leaders to pursue narrow national interests. This will increase the
likelihood of nations engaging in zero-sum behavior that will make it
even more difficult to deal with the most challenging megatrends. ,
Extremism and fracturing of the nation-state: Extremism and separatism
are likely to be fueled by individual empowerment and tribal, ethnic,
religious, and other identities, strengthened by ubiquitous social
media. The power and authority of the nation-state is likely to be
increasingly circumscribed by the rising power of non-state actors and
the growing importance of transnational challenges beyond the state's
control. The state is being challenged in many cases by separatist and
extremist forces, including religious fundamentalists in Waziristan and
Dagestan and regional nationalists in Catalonia and Scotland. , "[Black
swans]{.underline}" and lack of robust international institutions:
Failure to establish robust international institutions and habits of
cooperation could reduce the international community's ability to
respond to major crises, including black swan events. The latter
[are]{.underline} **[[high impact]{.underline}]{.mark}** but either
improbable or simply [**[unpredictable calamities]{.mark}** such as
pandemics, nuclear weapon or biological warfare attacks, or cyber
meltdowns]{.underline}. [[If China and the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[act
as rivals]{.underline}]{.mark} and give priority to parochial interests,
**[[it may be impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the international
community [**[to successfully confront the]{.mark}** major
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} of the next twenty years. **[[Owing to
their size and importance]{.mark} in the global system, what China and
the US do together]{.underline}** as well as individually **[[will
profoundly affect the international community's ability to engage
in]{.mark} robust international [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
science and technology [to find solutions]{.underline} to the world's
most pressing problems.

V. Scenarios Illustrate Interconnections and Alternative Outcomes

As the megatrends and uncertainties evolve over the coming two decades
and beyond, China and the United States, along with the rest of the
world, will face unprecedented challenges and unpredictable, disruptive
change. We offer three global scenarios to illustrate how the complex
megatrends, key uncertainties, and disruptive changes could play out,
depending in large part on whether the relationship between China and
the United States is primarily cooperative or conflictual. , Global
Drift and Erosion: This scenario is characterized by the inability of
China and the United States to work together effectively, if at all, to
address key global challenges and to resolve regional conflicts.
Problems created or exacerbated by the megatrends, key uncertainties,
and their interactions worsen, creating a world that is less peaceful,
less stable, and less prosperous. The debacle of the 2009 Copenhagen UN
climate change conference demonstrated the global impact of the failure
of the United States and China to agree on far-reaching steps to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. In this future, the US and China again fail to
respond adequately to continuing problems such as economic imbalances
associated with the efforts of many countries to break into and then
move from middle income status to that of high income. There is
disruptive socio-political change related in part to both economic and
demographic transitions, and environmental problems involving inadequate
energy, water, and food resources. Washington and Beijing could be too
preoccupied with political and military competition and territorial
disputes in the Western Pacific, as well as by bilateral differences
over intellectual property and other trade issues, to tackle these
pressing problems. Among possible developments, US-China tensions could
adversely affect global responses to energy challenges. These range from
threats to security of supplies resulting from conflict in the Middle
East and Persian Gulf to the need for a global energy transition away
from fossil fuels to minimize carbon emissions and the impact of energy
price volatility on global economic growth. Further, China and the
United States also could fail to cooperate in efforts to mitigate the
potentially disruptive impact of greatly increased demand for food,
water, and other resources created by the addition of more than one
billion people to the global population by 2030 as well as possibly two
billion or more people to the developing world middle class. Without
adequate international cooperation and global governmental mechanisms,
this could lead to deeper economic crises, unresolved political
conflicts, and worsening environmental conditions. , Zero-Sum World: A
second possible trajectory could lead to the emergence of an even more
competitive and dangerous zero-sum world, in which nations pursue narrow
national interests. For example, the world could experience intense
monetary and trade protectionism, with countries seeking geopolitical
advantage at the expense of international cooperation for the common
good. It could see intensifying rivalries, creating hostilities and
rendering cooperation on global challenges nearly impossible as global
governmental mechanisms break down or are marginalized. In this
scenario, the impact of megatrends and critical challenges on global
developments is overwhelmingly negative. The world economy is in a
tailspin, brought on, perhaps, by a deepening European recession
followed by a new meltdown of the global financial system and then a
worse recession than that sparked by the 2008 financial crisis. Regional
conflicts and disputes in East Asia intensify suspicions and threaten to
ignite conflict among the major powers. The United States and China not
only fail to cooperate on longer-term global issues but also fail to
work together to resolve immediate regional tensions which spin out of
control, leading to military conflict that threatens to drag the US and
China into direct confrontation. , Global Revitalization and
Cooperation: A third possible trajectory could lead to a world in which
sustained and [effective cooperation builds/rebuilds key institutions to
address old and emerging challenges as well as "black
swans]{.underline}". Globalization and global integration continue apace
with more successful efforts to mitigate or prepare for negative
consequences. This scenario is characterized by greater strategic
stability among major powers and by sustained prosperity and economic
growth in China, the United States, and most other countries. [Through
cooperative development]{.underline} and deployment of new technologies
[countries implement effective measures to manage energy, water,
governance, and other challenges.]{.underline} [The result would be a
wide range of win-win outcomes for all nations]{.underline}. [It is
difficult to find **any**]{.underline} credible [path to]{.underline}
such "[global revitalization and cooperation" that does not
include]{.underline} [a cooperative US-China relationship]{.underline}.
[This makes efforts to achieve such an outcome]{.underline}
**[imperative]{.underline}** for the leaders of both countries,
[despite]{.underline} the [differences]{.underline} and suspicions
between them. Many variants of these scenarios are possible, but the
dangers of a fragmented, competitive, or adversarial world are as clear
as the advantages of cooperation. Consultations with experts in China,
the United States, and many other countries indicate widespread
recognition that [[failure to address megatrends]{.underline}]{.mark}
and looming challenges [[cooperatively]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[lead
to]{.underline}]{.mark} suboptimal and even **[[catastrophic
outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But general recognition is insufficient
to establish priorities, identify critical linkages, and develop
concrete proposals for collective action. The stakes are too high to
rely on chance and informal procedures.

#### Strong US-China relations is key solve climate change 

**Harvard Project on Climate Agreements**, 02-20**18'**, \" Bilateral
Cooperation between China and the United States: Facilitating Progress

[Over the past two decades, [disagreements between]{.mark} developing
and developed [countries]{.mark} [have often frustrated]{.mark}
[efforts]{.mark} to reach consensus [on an]{.mark} effective
[international response to]{.mark} the problem of global [climate
change]{.mark}.]{.underline} Key disputes have centered on the
appropriate prioritization of economic development versus climate
mitigation, responsibility for historic emissions versus contribution to
current and forecasted emissions, and total emissions versus emission
per capita. [While differences between developing countries'
perspectives and developed-country perspectives on these issues are
unlikely to be resolved in the short term, [the imperative to move
beyond]{.mark} these [disputes toward a]{.mark} more [cooperative and
coordinated approach]{.mark} to global climate mitigation [is]{.mark}
becoming [urgent]{.mark}. At this critical juncture, the recent joint
announcements between China and the United States concerning climate
change actions represented an important development in global climate
negotiations and were appropriately hailed as offering a new model for
improved cooperation between emerging and developed economies. [Given
the size of the two countries' economies and]{.mark} their [large
contributions to global]{.mark} GHG [emissions]{.mark}, the
[actions]{.mark} outlined in the joint announcements per se [will have a
significant impact on future mitigation efforts]{.mark}---and, indeed,
did much to facilitate a successful outcome in Paris.]{.underline} [By
demonstrating these actions, [China and the United States may encourage
other countries to increase]{.mark} their [climate mitigation]{.mark}
ambitions.]{.underline} This paper has identified three specific areas
of international climate policy, namely marketbased mechanisms,
comparison of efforts, and trade policy and climate policy interactions,
where China and the United States can deepen their cooperation.
Cooperation on marketbased climate policies, particularly cap-and-trade,
is important, not only because marketbased approaches offer the most
cost-effective approach to mitigating GHG emissions, but also because
emissions trading systems make it possible to address equity concerns by
adjusting the level of the emissions cap and the allocation of emission
allowances[. A logical focus for China--U.S. cooperation with respect to
market-based mechanisms is capacity building. A functioning
cap-and-trade system requires properly designed government and market
institutions.]{.underline} At a micro level, the United States and China
can exchange experience and expertise on topics such as allowance
allocation, price ceilings and floors, allowance banking and borrowing,
and other detailed emissions trading rules. At a macro level, both China
and the United States confront challenges to implementing cap-and-trade
systems--- in the United States because of political polarization and in
China because of features of the regulated electricity market and the
power of state-owned enterprises. [Cooperation and communication can
help both countries overcome these barriers, while also advancing
theoretical and empirical understanding of cap-and-trade and other
market-based approaches.]{.underline} Cooperation on standards and
procedures for comparing mitigation efforts can strengthen the technical
basis for other aspects of China--U.S. cooperation, particularly in the
area of cap-and-trade systems, and facilitate the linkage of homogeneous
or heterogeneous climate policies. [Cooperation in this area can also
increase transparency and consistency in climate negotiations, improve
trust among parties, and advance efforts to track collective progress
toward achieving global mitigation targets.]{.underline} But China and
the United States have different preferences and interests in terms of
the scope and timeframe of mitigation efforts and other issues. Thus it
will be important to recognize from the outset that no single perfect
comparison metric is likely to satisfy both countries' needs. Instead, a
suite of metrics is likely to offer the best option for comprehensively
reflecting and comparing the mitigation efforts undertaken by each
country. More broadly, it will be important to develop a rigorous,
systematic, and transparent system for tracking domestic policy
developments in the context of an international climate policy
framework. Interactions between trade and climate policy constitute a
third important area for future U.S.--China cooperation. Reforms can be
initiated within the WTO and UNFCCC, which currently provide the
dominant frameworks for global coordination on trade and climate change.
But China and the United States should also explore opportunities to
advance progress in this area through more flexible plurilateral and
bilateral relationships. [Cooperation between the two countries to
develop GHG standards and methods for comparing the impact of domestic
climate policies would be particularly helpful in reducing the potential
for future trade conflicts and facilitating the coordination of climate
and trade policies. [Climate]{.mark} change [has added a new dimension
to a bilateral relationship]{.mark} [that is]{.mark} already [one of the
most important of the]{.mark} twenty-first [century]{.mark}. [While
China and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [have different national
interests]{.mark} in many areas, [climate change represents an important
area where their interests]{.mark}, and those of every other country
interested in the wellbeing of its citizens and future generations,
[converge]{.mark}. But [the success of the China--U.S.
relationship]{.mark} in this arena [will be determined less by the
ability to find common ground than by the ability to find
solutions]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [properly address]{.mark} the real
socioeconomic and political [differences]{.mark} that exist
[between]{.mark} [these]{.mark} [two]{.mark} nations. If an effective
response to climate change eventually requires the participation of all
countries, despite their different cultures, states of economic
development, and political systems, [successful China--U.S.
cooperation]{.mark} under the hybrid Paris climate policy architecture
[may well prove crucial in paving the way for broader international
cooperation to reduce the risk of global climate
change.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Prevent nuclear catastrophe: Finally end the Korean War
https://thebulletin.org/2017/06/prevent-nuclear-catastrophe-finally-end-the-korean-war/

[The]{.underline} long-simmering [[confrontation between the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and North Korea has reached]{.mark} a
moment of [unprecedented tension]{.mark}. [The risk
that]{.mark}]{.underline} unintended [[war will break out]{.mark} due to
misjudgment [is high]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Indeed, as others
have observed, [East Asia is]{.underline} witnessing [a]{.underline}
"Cuban Missile [Crisis]{.underline} in slow motion."

According to Graham Allison, director of Harvard University's Belfer
Center for Science and International Affairs, it is now time "to examine
previously unthinkable options" on the Korean Peninsula---such as
scaling back joint US-South Korean military exercises in exchange for a
freeze on North Korean tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Considering these "unthinkable" options, Allison writes, would follow in
a tradition established during the Cuban Missile Crisis by John Kennedy
and Nikita Khrushchev, who both "blinked," and whose behavior ultimately
amounted to cooperative crisis management. One of the most unthinkable
options for the Korean Peninsula---but perhaps the most promising---is
for the United States and China to finally pursue a formal end to the
Korean War.

Two main stakeholders. The situation on the Korean Peninsula today is
fraught, to say the least. North [Korea]{.underline} remains in
diplomatic isolation. It has [continued testing nuclear weapons and
ballistic missiles, resulting in further escalation of tensions. The
United States and South Korea have exhibited]{.underline} increasing
[hawkishness]{.underline}, stepping up joint military exercises that
center on striking key facilities in North Korea as well as the
country's leadership ("decapitation"). Washington and Seoul's combined
forces have enhanced their preemptive strike capability---but [if
US-South Korean forces attacked the North in the name of
counterproliferation or regime change, the result would inevitably be
all-out war and region-wide catastrophe.]{.underline}

Arguably, the US-North Korea confrontation has reached the level of
mutually assured destruction. The two sides' military capabilities are
not rigorously balanced, as Washington and Moscow's nuclear
second-strike capabilities were balanced during the Cold War. [But a
[military confrontation would cause]{.mark}]{.underline} intolerable
[damage]{.underline} to both sides [and [catastrophe for the whole
region]{.mark}. Seoul would become an inferno]{.underline}. In
[Japan]{.underline}, nuclear power plants and US military bases [would
be targeted]{.underline} with missiles. [North Korea's special forces
might resort to]{.underline} guerrilla or [terrorist tactics involving
weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}. Perhaps even Yanbian, [a
Chinese region]{.underline} near the North Korean border with a large
population of ethnic Koreans, [would be destabilized]{.underline}. The
use of force is therefore not an option. [[The only]{.mark} viable
[solution]{.mark}]{.underline} to the North Korean nuclear crisis [[is
cooperative crisis management]{.underline}]{.mark}. Previously
unthinkable options simply must be explored.

But [[the stakeholders who can end the]{.mark} nuclear [crisis
are]{.mark}]{.underline} not the United States and North Korea. Instead,
as Allison has correctly suggested, they are [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and China]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not merely
because the United States, as the region's predominant military power,
is exerting military pressure on North Korea, or that Beijing provides
Pyongyang an economic lifeline (making China the gatekeeper for
international economic sanctions against the North). Rather, [Washington
and Beijing hold the key to ending the crisis because they are the key
signatories of the Korean War Armistice Agreement]{.underline}---which
brought Korean War hostilities to an end but left the war itself in a
state of suspended animation.

To this day, despite rhetorical frictions between Beijing and Pyongyang,
China and North Korea share a "blood alliance" forged during the Korean
War. The latest research on the war---based on declassified North Korean
military documents that US and UN forces seized during the war, as well
as on archival materials from Russia and China---reveals that Mao Zedong
played a more active role in initiating the war than previously
understood. China is usually portrayed as entering the war in October
1950, after UN forces, pursuing a counterattack against North Korea,
reached the neighborhood of the Yalu River, which forms the border
between China and North Korea. But well before then---indeed, well
before the outbreak of war in June 1950---Mao had made a strategic
decision to support Kim Il-sung's invasion of the South. Kim badly
needed a larger army if he was to invade the South, and in the summer of
1949 Mao granted him approximately 30,000 ethnic Korean troops from the
People's Liberation Army (PLA), fully equipped with modern arms left by
the Soviet Red Army upon its departure from the country in 1948, and
with additional supplies from the PLA. In the early stages of China's
civil war, the 166th Division---an elite PLA force comprised of ethnic
Koreans---had formed the backbone of Communist forces fighting Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalist forces in Manchuria. Now these troops were
transferred to Kim's command, reappearing as the 6th Division of the
Korean People's Army (KPA). The 6th Division played a decisive role in
the Korean War---launching an initial surprise attack against Kaesong on
June 25, 1950, paving the way for the KPA's 3rd Division to mount a
lightning attack against Seoul on June 28, with the fighting then
continuing south to Taejon. (Much of this only became clear with the
1993 publication of a study by Ryo Hagiwara known in English as The
Korean War: A Conspiracy of Kim Il-sung and MacArthur.)

More than just a blood alliance, however, explains China's behavior on
the Korean Peninsula today. Just as Nikita Khrushchev deployed
nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba to strengthen the Soviet Union's
strategic position vis-à-vis the United States, China depends on
heavily-armed North Korea to help neutralize US forces in East Asia. The
only real difference is that Beijing is savvy enough to disguise its
actions---to let the confrontation on the Peninsula be perceived as
involving merely the United States and North Korea.

In fact, as Graham Allison has pointed out with considerable insight,
[[the]{.mark} real animating [force behind the]{.mark} North Korean
nuclear [crisis]{.mark}, and indeed behind tensions on the Korean
Peninsula]{.underline} since the end of the Korean War, [[is strategic
confrontation between the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
China]{.mark}. [It is therefore the]{.mark} [responsibility of Beijing
and Washington to reduce]{.mark} the [tensions]{.mark} that could cause
a catastrophic war]{.underline}. The two sides would do well to heed the
lesson that Kennedy drew from the Cuban Missile Crisis---that "while
defending our own vital interests, [nuclear powers must
avert]{.underline} those confrontations which bring an adversary to a
choice of either a humiliating retreat or a [nuclear war]{.underline}."

Now is the time. Among previously unthinkable measures to end the North
Korean nuclear crisis, the most effective would be simply to formally
end the abnormally protracted Korean War. After all, [the root cause of
the North Korean nuclear crisis is]{.underline} an ongoing Korean [Cold
War]{.underline}---contested [between the United States and
China]{.underline} (and at one time, discreetly, by the Soviet Union)
but disguised as an ideological battle over Korean unification, with
North and South contending for regime legitimacy. But [the Korean Cold
War has now reached the threshold of nuclear catastrophe]{.underline},
and it must end. Ending [the war would reduce North Korea's
motivation]{.underline} to assert the legitimacy of its regime, or guard
against "US nuclear blackmail," by equipping itself with nuclear-armed
missiles. And [China]{.underline}, freed from concerns that war would
break out on the peninsula or that the North Korean regime would
collapse, [would be able to implement more effective]{.underline}
economic [sanctions against North Korea and thereby contain nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}.

If Washington and Beijing committed themselves to the project,
negotiations toward a formal peace treaty would not have to be
exceedingly complicated. The parties could agree to minimal
preconditions: North Korea would stop its missile and nuclear tests
while the United States and South Korea would agree to constrain their
joint military exercises (an idea already proposed by Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi). Kim Jong-un, meanwhile, could be sidelined during the
talks, just as Fidel Castro was left completely out of communications
between Washington and Moscow at the critical moments of the Cuban
Missile Crisis. After the crisis, Castro and his regime survived for
more than half a century, contending with economic sanctions and causing
the rest of the world only modest problems.

When the Korean War is finally concluded, a new regional
confidence-building framework, based on the erstwhile six-party talks,
could be established---in much the same way that Washington and Moscow
established a crisis hotline following the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Formally [ending the Korean War]{.underline} should be the beginning,
not the end, of a years-long process of denuclearizing North Korea. It
[could even lead to the establishment of an East Asian
nuclear-weapon-free zone]{.underline}. In any event, [now is the time
for]{.underline} Presidents Donald [Trump and Xi]{.underline} Jinping
[to cooperate]{.underline}, as Kennedy and Khrushchev cooperated before
them, [to prevent nuclear catastrophe and negotiate a peace agreement
for the Korean Peninsula]{.underline}.

The 2018 U.S. National Defense Strategy categorized China as a
revisionist power, and through this lens, it seems strategically sound
for the United States to shield its precious technical advantages from a
potential adversary. Nevertheless, [some [NASA officials insist]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should]{.mark} still
[collaborate with China]{.mark} to capitalize [on]{.mark} a
revolutionary period of high [technical exchange]{.mark} between China
and other space powers. Other [officials warn]{.mark} that [if]{.mark}
the [U.S. and China do not]{.mark} find meaningful ways to cooperate in
space, **[relations]{.mark} could devolve into greater mistrust and
[lead to conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To guide strategic thinking on
U.S. space policy, this article submits that policymakers may gain
strategic insights on how to address China's growing influence in the
space domain by examining its actions in the maritime domain. Deriving
Strategic Insights from Sea to Space Enjoying this article? Click here

insights from the maritime environment for the space domain, this
article surveys how China: 1) applies force, 2) manipulates laws, 3)
shapes the environment, 4) cooperates internationally, and 5) conducts
diplomacy. First, China possesses three major maritime agencies that
apply force in order to protect and pursue its interests: the People's
Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), People's Armed Police (PAP) and the
Maritime Law Enforcement Forces that include the Coast Guard, and the
Maritime Militia. As Andrew Erickson notes, each agency represents the
largest of its kind globally. The PLAN commands over 300 ships (whereas
U.S. Navy has 277 as of 2017) and its Coast Guard has over 1,200 ships.
In their research on territorial disputes in the South China Sea,
scholars Christopher Yung and Patrick McNulty find that China utilized
its military and paramilitary forces 148 times from 1995 to 2013 -- more
than all other active claimants (Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei,
and Taiwan) combined in the same period. Their research concluded that
as China's capabilities increased, Beijing was more likely to use force
to advance its interests and less likely to defer to legal or
multilateral solutions. From a space perspective, U.S. policymakers can
surmise that if China had a comparable offensive capability in the space
domain, it might also prefer utilizing force to challenge rivals over
other means. Though China currently does not have an offensive space
capability on par with the scale of its maritime forces, the U.S.
Department of Defense 2017 Annual Report to Congress asserted that the
[[PLA is]{.mark} aggressively [acquiring]{.mark} a range of
[counterspace capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given the fact that
there are no international limitations on developing ground-based
counterspace weapons, China may pursue an equivalent path of developing
a high quantity of systems to overwhelm adversaries during conflict.
Second, China could reinterpret laws as a pretext to apply force. In the
maritime domain, China reinterprets the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to challenge U.S. freedom of navigation patrols
through the South China Sea. China claims waters extending past 12
nautical miles and into the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), saying that
foreign states must refrain from threatening the "territorial integrity
or political independence" of the owning state. Concurrently, in 1992,
China promulgated domestic maritime laws that extended its sovereign
claims and deemed the commercial or research activities of other states
illegal in contested waters. [The international community at large does
not recognize this reimagining of the EEZ; however, it does provide
China some legal footing and domestic cover to deploy maritime forces in
this region.]{.underline} Similarly, the Central Military Commission is
exploring the legalities for the use of force in space. PLA doctrine
proclaims the need to destroy, damage, or disrupt an adversary's space
capability to secure victory in the information space. Nationally, China
codified its security strategy of active defense -- using defensive
counterattacks in order to spoil the offensive actions of an adversary
-- in its National Security Law of 2015. By watching the evolution of
China's space-related domestic laws or reinterpretations of
international laws, U.S. policymakers may find China strategically
telegraphing its intentions through legal maneuvering. Third, when China
feels international laws are unfavorable, it may create an alternate
framework that advances its own interests. Shortly after a tribunal at
the Permanent Court of Arbitration of The Hague ruled against China's
activities in the South China Sea in 2016, China announced that it would
create a "maritime judicial center" and a "maritime arbitration center"
to promote its own vision for maritime law. China claimed that this
endeavor would advance the nation's role as a maritime power and support
the development of its Belt Road Initiative. Skeptics assert that China
initiated this endeavor to harden its claims on disputed territories and
to divert cases away from UNCLOS courts. By doing so, China can create
legal precedents to interpret international maritime laws and begin to
undermine the international maritime system framed around UNCLOS. In the
space arena, China is not anywhere close to rearranging an entire
judicial system around its views; however, it actively participates in
international space organizations and introduces measures that could
limit the ability for the United States to project force. Through the
United Nations, China and Russia have twice (2008 and 2014) proposed the
legally binding Treaty of Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in
Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space
Objects (PPWT). The primary U.S. objections to the treaty were that it
did not include verification mechanisms, only applied to space-based
weapons, and did not include ground based ASAT weapons -- a primary
counterspace capability China is advancing. Fourth, [policymakers could
also examine China's maritime cooperation initiatives to envision
potential space cooperation. [China's counterpiracy operation]{.mark} in
the Gulf of Aden has slowly emerged as a valuable mechanism [to
improve]{.mark} [U.S.-China cooperation]{.mark} as seen through the
counterpiracy exercises of December 2014]{.underline}. On a grander
scale in June 2017, [China laid out an ambitious vision for cooperation
in relation to the "Maritime Silk Road" as part of its larger Belt and
Road Initiative]{.underline}. [[This plan envisions]{.mark} the
establishment of cooperative principles, environmental norms, maritime
security, and "[collaborative governance]{.mark}" to achieve mutual
prosperity]{.underline}. [If one believes in [China]{.mark}'s sincerity,
[working cooperatively]{.mark} across these lines could **[greatly
reduce security tensions]{.mark} and set conditions for long-term mutual
gain.**]{.underline} [Subsequently, China is pursuing international
cooperation in space -- not only for security and economic reasons, but
also to bolster the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party to
domestic and international audiences]{.underline}. The [European Space
Administration [(ESA)]{.mark} has [already expressed desires to
cooperate]{.mark} with China [on human space flight]{.mark} and the use
of its future space station]{.underline}. China especially values its
relationship with ESA due to the opportunities to trade and transfer
technologies denied by the United States. China and Russia have also
agreed to cooperate on human space flight and deep space exploration.
Though these initiatives are not on the scale of a Maritime Silk Road,
[they do [offer U.S. policymakers]{.mark} opportunities to work with a
rising space power for [positive ends]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, the
United States should pay attention to China's diplomatic and engagement
efforts with other nations. Contrary to the cooperative tenets for a
Maritime Silk Road, in 2016, China convinced Cambodia to block an
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) joint statement that
recognized The Hague's arbitration ruling on the South China Sea dispute
in favor of the Philippines. In June 2017, Vietnam resisted China's
demands to vacate an oil venture within its EEZ, but eventually
capitulated when China threatened to use force. The most concerning
aspect for Vietnam was an atypical silence from its neighbors --
particularly from the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore. Apparently,
China's political and economic leverage over these nations prevented
them from publicly sympathizing with Vietnam or rebuking China's
actions. Seemingly, when pressed, China uses soft and hard power tactics
bilaterally to dislodge multilateral initiatives that counter it
interests. Could China disrupt the U.S.-European alliance as it did with
ASEAN unity? At this stage, Chinese-European cooperation in space seems
well intentioned. Nevertheless, U.S. policymakers should consider
whether China's growing space relations with Europe, Russia, or any
other space power could complicate U.S. interests in other areas. As
China strengthens its partnerships, its ability to shape laws,
institutions and the strategic preferences of others increase as well.
Conclusion [The United States sits at an important period to develop a
comprehensive space strategy that addresses China's growing influence.
U.S. cooperation with the Soviets in space during the Cold War was not
due to a desire for true cooperation, but a means to manage a potential
crisis related to the management of ballistic missiles and nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates could
[develop a similar mechanism]{.mark} for limited engagement with China
[to]{.mark} send positive signals and [reduce
misperceptions]{.mark}.]{.underline} [China's activities in space have
already intersected with U.S. interests and will only increase in
frequency and intensity over time]{.underline}. In the end, for the
United States to compete and lead in the space domain, [[it must
engage]{.mark} new players and shape the contours of the game. If
Washington is worried about how [China]{.mark} will play the game, it
can always look in the maritime arena for strategic clues.]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} health [threat posed by migration]{.mark} has]{.underline}
recently **[[reared its head in China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. An
[outbreak of [yellow fever]{.mark}]{.underline} [that began in
Angola]{.underline} in December 2015 **[[spread to
China]{.underline}]{.mark}** three months later, marking the first case
of yellow fever ever reported in all of Asia, followed by 10 more
Chinese cases imported from Angola by May. [[Yellow fever is]{.mark}
a]{.underline} sometimes **[[deadly]{.mark} disease]{.underline}**
[caused by]{.underline} a **[mosquito-borne virus]{.underline}**. While
no cure exists, [there is [a vaccine]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} but
[it [is]{.mark}]{.underline} generally [[administered]{.underline}
**[only to those]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[living
[in]{.mark}]{.underline}** or traveling [to [areas where the disease
is]{.mark} endemic]{.underline}. As such, [[China]{.mark}'s]{.underline}
1.4 billion [citizens [are]{.mark}]{.underline} almost **[[universally
unvaccinated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Chinese cases came from Chinese
workers returning home after having worked in Angola, where over 200,000
Chinese workers are employed on work visas for China's aid and
investment projects in the country.46 Chinese authorities do require
travelers to Angola to be vaccinated for yellow fever, but there are
fears that many of the Chinese workers there may not have abided by this
rule. [[The spread]{.mark} of yellow fever to China
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly [**[worrisome]{.underline}**
[given the]{.underline}]{.mark} [region's]{.underline} massive
[[population]{.underline}]{.mark} and the fact that
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} primary **[[vector of
transmission]{.underline}]{.mark}**--- the Aedes aegypti mosquito---[[is
**common** across]{.underline}]{.mark} much of [[China]{.mark} and
nearby countries]{.underline} in South and Southeast Asia. Many
epidemiologists have voiced concerns about how dangerous this confluence
of factors could prove to be. So far, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and China have]{.underline}]{.mark} each
[[responded to]{.underline}]{.mark} Angola's [[yellow
fever]{.underline}]{.mark} epidemic
**[[separately]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In addition to increasing
domestic mosquito monitoring and control activities to boost its own
preparedness, [the Chinese government provided Angola with]{.underline}
half a million dollars in [emergency assistance]{.underline} in
February, before the outbreak had even spread to China.47 [The
CDC]{.underline}'s Mozambique Field Epidemiology Training Program
[graduates]{.underline} have [collaborated with Angola]{.underline}'s
Ministry of Health [to track down]{.underline} suspected [cases of
yellow fever]{.underline} and intervene accordingly.48 With so much
recent discussion between U.S. and Chinese health authorities regarding
cooperative health security efforts in Africa,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} tragic yellow fever [[outbreak
offers]{.underline}]{.mark} the two [countries]{.underline} [**[an
opportunity]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[achieve]{.underline} significant [[collab]{.mark}orative
action]{.underline} on global health, if they choose to embrace it. The
recent [concerns]{.underline} of yellow fever epidemic also [brought
attention to]{.underline} China's **[vaccine production]{.underline}**.
[The]{.underline} global [vaccine industry has]{.underline} **[long
been]{.underline}** **[dominated by]{.underline}** a few [multinational
companies]{.underline}. In the past decade[, [vaccine manufacturers from
China]{.underline}]{.mark}, India, and other emerging economies
**[[entered the]{.mark} international [market]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} helped to **[[drive down]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
[[vaccine price]{.underline}]{.mark}. For Jiankang Zhang, representative
for PATH's China Programs, [the growth of China's vaccine industry
is]{.underline} "**[a very positive development]{.underline}** for
global health, as [[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} and international
procurement agencies [will be able to [afford]{.mark}]{.underline} more
**[life-saving [vaccines]{.mark}]{.underline}** and thus protect more
lives." A Chinese vaccine manufacturer obtained the first WHO
prequalification vaccine (the Japanese encephalitis vaccine) in October
2013.49 Hope has been high that other vaccines manufactured from China
will be qualified and enter the global market before the next pandemic.
In the wake of the yellow fever epidemic in 2016, China's Sinovac
Biotech pledged to provide sufficient yellow fever vaccine supply for
all Chinese expatriate workers.50 As the world is wondering what the
next global pandemic will be, [[China's]{.mark} vaccine [manufacturing
capacity]{.mark} may]{.underline} soon [[be]{.underline}]{.mark}come
[**[one of the keys]{.underline}** [to stemming]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[a potential [global crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A final global
health threat for the United States and China to consider as an area for
greater cooperation is bioterrorism. Bilateral cooperation on
counterterrorism is long established, but [[there is **little evidence**
of collab]{.underline}]{.mark}oration **[[in]{.mark} combating
[bioterror]{.mark}ism]{.underline}**. Microsoft founder Bill Gates
recently brought this issue into sharp relief at the Munich Security
Conference that was attended by 450 senior decision makers from around
the globe. Gates warned that "whether it occurs by a quirk of nature or
at the hand of a terrorist, [a]{.underline} fast-moving [[airborne
pathogen]{.mark} could [kill]{.mark}]{.underline} more than **[[30
million]{.underline}]{.mark}** people **[[in less than a
year]{.underline}]{.mark}**."51 Among other recommendations, [he
advocated]{.underline} that [[countries need to prepare for
pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark} in the same manner that the military
prepares for war---[[with]{.mark} "germ games" and]{.underline} other
**[pandemic [exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He concluded that
bioterrorism now ranks with nuclear war and climate

The People's Republic of China (PRC) replaced the Republic of China
(Taiwan) as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council (UNSC) in 1971. China's involvement in United Nations
peacekeeping operations (UNPKOs) did not start before the late 1980s,
during Deng Xiaoping's period of reform and opening up. This involvement
has since gone through several phases of "gradual adaptation, gradual
expansion, and gradual improvement" (逐步适应、逐步扩大、逐步提; zhubu
shiying, zhubu kuoda, zhubu tisheng), and has evolved from "passive and
simple" participation to "proactive and constructive" (主动和建设型;
zhudong he jianshe xing) participation.\[8\] Today, [China]{.underline}
proudly claims to be the **[largest contributor to UNPKOs]{.underline}**
[among the UNSC permanent members]{.underline} (although out of all UN
members it is the 12th largest contributor of troops, police, and
military experts). In January 2018, China had 2[,634 staff participating
in UNPKOs in South Sudan, Lebanon, Mali, Darfu]{.underline}r, the
Democratic Republic of the [Congo, Liberia,]{.underline} Western
[Sahara, Cyprus, and Afghanistan]{.underline}. \[9\] China's
[role]{.underline} in UNPKOs **[has been transforming
rapidly,]{.underline}** especially since Xi Jinping came to power in
2012-2013. [China is contributing in terms of troops]{.underline}, but
it also [intends to contribute in **terms of norms and
concepts**]{.underline}, and it therefore tries to influence reform
processes in the UN. China's new role in UN peace and security actions,
however, is facing challenges. China's growing contribution to UNPKOs
China's first participation in a UNPKO was in 1990, when it sent five
military personnel to the UN Truce Supervision Organization in the
Middle East. China's contribution to UNPKOs was then low but stable
during the 1990s, and started to increase rapidly in the early 2000s,
reaching its peak in 2015 with more than 3,000 Chinese blue helmets
worldwide. Under Xi, China's [contribution]{.underline} to UNPKOs has
**[entered a new, more proactive]{.underline}**, phase. In 2014, China
[dispatched 400 contingent troops to Mali, in addition to the 400
engineers, doctors, and security guards]{.underline} sent there the
previous year. That same year, the decision to send 700 peacekeeping
infantry battalion to South Sudan confirmed a new trend. During the 2015
UN Peacekeeping Summit, [Xi restated China's commitment to
becoming]{.underline} a **[major actor in international peace and
security.]{.underline}** He announced that China will:
[join]{.underline} the [UN Peacekeeping Capability Readiness
System]{.underline}; set up a standing peacekeeping force of 8,000
troops alongside a standing peacekeeping police force; train 2,000
foreign peacekeepers; carry out 10 de-mining assistance programmes; and
provide \$100m in military aid to the African Union.\[10\] By December
2016, China had set up a 300-strong standing peacekeeping police force
(ie. the equivalent of two Formed Police Units -- FPUs), which is based
in Dongying (Shandong province) and is composed of troops from the
People's Armed Police.\[11\] By September 2017, the standing
peacekeeping force had completed the registration of 8,000 troops,
including six infantry battalions, three engineers companies, two
transport companies, four second grade hospitals, four security
companies, three fast reaction companies, two medium-sized multipurpose
helicopter units, two transport aircraft units, one UAV unit, and one
surface naval ship.\[12\] This [shows]{.underline} the **[wide scope of
missions]{.underline}** [that Chinese peacekeepers intend to deal
with.]{.underline} China [also stepped up its contribution to the UN
Peacekeeping Police]{.underline}, which was set up in 2000 and whose
numbers rose considerably in 2013 with the dispatch of its first FPU to
the UN Mission in Liberia. Comprising 140 police staff, it constitutes
almost the entirety of China's worldwide total of 153 peacekeeping
police. It is therefore surprising that the Chinese provisional
representative to the UN, Wu Haitao, did not mention this in his
statement during the UN Peacekeeping Police Summit in September
2017.\[13\] Praising China's active role in peacekeeping police in
current UN missions, he only mentioned South Sudan, Cyprus, and
Afghanistan (13 staff altogether). The trend towards increasing Chinese
contribution to UNPKOs in conflict areas, such as South Sudan, is also
linked to China's interest in protecting the growing numbers of Chinese
nationals abroad, argues Li Dongyan, from the China Academy of Social
Sciences. She believes that this trend continues, noting that "China
refers to both the UK's operation in Sierra Leone, as well as France's
operation in Mali". These two operations were launched on the initiative
of the two European powers, without a UN mandate, to evacuate foreign
citizens (in Sierra Leone) and to support the local army (in Mali).
China's particular interest in these two operations further supports the
notion that [China is]{.underline} **[likely preparing to send national
forces abroad in the future.]{.underline}**

In this paper, we have [evaluated]{.underline} a [number of potential UN
PKO scenarios]{.underline} and [their prospects in]{.underline}
**[reducing conflict]{.underline}**. The [UN's new peace-building
agenda,]{.underline} spearheaded by the newly appointed Secretary
General António Guterres, [puts the focus squarely on
managing]{.underline} the outbreak, **[escalation]{.underline}**,
continuation, and recurrence of conflict. We have [shown]{.underline}
[that PKOs are an]{.underline} **[efficient tool for managing these
pathways]{.underline}**. By simulating different scenarios, we have
[estimated the effect on the future incidence of conflict]{.underline}
of [different types of missions and of varying the money spent on
PKOs]{.underline}. The results show that [PKOs have **a clear
conflict-reducing effect**]{.underline}. The effect of PKOs is largely
limited to [preventing]{.underline} **[major armed
conflicts]{.underline}**. However, there is a [discernible indirect
effect since the reduction of conflict intensity also tends to increase
the chances of peace in following years.]{.underline} There are also
some interesting regional differences. PKOs have the strongest effect in
three regions that have been particularly afflicted by conflict: West
Asia and North Africa; East, Central, and Southern Africa; South and
Central Asia.

#### Nuclear war

<https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/11/14/embrace-the-chaos/>)

In numerous ways, life has gotten substantially better in this more
crowded and interconnected era. Seventy years ago, global war killed
scores of millions, but [[interstate conflict has declined
sharply]{.underline}]{.mark} since the end of World War II, and [[the
creation of the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}ations [[ushered in a]{.mark} far more
egalitarian and democratic form of [international
governance]{.mark}]{.underline} than existed in any previous era. Today,
[[militarily powerful states are far less free than in the pre-U.N. era
to use overt force]{.underline}]{.mark} to accomplish their aims, [[and
the world]{.mark}]{.underline} now [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} numerous
transnational courts and [[dispute-resolution]{.mark} bodies
that]{.underline} collectively [offer states a viable alternative to the
use of force. [The]{.mark} modern [international order is no global
utopia, but it]{.mark}]{.underline} sure [[beats]{.underline}]{.mark}
colonial domination and [[world wars]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the 50
years that followed World War II, medical and agricultural advances
brought unprecedented health and prosperity to most parts of the globe.
More recently, the communications revolution has enabled exciting new
forms of nongovernmental cross-border alliances to emerge, empowering,
for instance, global human rights and environmental movements. In just
the last two decades, the near-universal penetration of mobile phones
has had a powerful leveling effect: All over the globe, people at every
age and income level can use these tiny but powerful computers to learn
foreign languages, solve complex mathematical problems, create and share
videos, watch the news, move money around, or communicate with far-flung
friends. All this has had a dark side, of course. As access to knowledge
has been democratized, so too has access to the tools of violence and
destruction, and greater global interconnectedness enables disease,
pollution, and conflict to spread quickly and easily beyond borders. A
hundred years ago, no single individual or nonstate actor could do more
than cause localized mayhem; today, we have to worry about massive
bioengineered threats created by tiny terrorist cells and globally
devastating cyberattacks devised by malevolent teen hackers. Even as
many forms of power have grown more democratized and diffuse, other
forms of power have grown more concentrated. A very small number of
states control and consume a disproportionate share of the world's
resources, and a very small number of individuals control most of the
world's wealth. (According to a 2014 Oxfam report, the 85 richest
individuals on Earth are worth more than the globe's 3.5 billion poorest
people). Indeed, from a species-survival perspective, the world has
grown vastly more dangerous over the last century. Individual humans
live longer than ever before, but a small number of [[states now possess
the]{.mark} unprecedented [ability to destroy l]{.mark}]{.underline}arge
chunks of the human race and possibly [[the Earth
itself]{.underline}]{.mark} --- all [[in a matter
of]{.underline}]{.mark} days or even [[hours.]{.mark}]{.underline}
What's more, though the near-term threat of interstate nuclear conflict
has greatly diminished since the end of the Cold War, nuclear material
and know-how are now both less controlled and less controllable. Amid
all these changes, our world has also grown far more uncertain. We
possess more information than ever before and vastly greater processing
power, but the accelerating pace of global change has far exceeded our
collective ability to understand it, much less manage it. This makes it
increasingly difficult to make predictions or calculate risks. As I've
written previously: We literally have no points of comparison for
understanding the scale and scope of the risks faced by humanity today.
Compared to the long, slow sweep of human history, the events of the
last century have taken place in the blink of an eye. This should ...
give us pause when we're tempted to conclude that today's trends are
likely to continue. Rising life expectancy? That's great, but if climate
change has consequences as nasty as some predict, a century of rising
life expectancy could turn out to be a mere blip on the charts. A steep
decline in interstate conflicts? Fantastic, but less than 70 years of
human history isn't much to go on.... That's why [[one can't dismiss the
risk of]{.underline}]{.mark} catastrophic events \[such as disastrous
climate change or nuclear conflict\] as "[[high consequence, low
probability]{.underline}]{.mark}." How do we compute the probability of
catastrophic [[events of]{.underline}]{.mark} a type that has never
happened? Does 70 years without [[nuclear
annihilation]{.underline}]{.mark} tell us that there's a low probability
of nuclear catastrophe --- or just tell us that we haven't had a nuclear
catastrophe yet?... Lack of catastrophic change might signify a system
in stable equilibrium, but sometimes --- as with earthquakes ---
pressure may be building up over time, undetected.... Most analysts
assumed the Soviet Union was stable --- until it collapsed. Analysts
predicted that Egypt's Hosni Mubarak would retain his firm grip on power
--- until he was ousted. How much of what we currently file under
"Stable" should be recategorized under "Hasn't Collapsed Yet"? This,
then, is the character of world messiness in this first quarter of the
21st century. So on to the next question: Where, in all this messiness,
does the United States find itself?

### 1nc -- African Instability

[As [China's]{.mark} global influence expands, its [foreign policy
is]{.mark} increasingly focused on advancing ideas, norms and values
that are often [at odds with the liberal international

are [[look]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[to China for **leadership** and

implication is an increased questioning of the human rights based

emphasize the Chinese model that favours stability over competitive

with China's **major investments** in infrastructural
development]{.underline}, such as the standard-gauge railway in East
Africa, Beijing is carving out a significant zone of influence and
shaping foreign policy orientations of African countries.

#### African instability causes climate change, terrorism, and pandemics

https://www.fpri.org/article/2021/01/does-africa-matter-to-the-united-states/

[**Africa matters** in terms of **size**, **population**, and rate of
**population growth**. It]{.underline} is the continent currently most
affected by climate change but [is]{.underline} also [a continent that
can have a **devastating impact** on **climate change globally** because
of the importance of the **Congo Basin** rainforest, which is the
second-largest absorber of heat after the Amazon rainforest. The
destruction of this important ecosystem could further accelerate
**global warming**]{.underline}. As residents of the region come into
increasing contact with the animals of the rainforest, [this region
could be the origin of the world's next **viral pandemic**. Violent
extremism and terrorism are increasing in Africa, and while now mostly
localized, the danger has the potential to **spread beyond the
continent**. **Crises**]{.underline}---natural and man-made---cause
massive relocations of populations, both on the continent and abroad,
which [can have **negative economic, social, and political
impacts**]{.underline}.

Why Africa Matters

The African continent is the world's second-largest, with the
second-fastest growth rate after Asia. With 54 sovereign countries, four
territories, and two de facto independent states with little
international recognition, the continent has a current population of 1.3
billion. By 2050, the continent's population is predicted to rise to 2.4
billion. By 2100, Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, will have a
population of one billion, and half the world's population growth will
be in Africa by then.

The population of African countries is also overwhelmingly young.
Approximately 40% of Africans are under 15, and, in some countries, over
50% is under 25. By 2050, two of every five children born in the world
will be in Africa, and the continent's population is expected to triple.
These developments have positive and negative potential impacts on the
United States and the rest of the world. Young Africans have, for the
most part, completely skipped the analog age and gone directly digital.
Comfortable with technology, they form a huge potential consumer and
labor market. [If]{.underline}, on the other hand, the [countries of
Africa fail to develop economically]{.underline} and do not create
gainful employment for this young population, then there is the risk
that [they will become a **huge potential source of recruits to
extremist and terrorist movements**]{.underline}, which currently target
disadvantaged and disenchanted youth.

Lack of economic opportunity, increased urbanization, and climate-fueled
disasters will also contribute to movement of people seeking better
lives, which will impact economies and security not only on the
continent of Africa, but also the economic and security situations
around the world. [Nations, lacking]{.underline} adequate critical
infrastructure, education, and [**job opportunities** are ripe for
**internal unrest** and **radicalization**]{.underline}. In particular,
inadequate health delivery systems, when coupled with natural disasters,
such as droughts or floods that limit food production, cause famine and
mass movements of populations.

The Challenges for U.S. Policy

Prior to World War II, the U.S. policy towards Africa was not as active
as it was toward Europe, Asia, or Latin America. During the Cold War,
Africa policy was primarily viewed from a perspective of super-power
competition. The end of the Cold War and the rise of international
terrorism introduced this as a major component in U.S. Africa policy
along with competition with a rising China and increased Chinese
engagement in Africa.

Before his first official trip to Kenya, U.S. President Barack Obama
said, "Africa had become an idea more than an actual place . . . with
the benefit of distance, we engaged Africa in a selective embrace." This
is probably an apt description of U.S. policy towards African nations
despite the bipartisan nature of that policy. The United States, with
the many domestic and international issues it has to cope with, can ill
afford to continue to ignore Africa. Going forward, U.S. policy must
include a hard-headed look at where Africa fits in policy priorities.

The incoming Biden administration will face a number of important issues
and challenges as it develops its Africa policy. The most pressing
issues are the following:

Climate Change: Climate change is an existential problem that affects
the entire globe, but Africa has probably suffered more from the effects
of climate change than other continents---and the problem will only get
worse with time. In an October 2020 article, World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said,

Climate change is having a growing impact on the African continent,
hitting the most vulnerable hardest, and contributing to food
insecurity, population displacement and stress on water resources. In
recent months we have seen devastating floods, an invasion of desert
locusts and now face the looming specter of drought because of a La Nina
event. The human and economic toll has been aggravated by the COVID-19
pandemic.

Climate change impacts water quality and availability, and millions in
Africa will likely face persistent increased water stress due to these
impacts. A multi-year drought in parts of South Africa, for instance,
threatened total water failure in several small towns and had livestock
farmers facing financial ruin. Another pressing climate-change issue is
the need for protection of the Congo Basin rainforest. This
178-million-hectare rainforest is the world's second largest after the
Amazon and is currently threatened by agricultural activities in
Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. Countries in the
Congo Basin need to address the preservation issue, while also enabling
sustainable agricultural activities to ensure food security for the
region's population. In addition to the impact on global climate caused
by destruction of the rainforest, such destruction also brings human
populations into closer contact with the region's animals, creating the
risk of future animal-to-human transmission of new and possibly more
virulent viruses similar to COVID-19, which will have a global impact.
In a January 2021 CNN report, Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum, who as a
researcher helped discover the Ebola virus in 1976, warned of possible
new pathogens that could be as infectious as COVID-19 and as virulent as
Ebola.

Rule of Law/Mitigation of Corruption: A key to African development,
given the increasing urbanization, population increases, and
youthfulness of the continent's population, will be an increase in
domestic and international investment to build the industries that can
provide meaningful employment and improved standards of living. In order
for this to be successful, African nations will need to address the
issues of rule of law and corruption. Investors will not risk money if
the business climate comes with a level of political risk that is too
high. Government leaders throughout Africa need to establish legislation
that provides an acceptable level of security for investments and take
action to curb the endemic corruption that currently discourages
investment. Corruption in Africa ranges from wholesale political
corruption on the scale of General Sani Abachi's looting of \$3-5
billion of state money during his five years as Nigeria's military ruler
to the bribes paid by businessmen to police and customs officials. The
"tradition" of having to pay bribes, or "sweeteners," drives away
domestic investment and scares away foreign investment, leaving many
countries mired in poverty.

Violent Extremism and Terrorism: A number of African nations are
currently plagued with rising extremist movements. While primarily a
domestic issue, the mass movement of people fleeing violence and the
disruption of economic activity have the potential to negatively impact
the rest of the world. African nations need regional responses to curb
extremist and terrorist organizations, many of which are supported by
international terrorist organizations, such as ISIS and al Qaeda. In
addition, the underlying conditions that helped to create these
movements must be addressed. [Terrorist groups in Africa range from
relatively large and dangerous groups, such as Boko Haram]{.underline},
a group in Nigeria that has received support from al Qaeda and that aims
to implement sharia law in the country[; Al-Shabab]{.underline}, [an al
Qaeda affiliate aiming to overthrow the government in
Somalia]{.underline} and to punish neighboring countries for their
support of the Somali regime; and Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army, a
fundamentalist Christian group. Terrorist groups in the fragile
political climate of Libya also pose a threat to sub-Saharan Africa.

#### Terrorism goes [nuclear]{.underline}\-\--extinction

**Bunn 21 ---** Matthew Bunn is the James R. Schlesinger Professor of
the Practice of Energy, National Security, and Foreign Policy at Harvard
Kennedy School and the Co-Principal Investigator of the Project on
Managing the Atom at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center. Matthew
Bunn \"Twenty years after 9/11, terrorists could still go nuclear,\"
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 9-16-2021,
https://thebulletin.org/2021/09/twenty-years-after-9-11-terrorists-could-still-go-nuclear/,
accessed 7-10-2022, WMK

But that was then. Today, both al Qaeda and another major jihadist
terror group, the Islamic State, have suffered tremendous blows, with
their charismatic leaders dead and many others killed or captured. A
US-led counterterrorism coalition destroyed the Islamic State's
geographic caliphate in Iraq and Syria. In recent years, many terrorist
attacks have not been much more sophisticated than driving a van into a
crowd. Al Qaeda has not managed to carry out a single successful attack
in the United States since 9/11. Is [a terrorist nuclear
attack]{.underline} **[still something to worry about]{.underline}**?

The short answer, unfortunately, is "yes." The probability of terrorists
getting and using a nuclear bomb appears to be low---but the
[consequences]{.underline} if they did **[would be so
devastating]{.underline}** that it is [worth beefing up efforts to make
sure **terrorists never get their hands on a nuclear
bomb's**]{.underline} essential ingredients. To see the possibilities,
we need to look at motive, capability, and opportunity.

Motive. [Violent Islamic extremists]{.underline} **[desperately want to
strike back]{.underline}** at the "crusader forces" who have inflicted
such punishing blows on their organizations. And both [the Islamic State
and al Qaed]{.underline}a **[would like a spectacular
action]{.underline}** to put them firmly back at the forefront of the
violent Islamic extremist movement. Years ago, al Qaeda spokesman
Sulaiman Abu Ghaith argued that because Western actions had killed so
many Muslims, al Qaeda had "the right to kill four million Americans,
one million of them children." That kind of hatred still festers. (Abu
Ghaith is serving a life sentence in a US prison.)

Nuclear explosives are only one of the paths to mass slaughter that
terrorists have pursued. Nuclear efforts must compete for terrorists'
attention with tried-and-true conventional weapons, biological
weapons---whose dangers the pandemic has highlighted---chemical weapons,
and more. Many of these other types of weapons would be easier for
terrorists to acquire, and so their use may be more likely. But [the
history-changing power of a mushroom cloud rising over a major city has
**proved attractive to terrorists**]{.underline} in the past and may
again.

Capability. Government studies make clear that [if a]{.underline}
sophisticated, well-funded [terrorist group got hold of the needed
plutonium]{.underline} or highly enriched uranium (HEU), they might well
[be able to put **together a crude nuclear bomb**.]{.underline}
Unfortunately, it [does not take a Manhattan Project to build a bomb,
when you have weapons-usable fissile material]{.underline}. Indeed, the
gr[oup needed to make a crude bomb might not have a footprint much
bigger than the 9/11 attackers h]{.underline}ad. Despite the enormous
destruction that has been rained on al Qaeda and the Islamic State over
the last 20 years, a cell of terrorists could be working on a nuclear
project even now, somewhere far from US attention and drone strikes.

The intense [counterterrorism campaigns]{.underline} of the last two
decades have [surely reduced terrorists' ability to plan and carry out
such a complex effort]{.underline}. But we **[simply do not know what
capability might remain.]{.underline}** The Taliban's rapid return to
power in Afghanistan could add to that capability, making that country a
terrorist haven again---but there are many other largely ungoverned or
terrorist-controlled places where such a project could be undertaken.

And the [capability]{.underline} side of the equation **[can change at
remarkable speed]{.underline}**. In January 2014, the US intelligence
community did not mention the Islamic State in its annual assessment of
threats to US security. By summer, the group had seized much of Iraq and
Syria and declared a global caliphate.

Opportunity. Fortunately, around the world, security for plutonium and
HEU is far better than it once was, making it far harder for terrorists
to get their hands on the needed ingredients for a bomb. More than half
of all the countries that once had such material on their soil have
gotten rid of it. While stolen HEU or plutonium was once showing up in
parked cars and airplane luggage racks in Europe, there hasn't been a
major seizure of potential nuclear bomb material for a decade now.

Nevertheless, with the Obama-era nuclear security summits now far in the
rearview mirror, [the momentum of **nuclear security improvement has
slowed.**]{.underline} There is [still a need to ensure that nuclear
weapons,]{.underline} materials, and facilities [are
protected]{.underline} against the full range of plausible
threats---especially from insiders, who appear to pose the biggest
nuclear security problem. The rise of domestic violent extremists in the
United States and other advanced democracies makes the insider threat
even more challenging. There is still a need for realistic tests and
assessments of nuclear security systems' real capabilities against
intelligent adversaries looking for ways to beat them. And there's still
a need to strengthen nuclear security culture---to make sure the staff
and guards at nuclear facilities are giving security the priority it
needs, day-in and day-out.

If [terrorists ever did manage]{.underline} to turn the heart of a
modern city into a smoldering radioactive ruin, **[they would change
history.]{.underline}** [The economic, political, and social
consequences]{.underline} **[would reverberate far and
wide]{.underline}**. [Fears that it could]{.underline} **[happen
again]{.underline}**---possibly stoked by terrorist claims that they had
more bombs already hidden in cities and would detonate them unless their
demands were met---[could lead people to flee major cities]{.underline}.
The reactions after 9/11---a **[more aggressive US foreign
policy,]{.underline}** racist animosity, **[expanded government
powers]{.underline}**, cutbacks in civil liberties---would be expanded
manyfold, particularly once people realized that the material for such a
bomb could be hidden in any suitcase.

President Biden has warned of these dangers. Now is the time for him to
act. Despite the many other priorities on his desk, it is time for him
to launch a new, expanded nuclear security initiative, working to ensure
that nuclear stockpiles worldwide are secure and accounted for to the
highest standards, that major obstacles are placed in the path of
nuclear smugglers, that states are deterred from helping terrorists with
nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, and that terrorist nuclear
plots are found and stopped. [The risk of a nuclear 9/11 will
persist]{.underline} [as long as high-capability terrorists and the
materials needed to make a nuclear bomb both **exist**]{.underline} in
the world.

### ! Warming

#### Warming causes extinction\-\--runaway tipping points

**Cribb 17** -- Julian Cribb, Principal of JCA, Fellow of the Australian
Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, Former Director,
National Awareness, 2017 ("The Baker," *CSIRO*, Surviving the 21st
Century Chapter 4, p. 91-94)

This event, known as [the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum]{.underline}
or [PETM]{.underline}, happened only about ten million years after the
dinosaurs were smashed by an asteroid impact. This 'hyperthermal' period
took place quite suddenly (in geological terms)---in less than 2000
years---and lasted for about 170,000 years before the planet again
cooled. The heat spike [was accompanied by]{.underline} a major wipe-out
of ocean life in particular, though most small land mammals survived.
Investigating the records of old marine sediments Zeebe was able to show
there had been a sharp, 70 %, leap in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations at
the time. However, he concluded there was only sufficient carbon
available to force the climate to warm by 1--3 °C and that [some other
mechanism]{.underline} must have been triggered by the initial warming,
which then [drove the Earth's temperature to fever pitch]{.underline},
up by another 4--6 °C (Zeebe et al. 2009). This process is the '
**[[runaway global warming]{.underline}]{.mark}** ' which [now [menaces
us]{.mark}]{.underline}. The significance of PETM is that it appears
that about [the same volume of carbon]{.underline} was dumped by natural
processes into the Earth's atmosphere and oceans [[as humans are
**currently dumping**]{.mark} with the burning of [fossil fuels and
clearing]{.mark} of [the world's forests]{.mark}]{.underline}---about 3
trillion tonnes in all---[[and it]{.underline}]{.mark} was this that
[[triggered the **hyperthermal surge** in]{.mark} planetary
[heating]{.mark}. As to the mechanism that could suddenly release a huge
amount of extra carbon into the atmosphere and oceans and project global
temperatures up by 6--9 °C, the most likely explanation is]{.underline}
the one described at the start of this chapter---[[the **rapid melting**
and escape of]{.mark} billions of tonnes of [frozen
**methane**]{.mark}]{.underline}, CH 4 , currently locked in tundra and
seabed sediments. This phenomenon, [dubbed the "clathrate gun
"]{.underline} (Kennett et al. 2003), is now linked by scientists not
only with the PETM event but also, according to palaeontologist Peter
Ward, with the Great Death of the Permian, [the worst annihilation in
the history of life on Earth]{.underline} (Ward 2008). The significance
of the clathrates is that they consist of methane, a gas that is [[72
times more powerful than CO 2]{.mark} as a climate forcing agent in the
short run, and 25 times stronger over a century or so]{.underline}. The
clathrates could be released by a process known as ' ocean overturning
', a shift in global current patterns caused by [moderate
warming]{.underline}, which [brings warmer water from the surface down
into the depths, to melt the deposits of frozen gas. [Unlocking several
trillion tonnes of methane]{.mark} would [cause]{.mark} global
[temperatures to **rocket upwards sharply**]{.mark}. Once such a process
gets under way, **most experts** consider, [warming will happen **so
fast**]{.mark}]{.underline} it is doubtful if humans could do anything
to stop it even if they instantly ceased all burning of fossil fuels.
[This '**double whammy**' of global warming caused by humans
releasing]{.underline} three trillion tonnes of [fossil carbon which
then precipitates an uncontrollable second phase driven by the melting
of all or part of the five trillion tonnes of natural methane
deposits]{.underline} (Buff et & Archer 2004) [is [the **principal
threat** to]{.mark}]{.underline} civilisation in the twenty-first
century and, combined with nuclear conflict (Chap. 4), to [[the
**survival of**]{.mark} **the [human species]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
IPCC's fifth report states that the melting of between 37 and 81 % of
the world's tundra permafrost is 'virtually certain' adding "[There is a
[**high risk** of]{.mark}]{.underline} substantial carbon and
[**[methane]{.mark} emissions** as a [result of **permafrost**]{.mark}
**thawing**]{.underline} " ((IPCC 2014a), p. 74). This could involve the
venting of as much as 920 billion tonnes of carbon. However, the Panel
did not venture an estimate for methane emissions from the melting of
the far larger seabed clathrates and a number of scientists have
publicly criticised the world's leading climate body for remaining so
close-lipped about this mega-threat to human existence. The IPCC's
reticence is thought to be founded on a lack of adequate scientific data
to make a pronouncement with confidence---and partly to fear of the
mischief which the fossil fuels lobby would make of any premature
estimates. However, it critics argue, by the time we know for sure that
the Arctic and seabed methane is escaping in large volumes, it will be
too late to do anything about it. The difficulty is that no-one knows
how quickly the Earth will heat up, as this depends on something that
cannot be scientifically predicted: the behaviour of the whole human
species and the timeliness with which we act. Failure to abolish carbon
emissions in time will make a 4--5 °C rise in temperature likely. As to
what that may mean, here are some eminent opinions : • Warming of 5 °C
will mean the planet can support fewer than 1 billion
people---Hans-Joachim Shellnhuber, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact
Research (Kanter 2009) • With temperature increases of 4--7 °C

### I/L China Solves African Instability

#### Chinese leadership is key to African stability\-\--its seen as [more credible]{.underline} than Western aid which makes it [uniquely effective]{.underline}

Security in Africa.\" African Conflict & Peacebuilding Review, vol. 9

To counter these potential risks to [China's]{.underline} influence and
reputation, **[close collaboration]{.underline}** [with the AU and other
African subregional organizations]{.underline}, that are
[clearly]{.underline} non-[Western actors and seen as mostly independent
from US influence,]{.underline} offers a viable solution. The partial
syntonization of China's policies with those of the AU in areas that are
either less important or in line with the Chinese security and foreign
policy strategy is, on the one hand, deflecting neocolonial criticism
and, on the other, [balancing]{.underline} the **[interventionist
position of the West]{.underline}**. Although China's stance toward
international intervention is far more passive than the principles of
mandatory intervention articulated in Article 4 of the Constitutive Act
of the AU and the clashes between the Chinese concept of
"noninterference" with the AU's notion of "nonindifference," both have
shown many similarities in their position on national sovereignty and
interstate conflicts. China is highlighting those cases where the views
of the AU and key African players converge with their own positions and
use them as reference points for their military engagement or the
absence thereof on the continent (Van Hoeymissen 2011: 102). Thus, in
2008, Beijing justified its criticism of international sanctions against
Zimbabwe with the remark that the Chinese position was in line with that
of the AU and the SADC, which both opposed sanctions and were regarded
by China as the consensus of African countries on the current situation
(United Nations 2008a; Van Hoeymissen 2011: 100). Apart from the
rhetorical level, [there is a growing appreciation of the AU as a
capable actor in conflict resolution]{.underline}, and [**China has
emphasized its willingness to take concrete measures** to help Africa
reinforce its]{.underline} **[collective security
mechanism.]{.underline}** Hence, [China has supported the AU in various
areas related **to peace and security**]{.underline}, particularly the
AU Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the hybrid UN-AU Mission in Darfur
(UNAMID), provided military aid, and conducted several training courses
for AU troops and security personnel at the Peace and Security
Department in China (Woldemichael 2012: iii). As stated in China's
African policy paper (2006), "[China supports]{.underline} the
**[positive efforts by the AU]{.underline}** and other African regional
organizations and African countries concerned [to settle **regional
conflicts**]{.underline} [and will **provide assistance**]{.underline}
within our own capacity. It will **[urge]{.underline}** [the UN Security
Council to **pay attention**]{.underline} [to and help resolve regional
conflicts in Africa]{.underline}. It will [continue its support
for]{.underline} and participation in UN **[peacekeeping operations in
Africa]{.underline}**." A decade after this proclamation[, China-AU
security partnerships have stretched from soft confidence-building
measures]{.underline} and preemptive diplomacy [to the development of
**specific conflict solution mechanisms**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[direct military support]{.underline}**. The [security-related
dialogue and consulting mechanisms]{.underline} between China and the AU
headquarters in Addis Ababa **[have evolved]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} several **[regular exchange formats have been
created]{.underline}**. In 2008 a strategic dialogue mechanism between
China and the AU that [deals with]{.underline} "**[major international
and regional issues]{.underline}** of common concern" (MOFA 2011) was
established. The African Union Commission ([AUC]{.underline}) is also
[participating]{.underline} in the [Initiative **on China-Africa
Cooperative Partnership for Peace**]{.underline} and Security (ICACPPS),
China's regular exchange with African foreign secretaries (Huang 2011:
264--65; C. Zhang 2016). China sees the AU as the "premier pan-African
institutional actor in relation to peace and security matters" (Ukeje
2018: 304) and is [increasingly]{.underline} **[institutionalizing the
relation with the AUC]{.underline}** and deepening the interregional
linkages. One of the goals of the Fifth FOCAC Ministerial Conference
held in Beijing in July 2012, which the AU attended for the first time
as a full member, was to [strengthen cooperation on **African peace and
security between China**]{.underline} and the AU. The action plan
adopted at the conference determined that China would launch the
initiative on the China-Africa Cooperative Partnership for Peace and
Security, provide financial support for AU peacekeeping missions in
Africa and the development of the African Standby Force, and train more
AU peacekeepers and officials in peace and security affairs. In
September 2015, President Xi announced that China will provide free
military aid of \$100 million over four years to support the African
Standby Force and the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crisis
(Xi 2015). Three months later, at the 2015 FOCAC summit in Johannesburg,
China confirmed its commitment to supporting the AU's capacity for
peacekeeping and promised an additional \$US60 million in grants to the
ASF and the African Capacity for the Immediate Response to Crisis (FOCAC
2015). In addition, to direct financial and logistic support to AU peace
missions, China [is also contributing indirectly to the AU's military
capacity by tying its bilateral military aid]{.underline} to African
countries' contributions to AU missions. Several countries, including
South Africa, Tanzania, Nigeria, Burundi, and Uganda, have thus received
additional military aid justified by China, due to their contribution to
regional security schemes (Shinn 2008; United Nations 2009). The AU has
become a major pillar of China's security strategy in Africa, and it
seems that despite the mixed results of AU missions in Africa, China
will continue its support for regional African security solutions.
[China has shown its]{.underline} willingness to support **[regional
initiatives]{.underline}** in Africa d[espite other multilateral or even
bilateral solutions that might,]{.underline} for the time being, [also
serve its interests]{.underline} on the continent. Whether the AU can
also establish itself as the premier partner for issues that border on
peace and security (terrorism, climate change, piracy, and migration, to
name a few) will depend first and foremost on the ability of the AU to
mobilize a broad pan-African consensus on these matters (Ukeje 2018:
307). China's support for the AU and African security in general is not
based on any specific program, which leaves a great amount of latitude
in its long-term commitments (Van Hoeymissen 2011: 100). Technical and
financial support often reflect current issues of China's foreign policy
priorities or come in the wake of big events like the FOCAC summit or
top-level visits from China. The contribution to the AU mission in
Darfur can thus be interpreted as a reaction to international criticism
of the close ties between Beijing and Khartoum and the contribution to
AMISOM as a move to protect international trade routes (Shichor 2007).
This flexibility creates some uncertainty on the African side and
prevents the reliable long-term inclusion of Chinese support for
capacity development in Africa's security sector.

#### The Western LIO model is *privatization* \-\-- it's an *economic disease* as per *statistical* evidence 

\*empirical comparison of Latin America with East Asia, income
inequality, state investment/social safety nets, adjustment based on
local characteristics

of the Washington Consensus, the Need for a New Reform and the Rise of
the Beijing Consensus," AEGIS: Journal of International Relations, 1(2),
118-130)

The Washington Consensus has brought a serious debate and critiques. The
structuralist thinkers such Dani Rodrick and Joseph E. Stiglitz have
explicitly mentioned strong critiques towards the Washington Consensus.
They oppose the consensus offered by John Williamson and say [[the
Washington Consensus]{.mark} has become a **source of crisis**
and]{.underline} problem for developing and
[l]{.underline}ess-[d]{.underline}eveloped
[c]{.underline}ountrie[s]{.underline}. Both Rodrick and Stiglitz have
challenged the term which described as the fundamental policies of the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury
Department where Stiglitz calls it as a "one size fits all" treatment of
individual economies. Stiglitz said that [the treatment suggested [by
the]{.mark}]{.underline} International Monetary Fund
[**[\[IMF\]]{.mark}** and the World Bank [is]{.mark} too simple: **one
dose**, **fast** stabilize, liberalize and **[privatize]{.mark}**,
without prioritizing or watching for side effects]{.underline}
(Stiglitz, 2002).

The reform package addressed by Williamson did not work out as it was
intended. [[Based on]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[statistical
data]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the Latin American [countries
which]{.underline} mostly [adopted [the Washington
Consensus]{.mark}]{.underline} policies [have a **[lower economic
growth]{.mark}** than]{.underline} East and Southeast Asian countries
[opposing the Washington Consensus policies]{.underline}. The economic
growth of Latin America reached 5.5% during 1960--1980, where East Asia
achieved only 5.5% during the same period. However, [during 1990--2004,
the economy in [Latin America]{.mark} only [achieved 2.7%]{.mark}, where
[East Asia]{.mark} can [reach 7.8%]{.mark} on that period]{.underline}
(World Bank Statistics). [**Tremendous economic growth** is shown by
East and Southeast Asian countries when they applied **contrary
policies** to Washington Consensus by having strong government role and
nationalize many companies **such as in China**]{.underline}, Taiwan and
South Korea, as well as India.

According to Stiglitz, the Washington Consensus has made a slower GDP
growth as well in Latin America where they are mostly the follower of
the IMF and the World Bank. On the other hand, Latin America also
experienced tremendous volatility of growth and there was no stability
during the 1890s period of Washington Consensus. [The [worst]{.mark}
thing]{.underline} according to Stiglitz [[was]{.mark} that the rise of
[unemployment in Latin America]{.mark} during 1990--2004 [and]{.mark}
the [declined]{.mark} of per capita [income]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Furthermore, under the Washington Consensus inequitable sharing becomes
a serious concern because [the Washington Consensus policies produced
limited growth only and [even when]{.mark} the [growth did
occur]{.mark}, [it was not **equitably shared**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
The [[equality]{.mark} issues]{.underline} are not even considered
seriously from the consensus policies which later
[[caused]{.underline}]{.mark} social and [[political problems]{.mark}
in]{.underline} some countries in [Africa, Asia and Latin
America.]{.underline}

Dani Rodrick mentioned that [the government role cannot totally be
separated from economic activities]{.underline} (Rodrick, 2006). [In
developing countries, the [roles of government are]{.mark} not only to
address market failure]{.underline} such as controlling conflicts of
interest and ensuring the soundness and safety of the financial system,
[but also to **promote equity** and [provide **safety
nets.**]{.mark}]{.underline} For structuralist, Washington consensus is
considered as a failure consensus because it did not understand the
limitation of the markets and it focused on very limited a set of
instruments. As the consequences, the Washington Consensus ignored the
industrial policies, land reform, strengthening the financial sector,
improving education, Competition policy, and government issues in both
public and private sectors (Stiglitz, 2005).

According to Marxist/dependency theorists, [the Washington Consensus
is]{.underline} not suitable for developing or third world countries.
However, it can bring an economic disease for development and prosperity
in those countries. The Marxist thinkers such as Alfredo Saad Filho and
Costas Lapavitsas have seriously advocated for equality and adjust the
development distribution and better social class in the society. The
Marxist economists argued that the Washington Consensus categorizes the
third world nations into a backdrop of the reform which makes the third
world nations have a dependency on the mercy of the developed countries
or western countries (Lapavitsas, 2001). They believe that the consensus
proposed by Williamson is the source for greater global crisis and
economic problem (Saad-Filho, 2010).

Marxist/dependency thinkers believe that the Washington Consensus is a
tool to further the establishment of the capitalism. For the Marxist,
this capitalism system may lead to even greater social and economic
problems for the workers in developing and less-developed countries
because of their low bargaining power and weak position as subject from
the western imperialists. The policies in the consensus will push the
developing countries and less-developed countries to adopt the
capitalism system which brings them under the control of the developed
countries and global financial institutions. The reform package offered
from the Washington Consensus is considered by the Marxist as a worse
instrument that will be used by developed and huge economic countries to
expand the imperialist influence and power to the third world countries
and makes them dependent for political, social and economic on western
countries and international financial institutions.

Many scholars then believe that the Washington Consensus policies have
failed to handle the economic structure efficiently in developing
countries. The case in East Asia can be a good example where Taiwan and
South Korea can show a wonderful success for their economic growth with
a larger role from the domestic government by growing domestic savings
and undertaking the industrial policies inside the region. It is the
same like what happens in China, India, Indonesia and some other
Countries in the region where the governments play a big role in the
market and economic activity, as well as applies the trade system with
their own characteristic and model.

The biggest critique towards the Washington Consensus came when global
financial crisis starting in 2008. The developing and less-developed
countries confidently oppose and reject the Washington Consensus
policies and against the international financial institutions such
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for their insignificant
contribution and solutions. On the other hand, the prior to the global
financial crisis in 2008, the economic crisis which happened in
Argentina in 1999--2002 is believed as the result of the Washing
Consensus failure. During the 1990s, Argentina became a loyal follower
of the Washington Consensus policies suggested by the IMF and the World
Bank. However, its economy finally was collapse. Many economists and
scholars believe that the cause of this crisis is due to the application
of fixed exchange rate which became increasingly uncompetitive, failure
to get an effective control over the fiscal accounts, and the collapse
of the macroeconomic in the country.

The Need of New Reforms

The failure of the Washington Consensus has provided many lessons that
can be learned by new government leaders in developing and
less-developed countries to concern on their policies and international
financial institutions to do a reform and create a new economic package
or policies to boost global growth and development. The neo-liberalist
people have to believe that the Washington Consensus has failed to give
a solution for global development. However, it has given a bad
experience for countries adopting the policy package from this
consensus.

During the 1990s and 2000s, the international financial institutions
such as the international Monetary Fund and the World Bank have
suggested the Washington Consensus package for the developing and
less-developed countries. In fact, this idea did not bring a successful
achievement for global development. The countries that adopted the
Washington associated policies experienced a bad economic growth and
collapse, whereas the countries that opposed the Washington package can
show a great economic growth. For instance, there is a big contrast
between Latin American countries adopting the Washington package and
East Asian countries which did not adopt the Washington package in some
important respect. East Asian countries are slow to liberalize the
capital market than the Latin America and some African countries.
Furthermore, they are also slow to liberalize the trade and they adopted
strong government industrial policies such as making many successful
state-owned enterprises.

The differences in terms of policy account for the performance
differences between Latin American/African countries and East/Southeast
Asian countries. The East/Southeast Asian countries show more growth and
faster growth, the benefits of growth more widely shared, and more
stable although the 1997/98 Asian crisis happened, they can recover it
quickly like Indonesia.

The Washington Consensus has come to the end. The question now what is
the alternative one to replace and give a positive global development.
Therefore, we will need a new consensus or a new reform. According to
structuralist thinker such as Stiglitz, the economic package should not
ignore the relationship between the economic success and the social and
political stability or structure. The objective of the policies should
not only concern to increase the GDP, but have to achieve a sustainable
and equitable democratic development. The most important point now is to
chase new reforms to finish soon and create good global governance. The
reforms will work by reforming the global financial system to make it
more stable and to reduce the risks facing the developing countries such
as reforming the global reserve system and developing better mechanism
for shifting risk (Stiglitz, 2005).

Globalization and Inclusive World Economy

The failure of the Washington Consensus has provided many experiences
regarding the international development, and today in the post
Washington consensus we are dealing with the globalization as a global
instrument to accelerate global prosperity growth. Globalization at its
simplest can be seen as the increase over time of international trade
(referred to as merchandise trade) and services (Otter, 2014).
Furthermore, globalization can be defined as a process of international
integration through the interchange of world views, products, ideas and
other aspects of culture (Al-Rodhan, Stoudmann and Nayef, 2006).
Globalization is almost the same with the Washington Consensus which
highlights the trade and market liberalization. Dorron Otter in his
book, The Business Environment, mentioned that according to
Neoclassical/neoliberal such as Adam Smith, trade will be very important
to expand the market which allows bigger specialization and increases
productivity at the domestic level. Therefore, the globalization based
on neoliberal/neoclassical view will give good benefits: firstly, it
provides a source of external funding that boosts the amount of money
available to fuel trade internally, and secondly it enables further room
for the expansion of markets on an international scale (Otter, 2014).
The comparative advantage theory can be applied and work here totally.

The Marxist/socialist has difference views regarding the globalization
than the neoliberal/classical views. According to Marxist/socialist,
globalization will not be a solution for international development
because it will create a bigger dependency of the third world countries
on the developed nations or western imperialist. The globalization will
drive the developing and less-developed countries to greater problems
such as disparity, inequality, poverty, and unbalanced development among
the countries. On the other hand, the structuralist thinkers argue that
the globalization could be a good instrument to achieve global
development and prosperity if there are some structural and
institutional reforms and reparation. Structuralist thinkers believe
that the third world countries cannot reach the level of developed
nation or industrialist nations directly or soon after the world war II,
but they need to catch up this level by taking the globalization to move
up step by step.

Therefore, the domestic and international levels need to undertake
certain strategies and policies to achieve positive development and
prosperity if the globalization is to work in such a way as to build an
inclusive world economy. Stiglitz argued that the domestic level should
pay a serious concern to focus on the importance of equity and
employment. In addition, the domestic level has to make a balanced role
of government and market by promoting and regulating markets, providing
institutional and physical infrastructure, and promoting education,
innovation and technology. The domestic government has to play good and
enough roles toward the macroeconomic sector. The financial sector
should get bigger concern from the government in order to create a more
stable and positive financial market, and the government has to make
good and strong social and political policies as the key aspect to
achieve a good and stable capital investment.

On the other side, the international level has to make some reforms in
order to reach a better global development. Stiglitz said that in order
to enhance sustainable, equitable, stable, and democratic development,
the international level should pay a serious concern towards several
aspects regarding the reformation of the global economic architecture.
The global economic architecture should produce new strategies and
policies by focusing on efficiency, stability, equity among countries,
and ability of developing countries to pursue their objectives. The
international institutions have to allow developing and less-developed
countries to have bigger authority to adjust their fundamental economy,
social and politic towards the globalization characteristics and system.
The global economic strategies and policies have to be in appropriate
with the local characteristics and models in order to allow the third
world nations to achieve faster economic acceleration by having more
suitable platform and economic package.

Beijing Consensus

The rise of China as the new economic super power has contributed to the
change of the international economic architecture. China role in terms
of economy has challenged the position of the United States as the most
dominant player at the international level (Albertoni & Arguello, 2015).
Its increasing development has decreased the influenced of the United
States, especially among the developing countries (Turin, 2010).
Therefore, many people are now discussing a new economic term called
"Beijing Consensus." The Beijing Consensus was firstly introduced by
Joshua Cooper Ramo in 2004 through his paper published by the United
Kingdom's Foreign Policy. Ramo sees that the economic policies produced
in Beijing have become concern for many countries and influence the
international economic architecture. [The Chinese economic
model]{.underline}/ Beijing Consensus [offers a **different
model**]{.underline} and characteristic [than]{.underline} the
guidelines offered by [the Washington Consensus.]{.underline}

[The major aspects of differences between the Beijing Consensus and the
Washington Consensus are the role of GDP, financial sovereignty, and
government intervention]{.underline}. [When the Washington Consensus
puts more concern on how to maximise the liberalisation of market and
gives full freedom for market, [the Beijing Consensus]{.mark} still
[puts]{.mark} the role and **[intervention of]{.mark} the
[government]{.mark}** in the market [as]{.mark} an [important]{.mark}
aspect to drive the development]{.underline}. Firstly, in the Washington
Consensus, the GDP is the main focus or centralisation to determine the
growth of a country. However, for the Beijing Consensus, economic
sustainability and the wealth distribution will also become as the
important aspects. Secondly, in terms of financial sovereignty, the
Washington Consensus will believe that the financial sovereignty
automatically will be produced by the general development, whereas
**[[the Beijing Consensus sees that the financial sovereignty will be
obtained through the policies of self--determination, because this more
deliberate action to financial sovereignty will give a more secure
future for economy of a country]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Hubner, 2013).
Lastly, the government in the developing countries are mostly having
problem with corruption in the government and politics in which put
those developing countries likely unstable in some cases and it can
bring to risk than potential growth. Unfortunately, [the
[Washington]{.mark} consensus will [use general guidelines for
all]{.mark} type of countries, whereas the [Beijing Consensus]{.mark}
will [allow]{.mark} the developing [countries to **adjust**]{.mark}
**the economic system** [in line with]{.mark} their **[local
characteristics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Then, it becomes the reason for
Samantha Hubner to suggest those developing countries to consider the
classical liberalism and it will likely be safer to be used in
developing countries because it will consider the laws of human nature
(Hubner, 2013).

#### Illiberalism \-\-- it promotes *long-term planning*, democracy freezes action 

**Baker 17** (Thomas Baker -- PhD in Sociology from the National
University of Singapore, "The Real Source of China's Soft Power," The
Diplomat. November 18, 2017.
<https://thediplomat.com/2017/11/the-real-source-of-chinas-soft-power/>)

First, they are seeing Chinese soft power through an American lens. That
the United States was the case study for Nye's theory is not a problem;
[the problem is [assuming that other nations need to be like
America]{.mark} in order to be attractive]{.underline}. [This is to
universalize the particular and [speaks of]{.mark} the
**[ethnocentrism]{.mark}** of]{.underline} many [American policy
thinkers]{.underline}. Since China is diametrically opposite to America,
the conclusion is that China lacks fundamental criteria to be an
attractive country. China's attractiveness is in fact very different
from the United States', and American observers may be blind to what
makes China attractive. This is not "soft power with Chinese
characteristics," as Mikael Weissmann calls it facetiously, but requires
an understanding of how the rest of the world thinks. As my colleague
Bill Case has proposed, China is in fact a very attractive model to
leaders and politicians in Southeast Asia and no doubt in other parts of
the world. Leaders see in China a powerful nation able to defy American
and Western dictates, whilst ensuring economic stability and prosperity
for its citizens. [[China emerges as a solution for struggling
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} in Southeast Asia [[as they
navigate]{.underline}]{.mark} difficult economic scenarios or, in the
case of Malaysia's embattled Prime Minister Najib Razak, a
**[[corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}** scandal [that
threatens]{.underline} the [legitimacy]{.underline} of his premiership.
China provides a useful model for already illiberal and
authoritarian-leaning political leaders and regimes to sustain
themselves. American and other [Western observers fall into the trap of
assuming that freedom, civil liberties, and democracy are more desired
than economic stability and prosperity]{.underline}. As Chua Beng Huat
has argued in the case of Singapore, **[[liberalism is not a]{.mark}
necessary [precondition for]{.mark} the functioning of [an advanced
capitalist nation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead the legitimacy of
Singapore's leaders comes from their performance as economic managers
and their ability to respond to citizen demands. Francis Fukuyama's "End
of History" argument increasingly looks anachronistic. Many people in
[developing and poorer [nations look]{.mark}]{.underline} up
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} Singapore, and [increasingly
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[as a model of **political
stability**]{.underline}]{.mark} coupled with economic growth and
prosperity. [If people have [to give up]{.mark} a few [civil

it [means **less corruption**, **better infrastructure**, **more jobs**,
and **increased income**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Looking at China's rapid
development -- and as more people see it -- China will grow in stature
amongst lay opinion. [[Democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} is increasingly
seen to [[produce **inaction**]{.mark} and **stalemate**]{.underline} as
evidenced in countries across the European Union, United States, and
Australia. Many Indonesians increasingly opine that things were better
under authoritarianism and pejoratively call the post-1998 era
"democrazy." [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, by contrast, is seen to take
a no-nonsense approach to problems; it [[has **clear objectives** and
**gets things done.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Rights may be trampled or
limited in this process, but to many people who live in clogged cities
like Jakarta or Manila or in underdeveloped regions, China's model of
action and development look like a godsend. [[In an era of]{.mark}
economic uncertainty, [**declining social mobility**, **economic
inequality**, **rising unemployment**]{.mark}, and casualization, [the
American model looks **increasingly less
appealing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If [[the election
of]{.underline}]{.mark} Donald [[Trump is
**symptomatic**]{.underline}]{.mark} of these problems, then it is
little wonder that people are looking to other countries to emulate. On
the other side of the Pacific, China continues to grow in stature and
appears to be a paradigm of stability and prosperity. China's success is
of course not guaranteed, but in a world of economic uncertainty, [the
[China model]{.mark} increasingly [looks **more attractive
than**]{.mark} **Pax [America]{.mark}**]{.underline}na.

### ! -- African Instability

#### African instability causes [terrorism]{.underline} and [global war]{.underline} 

**Mead 13** (Walter Russel Mead, Distinguished Fellow at Hudson
Institute, the James Clarke Chace Professor of Foreign Affairs and
Humanities at Bard College, December 15, 2013. "Peace In The Congo? Why
The World Should Care"

One of the biggest questions of the 21st century is whether this
destructive dynamic can be contained, or whether the demand for ethnic,
cultural and/or religious homogeneity will continue to convulse world
politics, drive [new generations of conflict, and]{.underline} create
[millions more victims]{.underline}. The [[Congo]{.underline}]{.mark}
conflict [is a disturbing piece of evidence
[suggest]{.mark}]{.underline}ing that, in [Africa]{.underline} at least,
[there is [potential for]{.mark}]{.underline} this kind of
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Congo war (and the long Hutu-Tutsi
conflict in neighboring countries) is not, unfortunately alone. [The
secession of [South Sudan]{.mark}]{.underline} from Sudan proper, the
wars in what remains of that unhappy country, [the secession of
[Eritrea]{.mark}]{.underline} from Ethiopia [and the [rise of
Christian-Muslim tension]{.mark}]{.underline} right across Africa (where
religious conflict often is fed by and intensifies "tribal"---in Europe
we would say "ethnic" or "national"---conflicts) [[are]{.mark} strong
indications]{.underline} that [the [potential for huge]{.mark} and
[destructive conflict]{.mark} across Africa is very real]{.underline}.
But one must look beyond Africa. The Middle East of course is aflame in
religious and ethnic conflict. The old British Raj including India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma and Sri Lanka offers countless examples of
ethnic and religious conflict that sometimes is contained, and sometimes
boils to the surface in horrendous acts of violence. Beyond that, rival
nationalisms in East and Southeast Asia are keeping the world awake at
night. The [[Congo]{.underline}]{.mark} war [should be a
[reminder]{.mark}]{.underline} to us all that the foundations of our
world are dynamite, and [that the [potential for new conflicts on the
scale of]{.mark} the horrific [wars of the 20th century]{.mark} is very
much with us today]{.underline}. The second lesson from this conflict
stems from the realization of how much patience and commitment from the
international community (which in this case included the Atlantic
democracies and a coalition of African states working as individual
countries and through various international institutions) it has taken
to get this far towards peace. Particularly at a time when many
Americans want the US to turn inwards, there are people who make the
argument that it is really none of America's business to invest time and
energy in the often thankless task of solving these conflicts. That
might be an ugly but defensible position if [[we]{.underline}]{.mark}
didn't [[live in]{.mark} such [a **tinderbox**]{.mark}
**world**]{.underline}. Someone could rationally say, yes, it's terrible
that a million plus people are being killed overseas in a horrific
conflict, but the war is really very far away and America has urgent
needs at home and we should husband the resources we have available for
foreign policy on things that have more power to affect us directly.
[The problem is that **[these wars spread]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They
may start in places that we don't care much about (most Americans didn't
give a rat's patootie about whether Germany controlled the Sudetenland
in 1938 or Danzig in 1939) but they tend to spread to places that we do
care very much about. This can be because a revisionist great power like
Germany in 1938-39 needs to overturn the balance of power in Europe to
achieve its goals, or it can be because instability in a very remote
place triggers problems in places that we care about very much. [Out of
[Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2001 [[came]{.underline}]{.mark}
both [[9/11]{.mark} and the [**waves** of **insurgency** and
**instability**]{.mark} that threaten to rip nuclear-armed Pakistan
apart or trigger wider conflict with India]{.underline}. Out of the mess
in Syria a witches' brew of terrorism and religious conflict looks set
to complicate the security of our allies in Europe and the Middle East
and even the security of the oil supply on which the world economy so
profoundly depends. Africa, and the potential for upheaval there, is of
more importance to American security than many people may understand.
The line between Africa and the Middle East is a soft one. The [[weak
states]{.underline}]{.mark} that straddle the southern approaches of the
Sahara [are ideal [petri dishes for **Al Qaeda**]{.mark} **type groups**
to form and attract local support.]{.underline} [There are [networks of
funding]{.mark} and [religious contact]{.mark} that give [groups]{.mark}
in these countries potential access to [funds, fighters, training
and]{.mark} [weapons]{.mark} from the Middle East.]{.underline} [A war
in the]{.underline} eastern [Congo]{.underline} might not directly
trigger these other conflicts, but it [helps to [create]{.mark} the
swirling [underworld of arms trading, money transfers, illegal
commerce]{.mark} and the rise of a generation]{.underline} of young men
[who become experienced fighters]{.underline}---and know no other way to
make a living. [It **[destabilizes]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
environment for **[[neighboring states]{.underline}]{.mark}** (like
Uganda and Kenya) [that [play]{.mark} much more direct [role in
potential crises]{.mark} of greater concern to us.]{.underline}

Volumes of scholarly literature detail [[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}
rise to great-power status and the likely implications thereof.37 Given
its prodigious economic growth, it is natural to question whether such a
[[rise]{.underline}]{.mark} will be [[accompanied by US-Sino
conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such an outcome [[is
unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}, primarily [[because]{.mark} of a return
of **[nuclear parity]{.mark}**]{.underline} with[[in a **bipolar
environment**.]{.underline}]{.mark}38 There are concerns over China's
increasing need for fuel imports to support its expanding
infrastructure. China shows little concern with the political ideologies
of regimes with which it trades; yet, its willingness to deal with
states like Iran and Sudan could worsen relations with the United
States.39 China's ongoing military modernization also appears designed
in part to deny the United States the ability to deter it in the near
future through strategies focused primarily on interruptions of its oil
supply via area denial or control of critical eastern sea lines of
communication. China is expanding its web of regional alliances via arms
transfers and other inducements that may result in a wall of allies the
United States will find difficult to penetrate to protect its interests
in the Eastern Hemisphere.40 China is also willing to protect those
interests militarily where necessary; some aver the 1996 Taiwan crisis
indicated China may be prepared to take Taiwan by force in a preemptive
attack.41 Yet, evidence suggests its neighbors welcome the economic
opportunities China presents to them and believe its intentions are
peaceful and focused on domestic stability and growth rather than
regional dominance.42 Since it is unlikely that any regional attempts to
balance a rising China are forthcoming, at least in the near term, it
falls to the United States as the peer competitor to do so. While US
military preeminence is still clear, trends appear to indicate the
United States will find it increasingly difficult to compete with China
for strategic resource requirements as China's geostrategic influence
expands. Bipolarity, Nuclear Weapons, and Sino-US Proxy Conflict in
Africa It is likely [China will achieve economic and]{.underline} then
[military parity with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates in
the next two decades. [China currently possesses 240
nuc]{.underline}lear warhead[s and 135 ballistic missiles capable of
reaching the United States or its allies]{.underline}; that number of
nuclear warheads is estimated to double by the mid 2020s.43 As during
the Cold War, [a bipolar system]{.underline} in which war between the
United States and China is too costly [will lead to policy decisions
that seek **conflict resolution** elsewhere]{.underline}.44 [\[Insert
Footnote 44\]]{.underline} 44. Aaron Friedberg, "The Future of
U.S.-China Relations: Is Conflict Inevitable?" International Security
30, no. 2 (2005): 17--19, argues that [the costs of such conflict will
cause both sides to **carefully avoid**]{.underline} direct
[conflict]{.underline}. [\[Exit Footnote 44\]]{.underline} But why would
China's rising necessarily lead to geostrategic competition with the
United States, and where would this most likely occur? Unlike the Cold
War, [[access to]{.mark} strategic [resources]{.mark} rather than
ideology would]{.underline} lie at the heart of future US-Sino
competition, and the new "great game" **[[will]{.mark} most likely [be
played in Africa.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Despite Communist Party control
of its government, China is not interested in spreading its version of
communism and is much more pragmatic in its objectives---securing
resources to meet the needs of its citizens and improve their standard
of living.45 Some estimates show that China will overtake the United
States to become the world's largest economy by 2015, and rising powers
usually take the necessary steps to "ensure markets, materials, and
transportation routes."46 China is the leading global consumer of
aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, zinc, tin, and iron ore, and its metal
needs now represent more than 25 percent of the world's total.47 In
contrast, from 1970 to 1995, US consumption of all materials, including
metals, accounted for one-third of the global total despite representing
only 5 percent of the world's population.48 China is the largest energy
consumer, according to the International Energy Agency, surpassing the
United States in consumption of oil, coal, and natural gas in 2009.49 As
the two largest consumers of both global energy and materials, the
United States and China must seek foreign policy prescriptions to
fulfill future resource needs. While the United States can alleviate
some of its energy needs via bio- or coal-based fuels, hydrogen, or
natural gas alternatives, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} currently lacks
the technological know-how to do so and [[remains tied to a]{.mark}
mainly [nonrenewable energy]{.mark} resource base.]{.underline} Since
the majority of these needs are nonrenewable, competition of necessity
will be zero-sum and will be conducted via all instruments of power.50
[[Africa is home to]{.mark} a wealth of mineral and [energy
resources]{.mark}, much of which still remains largely
unexploited.]{.underline} Seven African states possess huge endowments
of oil, and four of these have equally substantial amounts of natural
gas.51 Africa also enjoys large deposits of bauxite (used to make
aluminum), copper, lead, nickel, zinc, and iron ore, all of which are
imported and highly desired by China. Recent activity serves to prove
that China seeks greater access to natural resources in Africa by avidly
promoting Chinese development in a large number of African nations.
South Africa, the continent's largest economy, has recently allowed
China to help develop its vast mineral wealth; it is China's number one
African source of manganese, iron, and copper.52 Chinese involvement in
Africa is not wholly extractive; the continent provides a booming export
market for China's goods and a forum to augment its soft power in the
region by offering alternatives to the political and economic baggage
that accompanies US foreign aid.53 [Of primary interest is open access
to Africa's significant deposits of oil and other energy
resources]{.underline}. For example, China has 4,000 military personnel
in Sudan to protect its interests in energy and mineral investments
there; it also owns 40 percent of the Greater Nile Oil Production
Company. 54 Estimates indicate that within the next few decades China
will obtain 40 percent of its oil and gas supplies from Africa.55 Trade
and investment in Africa have also been on the rise; trade has grown
more than 10 percent annually in the past decade. Between 2002 and 2004,
African exports to China doubled, ranking it third behind the United
States and France in trade with the continent. Chinese investment is
also growing; more than 700 Chinese business operations across Africa
total over \$1 billion. Aid and direct economic assistance are
increasing as well, and China has forgiven the debt of some 31 African
nations.56 [[Africa is]{.mark} thus [a **vital foreign interest** for
the Chinese and]{.mark} must be for [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates; [access to [its mineral and
petroleum]{.mark} wealth [is **crucial to**]{.mark} the
**[survival]{.mark}** of each]{.underline}.57 Although the US and
Chinese economies are tightly interconnected, the nonrenewable nature of
these assets means competition will remain a zero-sum game. Nearly all
African states have been independent entities for less than 50 years;
consolidating robust domestic state institutions and stable governments
remains problematic.58 Studies have shown that weak governments are
often prime targets for civil conflicts that prove costly to control.59
[Many African [nations possess]{.mark} **both [strategic resources and
weak regimes]{.mark}**[, making them **vulnerable to internal conflict**
and]{.mark} thus valuable candidates for [assistance from China or the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [to help
settle their domestic grievances]{.underline}. [With access to African
resources of vital strategic interest to each side, [competition
could]{.mark} likely [occur by **proxy via**]{.mark}]{.underline}
diplomatic, economic, or **[[military assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to one (or both) of the parties involved. [Realist claims that focusing
on third-world issues is misplaced are thus fallacious]{.underline};
[[war in a]{.mark} future US-China [bipolar system remains **as costly
as**]{.mark} **it was [during the Cold War]{.mark}**. Because of the
**fragile nature of** many **African regimes**]{.underline}, [domestic
grievances are **more prone to result in conflict**]{.underline}**;**
[[US and Chinese]{.mark} strategic [interests]{.mark} will [dictate an
**intrusive foreign policy** to be]{.mark} both [**prudent and vital**.
US-Sino proxy conflicts over]{.mark}]{.underline} control of [[African
resources will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely **[[become
necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}** if these great powers are to sustain
their national security postures, especially in terms of strategic
defense.60 What does this mean for the future of US grand and military
strategy, foreign policy prescriptions, future defense acquisition
priorities, and military doctrine and training?

#### 1 -- [Empirics]{.underline} -- LIO has failed with EVERY crisis their ev cites

In their statement, China and Russia achieved peak hypocrisy. But the
existing world order, which aspired to build a global commonwealth, had
already been failing. [The free world's leader]{.underline}s had [long
ago started favoring **performative commitments**]{.underline}
[over]{.underline} the **[real action needed to safeguard]{.underline}**
[the planet from **crises**]{.underline}. [They **expanded NATO**
without meaningfully responding to increasing **Russian
aggression**]{.underline}. Distracted and chastened by misadventures in
the Muslim world, [Washington]{.underline} in particular
[disengaged]{.underline} **[from practical deeds]{.underline}**, [even
as its rhetorical commitment to the international order
varied.]{.underline} The United States' [high defense spending had more
to do with satisfying **domestic constituencies**]{.underline} [than
with **supporting any positive strategy**]{.underline}. The world's
[transition from **fossil fuels**]{.underline} [to **renewable energy
sources**]{.underline} [was based on **hollow pledges**]{.underline} and
private action. As support for globalization waned, the [United States
and other countries]{.underline} [**retreated from trade agreements**
and]{.underline} **[neglected international institutions]{.underline}**
for civilian and common economic action. The world's drive in the early
years of this century to improve global **[health and human development
petered out.]{.underline}**

[The]{.underline} **[emptiness]{.underline}** [of the supposed
**international system**]{.underline} was [especially
obvious]{.underline} at the end of 2019, [when the]{.underline} COVID-19
[pandemic broke out.]{.underline} Charged with unprecedented global
responsibilities, China and the United States stepped down, not up.
Beijing withheld crucial information about the outbreak. [Washington
**withdrew from the World Health Organization**]{.underline} [just when
it most needed U.S. leadership. Wealthy countries began a mad scramble
to develop vaccines]{.underline}, but they **[moved too slowly to create
other treatments]{.underline}** and hoarded whatever shots and
therapeutics pharmaceutical companies could produce, leaving the rest of
the world behind. The best estimates suggest that the virus caused about
15 to 20 million deaths and trillions of dollars of economic damage.

By the spring of 2020, "for all practical purposes **[the G7 ceased to
exist]{.underline}**," wrote the foreign policy experts Colin Kahl and
Thomas Wright in August 2021. "[Pandemic politics]{.underline}," they
continued, "**[ultimately dealt the final blow to the old
international]{.underline}** order."

Six months after they published those words, **[Russia invaded
Ukraine]{.underline}**. [It was an attack that could truly have **buried
the old system**]{.underline}, as Moscow believed it would. Yet
Ukraine's inspiring fight has helped the G-7 roar back to life. Its
members have organized an economic counteroffensive, and they have
joined a coalition providing military aid. Amid the wreckage of so many
past hopes, it is possible to imagine a reconstructed world order
emerging from this crisis.

But for a new system to succeed, its would-be architects must organize
actions, not more theatrics. Over the course of world history, the most
powerful idealism has usually been the idealism of what works. Today,
that means crafting a practical international order focused on a few
basic problems that rally broad interest. Many leaders want to stop
unprovoked wars of aggression, especially those that might spark a third
world war. They would welcome a new vision of economic order that does
not ignore security but is also not a huckster's promise that everything
can be made at home. They would like to convert jolting energy shocks,
such as the one caused by Russia's invasion, into a managed transition
to a more carbon-free future. They want to be better prepared for the
next pandemic. And most world leaders, and even many ordinary Americans,
still hope that China will choose to be part of these solutions, not one
of the wreckers of a new international system.

These aspirations may seem modest. They do not include holding war
crimes trials or spreading democracy. But effective common action on
just these items will be an enormous task. [The world order
is]{.underline} **[deglobalizing and dysfunctional]{.underline}**,
[facing challenges that have never **been more planetary in
scope**]{.underline}. Leaders must craft a system focused on actually
addressing these issues rather than on striking the right pose.

Pushing back against Trump's foreign policy is an important goal. But
moving forward requires a more serious analysis than claiming that [the
"[liberal international order]{.mark}"]{.underline} was the centerpiece
of past U.S. foreign-policy successes, and thus should be again. Both
claims are flawed. We need to understand the limits of the liberal
international order, where it previously failed to deliver benefits, and
why it [offers little guidance for]{.underline} many [contemporary
questions]{.underline}. First, advocates of the order tend to skim past
the [policies pursued under the liberal order]{.underline} that [have
not worked]{.underline}. These mistakes need to be directly confronted
to do better in the future. [[Proponents]{.mark} of the
order]{.underline}, however, often [present a **[narrow]{.mark}** and
highly **selective** [reading]{.mark} of history that
[ignores]{.mark}]{.underline} much of [the [coercion]{.mark}, violence,
[and instability]{.mark} that accompanied post-war history]{.underline}.
[Problematic outcomes are treated as]{.underline} either [aberrant
exceptions]{.underline} or as not truly characterizing the order. One
recent [defense of the liberal order]{.underline} by prominent liberal
institutionalists Daniel Deudney and G. John Ikenberry, for instance,
[does not mention [Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam]{.mark}, or
[Libya]{.mark}]{.underline}. Professors Stephen Chaudoin, Helen Milner,
and Dustin Tingley herald the order's "support for freedom, democracy,
human rights, a free press." Kori Schake writes that Western
democracies' wars are "about enlarging the perimeter of security and
prosperity, expanding and consolidating the liberal order." Historian
Hal Brands argues that the order has advocated "political liberalism in
the form of representative government and human rights; and other
liberal concepts, such as nonaggression, self-determination, and the
peaceful settlement of disputes." Other analysts have persuasively
argued that these accounts create an "imagined" picture of post-World
War II history. Patrick Porter outlines in detail [how coercive,
violent, and hypocritical U.S. foreign policy has often
been]{.underline}. To the extent an international liberal order ever
actually existed beyond a small cluster of countries, writes Nick
Danforth, it was recent and short-lived. Thomas Meaney and Stephen
Wertheim further argue that "[critics exaggerate]{.underline} Mr.
[Trump's abnormality]{.underline}," situating him within a long history
of the pursuit of American self-interest. Graham Allison---no
bomb-throwing radical---has recently written that the order was a "myth"
and that credit for the lack of great power war should instead go to
nuclear deterrence. [Coercion and disregard for]{.underline} both
[allies and political liberalism have been entirely compatible with the
"liberal" order. The last two decades have been a bumpy ride for U.S.
foreign policy. Since 9/11, we have seen the disintegration of [Syria,
Yemen]{.mark}, and Libya, a war without end in Afghanistan, the collapse
of the [Arab Spring]{.mark}, the rise and resurgence of the Islamic
State, and]{.underline} the distinctly [mixed success]{.underline} of
strategies aimed at [managing China's rise]{.underline}. At home, [the
growth of a national-security state has placed remarkable power in the
hands of]{.underline} Donald [Trump]{.underline}. Simply **[returning to
the old order is no guarantee of good results]{.underline}**. Grappling
openly with failure and self-inflicted wounds---while also acknowledging
clear benefits of the order---is essential for moving beyond
self-congratulatory platitudes. Second, [the liberal order]{.underline}
in its idealized form [had very limited reach into]{.underline} what are
now [pivotal areas of U.S. security policy: Asia, the Middle East, and
the "developing world"]{.underline} more broadly. The core of the
liberal order remains transatlantic, but [Asia]{.underline} is now
growing dramatically in wealth and military power. What is the record of
the order in the region? There was certainly some democracy promotion
when authoritarian regimes began to totter, but [there was also deep,
sustained cooperation with dictators like Suharto and Ferdinand
Marcos]{.underline}; while there are some [regional
institutions]{.underline} (such as ASEAN), they [are]{.underline}
comparatively [weak]{.underline}; while there are some
[rules]{.underline}, they [have been deeply contested]{.underline}.
Close [U.S. allies]{.underline} like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea (the
latter two experiencing long bouts of U.S.-allied autocracy) [were not
integrated into a broad alliance pact like NATO]{.underline}. India and
Pakistan were never part of the core order, and China was only very
partially integrated (primarily into the economic pillar of the order,
and through ad hoc security cooperation from the 1970s). Southeast Asia
has been a site of warfare and authoritarianism for much of its
post-1945 history. The United States has long considered [the Middle
East]{.underline} vital to its security, but the extent to which the
United States should invest its own blood and treasure in protecting the
area was always up for debate. It was only in the 1970s that the United
States decided it was prepared to use force to defend the region; "dual
containment" in the 1990s was always controversial, while the invasion
of Iraq and its chaotic aftermath revealed deep fissures over how much
presence was enough. Meanwhile, [liberalism, democracy, human rights,
and international [institutions have not made]{.mark} much of [a
mark]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. Jake Sullivan, in a rather odd
defense of the order, suggests that "Middle Eastern **[[instability has
been a feature, not a bug, of the system]{.underline}]{.mark}**." This
is not reassuring about the order's ability to structure politics in the
area. [The same can be said about the order's history [in
Africa]{.mark}]{.underline}, with deep Western involvement in civil
wars, support for authoritarian regimes, and often-counterproductive
demands for economic liberalization contributing to ongoing instability.
The legacy of the "liberal order" is both far more complex and shallower
outside of the north Atlantic core than within it. [Invocations of the
order are seen with greater cynicism and suspicion in these
areas]{.underline} than in Washington or Berlin. [Yet they are precisely
the regions that are increasingly the focus of U.S. security
policy.]{.underline} Finally, and as the preceding already suggests, the
idea of "[[liberal order" is]{.underline}]{.mark} itself frequently [too
vague a concept, and]{.underline} was too [incomplete a phenomenon, to
offer guidance on]{.underline} a number of key [contemporary
questions]{.underline}. Allison goes so far as to call it
"**[[conceptual Jell-o]{.underline}]{.mark}**." The extremely abstract
principles that experts use to define the order are confronted with a
reality of extreme historical variation. [This amorphousness undermines
its usefulness as an actual guide to future foreign policy]{.underline}.
[U.S. alliances in]{.underline} Western [Europe]{.underline} since World
War II [looked dramatically different than]{.underline} those in [East
Asia]{.underline}. Both have achieved their basic goals, so which should
be the model for the future? [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [often applied pressure to coerce]{.underline} its
[allies]{.underline} into adopting economic and security policies
conducive to U.S. interests---going so far as to threaten abandonment of
close European allies---[even as it]{.underline} simultaneously
[built]{.underline} key elements of [the liberal order]{.underline}. The
core of the liberal order was a more tenuous and contested political
space than we often remember. This inconsistency applies to involvement
in the domestic politics of other states. The United States has
regularly embraced authoritarian leaders (and distanced itself from
democratic regimes), while at other times it has helped to push these
leaders out in the face of domestic mobilization. Advocates of the order
tend to stress the latter and dismiss the former as aberrant, but both
strategies contributed to the ultimate victory of the liberal order over
the Soviet bloc. The order's history offers support for aggressively
promoting democracy, accepting democratization when it emerges, and
strongly supporting friendly dictators. This makes it unhelpful for
grappling with the question of whether and how to promote democracy. The
same is true of military interventions and covert operations abroad.
U.S. leaders invested heavily in Cold War proxy wars and the overthrow
of foreign regimes, while at other times and places they avoided such
interventions. This history carries important implications for
addressing today's policy challenges. [Simply appealing to the order
does not]{.underline}, for instance, [tell us much]{.underline} about
how [to deal with a rising China]{.underline}: Since the liberal order
included highly institutionalized alliances, loose "hub-and-spoke"
arrangements, and coalitions of the willing, and was characterized by
both preventive wars and containment, it is extremely unclear what the

Witnessing the chaos, [critics of]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [have made its damage to the post-1945 "liberal
international order" a central part of their criticism. In their view,
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [created and led a
post-World War II order]{.underline}---[made up of international rules
and institutions, free trade, and democracy]{.underline}---[that
generated enormous benefits now threatened by]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration's actions. A post-Trump foreign
policy, they argue, needs to re-embrace the fundamentals of this order.
Pushing back against Trump's foreign policy is an important goal. But
[[moving forward requires]{.mark} a **[more]{.mark} [serious analysis
than claiming that the "liberal international order" was the centerpiece
of past U.S. foreign-policy successes]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and thus
should be again.]{.underline} **[Both claims are flawed]{.underline}**.
[We need to understand the limits of [the liberal]{.mark} international
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}, [where **it previously [failed to deliver
benefits]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} why it **[offers little guidance for
many contemporary questions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} First,
[[advocates]{.mark} of the order t]{.underline}end to [[skim past the
policies]{.mark} pursued under the liberal order [that have not
worked]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These **mistakes need to be directly
confronted** to do better in the future]{.underline}.
[[Proponents]{.underline}]{.mark} of the order, however, often [[present
a **narrow and highly selective reading of history** that
ignores]{.mark} much of [the coercion, violence, and instability]{.mark}
that accompanied post-war history]{.underline}. **[[Problematic outcomes
are treated as either]{.mark} aberrant [exceptions or as not truly
characterizing the order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [One recent defense of
the liberal order by]{.underline} prominent liberal institutionalists
Daniel [Deudney and]{.underline} G. John [Ikenberry]{.underline}, for
instance, [does not mention **[Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam,]{.mark} or
[Libya]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Professors Stephen
[Chaudoin]{.underline}, Helen [Milner, and]{.underline} Dustin [Tingley
herald the order's "support for freedom, democracy, human
rights]{.underline}, a free press." Kori [Schake writes that Western
democracies' wars are "about]{.underline} enlarging the perimeter of
security and prosperity, [expanding and consolidating the liberal
order]{.underline}." Historian Hal [Brands argues that the order has
advocated "political liberalism]{.underline} in the form of
representative government and human rights; [and other liberal concepts,
such as nonaggression, self-determination, and]{.underline} the
[peaceful settlement]{.underline} of disputes." Other analysts have
persuasively argued that [[these **accounts create an "imagined" picture
of post-World War II history**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Patrick [[Porter
outlines]{.mark} in detail [how **coercive, violent, and hypocritical**
U.S. foreign policy has]{.mark} often [been]{.mark}]{.underline}. [To
the extent an international liberal order ever actually existed beyond a
small cluster of countries]{.underline}, writes Nick Danforth, [it was
recent and short-lived]{.underline}. Thomas Meaney and Stephen Wertheim
further argue that "critics exaggerate Mr. Trump's abnormality,"
situating him within a long history of the pursuit of American
self-interest. Graham [Allison]{.underline}---no bomb-throwing
radical---[has recently written that the order was a "myth" and that
credit for the lack of great power war should instead go to nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}. [[Coercion and disregard for]{.mark} both
[allies]{.mark} and political liberalism [have been entirely compatible
with the "liberal" order]{.mark}]{.underline}. The last two decades have
been a bumpy ride for U.S. foreign policy. [Since 9/11, we [have seen
the disintegration of Syria, Yemen]{.mark}, and Libya, a war without end
in Afghanistan, [the]{.mark} collapse of the [Arab Spring, the
rise]{.mark}]{.underline} and resurgence [[of the Islamic State,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [distinctly mixed success of strategies
aimed at managing [China's rise]{.mark}.]{.underline} At home, the
growth of a national-security state has placed remarkable power in the
hands of Donald Trump. [Simply [returning to the old order is **no
guarantee of good results**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Grappling openly with
failure and self-inflicted wounds]{.underline}---while also
acknowledging clear benefits of the order---[is essential for moving
beyond self-congratulatory platitudes.]{.underline} Second, [the liberal
order]{.underline} in its idealized form [had very limited reach into
what are now pivotal areas of U.S. security policy: Asia, the Middle
East, and the "developing world" more broadly]{.underline}. The core of
the liberal order remains transatlantic, but Asia is now growing
dramatically in wealth and military power. [What is the record of the
order in the region?]{.underline} [There was certainly some democracy
promotion]{.underline} when authoritarian regimes began to totter, [but
there was also deep, sustained cooperation with dictators]{.underline}
like Suharto and Ferdinand Marcos; [while there are some regional
institutions]{.underline} (such as ASEAN), [they are comparatively weak;
while]{.underline} there are some [rules]{.underline}, they [have been
deeply contested.]{.underline} [Close U.S. allies like Japan, Taiwan,
and South Korea]{.underline} (the latter two experiencing long bouts of
U.S.-allied autocracy) [were not integrated into a broad alliance pact
like NATO]{.underline}. [India and Pakistan were never part of
the]{.underline} core [order, and China was only very partially
integrated]{.underline} (primarily into the economic pillar of the
order, and through ad hoc security cooperation from the 1970s).
Southeast Asia has been a site of warfare and authoritarianism for much
of its post-1945 history. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[has long considered the Middle East vital to its security]{.underline},
but the extent to which the United States should invest its own blood
and treasure in protecting the area was always up for debate. It was
only in the 1970s that the United States decided it was prepared to use
force to defend the region; "dual containment" in the 1990s was always
controversial, while the invasion of Iraq and its chaotic aftermath
revealed deep fissures over how much presence was enough. Meanwhile,
[liberalism, democracy, human rights, and international institutions
have not made much of a mark in the region]{.underline}. Jake Sullivan,
in a rather odd defense of the order, suggests that "Middle Eastern
instability has been a feature, not a bug, of the system." [This is not
reassuring about the order's ability to structure politics in the
area]{.underline}. [The same can be said about]{.underline} the order's
history in [Africa]{.underline}, [with deep Western involvement in civil
wars, support for authoritarian regimes, and]{.underline}
[often-counterproductive demands for economic liberalization
contributing to ongoing instability.]{.underline} The legacy of the
"liberal order" is both far more complex and shallower outside of the
north Atlantic core than within it. Invocations of the order are seen
with greater cynicism and suspicion in these areas than in Washington or
Berlin. Yet they are precisely the regions that are increasingly the
focus of U.S. security policy. Finally, and as the preceding already
suggests, [the idea of "liberal order" is itself frequently too vague a
concept, and was too incomplete a phenomenon, to offer guidance on a
number of key contemporary questions.]{.underline} Allison goes so far
as to call it "conceptual Jell-o." [The extremely [abstract
principles]{.mark} that experts use to define the order are confronted
with a reality of extreme historical variation. This amorphousness
**[undermines its usefulness as an actual guide to future foreign
policy.]{.mark}**]{.underline} U.S. alliances in Western Europe since
World War II looked dramatically different than those in East Asia. Both
have achieved their basic goals, so which should be the model for the
future? The United States often applied pressure to coerce its allies
into adopting economic and security policies conducive to U.S.
interests---going so far as to threaten abandonment of close European
allies---even as it simultaneously built key elements of the liberal
order. The core of the liberal order was a more tenuous and contested
political space than we often remember. This inconsistency applies to
involvement in the domestic politics of other states. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has]{.mark}
regularly [embraced authoritarian leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}(and distanced itself from democratic regimes), [[while at
other times]{.mark} it has helped to [push these leaders out]{.mark} in
the face of domestic mobilization]{.underline}. [[Advocates]{.mark} of
the order tend to stress the latter and [dismiss the former as
aberrant]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**but [both strategies contributed to
the ultimate victory of the liberal order]{.mark}** []{.mark}over the
Soviet bloc. The order's history offers support for]{.underline}
aggressively [promoting democracy]{.underline}, accepting
democratization when it emerges[, and strongly supporting friendly
dictators]{.underline}. [[This makes it unhelpful for grappling with
**the question of whether and how**]{.mark} to promote
democracy]{.underline}. [The same is true of military interventions and
covert operations abroad]{.underline}. U.S. leaders invested heavily in
Cold War proxy wars and the overthrow of foreign regimes, while at other
times and places they avoided such interventions. This history carries
important implications for addressing today's policy challenges. [Simply
appealing to the order does not, for instance, tell us much about how to
deal with a rising China]{.underline}: Since the liberal order included
highly institutionalized alliances, loose "hub-and-spoke" arrangements,
and coalitions of the willing, and was characterized by both preventive
wars and containment, [it is extremely unclear what the order suggests
for America's China strategy. While "rules-based" order is a term in
vogue, [**it doesn't tell us what the rules should actually be, or how
they should be decided**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Nor does appealing to
the liberal order help us understand whether the U]{.underline}nited

The [first challenge to the current liberal order comes]{.underline}
from the **[entrenchment of authoritarianism]{.underline}** during the
pandemic[, as characterized by authoritarian resilience,
autocratizatio]{.underline}n,4 and the [consolidation of competing
political-economic models]{.underline} built by leading authoritarian
countries. As numerous democracies test the boundaries of freedom and
control, [authoritarian leaders across the world]{.underline} **[exploit
the coronavirus crisis to tighten control over their people even
further]{.underline}**. The sweeping measures and institutional
arrangements utilized by these leaders to combat the virus [will leave
significant legacies on both domestic politics and foreign
policies]{.underline}. Interpreted in the path-dependence framework, the
decisions made at certain "formative moments or conjunctures" can
influence the long-term institutional trajectories. These institutions
can be "sticky" and resistant to changes \[43\]. Moreover, rid[ing the
wave of autocratization, leading authoritarian countries]{.underline}
**[like China]{.underline}** [have consolidated their competing
political-economic models **vis-à-vis the Western-dominated
model**]{.underline}. As increasingly powerful and ambitious patrons in
the global arena, [they have provided alternative sources of economic
power, security, aid, ideology]{.underline}, as well as institutional
platforms to the autocrats and emerging autocrats, without imposing
political conditionality that favors liberal values. The pandemic has
provided opportunities to consolidate their positions and promote their
models worldwide.

[The entrenchment of authoritarianism]{.underline} is first and foremost
[reflected by the durability of authoritarian regime]{.underline}s
during the pandemic. To the disappointment of those seeking cracks in
the authoritarian regimes hit hard by the pandemic, the [autocrats
around the world have largely survived the tests resulting from the
pandemic]{.underline}. In particular, the resilience of communist
regimes, such as China and Vietnam, has provided clear examples of
entrenched authoritarianism during the pandemic. [In]{.underline} the
case of [China, confronted with the worst health crisis faced by
the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party ([CCP]{.underline}), the
[regime's capacity is questioned by many scholars and
observe]{.underline}rs. Pei argues that the pandemic has shown the
regime's lack of capacity in responding to the health crisis and exposed
the fragility of Xi Jinping's strongman rule. The regime will be trapped
in economic stagnation and increasing social unrest domestically and in
great-power competition abroad. As a result, it will start to "unravel
by fits and starts" \[44\]. This assessment is consistent with Pei's
earlier diagnosis of the CCP's serious illnesses and regime decay, as
well as other scholars' observation of China's "frozen" political system
\[45, 46\]. However, the evidence so far suggests [that the regime has
not only managed to survive the crisis but also boosted its
legitimacy.]{.underline}

Early in the outbreak, China's failure to respond was perceived as a
manifestation of the breakdown of top-down governance structures \[47\].
Chinese people were angry at the government's handling the crisis in its
initial response. The authorities chose to withhold information about
the virus from the public, punished doctors for "spreading rumors," and
prioritized stability over transparency. When the situation erupted
beyond control, the influx of photos, videos, blogs, and diaries on
social media depicting the ordeals of Wuhan citizens ignited both anger
and fear among the public. The CCP rushed to calm the public, started a
massive machine of mobilization, and implemented extreme lockdown
measures. Grassroots organizations were also mobilized by the state to
enforce quarantines and lockdowns, provide essential services, and
collect information and monitor citizens, greatly enhancing the state's
capacity at political and social control \[48\]. The state soon regained
control of the situation, although life was far from being back to
normal.

The [shock caused by the pandemic]{.underline} was [followed by the
massive outbreaks in Europe]{.underline} and [later the United
States]{.underline}, [overwhelming the capacity of one country after
another]{.underline}. Chinese state media and social media produced
vivid stories describing the disastrous responses in many Western
democracies, especially their failures to copy China's "homework" for
combating the coronavirus. It looked as though [China **was the only
haven in the world**]{.underline} and many Chinese people abroad
struggled to find their way back home.

Both authoritarian and democratic countries have demonstrated mixed
performances in responding to the pandemic. There are successful cases
in democracies, such as that of South Korea, which presents an effective
model for combating the coronavirus. There are also failed cases among
autocracies, such as Iran, which struggled to contain the outbreak
during its initial stage \[49, 50\]. However, the failures of many
democratic countries, especially the United States, to control the virus
quickly and effectively helped reverse course in China and boost the
CCP's domestic legitimacy. The comparison led many Chinese to believe
that an authoritarian government is a better option for China,
especially in times of crisis and during the rhetorical siege by the
Western countries. The CCP gladly sells the idea of a better political
system to its people through intensive nationwide propaganda,
manipulation of social media, and spontaneous expression of national
pride by its people. The success story of Vietnam which shares similar
political-economic model with China further contributes to the discourse
of a superior political system. In a survey conducted in April,
researchers asked citizens to rate their countries' performance in
dealing with the pandemic. China ranked highest among 23 countries, with
a score of 85 out of 100, followed by Vietnam (77). In the rating of the
political leaders' response to the crisis, both countries (China, 86 out
of 100; Vietnam, 82) outpaced major Western countries, including New
Zealand (67), Germany (35), the United States (32), the United Kingdom
(30), and Italy (25) \[51\]. Another report based on online surveys
finds that trust in the Chinese government was as high as 95% in April
\[52\].

Beyond China, other authoritarian leaders exploited the crisis to
further tighten control over their people. [In Russia,]{.underline}
which closely monitored its neighbor's tech-driven model of control, the
[pandemic provided an opportunity for **Russian authorities to develop
new surveillance capabilities**]{.underline} equipped with
facial-recognition and geolocation tracking systems \[53\]. [In Iran,
the hard-liners leveraged the massive pressures]{.underline} from the
pandemic to **[consolidate power]{.underline}**. Members of the
Revolutionary Guards were dispatched to enforce strict quarantine
measures, while ramping up efforts to monitor and silence citizens on
the basis of "national security" \[54--56\]. Moreover, conservatives
capitalized on the missteps made by the moderate, civilian-led
government. They launched campaigns to undermine it, portraying the
Revolutionary Guards as "the guardian of public health and the champion
of the fight against the invisible enemy" \[57\].

[Coupled with authoritarian resilience]{.underline}, [**a wave of
autocratization** has surged around the world during the
pandemic]{.underline}. In Hungary, a country already experiencing rapid
erosion of freedoms and democratic norms in recent years, Prime Minister
Viktor Orbán secured an indefinite state of emergency that allows him to
rule by decree. Journalists can be jailed for up to five years for
spreading misinformation that hinders the government's response to the
pandemic \[58\]. Similarly, in the name of maintaining order and
combatting disinformation during the pandemic, extraordinary emergency
powers were invoked in both Thailand and the Philippines. These powers
allowed the Thai authorities to censor or shut down media and the latter
to imprison those accused of spreading false information on social media
and other platforms \[59, 60\].

By late April, more than [84 countries had enacted emergency laws to
give executives more power to handle the coronavirus]{.underline}
\[61\]. Previous researches already found that states of emergency often
associate with a heightened risk of autocratization \[62\]. Before the
pandemic, more than one-third of the world's population already lived in
autocratizing countries. Moreover, for the first time since 2001, the
majority of countries in the world are autocracies (92 in total) \[63\].
The pandemic has reinforced anti-democratic trends, with 48 countries at
high risk of pandemic backsliding and 34 others at medium risk \[64\].
While the urgency and presence of the coronavirus will eventually
dissipate, the effect of the authoritarian measures and the
institutional legacies will likely remain, influencing both domestic
politics and foreign policies.

Rather than witnessing "the end point of mankind's ideological evolution
and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form
of human government" \[11\], [the world is now seeing a regime landscape
mixed **with thriving authoritarianism**]{.underline} and democracy. To
complicate the matters further, the [challengers to the current
order]{.underline} have [exploited the pandemic to **assert their
political systems**]{.underline} and ideologies, which are seen as
incompatible with the Western standards and values. Ikenberry asserts
that neither China nor Russia has a model that is appealing to the rest
of world \[10\]. However, because of the ideological divergence,
[authoritarian political-economic models built by these two countries
are **increasingly welcomed by sitting dictators**]{.underline} and
emerging autocrats. China and Russia have already become alternative
providers of goods such as developmental assistance and military
security, which used to be monopolized by major Western powers \[23\].
Now, they are using such leverages to rival the liberal order led by the
United States, building "parallel structures of global governance that
are dominated by authoritarian states and that compete with older, more
liberal structures" \[65\].

In comparison to Russia, China has maintained more extensive
institutional networks. China has created, expanded, and led important
international institutions (such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment
Bank), regional forums (the Forum for China-Africa Cooperation),
security organizations (the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation), and
infrastructure investment projects (the Belt and Road Initiative). These
institutions have become the cornerstones of its alternative
political-economic model. In this model, the powerful and ambitious
patron provides alternative sources of economic power, security, aid,
ideology, as well as institutional platforms for the dictators and
emerging autocrats, without imposing political conditionality that
favors liberal values.

The [pandemic allows these challengers]{.underline} to **[consolidate
their positions and promote their political-economic models
globally]{.underline}**. In the case of [China]{.underline}, it has
[sought to build a "health silk road" b]{.underline}y sending medical
teams and resources to numerous countries around the world. According to
a report released by China's State Council Information Office, the
country had offered or provided assistance to 150 countries and 4
international organizations as of June \[66\]. Major Western powers have
widely criticized these efforts for their intention to capitalize on the
pandemic and project China's influence globally. But China has won many
hearts in the region where it has projected its economic and diplomatic
influence through the Belt and Road Initiative in recent years.
Countries that welcome China's growing influence include major
autocratizing countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including Serbia,
Hungary and the Czech Republic \[67, 68\]. As a result, China [can
utilize its reciprocating relations with the receivers of medical
goods]{.underline} and to [garner additional support for its
**authoritarian political-economic model** vis]{.underline}-à-vis the
Western liberal model. Moreover, the exacerbation of nationalism in both
democracies and autocracies further reinforces the consolidation of
authoritarianism and authoritarian political-economic models during the
pandemic.

Besides the challenge brought by the entrenchment of authoritarianism,
the [second challenge to current order stems from]{.underline} the
**[exacerbation of nationalism]{.underline}**. One of the [underlying
tensions of the current order exists between states seeking]{.underline}
to [assert their agency against the seemingly inexorable and
homogenizing forces of **globalization**]{.underline} [promoted by
the]{.underline} **[liberal order]{.underline}**. [States refuse to be
hollowed out by the globalizing forces and seek to assert their
authority and legitimacy]{.underline} both within their territorial
boundaries and in transnational processes. [Nationalism has been a tool
for modern states]{.underline} to [legitimize their power at home and
position themselves in the international arena]{.underline}. Besides its
linkage to language and symbolism, nationalism is "a sociopolitical
movement and an ideology of the nation" \[69\]. The pandemic provides
fertile ground for nationalism to thrive in both democratic and
authoritarian countries, as states reclaim their place and authority
left by the retreat of globalizing forces. [With help from nationalist
and populist politicians]{.underline}, **[nationalism has blended with
populism]{.underline}** and authoritarianism and become stronger in both
democratic and authoritarian hosts.

Confronted with the pandemic, many [countries]{.underline} **[rushed to
fend for themselves]{.underline}** [instead of joining together in
**multilateral efforts**.]{.underline} State leaders worldwide
unilaterally closed borders, restricted incoming travelers, grappled
with solutions to meet their own soaring demands for medical supplies,
and prepared to fix their damaged economies. [States have reasserted
their roles in responding to crises]{.underline}, **[guarding their
sovereignty,]{.underline}** and managing their own economies in the
uncertain times, [while]{.underline} the globalizing forces promoted by
the **[current order are in the retreat]{.underline}**. [The
self-serving calculations of]{.underline} **[national
interests]{.underline}**, in both political and economic spheres,
[have]{.underline} **[dominated many leaders' thinking]{.underline}**
since the outbreak of the pandemic and are [likely to **continue
influencing policymaking**]{.underline} [in the post-pandemic
struggle]{.underline} for recovery. The [exacerbation of
nationalism]{.underline} has **[eroded the popularity and authority of
international institutions]{.underline}** that buttress the principle of
multilateralism and the seemly unstoppable forces of globalization
promoted by the current order. It also pushes states to make choices
that are most aligned with their national interests, from both material
and ideological perspectives.

As Walt argues, "The [pandemic will **strengthen the state and reinforce
nationalism**]{.underline}" \[7\]. Bieber observes that [even before the
pandemic]{.underline}, excl**[usionary nationalism mixed with far-right
politics]{.underline}** and populism [had already **overshadowed major
countries**]{.underline} around the world. The pandemic reinforces
nationalism in several important ways: a "[marriage" between nationalism
and authoritarianism, bias against others]{.underline} (including ethnic
minorities and other marginalized groups) presumed to be associated with
the pandemic, and the [rise of deglobalization and
anti-globalization]{.underline} \[70\]. These changes will likely
reinforce existing nationalistic dynamics. These dynamics are evident
during the pandemic at both state and society levels, as well as in both
democratic and autocratic settings, as exemplified by the developments
in the United States and China. Both countries have been involved in
escalated "narrative battle" powered by nationalism \[71\].

[In the United States]{.underline}, **[controversial
labels]{.underline}**, from the "Chinese Virus" to the "Kung Flu", were
[disseminated by]{.underline} President [Trump]{.underline} as state
leaders tried to find a scapegoat to blame for their own failures in
responding to the pandemic. Even after the Administration wasted nearly
two months responding to the crisis, many [politicians were quick to
defend Trump:]{.underline} "We don't blame Trump, we blame China."
Senator Lindsey Graham claimed that the Chinese government was
responsible for all American deaths \[72\]. Only a few days later, the
U.S. intelligence and national security officials said that the U.S.
government was exploring the possibility that the coronavirus leaked
from a lab in Wuhan \[73\]. Trump and the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
soon joined the chorus. They ignored the assessments made by many
scientists and weaponized the coronavirus for political purpose. [Both
the Republican Party and the Democratic Party continued to blame
China]{.underline} in an attempt to maximize their appeal to the voters
and increase their odds of winning the 2020 election \[74\].

[While the state leaders in the US were pandering to a **nationalist
base**]{.underline}, [xenophobic sentiment surged across the
country.]{.underline} Within just four weeks (March 19--April 15), at
least 1497 incidents of coronavirus-related discrimination targeting
Chinese and other groups of Asian origins were reported in the United
States. These incidents included verbal harassment, refusal of services,
and even physical assault \[75\]. The Pew Research Center also found
that negative views of China had risen to its highest point since the
center started collecting data on Americans' views of China in 2005.
About two-thirds (66%) of American adults had a negative view of the
country, a significant increase of 20 percentage points since Trump took
office \[76\].

[In China]{.underline}, **[nationalist strategies were also
used]{.underline}** at the state level. Early in the outbreak, [the
United States was blamed by China]{.underline} for its [failure to
provide sincere and substantive support toward China]{.underline} and
for its overaction by raising its travel advisory level, bringing
American citizens back, and blocking Chinese visitors. Later, the U.S.
military was accused of intentionally spreading the virus in Wuhan, a
theory promoted by Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson for China's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs \[77\]. Moreover, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
announced its decision to expel American journalists working for The New
York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, further
fueling nationalist sentiment in China.

Likewise, the Chinese people's views of the United States drastically
declined during the pandemic. Before the United States stepped up its
efforts to shift the blame toward China, a survey by the Eurasia Group
Foundation (February 15--March 3) found that [China had witnessed the
starkest decline among ten countries in their views toward the United
States and American democracy.]{.underline} Favorable views of the
United States decreased by nearly 20 percent as negative views increased
by 11%, compared to a 2019 report. Positive views of American democracy
also declined by 15%. About half of the respondents believed that the
United States had made the world a worse place in the past 20 years
\[78\]. An article published by a Chinese nationalist tabloid reported
that Chinese people had seen the harm of U.S. hegemony and the darker
side of democracy \[79\].

Politicians from both sides are playing a dangerous game by exploiting
the nationalistic feelings in their respective societies to serve their
own political agendas. Both sides have politicized the coronavirus and
related scientific researches, further rousing animosity between the two
countries. Beyond these two cases, **[many other nationalist and
populist leaders around the world]{.underline}** [have sought to decry
globalization]{.underline} and "others". The [pandemic has given them
the weapon they need]{.underline}. While Trump proclaimed on Twitter,
"We need the wall more than ever!", France's rightist National Rally
party's leader Le Pen blamed "the religion of borderlessness" for the
virus outbreak. During the pandemic, state leaders and political parties
in Hungary, India, Germany, Italy, and Spain have targeted ethnic
minorities and other marginalized groups \[67, 80--83\]. Foreign workers
and F1 students were the latest victims of current U.S. administration's
populist and nationalist strategies \[84, 85\].

In the last decade[, the world has witnessed the rise of **nationalist
and populist leaders**]{.underline} in national and subnational politics
[throughout many regions]{.underline} \[86--88\]. The [pandemic enables
these leaders to rally their supporters]{.underline} and
[attack]{.underline} what they see as **[the illusion of
solidarity]{.underline}** between nations and the failure of
international institutions, including the European Union and the World
Health Organization (WHO). Moreover, states' recalculations of national
interests are likely to reinforce their appeals because the pandemic has
exposed the risk and vulnerability of global dependency regarding the
supply chains and strategic resources. As a result, the pandemic will
likely prompt a renationalization of production and transform global
integration to a more limited form that is oriented toward regional and
bilateral engagements \[89\].

[Even in Europe]{.underline}, the region that serves as "the proof that
human society was becoming transnational, transcending its national

globalization has declined]{.underline}**. As [we witness the "universal
reversion to **nationalist policies and defense of particularistic
national interests**]{.underline} [at the expense of **transnational
solidarity**"]{.underline}, [international institutions are **more
likely to suffer from the pandemic**]{.underline} \[90\]. The pandemic
has given "a political gift for nativist nationalists and
protectionists" and will have long-term impact on many aspects of
globalization, including the free movement of people and goods \[91\].
States are able to reclaim their place and assert their authority and
legitimacy within their territorial boundaries and in transnational
processes. [As politicians]{.underline} in both democracies and

#### \[x\] \-\-- [globalization]{.underline} and [populist backlash]{.underline}

**Mearsheimer 19** (John J, President and Fellows of Harvard College and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "Bound to Fail: The Rise and
Fall of the Liberal International Order," International Security, Volume
43, Issue 4, Spring 2019)

SUMMARY The various causal processes described above have all played an
important role in subverting the liberal international order. Although
each one has a distinct logic, they have often operated synergistically.
For example, [the negative effects of
**[hyperglobalization]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the lower and middle
classes [have combined with]{.underline} the **[nationalist
resentment]{.underline}** over immigration [[and]{.mark} the sense of
**[lost sovereignty]{.mark}** to [fuel]{.mark} a strong **[populist
backlash]{.mark}** against]{.underline} the principles and practices of
the [liberal order]{.underline}. Indeed, that anger has often been
directed at the liberal elites who have benefited from the order and who
vigorously defend it. [[That]{.mark} resentment]{.underline}, of course,
has had significant political consequences. It [has [caused]{.mark} deep
political divisions]{.underline} [in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and other Western democracies, led to
[Brexit]{.mark}, helped put [Trump]{.mark} in the White House,
[and]{.mark} fueled support for [nationalist leaders]{.mark} around the
world]{.underline}. Where Are We Headed? One might acknowledge that
[[the l]{.underline}]{.mark}iberal [[i]{.underline}]{.mark}nternational
[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}rder [[is in **terminal
decline**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but argue that it can be replaced with a
more pragmatic version, one that avoids the excesses of the post--Cold
War order.85 This more modest liberal order would pursue a more nuanced,
less aggressive approach to spreading liberal democracy, rein in
hyperglobalization, and put some significant limits on the power of
international institutions. The new order, according to this
perspective, would look something like the Western order during the Cold
War, although it would be global and liberal, not bounded and realist.
This solution is not feasible, however, because **[[the unipolar moment
is over]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [which means [there is **no
chance**]{.mark} of maintaining **any kind** of liberal international
order]{.underline} for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, President
[Trump has no intention of pursuing a \"liberal-lite\" world order, and
without his support, that option is a nonstarter]{.underline}. But
**[even if Trump were not an obstacle]{.underline}** and the
international system were to remain unipolar, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would **fail**]{.underline} [if it lowered its
sights and attempted to construct a less ambitious liberal
order]{.underline}. Indeed, [it would end up building an **agnostic**
international order instead. It is **impossible** to build [a meaningful
liberal global order]{.mark} with modest or more passive
policies]{.underline}. [The enterprise [requires **too much social
engineering**]{.mark} in **too many places**]{.underline}. [If it has
any chance of succeeding]{.underline} (I think it has none), [the
liberal unipole and its allies must relentlessly pursue highly ambitious
global policies]{.underline}, which is why the United States and its
liberal partners acted the way they did in the wake of the Cold War.
[That approach]{.underline}, however, [is [now **politically
infeasible** because of past failures]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Consequently, the liberal democracies have no choice but to take small
steps here and there to remake the world in their own image, while
adopting a live and let live approach toward most countries in the
world. That humble approach would effectively produce an agnostic order.
But that is not going to happen, because the system is multipolar and
great power politics are once again at play. Thus, the key question is:
What kinds of realist orders will dominate the landscape in the new
multipolar world? THE NEW REALIST ORDERS [There are likely to be
three]{.underline} different [realist orders in the]{.underline}
foreseeable [future: a thin international order and]{.underline} two
thick bounded orders---[one [led by China]{.mark}, [the other by the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates.
[The]{.underline} emerging [thin international order will be
concerned]{.underline} mainly [with overseeing arms control]{.underline}
agreements [and making the global economy work]{.underline} efficiently.
[It is]{.underline} also [likely to pay more serious
attention]{.underline} than in the past [to]{.underline} problems
relating to [climate change]{.underline}. In essence, the institutions
that make up the international order will focus on facilitating
interstate cooperation. [The two bounded orders]{.underline}, in
contrast, [will be]{.underline} concerned principally with [[waging
security competition]{.underline}]{.mark} against each other,
**[although]{.underline}** [that [will call for]{.mark}]{.underline}
promoting **[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [among the members of
each order]{.underline}. There will be significant economic and military
[[competition]{.underline}]{.mark} between those two orders that [[will
need to be **managed**]{.mark}, which is why **they will be thick
orders**]{.underline}. Two key features of the new multipolar world will
profoundly shape the emerging orders. First, assuming that China
continues its impressive rise, it will be involved in an intense
[security competition]{.underline} with the United States that will be
the central feature of international politics over the course of the
twenty-first century. That rivalry [will lead to the creation of bounded
orders dominated by China and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Military alliances will be core components of
those two orders, which are now beginning to form and will resemble the
Soviet-led and U.S.-led orders in the Cold War. [[Beijing and
Washington]{.mark}, however, **[will]{.mark}**]{.underline} sometimes
[**[have reasons to cooperate]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}]{.mark}
[select military issues]{.underline}, an endeavor that will fall within
the purview of the international order, as it did during the Cold War.
Again, the focus will be principally on [[arms
control]{.underline}]{.mark} agreements and will involve Russia as well
as China and the United States. The existing [treaties and
agreements]{.underline} dealing with proliferation [are likely to remain
in place, because all three great powers will want [to limit the spread
of nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. But Beijing, Moscow, and
Washington will have to negotiate new treaties limiting their arsenals,
as the superpowers did during the Cold War.86 Nevertheless, the U.S.-led
and Chinese-led bounded orders will be largely responsible for dealing
with core security matters.

The [planet is in the throes of]{.underline} an **[environmental
emergency]{.underline}**. Humanity's continued addiction to fossil fuels
and its [voracious appetite for natural resources]{.underline} **[have
led to runaway climate change]{.underline}**, degraded vital ecosystems,
and ushered in the slow death of the world's oceans. Earth's biosphere
is breaking down. Our depredation of the planet has jeopardized our own
survival.

Given these risks, it is shocking that [the multilateral system **has
failed to respond more forcefully**]{.underline} and has
[instead]{.underline} merely **[tinkered at the margins]{.underline}**.
[Although]{.underline} the [United States and the European Union have
adopted measures to slow the pac]{.underline}e of global warming---by
setting more aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets, for
example---**[nothing guarantees that they will adhere to those
pledges]{.underline}**, and such [steps]{.underline} [do little to
encourage decarbonization in]{.underline} China, India, and [other major
emitters]{.underline}. These efforts also fail to address other facets
of the looming catastrophe, not least collapsing biodiversity.

The [natural world obeys no sovereign boundaries,]{.underline} and
neither does the worsening ecological crisis. It is t[ime to take bold
steps to overcome the disconnect **between an international system
divided into 195 independent countries**]{.underline}, each operating
according to its own imperatives, [and a global calamity that cannot be
resolved in a piecemeal fashio]{.underline}n. It is time to govern the
world as if the earth mattered. What the world needs is a paradigm shift
in U.S. foreign policy and international relations---a shift that is
rooted in ecological realism and that moves cooperation on shared
environmental threats to center stage. Call this new worldview
"planetary politics." All governments, starting with Washington, must
designate the survival of the biosphere as a core national interest and
a central objective of national and international security---and
organize and invest accordingly.

it [would not preclude]{.underline} **[many current forms of

**[extensive trade, investment, collaboration on vital transnational

In their statement, China and Russia achieved peak hypocrisy. But the

already been failing. [The free world's leader]{.underline}s had [long

[over]{.underline} the **[real action needed to safeguard]{.underline}**
[the planet from **crises**]{.underline}. [They **expanded NATO**

[disengaged]{.underline} **[from practical deeds]{.underline}**, [even

and]{.underline} **[neglected international institutions]{.underline}**

years of this century to improve global **[health and human development

### AT: China LIO Bad

#### \*China is also committed to a rules-based order\-\--their argument is [US hypocrisy]{.underline}

**Walt 21 ---** Stephen Walt. "China Wants a 'Rules-Based International
Order,' Too" Foreign Policy. March 31^st^, 2021
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/03/31/china-wants-a-rules-based-international-order-too/>
WMK

But the [distinction between the United States']{.underline} supposed
[commitment to a system of rules and China's alleged lack
thereof]{.underline} **[is misleading]{.underline}** in at least three
ways. First, it [overlooks]{.underline} the [United States']{.underline}
own **[willingness to ignore, evade, or rewrite the rules]{.underline}**
[whenever they seem inconvenient]{.underline}. If we are honest with
ourselves, we have to acknowledge that [Washington]{.underline}
sometimes [thinks it is **perfectly okay for might to make right and for
winners to take all.**]{.underline} The [collapse of the Soviet Union,
when the United States took full advantage of a weakened post-Soviet
Russia]{.underline}, is a perfect example.

Second, as Harvard University's Alastair Iain Johnston has shown, [China
**accepts and even defends**]{.underline} many [principles of the
existing order]{.underline}, although of course not all of them. That
situation may change in the future, of course, but [even a vastly more
powerful China]{.underline} would **[undoubtedly seek to
retain]{.underline}** whatever **[features of the present
order]{.underline}** serve its interests.

Third, [statements]{.underline} such as Blinken's imply that abandoning
[today's rules-based order would leave us in a lawless, rule-free world
of naked power politics]{.underline}, unregulated by any norms or
principles whatsoever. This is **[simply not the case]{.underline}**:
Scholars of widely varying views understand that [all international
orders]{.underline}---global, regional, liberal, realist, or
whatever---require **[a set of rules to manage the various interactions
that inevitably arise between different polities.]{.underline}**

Examples can be found throughout the international relations literature:
44 years ago, theorist Hedley Bull defined an "international society" as
"a group of states ... bound by a set of common rules" and the
University of Chicago professor John Mearsheimer recently referred to
international orders as "an organized group of international
institutions," which he says "are effectively rules that the great
powers devise and agree to follow." The statesman Henry Kissinger argues
that [all world orders rest on a "set of commonly accepted
rules"]{.underline} and the Princeton University professor G. John
Ikenberry's many works on the U.S.-led "liberal" order all emphasize its
"rules-based character." The political scientists Beth Simmons and Hein
Goemans agree, writing, "[any intergroup order must be defined by rules
of group membership and ... political authority]{.underline}." Even
skeptics of the liberal order, such as the scholar Patrick Porter,
acknowledge the role that rules played within that system, while
emphasizing how [the United States has used its superior
power]{.underline} to **[compel other states to comply with the rules it
prefers.]{.underline}**

In short, the issue is not the United States' preference for a
"rules-based" order and China's alleged lack of interest in it; rather,
the issue is who will determine which rules pertain where. Or as the
Rand Corp.'s Michael Mazarr recently put it, "At its core, the United
States and China are competing to shape the foundational global
system---the essential ideas, habits, and expectations that govern
international politics. It is ultimately a competition of norms,
narratives, and legitimacy."

The differences between the American and Chinese conceptions are
relatively straightforward. The United States (generally) prefers a
multilateral system (albeit one with special privileges for some states,
especially itself) that is at least somewhat mindful of individual
rights and certain core liberal values (democratic rule, individual
freedom, rule of law, market-based economies, and so on). These ideals
may be applied imperfectly at home and pursued inconsistently abroad,
but the U.S. commitment to them is not just empty rhetoric. Among other
things, it underpins U.S. efforts to persuade or compel other states to
alter their own domestic arrangements. Not surprisingly, the United
States also likes many existing institutions (the IMF, NATO, the World
Bank, the reserve role of the dollar, to name a few) because they give
the United States greater influence.

By contrast, [China]{.underline} favors a more Westphalian conception of
[order]{.underline}, one where state sovereignty and noninterference are
paramount and liberal notions of individual rights are downplayed if not
entirely dismissed. This vision is no less "rules-based" than the United
States', insofar as it draws on parts of the United Nations charter, and
it [would not preclude]{.underline} **[many current forms of
international cooperation]{.underline}**, [including]{.underline}
**[extensive trade, investment, collaboration on vital transnational
issues such as climate change.]{.underline}** [China is also a **vocal

sometimes violates existing multilateral norms. Nonetheless, a world in
which China's preferences prevailed would be different than one in which
the U.S. vision proved to be more influential.

But this [policy mantra]{.underline} has two fundamental problems: it
**[mischaracterizes China's strategic intentions]{.underline}** in the
region, [and]{.underline} it [is based on a U.S. strategic objective
that is]{.underline} probably **[no longer achievable]{.underline}**.
[First, [China is pursuing **heg**]{.mark}emony in East Asia, [but
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} an [**exclusive [hostile
heg]{.mark}emony**. It is not trying to]{.underline} **[extrude the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [from the region or deny

[indicated receptivity to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[peaceful
coexistence]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline} **[overlapping
spheres of influence]{.underline}** [with the **U**]{.underline}nited

on**]{.underline} its [**neighbors**, [and]{.mark} it [does not seek to
**obstruct**]{.mark} **commercial [f]{.mark}**reedom]{.underline}
[**[o]{.mark}**f **[n]{.mark}**avigation]{.underline} [in the
region]{.underline} (because [no country is more dependent on freedom of
the seas than China itself]{.underline}). [In short, Beijing wants to
extend its power and influence within East Asia, but]{.underline} **[not
as part of a "winner-take-all" contest]{.underline}**. [China does have
unsettled and vexing sovereignty claims over Taiwan]{.underline}, most
of the islands and other features in the East and South China Seas, and
their adjacent waters. [Al**[though]{.mark}** Beijing has demonstrated a
**[willing]{.mark}**ness [to use force]{.mark} in defense or pursuit of
these claims, it is **[not looking for excuses]{.mark}** to do so.
Whether these disputes can be managed or resolved in a way that is
mutually acceptable to the relevant parties]{.underline} and consistent
with U.S. interests in the region [is an open, long-term question. But
that possibility should not be ruled out on the basis
of]{.underline}---or made more difficult by---[**false assumptions of
irreconcilable interests**. On the contrary, it should be pursued on the
basis of a recognition that **[all]{.mark} the parties [want to avoid
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}---and that the sovereignty disputes in
the region ultimately are not military problems requiring military
solutions. And since Washington has never been opposed in principle to
reunification between China and Taiwan as long as it is peaceful, and
similarly takes no position on the ultimate sovereignty of the other
disputed features, their long-term disposition need not be the litmus
test of either U.S. or Chinese hegemony in the region. [Of course, China
would prefer not to have forward-deployed U.S. military
forces]{.underline} in the Western Pacific that could be used against
it, [but [Beijing]{.mark} has]{.underline} **[long
tolerated]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} arguably [could]{.underline}
**[[indefinitely tolerate]{.underline}]{.mark}** [an American [military
presence]{.mark} in the region---unless that presence is]{.underline}
clearly and exclusively **[aimed at coercing]{.underline}** or
containing **[China]{.underline}**. It is also true that Beijing
disagrees with American principles of military freedom of navigation in
the region; and this constitutes a significant challenge in waters where
China claims territorial jurisdiction in violation of the UN Commission
on the Law of the Sea. But this should not be conflated with a Chinese
desire or intention to exclusively "control" all the waters within the
first island chain in the Western Pacific. The Chinese almost certainly
recognize that exclusive control or "domination" of the neighborhood is
not achievable at any reasonable cost, and that pursuing it would be
counterproductive by inviting pushback and challenges that would negate
the objective. So what would [Chinese "hegemony" in East
Asia]{.underline} mean or look like? Beijing probably thinks in terms of
something [much like American primacy in the Western Hemisphere: a model
in which China is generally recognized and acknowledged as the de facto
central or primary power in the region, but has little need or incentive
for]{.underline} **[militarily adventurism]{.underline}** [because
the]{.underline} mutual **[benefits of [economic interdependence
prevail]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the neighbors have no reason---and
inherent disincentives---to challenge China's vital interests or
security. And as a parallel to China's economic and diplomatic
engagement in Latin America, Beijing would neither exclude nor be
hostile to continued U.S. engagement in East Asia. [A
standard]{.underline} **[counterargument]{.underline}** to this
relatively benign scenario [is [that Beijing would **not be
content**]{.mark}]{.underline} with it for long because China's
strategic ambitions will expand as its capabilities grow. [This is a
valid]{.underline} [**hypothesis**, but it usually [overlooks]{.mark}
the greater possibility [that]{.mark} China's [external
ambitions]{.mark} will [expand]{.mark} **not because**]{.underline} its
[**inherent capabilities have grown**, but because Beijing sees the need
to be more assertive [in **response to external challenges**]{.mark}
**to Chinese**]{.underline} interests or [**security**. Indeed, much of
China's "assertiveness" within East Asia [over the **past
decade**]{.mark}]{.underline}---when Beijing probably would prefer to
focus on domestic priorities---[has been a]{.underline} **[reaction
to]{.underline}** such **[perceived challenges]{.underline}**.
Accordingly, Beijing's willingness to settle for a narrowly-defined,
peaceable version of regional preeminence will depend heavily on whether
it perceives other countries---especially the United States---as trying
to deny China this option and instead obstruct Chinese interests or
security in the region.

[The]{.underline} popular '[Thucydides trap']{.underline} argument and
power transition theory in IR [suggest]{.underline} that a [war is more
likely to take place between a rising power and a ruling state when
their power gap narrow]{.underline}s during the international order
transition (Allison, 2017; Organski, 1958). I argue that [this argument
is **too deterministic and pessimistic**]{.underline} for two reasons.
[First]{.underline}, **[nuclear deterrence]{.underline}** [based
on]{.underline} the '**[mutual assured destruction']{.underline}** logic
among great powers [will make direct military conflicts]{.underline}
**[unthinkable]{.underline}**, if not impossible. Second, [the world has
been **fundamentally** changed by the **deepening globalization and
integrated supply chains**]{.underline}. Although some politicians in
the United States advocate the 'decoupling' with China, it is a
politically motivated rhetoric rather than a well-crafted strategy
(Farrell & Newman, 2020). As David Ignatius points out, '[the United
States and China have an increasingly competitive
relationship,]{.underline} **[but they need each othe]{.underline}**r,
too, like conjoined twins. Hasty [attempts at separation]{.underline}
**[could harm them both]{.underline}**. Open research made U.S.
technology great; making it more difficult for the best brains to live
and work here would be folly' (Ignatius, 2020). [In other words, it will
be much harder, more painful, and harmful for the United States and
China to **decouple**]{.underline} from one another, economically and
technologically.

Then the question is: how will the United States and China compete or
'fight' without war when the power disparity continues to narrow between
the two nations during the international order transition? In this paper
I introduce a new '[institutional peace']{.underline} argument, which
suggests that the [future international order transition]{.underline}
**[will not feature a military conflict]{.underline}** between the
United States and China, [although diplomatic standoffs and even
military tensions might take place more frequently]{.underline} than
before. Institutional competition and conflicts among great powers will
become a new game (though not the only game) in town during the period
of international order transition. Consequently, these institutional
dynamics will generate incremental change that may lead to a more
peaceful international order transition.

The 'institutional peace' argument presumes that [deepening
globalization]{.underline} and the [existing nuclear deterrence
situation]{.underline} have **[changed the nature of international order
transition]{.underline}**. [Both the United States and China, as nuclear
powers, will do their best to compete for power and
influence]{.underline}, but at the same time, th**[ey will avoid direct
military conflicts because a nuclear showdown will not only destroy
their adversaries, but themselves]{.underline}** as well. Therefore,
international institutions, one pillar of the international order,2 will
become the focal point of competition among great powers, especially
between the United States and China, during the order transition.

Challenging a popular view that China's rise will lead the United States
and China to fall into the 'Thucydides trap'---a possible hegemonic war
between the two---this paper argues that the [international order
transition]{.underline} **[will be different this time]{.underline}**.
[Instead of using military means to change the international

institutional balancing **strategies to compete**]{.underline} with one
another f[or an advantageous position in the future international
order.]{.underline} Institutional [competition]{.underline} in the form
of institutional balancing among great powers [will strengthen the
dynamics and utility of international institutions, encourage states to
offer new public goods, and eventually ensure a more **peaceful order
transition**]{.underline} in the international system.

Since the end of the Cold War, China and the United States have engaged
in institutional balancing in both economic and security orders in the
Asia Pacific. By targeting US domination and existing rules in global
finance institutions, [China's AIIB initiative]{.underline} has
[encouraged]{.underline} some [intense]{.underline} **[but healthy
institutional competition]{.underline}** in the arena of global
infrastructure finance. [Through multilateral cooperation with the ASEAN
states]{.underline} in the ARF and ASEAN-dominated institutions, [China
has also challenged the legitimacy and dominating role of the US-led
hub-]{.underline}and-spokes bilateral system in the regional security
architecture. One unintended consequence of institutional balancing
between the United States and China is the proliferation of multilateral
security institutions, such as the SLD, the ADMM-Plus, and the revival
of the Quad 2.0 in the region. The AIIB and ARF cases have shown that
the international order transition led by institutional balancing might
be more peaceful than previously perceived.

Two caveats, however, are worth noting to support this optimistic view
of the international order transition. The first one is that the [MAD
logic of nuclear deterrence **should remain valid** among great
powers.]{.underline} Interdependence based on the mutual vulnerability
in the context of nuclear weapons was the key factor
[making]{.underline} the [antagonism]{.underline} between the United
States and the Soviet Union **[remain 'cold']{.underline}** during the
Cold War. Given the technological innovations in military weaponry, it
becomes questionable whether nuclear deterrence will still be sustained
between the United States and China (Christensen, 2012; Glaser & Fetter,
2016; Lieber & Press, 2006; Lieber & Press, 2017; Wu, 2020). As some
scholars point out, institutional competition among states might 'lock
in an unjust status quo, produce exclusion, or generate grievances that
turn into struggles, they may in fact induce conflictual change' (Mérand
& Pouliot, 2020, p. 129). If one side no longer believes in MAD,
military force will become a legitimate mechanism to change the
international order, and therefore, a hegemonic war cannot be ruled out.

It is worth noting that Asia is an inherently dangerous place. Soon
after the Cold War, some scholars predicted that Asia was 'ripe for
rivalry' because of the mounting territorial disputes as well as
bourgeoning nationalism (Friedberg, 1993). The 1995--1996 Taiwan Strait
crisis almost triggered a military conflict between China and the United
States. The Taiwan issue might be the most likely reason for China and
the United States to go to war in the future. The nuclear tests and
missile crises ignited by North Korea remind us that the Cold War has
not ended on the Korean Peninsula. The maritime and territorial disputes
in the East China Sea and the South China Sea have damaged China's
relations and trust with its neighbors. During the coming international
order transition effective nuclear deterrence might prevent China and
the United States from fighting a direct war or a hegemonic war;
however, it will not stop conventional military conflicts among regional
actors or even proxy wars between the United States and China if these
security flashpoints are not managed and controlled well (Taylor, 2018).
International and regional institutions can potentially help to build
trust and alleviate these regional tensions among states. However, in
order to make 'institutional peace' work, the [United States and
China]{.underline}---as two nuclear powers in the region---[need to
reach a strategic consensus, which is to compete fiercely by 'all
measures short of war]{.underline}' (Wright, 2017).

[There is a]{.underline} **[positive sign]{.underline}** that the
[militaries]{.underline} from the United States and China have [remained
rational **under the logic of MAD**]{.underline}. It has been reported
that [General Mark Milley]{.underline}, the Chairman of US Joint Chiefs,
[was seriously worried that Trump might 'go rogue']{.underline} and even
[launch a nuclear war]{.underline} in the final days of his presidency.
More importantly, some US intelligence reports showed that 'the [Chinese
believed the United States was going to attack them]{.underline}'
(Woodward & Costa, 2021, p. 128). [In order to]{.underline}
**[deescalate]{.underline}** a possible [military conflict]{.underline}
or even a nuclear war, Milley [secretly called]{.underline} his [Chinese
counterpart]{.underline}, General Li Zuocheng, on October 30, 2020, four
days before the election, to [assuage]{.underline} Chinese
[concerns]{.underline} that the [US was planning to attack China.
In]{.underline} his own words, Milley said,

General Li, I want to assure you that **[the American government is
stable]{.underline}** and everything is going to be okay. [We are not
going to **attack**]{.underline} or conduct any kinetic operations
against you .... there's going to be tension. And I am going to be
communicating with you pretty regularly ... We're not going to have a
fight. General Li said 'Okay. I take you at your word'.(Woodward &
Costa, 2021, pp. 128--130)

It is clear that [both the US and Chinese military leaders are **fully
aware**]{.underline} [of the catastrophic consequence of **military
conflicts**]{.underline} between the two nations. Nevertheless, civil
politicians in both states might still play with fire to escalate
bilateral tensions for political gains in the future. Interestingly, the
[military]{.underline} in both nations might **[play a 'peace-guardian'
role in avoiding a war]{.underline}**, particularly a nuclear one,
between the two nations.

#### [Empirics]{.underline} and [theory]{.underline}\-\--transition doesn't cause war UNLESS China is [excluded]{.underline} from the international order

**Shifrinson 20 ---** Joshua Shifrinson is an Assistant Professor of
International Relations at Boston University. Joshua Shifrinson (2020)
The rise of China, balance of power theory and US national security:
Reasons for optimism?, Journal of Strategic Studies, 43:2, 175-216, DOI:
10.1080/01402390.2018.1558056 WMK

[Despite]{.underline} the [prevalence of]{.underline} these
[assumptions]{.underline}, however, [there are]{.underline} both
**[empirical and theoretical reasons]{.underline}** [to question whether
rising states]{.underline} are **[prone to prey upon declining
states.]{.underline}** Few studies examine the evolution of rising state
attitudes towards declining states.18 That said, [a]{.underline}
**[large literature]{.underline}** exa[mining the relationship between
**power shifts**]{.underline} and war -- an outcome one might expect if
rising states were primed to challenge declining states19 --
[finds]{.underline} **[only a tenuous link between shifts in the
distribution of power and conflict]{.underline}**.20 Rather, this
research suggests that [only rising states '**dissatisfied' with the
existing international order**]{.underline} and holding 'revisionist'
attitudes [are prone to challenge declining states and provoke
conflict.]{.underline}21 [Otherwise, rising states tend to pursue
policies that]{.underline} **[do not result in war22]{.underline}** and
may even try to avoid courting conflict.23

Similarly, [even in cases where rising states notionally hold
revisionist]{.underline} or dissatisfied [preferences]{.underline}, it
is amb[iguous whether such attitudes drive rising state strategies
towards particular declining states.]{.underline} Not only do notionally
revisionist actors often seek allies among the existing great powers --
meaning that they may cooperate with decliners to court them as partners
-- but rising state strategies towards decliners do not always align
with judgments of risers' intentions and motives.24 For instance,
Wilhelmine Germany -- a state seen by many scholars as a prototypical
dissatisfied, revisionist actor -- nevertheless supported
Austria-Hungary before 1914; likewise, a surging and equally revisionist
Soviet Union still attempted to align with the United Kingdom after
World War Two.25 In short, [not only is there an incomplete link between
rising state preferences and conflict]{.underline} during a power shift,
[but risers' revisionist or dissatisfied proclivities do not determine
the more focused policies used to guide their relations with declining
states.]{.underline}

More importantly, [there are also]{.underline} **[theoretical
reasons]{.underline}** [rooted in balance of power realism to
question]{.underline} whether [rising states are inveterate
predators]{.underline}. To be clear, 'balance of power realism' is not a
single theory so much as a family of arguments that are themselves
divided over when and why states compete by manipulating the
distribution of power.26 Nevertheless, as a group, balance of power
theory is driven by core understandings that (1) states are the primary
actors in international affairs, with the great powers the most
important among this set; (2) to obtain security -- whether defined in
terms of minimising threats to their survival, aggregating power, or
other objectives -- states tend to offset and oppose one another; (3)
opposition -- including the possible resort to force -- tends to grow
more intense the more another state is seen as particularly powerful or
threatening; and (4) states carry out this opposition by balancing and
aggregating capabilities by arming themselves (internal balancing)
and/or forming alliances (external balancing).27

Although different iterations of balance of power theory carry different
assumptions as to the frequency and intensity of balancing, the approach
as a whole underlines two reasons why [rising states]{.underline} **[may
avoid preying upon decliners]{.underline}** and -- under certain
conditions -- engage in supportive strategies. First, [states threatened
by another actor can arm, ally and threaten war to protect
themselves]{.underline}.28 Hence, rising [powers that challenge their
relatively declining peer]{.underline}s are **[apt to provoke
counterbalancing]{.underline}**.29 In fact, ris[ing states that expand
precipitousl]{.underline}y and overtly threaten declining states ma[y
catalyse a significant counterbalancing coalition]{.underline}, court
insecurity spirals with threatened rivals, and even [encourage one or
more declining states to lash out]{.underline} in a preventive
conflict.30 [Rising states are therefore incentivised to anticipate
these dangers]{.underline}, **[cap their foreign
ambitions]{.underline}** and **[limit the risk of
counterbalancing]{.underline}** so long as other states can penalise
their aggrandisement.

3\. How about [the [US pulling out of multilateral
organisations]{.mark}]{.underline}, will there be a power vacuum that
might appeal to another county like China?

**[There [might not be a]{.mark}]{.underline}**s much of a
**[[vacuum]{.mark} as we fear]{.underline}**. For example, [you have
multilateral organisations such as the [African
Union]{.mark}]{.underline}, you have the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations \[[[ASEAN]{.underline}]{.mark}\]. [You have]{.underline},
perhaps not the western dedication to human rights, but
[[attempt]{.underline}]{.mark}s for peace harmony and
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}. So, you may not have a normative
commitment to democracy, but one for the commitment to peace. These
other models for peace, gives them a chance of developing sustainable
mechanisms. I'm not trying to gloat over US withdrawal, but in a sense,
I am. Now you get different parts of the world which have a chance, even
though it might be messy and embroiled with conflict. **[[There's no
reason to believe]{.mark} that the [withdrawal of the US will lead to
power vacuum]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but **[actually]{.underline}**
might [[give developing powers]{.mark}]{.underline} a chance to regain
[[normal life]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example Afghanistan. [[West
Asia]{.mark} had its own civilisation for 1000s of years, it
[had]{.mark} communities and sophisticated [mechanisms]{.mark}, [much
better then]{.mark} the [alternative]{.mark} conflicts that the [West
brought]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [withdrawal of the
l]{.mark}]{.underline}iberal [[i]{.underline}]{.mark}nternational
[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}rder might actually [[allow for]{.mark} the
[return of peace]{.mark}]{.underline} for them. Today, in a lecture on
South Asia, I was showing Afghanistan in the 1970s, society was
peaceful, people could go to schools, women wore skirts while walking
down streets of Kabul. Not to say that wearing miniskirts is an
indication of development, but the point is that [people were living
normal lives as human beings]{.underline}. This was [before Afghanistan
was sought to be brought into the 'liberal world order',]{.underline}
before the invasion into Afghanistan which had been brought about by
US-backed mujahedin. To answer your question, [[withdrawal]{.mark} of
the 'liberal world order', or the US]{.underline} so to speak, [from
multilateral organisations [may]{.mark} just [be the **best thing**

## LIO Good

### 1ac -- Harari

#### LIO collapse causes [extinction]{.underline}\-\--rogue tech, bio arms-racing, and climate change. 

**Harari '18** \[Yuval; September 26; Professor of History at Hebrew
University of Jerusalem; \"We need a post-liberal order now,\"
https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/26/we-need-a-post-liberal-order-now\]

[If the **liberal order is collapsing**, what new kind of global order
might [replace]{.mark} it?]{.underline} So far, [those who challenge
[the liberal order]{.mark}]{.underline} do so mainly on a national
level. They have many ideas about how to advance the interests of their
particular country, but they [don't have a viable vision for how the
world as a whole should function]{.underline}. For example, Russian
nationalism can be a reasonable guide for running the affairs of Russia,
but Russian nationalism has no plan for the rest of humanity. Unless, of
course, nationalism morphs into imperialism, and calls for one nation to
conquer and rule the entire world. A century ago, several nationalist
movements indeed harboured such imperialist fantasies. Today's
nationalists, whether in Russia, Turkey, Italy or China, so far refrain
from advocating global conquest.

In place of violently establishing a global empire, [some
nationalists]{.underline} such as Steve Bannon, Viktor Orban, the
Northern League in Italy and the British Brexiteers dream about a
peaceful "Nationalist International". They [argue]{.underline} that all
nations today face the same enemies. The bogeymen of globalism,
multiculturalism and immigration are threatening to destroy the
traditions and identities of all nations. Therefore nationalists across
the world should make common cause in opposing these global forces.
Hungarians, Italians, Turks and Israelis should build walls, erect
fences and slow down the movement of people, goods, money and ideas.

[The world will]{.underline} then [be divided into distinct
nation-states]{.underline}, each with its own sacred identity and
traditions. Based on mutual respect for these differing identities, all
nation-states could cooperate and trade peacefully with one another.
Hungary will be Hungarian, Turkey will be Turkish, Israel will be
Israeli, and everyone will know who they are and what is their proper
place in the world. It will be a world without immigration, without
universal values, without multiculturalism, and without a global
elite---but with peaceful international relations and some trade. In a
word, [the "Nationalist International" envisions the world as a network
of walled-but-friendly fortresses]{.underline}.

Many people would think this is quite a reasonable vision. Why isn't it
a viable alternative to the liberal order? Two things should be noted
about it. First, it is still a comparatively liberal vision. It assumes
that no human group is superior to all others, that no nation should
dominate its peers, and that international cooperation is better than
conflict. In fact, liberalism and nationalism were originally closely
aligned with one another. The 19th century liberal nationalists, such as
Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini in Italy, and Adam Mickiewicz in
Poland, dreamt about precisely such an international liberal order of
peacefully-coexisting nations.

The second thing to note about [this vision of friendly
fortresses]{.underline} is that it **[has been
tried]{.underline}**---[and it **failed spectacularly**. **All
attempts** to divide the world into clear-cut nations have]{.underline}
so far **[[resulted in war]{.mark} and genocide]{.underline}**. When the
heirs of Garibaldi, Mazzini and Mickiewicz managed to overthrow the
multi-ethnic Habsburg Empire, it proved impossible to find a clear line
dividing Italians from Slovenes or Poles from Ukrainians.

This had set the stage for the second world war. The key problem with
the network of fortresses is that each national fortress wants a bit
more land, security and prosperity for itself at the expense of the
neighbors, and without the help of universal values and global
organisations, rival fortresses cannot agree on any common rules. Walled
fortresses are seldom friendly.

But if you happen to live inside a particularly strong fortress, such as
America or Russia, why should you care? Some nationalists indeed adopt a
more extreme isolationist position. They don't believe in either a
global empire or in a global network of fortresses. Instead, [they deny
the necessity of any global order whatsoever]{.underline}. "Our fortress
should just raise the drawbridges," they say, "and the rest of the world
can go to hell. We should refuse entry to foreign people, foreign ideas
and foreign goods, and as long as our walls are stout and the guards are
loyal, who cares what happens to the foreigners?"

Such extreme isolationism, however, is completely divorced from economic
realities. Without a global trade network, all existing national
economies will collapse---including that of North Korea. Many countries
will not be able even to feed themselves without imports, and prices of
almost all products will skyrocket. The made-in-China shirt I am wearing
cost me about \$5. If it had been produced by Israeli workers from
Israeli-grown cotton using Israeli-made machines powered by non-existing
Israeli oil, it may well have cost ten times as much. Nationalist
leaders from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin may therefore heap abuse on
the global trade network, but none thinks seriously of taking their
country completely out of that network. And we cannot have a global
trade network without some global order that sets the rules of the game.

Even more importantly, whether people like it or not,
[[humankind]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[faces]{.underline}]{.mark}
three [common [problems]{.mark} that make a mockery of all national
borders]{.underline}, and [that can **[only]{.mark} be [solved
through]{.mark} global [cooperation]{.mark}**. These are **[nuclear war,
climate change and tech]{.mark}nological disruption**. You cannot build
a wall against nuclear winter or against global warming, and no nation
can regulate]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI) or
bioengineering single-handedly]{.underline}. It won't be enough if only
the European Union forbids producing killer robots or only America bans
genetically-engineering human babies. Due to the immense potential of
such disruptive technologies, if even one country decides to pursue
these high-risk high-gain paths, other countries will be forced to
follow its dangerous lead for fear of being left behind.

[[An **AI**]{.mark} **arms race** [or]{.mark} a
**[biotech]{.mark}nological [arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline} almost
[**[guarantees]{.mark} the worst outcome**. Whoever wins]{.underline}
the arms race, **[the loser will likely be [humanity]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}**. For in an arms race, [all regulations [will
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider, for example, conducting
genetic-engineering experiments on human babies. Every country will say:
"We don't want to conduct such experiments---we are the good guys. But
how do we know our rivals are not doing it? We cannot afford to remain
behind. So we must do it before them."

Similarly, [consider developing autonomous-weapon systems]{.underline},
that can decide for themselves whether to shoot and kill people. Again,
[every country will say: "This]{.underline} is a very dangerous
technology, and it [should be regulated]{.underline} carefully. [But we
don't trust our rivals to regulate it, so we must develop it
first]{.underline}".

[The **only thing** that can prevent]{.underline} such [destructive arms
races is **[greater trust]{.mark} between countries**. This [is
**not**]{.mark} **an [impossible]{.mark} mission**]{.underline}. If
today the Germans promise the French: "Trust us, we aren't developing
killer robots in a secret laboratory under the Bavarian Alps," the
French are likely to believe the Germans, despite the terrible history
of these two countries. [We need to build such trust
globally]{.underline}. We need to reach a point when Americans and
Chinese can trust one another like the French and Germans.

Similarly, we need to create a global safety-net to protect humans
against the economic shocks that AI is likely to cause. Automation will
create immense new wealth in high-tech hubs such as Silicon Valley,
while the worst effects will be felt in developing countries whose
economies depend on cheap manual labor. There will be more jobs to
software engineers in California, but fewer jobs to Mexican factory
workers and truck drivers. We now have a global economy, but politics is
still very national. [Unless we find solutions on a global level to the
disruptions caused by AI, entire countries might collapse, and the
resulting chaos]{.underline}, violence and waves of immigration [will
**destabilise the entire world**]{.underline}.

This is the proper perspective to look at recent developments such as
Brexit. In itself, Brexit isn't necessarily a bad idea. But is this what
Britain and the EU should be dealing with right now? How does Brexit
help prevent nuclear war? How does Brexit help prevent climate change?
How does Brexit help regulate artificial intelligence and
bioengineering? Instead of helping, Brexit makes it harder to solve all
of these problems. Every minute that Britain and the EU spend on Brexit
is one less minute they spend on preventing climate change and on
regulating AI.

In order **[[to survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and flourish [in the 21st
century, [humankind needs]{.mark} **effective global
[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and so far [[the **only**]{.mark}
**viable [blueprint]{.mark}** for such cooperation [is]{.mark} offered
by **[liberalism]{.mark}**. Nevertheless, governments all over the world
are undermining the foundations of the liberal order]{.underline}, and
the world is turning into a network of fortresses. [The first to feel
the impact are the weakest members of humanity]{.underline}, who find
themselves without any fortress willing to protect them: refugees,
illegal migrants, persecuted minorities. [But if the walls keep
rising]{.underline}, eventually [the **whole of humankind** will **feel
the squeeze**]{.underline}.

### AT: China Led Order

#### Chinese led order is [incoherent]{.underline} and [fails]{.underline}

International Studies Review, Volume 23, Issue 3, September 2021, Pages
807--834, <https://doi.org/10.1093/isr/viaa076> WMK

However, [China's attempts to "**upload" its preferred normative
vision**]{.underline} to [multilateral institution]{.underline}s, even
its own**[, are not]{.underline}** always **[successful]{.underline}**.
For example, [while Xi Jinping initially promoted the idea of an AIIB
under the principles of win-win cooperation]{.underline} (ASEAN-China
Centre 2013), **[this has not been reflected in official discourses of
the AIIB]{.underline}**. The World Internet Conference offers an even
clearer example[. At the first meeting in 2014, attendees
awoke]{.underline} on the last day to [find copies of a "Wuzhen
Declaration]{.underline}" pushed under their hotel room doors, [which
repeated key Chinese talking points on internet governance.]{.underline}
Upon the objections of several attendees, it was not officially
promulgated (Wall Street Journal 2014).

[The clumsiness of such attempts at **normative
entrepreneurialism**]{.underline} po[int toward the difficulty for China
**in using multilateral formats to promote normative
change**]{.underline}, [let alone an **alternative ideology to aspire
for global hegemony**]{.underline} (Allan, Vucetic, and Hopf 2018). This
probably [reflects]{.underline} **[the ideological incoherence of
contemporary Chinese society]{.underline}**, [with its awkward mix of
Maoist terminology, Dengist pragmatism, and increasing appeals to
classical Chinese thought]{.underline} (Holbig 2013; Madsen 2014; Brown
and Bērziņa-Čerenkova 2018). More likely is that China's institutions
will contribute to normative change simply by avoiding the overtly
liberal ideas present in existing institutions that link states'
international legitimacy to their domestic affairs (Zhang 2011, 2016).

### AT: LIO Unsustainable

#### China heg is [not sustainable]{.underline}\-\--structural factors

**Mueller 22 ---** John Mueller is a senior fellow at the Cato
Institute. He is also a member of the political science department and
senior research scientist with the Mershon Center for International
Security Studies at the Ohio State University. John Mueller, "China Has
Been a Failure at Hegemony, So Let's Just Chill," Cato Institute,

[Many in the U.S. foreign policy establishment]{.underline} and
elsewhere are [sounding an alarm over concerns that]{.underline}, as
[China]{.underline} develops, it [will become the dominant
power]{.underline} in its region, a "hegemon" that will have too much
"influence" there [and do damage to U.S. security
interests]{.underline}. For example, in 2017 the National Intelligence
Council opined that "geopolitical competition" was on the rise and the
Chinese sought "to exert more sway over their neighboring regions and
promote an order in which U.S. influence does not dominate."

Accordingly, as it is often suggested, military hardware must be
deployed to somehow keep that from happening.

However, to a degree, we already know what Chinese "hegemony" looks
like. Over the last decade, [China has established a major military and
especially economic presence]{.underline}, and it has [tried to convert
this condition into influence]{.underline}. These [experiments in
hegemony]{.underline} --- China's Belt and Road Initiative
([BRI]{.underline}) which has stressed construction loans to countries
across Eurasia, and its rather [belligerent "wolf
diplomacy]{.underline}" antics --- have substantially foundered and
have, if anything, **[proved to be counterproductive]{.underline}**. The
[experience]{.underline} **[does not bode well for future
effort]{.underline}**s, and it does not justify alarm.

Its much‐​hyped [Belt and Road Initiative was once deemed by some to be a
key element]{.underline} of a [plot by the Chinese to "rule the
world.]{.underline}" However, [from the beginning]{.underline} there
were [warnings from Chinese scholar]{.underline}s and business leaders
[questioning the economic rationale]{.underline} for many of the
investments. In addition, economist Barry Naughton of the University of
California at San Diego notes that the [idea was]{.underline} in part
**[economically misguided]{.underline}**, and Tufts University's Michael
Beckley has estimated that the scheme would "probably **[exacerbate
China's woes]{.underline}**" by [funding "hundreds of **financially
dubious projects**]{.underline} [in unstable countries]{.underline},
more than half of which have credit ratings below investment‐​grade."

These [suggestions]{.underline} have **[proved to be
justified]{.underline}**. [Expenditures of hundreds of
billions]{.underline} on the project have **[failed to
deliver]{.underline}** either **[returns]{.underline}** for investors
(including state‐​run banks) or political returns for China, notes
Taiwan‐​based analyst Tanner Green. The [project was there]{.underline},
he says, "[only because it is the favored brain**child of an
authoritarian leader living in an echo chamber**]{.underline}" --- for
other Chinese to attack BRI is "to attack the legitimacy of the party
itself."

[By 2019, BRI lending]{.underline} by China had [fallen
from]{.underline} a peak of \$[75 billion]{.underline} in 2016 (at a
time when its promulgating author, Chinese President Xi Jinping, was
touting BRI as "a project of the century") [to]{.underline} just \$[4
billion]{.underline}. Although some of these [projects]{.underline} will
likely succeed, there were reports by the end of 2020, like this one by
James Kynge and Jonathan Wheatley at the Financial Times, that the money
had often been doled out "with a combination of hubris, ambition, and
naivete." Descriptors like "**[unravelling]{.underline}**," "**[fallen
off a cliff," and "ill‐​conceived]{.underline}**" were being applied by
experts, including Matt Ferchen at Merics, a Berlin‐​based think‐​tank,
who wrote that China was now "mired in debt renegotiations with a host
of countries."

In fact, as Stanford's Elizabeth Economy notes, there has been something
of a backlash and "[stories of Chinese corruption and
scandals]{.underline} with [infrastructure projects]{.underline} are
[contributing to rising Sinophobia]{.underline}." China has shot back
saying critics are "prejudiced" and lacking "objectivity and a fair
understanding" of the initiative; others have sought to play down
criticisms of Chinese labor practices or accusations of debt traps.

[Rising concerns]{.underline} have nonetheless [pushed]{.underline} the
[European Union to launch a global investment projec]{.underline}t that
is [apparently intended to be a counter to China's]{.underline} BRI, and
the United States seems to want to follow suit. But, as Foreign Policy's
James Palmer noted recently, "all this feels both outdated and
unnecessary," pointing out that "[the heyday of BRI hype]{.underline},
even in China, [was at least three years ago]{.underline}," while the
current focus is on the "white elephant nature of projects and the
relative lack of deliverables for China."

[China's clumsy "wolf warrior" diplomacy]{.underline} of recent years
has **[also failed to deliver]{.underline}**. As Stanford's Thomas
Fingar notes, "[muscular displays of Chinese military]{.underline} power
may have been intended to dissuade neighboring countries from lending
support to imputed U.S. military planning, but they **[seriously
undercut efforts]{.underline}** [to reassure other countries that they
had **no reason to fear China's 'peaceful rise.'"**]{.underline}

Moreover, [they have pushed countries it sought to
intimidate]{.underline}, such as Japan, India, South Korea, and
Australia, **[to become far more hostile]{.underline}**. Thus, historian
Arne Westad points out that [the efforts]{.underline} "**[have all
backfired]{.underline}**: [East Asia is much warier of Chinese aims
today]{.underline} than it was a decade ago," and he cites a Pew
Research Center poll showing the percentage of South Koreans who viewed
China's rise favorably fell from 66 percent in 2002 to 34 percent in
2017. In Australia the percentage trusting China to act responsibly in
the world dropped from 52 percent to 16 percent between 2018 and 2021.

As David Shambaugh, a China specialist at George Washington University,
concludes: "If [Beijing is trying to recreate a twenty‐​first‐​century
version of the imperial 'tribute system,**' it will inevitably
fail**]{.underline}, as [other sovereign Asian nations do not desire to
fall into such a patron‐​client relationship with China
again."]{.underline}

Fingar and Jean Oi summarize the situation: "[China's relationship with
more or less all countries]{.underline} **[is more fraught today than it
was before]{.underline}** Xi launched the **[BRI]{.underline}** and
China began to flex its economic and military muscles in ways neighbors
found worrisome."

#### China can't become a hegemon

Deep Integration and a new Cold War. Global Policy, 13(1), 91--106.

The [Chinese regime's peaceful rise]{.underline} rhetoric [reveals the
country's developmental quandary in the age of]{.underline}
globalization. Rampant **[corruption]{.underline}** [as well as the
regime's strong links]{.underline} **[with Wall Street
finance]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} intimate collaboration with
**[Western industrial capital]{.underline}** have [fostered a thriving
system of crony comprador capitalism]{.underline} (Ho, 2013; Meisner,
1996, p. 300; Pei, 2016),28 [characterized by unprecedented state
capture]{.underline} by public and private [institutional interests who
not only are 'self-serving', but also 'serve the interests of global
capital]{.underline}' (Kwong, 2006; Yue, 2018a, pp. 271--331).29 With
this 'worst form of capitalism' **[becoming solidly
entrenched]{.underline}**, the current campaign waged by the seemingly
all-powerful paramount leader Xi Jinping against the 'ultrarich and
famous' high-tech oligarchs, is motivationally dubious, which has in no
small part more to do with affirming 'politics in command' (zhengzhi
guashuai, 政治挂帅) than with reversing 'state capture' by private
interests.

In fact, from 2002 onward, the [liberal globalization
approach]{.underline} to [economic development]{.underline} has
**[undergirded the CCP's guiding ideology]{.underline}** of 'building a
socialism of (changed from "with") Chinese characteristics',30
[symbolizing that the country's dependent pathway of development has
since been fully institutionalized]{.underline} (Yue, 2018a, pp. 111 &
317). The ruling elites are so obsessed with the alleged benefits of
globalization as to make the country's embrace of global capitalism a
'political correctness'. Since under most circumstances globalization is
not open to criticism, China's commitment to the techno-nationalism that
it is widely perceived to have embraced remains deeply in doubt.31

The [seemingly grandiose 'Made in China 2025' initiative]{.underline},32
as some Western observers have put it, **[is 'an act of
desperation']{.underline}** [rather than a **plan to
dominate'**]{.underline}.33 Viewing [China's rise]{.underline} as
**[more hype than reality]{.underline}**, Michael Beckley (2018), who
has measured power as the 'function of net resources', convincingly
argued that '[the United States' economic and military lead over **China
is much larger than typically assumed**]{.underline} -- and that the
[trends are **mostly in America's favor'**]{.underline}. Inspired by
Susan Strange's IPE-based inquiry into American structural power, Sean
Starrs (2013), by factoring in the critical role of transnational
corporations (TNCs) 'in the era of transnational modular production
networks', empirically confirmed that '[American economic
power]{.underline} **[has not declined]{.underline}** -- [it has
globalized'.]{.underline} A most recent review done by LSE IDEAS (a
policy think tank) asserted that 'China is not yet a military challenge
in the same way as Russia (or the Soviet Union) was during the Cold War'
(Watkins, 2021).

But perception matters in practical terms, whether it is genuine or
feigned. In the face of China's perceived 'rise', the US administration,
from Obama's second term in office onward, felt increasingly justified
in reinforcing the containment of China to complement its engagement
policy, and even began, after Trump's rise to power, to contemplate
decoupling from China, given mounting uncertainty about the regime's
intentions and the security challenge posed by China's economic rise,
increasing military expenditure, and more aggressive international
posture.34 That scenario seems a good fit with the 'The Tragedy of Great
Power Politics' paradigm espoused by John Mearsheimer, who has compared
China to the autarkic empires of Germany or Japan before 1945.

Comparisons of this kind are far less relevant to reality than they
seem. For one thing[, the]{.underline} [perceived 'power
transition']{.underline} (2011--20) was 'occurring' [when the rising or
risen China still lagged far behind the declining USA **scientifically
and technologically**]{.underline}, [and seemed destined to remain so
into the far distant future]{.underline}. This [stands in stark contrast
with the power transition from Britain to Germany]{.underline} in the
1901--1910 decade, in which imperial Germany emerged as a superior
scientific powerhouse (Table 1). The fallacy of the power shift model is
further confirmed by a series of astounding or even humiliating
concessions on market access China was obliged to make on a unilateral
basis to both the USA and EU in 2020, the year in which the alleged
'power transition' to Chinese dominance was complete.35

[The]{.underline} prevailing power transition theory ([PTT]{.underline})
[**wrongly assumes that emerging powers are inevitably dissatisfied with
the status quo**, and are poised to overturn the existing international
orde]{.underline}r. Odd Arne Westad (2021) has refuted this cliché,
contending that '[there is little evidence that the regime is o**ut to
destroy the international system designed by and still dominated by
Western power.**]{.underline} [Rather, it seems intent on **getting more
out of it'.**]{.underline} This is due to the brutal fact is that its
[entrapment in semi-peripheral development]{.underline} has [made China
not **a solid superpower candidate,**]{.underline} [but rather **a
fragile great p ower**]{.underline}. The country's elites' universally
uncritical embrace of global capitalism, especially the leadership's
tireless championship of free trade, is a vivid reflection not of the
Chinese economy's structural strength but of its substantial structural
weakness.

Moreover, [the intellectual background of the post-Mao
leadership]{.underline}, including Deng[, 'has given them neither proper
knowledge of, nor real insights into]{.underline}, [what the current
liberal order meant, how it came about, and in **what way could it be
overturned'**]{.underline} (Yue, 2018a, p. 16). [China]{.underline}
today [is so **tightly enmeshed**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline}
**[international system]{.underline}** [that it lacks both the will and
ability to challenge **the USA through any sort of hard-balancing
approach.**]{.underline} Its [lack of 'potent **soft-power sources'**
also makes it no match for either the Third Reich or the
USSR]{.underline}, which in every sense constituted competing
alternatives in their respective eras (Nye, 2015, p. 68). Far from
having achieved parity with the USA in terms of relational capabilities
-- posing competing and more accurate understanding of what it means to
be powerful (Quinn & Kitchen, 2019) -- [China]{.underline}, as Kitchen
and Cox (2019) contend, 'will **[remain a rule-taker']{.underline}**
unless a new 'world-making moment' befalls that equips it with the
requisite structural power to wrest international leadership from the
USA.

That is not to deny that China's foreign and security policies have
stiffened over the past decade or more, particularly after its success
in hosting the 2008 Olympic Games and the coming of the 2007--09
financial crisis. Its increasing assertiveness in the region and the
wider world are in large part a consequence of Chinese policy makers'
grave misjudgment of the USA: especially the belief that the financial
crisis marked the point of no return in an accelerating US decline. With
the USA's subsequent 'rebalancing to Asia', and despite continued
nationalist rhetoric, China silently reinstated Deng Xiaoping's 'bide
time to build up strength' strategy -- also known as the '24-character
strategy' -- in the closing years of Hu Jintao's tenure.36

After his accession to power in late 2012, Xi Jinping became fully aware
of how corrupt and incompetent the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had
become, whose 'first and paramount mission is (and will continue to be)
preserving the power of the Chinese Communist Party against China's own
people' (Frum, 2021).37 Xi also took note of the fact that China was far
more dependent on the USA than vice versa, that it still lacks effective
alternatives to escaping from dependency and thus can ill-afford a
complete decoupling, especially in technological terms. Xi fully
recognized that an all-out trade war, much less a military conflict with
the USA, were not viable options for China and must be avoided at all
costs. He was entirely candid at his first meeting with Trump at
Mar-a-Lago in April 2017: 'There are a thousand reasons to make the
China-U.S. relationship work, and no reason to break it'.38

Thus [despite frequent saber-rattling and a cosmetic toughening of
China's foreign policy]{.underline} aimed primarily at domestic
opinion,39 [the Chinese Communist leadership has viewed]{.underline}
**[continued bandwagoning on the liberal order as crucial to the
country's economic dynamism]{.underline}** [and thus to the **regime's
own security**]{.underline} 'at the critical juncture of painful
structural adjustment for fulfilling the desired economic transition'
(Yue, 2018a, p. 312).

[What are the prospects for the Western hegemonic order]{.underline} in
the face of China's rise? Broadly speaking, [there are three
possibilities]{.underline}. The [order could remain stable under the
leadership of either the US]{.underline} or a coalition of great powers.
The [order could dissolve without being replace]{.underline}d. [Or,
China could lead a hegemonic transition]{.underline}, either by joining
and transforming the current order or by constructing an alternative
order from the outside. To assess which of these is most likely, we
return to the three theoretical expectations about the dynamics of
hegemonic order we outlined earlier. We [conclude]{.underline} that the
**[first two possibilities are more likely than a Chinese-led
transition]{.underline}**, [given the distribution]{.underline} **[of
identity.]{.underline}**

First, does the distribution of identity bolster Western hegemony? The
evidence shows that [while some aspects of Western democratic neoliberal
hegemony are contested]{.underline}, **[the distribution of identity
among the great powers provides strong support for Western
hegemony.]{.underline}** [Masses and elites]{.underline} i[n the United
Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Brazil, and India]{.underline}
**[clearly identify with democracy]{.underline}**. While the masses in
some of these countries reject neoliberalism, elites identify with
liberal policies. This suggests that the [hegemonic order is likely to
remain stable **even in the face of a relative decline in American
power.**]{.underline} Other states would likely be willing to support
the order and either bolster American leadership or form a coalition
akin to Snidal's k-group that could maintain most existing rules without
a hegemon.

Second, what does the distribution of identity imply for China's ability
to join and transform the existing order? Among the great powers,
[Chinese elites are **alone** in openly opposing the democratic element
of Western hegemony]{.underline}. This [poses an important obstacle to
any Chinese global hegemonic project because Chinese elites would have
to abandon a fundamental aspect of their own self-understanding to
become full members of the current order.]{.underline} There is unlikely
to be an American-Chinese hand-off similar to the shift from British to
American hegemony because [China is not likely to join the existing
order as a junior partner]{.underline}. **[Thus, China is unlikely to
lead a transition]{.underline}** within the dominant norms of the
existing order.

Third, what is the likelihood that China will be able to form an
alternative counterhegemonic bloc that would challenge or displace the
current order? Again, [since all the other great powers save Russia
identify as democracies,]{.underline} it is **[unlikely China can build
an ideology that would simultaneously satisfy its domestic needs and
appeal to others.]{.underline}** So [elites and masses in the other
great powers would have to reject their democratic identities in favor
of a Chinese alternative.]{.underline} **[This seems
unlikely]{.underline}** give[n the **strong support for
democracy**]{.underline} [in India and Brazil]{.underline}. To [make a
nondemocratic hegemony possib]{.underline}le, **[China would have to
delegitimate or displace the democratic elements that dominate identity
discourses in the other great powers]{.underline}**. While this is a
possibility, the [mass-level support for democracy means any effort to
cultivate an alternative, nondemocratic distribution of identity is
likely to take **a long time**]{.underline}. Moreover, [China is
portrayed **negatively in other great-power discourses**]{.underline} on
this point. In Germany, Chinese authoritarian socialism is linked to a
rejected Nazi and Soviet past.Footnote115 Some Indian texts worry that
India's democratic identity will bring it into conflict with a Chinese
power hostile to democracy.Footnote116 Elsewhere, China is viewed
ambivalently as an economic marvel or competitor, but is never
represented positively as a leader or model.

[China's identity discourse contains little else that could be
extrapolated into a **compelling vision or** ideology in support of an
alternative international order]{.underline}. Because its national
identity discourse is insular, it is [hard to imagine how Chinese
identity categories could be **universalized**]{.underline} [so they
would appeal to other]{.underline}s. Given that the masses in all
countries except for the UK have ambivalent or negative attitudes toward
capitalism, markets, and neoliberalism, one possibility is that China
could lead an anti-neoliberal, nationalist, counterhegemonic coalition.
There is a latent alternative "historic bloc," to borrow Gramsci's
terminology, in search of an ideology backed by sufficient global
material power to make it hegemonic. But [it is difficult to see how
China would offer a **compelling alternative to
neoliberalism**]{.underline}. Europeans and others seem ready for social
democracy, but China is unlikely to offer that alternative.

Former U.S. President Donald [Trump ushered in]{.underline} a more
**[confrontational era]{.underline}** [in U.S.-China
relations]{.underline}, and [Biden has]{.underline} largely
**[maintained his predecessor's approach]{.underline}** to Beijing,
albeit with a more equanimous tone and embrace of multilateralism. The
U.S. government has for decades been concerned by China's mercantilism,
rapid military modernization, and illiberal approach to human rights,
but it had held out hope that China might liberalize through
increasingly robust contact with the rest of the world. That has not
happened, and the [United States]{.underline} and others **[have lost
patience with China's state capitalist system]{.underline}**,
[militarization of the South China Sea, and]{.underline} increasingly
**[authoritarian governance.]{.underline}**

But [Beijing is]{.underline} **[not backing down]{.underline}**. Despite
facing pronounced international pushback during the pandemic, [Xi has
become even more confident in China']{.underline}s
[economic]{.underline} system, governance model, and approach to
international affairs. "Time and momentum are on China's side," he
argued last year at a high-level meeting, though many analysts accuse
the party of overconfidence. At the same time, Chinese officials are
increasingly looking askance at their U.S. counterparts. Many appear to
believe that the United States, though still a formidable power, is in
the early stages of an inevitable decline. Just as China resumes its
rightful place atop the hierarchy of Asian nations, Beijing's thinking
goes, the United States' unresolved racial justice issues, income
inequality, and political polarization will catalyze an irreversible
diminution of U.S. power in Asia and across the globe.

Complicating matters further, [the U.S. and Chinese publics are
**increasingly distrustful of each other.**]{.underline} A [whopping 89
percent of American respondents]{.underline} to a recent survey from the
Pew Research Center [consider China a]{.underline} competitor or
**[enemy]{.underline}**, while around [two-thirds of Chinese respondents
view the United States **unfavorably or very unfavorably**]{.underline}.
Such [negative mutual perceptions]{.underline} would likely **[hamper
each side's ability to recalibrate its approach to the
other]{.underline}**.

However, there are some reasons to think that naturally occurring
[[pathogens are **unlikely** to cause]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Firstly, [Homo sapiens have been
around for **[200,000 years]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the Homo genus
for around six million years [[without]{.mark} being
[exterminated]{.mark} by an infectious disease, which [is
evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[the]{.mark} base [rate]{.mark} of
extinction-risk natural pathogens [is low]{.mark}]{.underline}**.82
Indeed, past disease [[outbreaks have not **come
close**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to rendering humans extinct]{.underline}.
Although bodies were piled high in the streets across Europe during the
Black Death,83 human extinction was never a serious possibility, and
some economists even argue that it was a boon for the European
economy.84 Secondly, [infectious [disease]{.mark}]{.underline} has [only
[contributed to]{.mark} the [extinction of a]{.mark} **small
[minority]{.mark} of animal species**]{.underline}.85 [The [only
confirmed case of]{.mark} a [mammalian]{.mark} species
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} being caused by an infectious disease
[[is **a**]{.mark} **type of [rat]{.mark}** [native]{.mark} **only [to
Christmas Island]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Having said that, the context
may be importantly different for modern day humans, so it is unclear
whether the risk is increasing or decreasing. On the one hand, due to
globalisation, the world is more interconnected making it easier for
pathogens to spread. On the other hand, [[interconnectedness
could]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[increase immunity]{.mark}** by
[**increasing exposure** to **lower virulence strains**]{.mark}
**between subpopulations**]{.underline}.87 Moreover, [[advancements in

However, climate breakdown does pose a grave threat to civilization as
we know it, and the potential for mass suffering on a scale perhaps
never before encountered by humankind. This should be enough reason for
action without any need for exaggeration or misrepresentation!

A "Hothouse Earth" scenario plays out that sees Earth's temperatures
doomed to rise by a further 1°C (1.8°F) even if we stopped emissions
immediately.

Peter Kalmus, Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory:

This word choice perhaps reveals a bias on the part of the author of the
article. A temperature can't be doomed. And while I certainly do not
encourage false optimism, assuming that humanity is doomed is lazy and
counterproductive.

Fifty-five percent of the global population are subject to more than 20
days a year of lethal heat conditions beyond that which humans can
survive

Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of
Exeter:

This is clearly from Mora et al (2017) although the report does not
include a citation of the paper as the source of that statement. The way
it is written here (and in the report) is misleading because it gives
the impression that everyone dies in those conditions. That is not
actually how Mora et al define "deadly heat" -- they merely looked for
heatwaves when somebody died (not everybody) and then used that as the
definition of a "deadly" heatwave.

Deadly heat conditions across West Africa persist for over 100 days a

Peter Kalmus, Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory:

The deadly heat projections (this, and the one from the previous
paragraph) come from Mora et al (2017)1.

It should be clarified that "deadly heat" here means heat and humidity
beyond a two-dimension threshold where at least one person in the region
subject to that heat and humidity dies (i.e., not everyone instantly
dies). That said, in my opinion, the projections in Mora et al are
conservative and the methods of Mora et al are sound. I did not check
the claims in this report against Mora et al but I have no reason to
think they are in error.

Willem Huiskamp, Postdoctoral research fellow, Potsdam Institute for

This is a highly questionable conclusion. The reference provided in the
report is for the "Global Catastrophic Risks 2018" report from the
"Global Challenges Foundation" and not peer-reviewed literature. (It is
worth noting that this latter report also provides no peer-reviewed
evidence to support this claim).

Furthermore, if it is apparently beyond our capability to model these
impacts, how can they assign a 'high likelihood' to this outcome?

While it is true that warming of this magnitude would be catastrophic,
making claims such as this without evidence serves only to undermine the
trust the public will have in the science.

Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for
Atmospheric Research:

It seems that [**the eye-catching [headline]{.mark}-level

[from]{.mark}]{.underline} these [**[knock-on effects]{.mark}**,

**Post '21** \[Daniel; 1/29/21; PhD Candidate in IR @ Brown University;

<https://warontherocks.com/2021/01/deterring-north-korea/>\]

With these principles in mind, [[can deterrence]{.mark} continue to
[work]{.mark} vis-a-vis North Korea]{.underline}? **[In short,
[yes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Throughout the evolution of the U.S-North
Korean deterrence relationship, [vulnerability has played an important
role in the]{.underline} nuclear [strategies]{.underline} and policies
[of both sides]{.underline}. [The [vulnerability of]{.mark} U.S.
[allies]{.mark} and assets in the region to North Korea]{.underline}'s
intermediate-range missile and artillery barrages
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} almost certainly [[been a check on]{.mark} a
more **[aggressive U.S.]{.mark} strategy**]{.underline}, whether geared
toward nonproliferation or regime change. [It is]{.underline} certainly
[plausible that **in the absence of**]{.underline} this [**vulnerability
the chances of the U.S.**]{.underline} preventively **[attacking North
during the Trump administration would have been higher]{.underline}**,
[especially considering the]{.underline} extremely [hawkish views of his
national security adviser]{.underline} in 2017. [As a result
of]{.underline} this [vulnerability, the U.S. routinely demonstrates its
dedication to security agreements]{.underline} with allies in word and
deed. [Strategic bomber flights and military exercises]{.underline}, for
example, [demonstrate to North Korea their own vulnerability to U.S. and
allied power]{.underline} in the region. Conversely, [although the Kim
regime would like]{.underline} nothing more than [to **unify** the
Korean Peninsula]{.underline} under North Korean leadership (dubbed the
"holy grail of North Korean statecraft" in a recent report), [it has
refrained from]{.underline} overt and [aggressive military action in
pursuit of this goal]{.underline}. **[There is no doubt that
[Kim]{.mark}]{.underline}**, like his predecessors, **[[is wary]{.mark}
of such behavior [in the face of U.S.]{.mark} and allied military
capabilities]{.underline}**. Today, [North Korea remains vulnerable to
U.S. nuclear attacks]{.underline}, while the United States and its
regional partners remain vulnerable to nuclear attack or retaliation
from North Korea. This **[[mutual vulnerability necessitates
caution]{.mark} on both sides]{.underline}**.

Recent progress in North Korean missile technology have made portions of
the U.S. mainland vulnerable, giving the U.S. further reason to avoid
unnecessary provocation. In 2017, North Korea conducted several tests of
intercontinental ballistic missiles, two of which demonstrated the
capability to potentially reach the continental United States. More
recently, [**[Nor]{.mark}**th **[Ko]{.mark}**rea has successfully
[tested]{.mark} a
**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}ubmarine-**[[l]{.underline}]{.mark}**aunched
**[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**allistic **[m]{.underline}**issile [and has
showcased a]{.underline} new and [larger]{.underline} submarine-launched
ballistic [missile at a recent parade]{.underline}. [As a result, the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[continues to [invest]{.mark} significantly [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
homeland **[[missile defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [as well as to
deploy missile defenses to defend allies and assets in the
region]{.underline}. Missile defenses likely contribute to increased
feelings of vulnerability among Kim's regime, which may see the build-up
as a prelude to a military offensive. Though imperfect, **[these
[attempts to reduce vulnerability enhance deterrence
by]{.mark}]{.underline}** potentially **[[denying]{.mark} North Korea
the expected military [gains from a]{.mark}]{.underline}** limited
**[missile [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**, even as fully effective
missile defenses might contribute to strategic instability. [Regardless
of]{.underline} their [effectiveness]{.underline}, [Kim will have to
**factor in**]{.underline} these [defensive capabilities when assessing
the success of engaging in conflict and will question the ability to
achieve even limited goals]{.underline} through limited means. For
example, [in order to ensure the success of a missile attack, Kim would
have to increase the size]{.underline} of the salvo in order [to
compensate for missiles]{.underline} likely to be [shot down by U.S. and
allied defenses]{.underline}. But knowing that a larger initial attack
would be perceived as particularly aggressive and would likely invite a
larger counter-attack, he might be deterred from pursuing whatever
limited gains a smaller attack might have achieved. **[[From Kim's
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[U.S.]{.mark} military
[capabilities are more than]{.mark} [sufficient to make]{.mark} military
[success]{.mark} for North Korea]{.underline}** in any conflict
**[appear [difficult]{.mark} and costly]{.underline}**.
[Vulnerability]{.underline} to severe retaliation and punishment from
U.S. strategic forces [is]{.underline} also currently [unavoidable for
Kim]{.underline}. In fact, this very vulnerability has driven the North
Korean nuclear program toward a capability to directly threaten the
U.S., thereby demonstrating its own acknowledgement of vulnerability. In
sum, **[both sides are vulnerable to each other]{.underline}**. Most
importantly for U.S. decision-makers, there is no likely development in
the near to medium term that might remove this sense of vulnerability
from Kim's mind.

[[There is]{.mark} also]{.underline} great [[uncertainty in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} and
red lines [of each side]{.underline}, **[in particular concerns about
what might cause Kim to feel]{.underline}** existentially **[threatened,
and concerns over what might trigger the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to exercise nuclear defense on behalf of its
allies]{.underline}** in the region. [[Kim]{.mark} consistently
[expresses]{.mark} concerns about **[regime survival]{.mark}** and fear
of a U.S. attack]{.underline}, and [recent U.S. regime change operations
in other states only strengthen this fear]{.underline}.
[While]{.underline} the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [should be careful **not**]{.underline} [to
**inadvertently**]{.underline} [increase this threat level to a point
where Kim believes he must start a]{.underline} [major war]{.underline},
**[the threat of nuclear retaliation should be
maintained]{.underline}**. Such a scenario is far from implausible
(nuclear scholar Jeffrey Lewis sketches out a hypothetical nuclear war
between North Korea and the United States in a recent novel). Missile
defenses also add an important element of uncertainty to the
relationship. [[Uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark} about the effectiveness
of these systems [should [induce **caution**]{.mark} **on both
sides**]{.underline} [because]{.underline} [**[neither]{.underline}**
[can be]{.underline}]{.mark} [completely [sure about
how]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[effective]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the
[systems will be]{.mark}]{.underline} (though these systems may also
strengthen resolve on the part of the U.S. if deemed very effective, as
Robert Powell suggests). Although the United States has been clear in
its statements regarding North Korean nuclear use, for example stating
in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review that "there is no scenario in which
the Kim regime could employ nuclear weapons and survive," [uncertainty
remains about which actions]{.underline} beneath the nuclear threshold
[might trigger a larger response]{.underline}. **[[This]{.mark}
uncertainty [will]{.mark}]{.underline}** undoubtedly **[[induce caution
in even lower-level]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark} behavior.]{.underline}**
[The U.S.]{.underline} explicitly [includes]{.underline} some level of
[[ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark} and uncertainty in its declaratory
statements, such as when describing possible conditions for nuclear use,
saying, "[Significant non-nuclear strategic attacks
include]{.underline}, but are not limited to, [attacks on the U.S.,
allied, or partner civilian population or infrastructure]{.underline},
[and attacks on U.S. or allied nuclear forces]{.underline}, their
command and control, or warning and attack assessment capabilities."
[This type of statement [leaves]{.mark} plenty of [room]{.mark} for
adversaries [to question what]{.mark} **might** [trigger]{.mark} a
[response and makes]{.mark}]{.underline} any [[aggression]{.mark}
against the U.S. or]{.underline} its [allies]{.underline} a
[[risky]{.underline}]{.mark} proposition.

Last, [both Kim and]{.underline} leaders in [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and its [allies]{.underline} appear to [remain
rational actors despite]{.underline} recent bombastic [behavior
and]{.underline} inflammatory [rhetoric]{.underline} (which may be
plausibly attributed to clumsy signaling attempts).
**[[Kim]{.underline}]{.mark}** may be a cold and brutal oppressor, but
his behavior **[should be [seen as]{.mark}]{.underline}** quite
**[[rational]{.underline}]{.mark}** if you make the very supportable
assumption that, like most political leaders, [his [primary goal]{.mark}
is [keeping]{.mark} his [regime alive]{.mark}]{.underline} and keeping
himself in power. As others have noted, "Kim is a tyrant, but I don't
think he is suicidal." Kim continues to build and enhance his nuclear
weapons capability in reaction to real and proximate threats to his very
survival. [The United States]{.underline} [frequently
conducts]{.underline} **[exercises]{.underline}** [with South
Korea]{.underline} and Japan, and [North Korea frequently
decries]{.underline} [these]{.underline} exercises [as hostile and
reckless]{.underline}. Kim sees these exercises as practice events for
an eventual attack on North Korea. The United States has also stationed
missile defense capabilities in South Korea and Japan, as well as on
ships in the region. Kim's continued pursuit of enhanced nuclear
capabilities in response is as rational as it is for the U.S. to want to
mitigate its own vulnerability. Frequent military deployments to the
region, and overflights of U.S. strategic (nuclear capable) bombers also
serve to enhance the perception of threat on behalf of Kim. These
security dilemma dynamics have certainly contributed to Kim's rational
pursuit of an enhanced nuclear weapons capability. On top of these very
visible military measures, recent dramatic increases in [hostile
rhetoric from]{.underline} former President Donald [Trump]{.underline},
such as his "fire and fury" remarks, [have]{.underline} only [served to
solidify Kim's]{.underline} perceived [need]{.underline} [for a nuclear
deterrent]{.underline} to potential U.S.-backed regime change. Of
course, deterrence requires clear communication and credibility, which
includes demonstrating capability. **[Kim is well [aware]{.mark} that if
he were to engage in]{.underline}** any sort of **[large scale
[aggressive]{.mark}]{.underline}** military **[[behavior]{.mark} against
his neighbors, this [could spell the end]{.mark} of his
regime]{.underline}**. He also has no reason to doubt the U.S.
capability and opportunity to respond to threats from North Korea.
[Assuming]{.underline}, as I do above, [that Kim desires to remain the
leader of his country]{.underline} and to preserve his regime, [he has
little incentive to test the U.S. nuclear deterrent]{.underline}.
Whether his eccentric and brutal behavior leads to some other
inadvertent escalation is a different question. As far as U.S. leaders
are concerned, assuming Kim is rational enough to know what he wants and
to recognize how he can lose it seems to be a safe bet.

In the last two years, [[we've seen]{.underline}]{.mark} rising
[**[hysteria]{.underline}** [over]{.underline}]{.mark} [a future **[war
in space]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[Fanning the flames]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} not only [dire assessments [from the]{.mark} US
[military]{.mark}, but also **breathless coverage** from a]{.underline}
cooperative [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[credulous
[press]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[This]{.mark} reporting]{.underline}
doesn't only **[[muddy]{.mark} public [debate]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[over]{.underline}]{.mark} whether we really need expensive systems. It
could also become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The irony is that nothing
makes [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [[**slim possibility** of
**war in space**]{.underline}]{.mark} more likely than fearmongering
over the threat of war in space.

Two television programs in the past two years show how egregious this
fearmongering can get. In April 2015, the CBS show 60 Minutes ran a
segment called "The Battle Above." In an interview with General John
Hyten, the then-chief of U.S. Air Force Space Command, it came across
loud and clear that the United States was being forced to prepare for a
battle in space --- specifically against China --- that it really didn't
want.

It was explained by Hyten and other guests that China is building a
considerable amount of hardware and accumulating significant know-how
regarding space, all threatening to space assets Americans depend on
every day. If viewers weren't frightened after watching the segment, it
wasn't for lack of trying on the part of CBS.

Using terms like "offensive counterspace" as a 1984 NewSpeak euphemism
for "weapons," it was made clear that the United States had no choice
but to spend billions of dollars on offensive counterspace technology to
not just thwart the Chinese threat, but control and dominate space.
While it didn't actually distort facts --- just omit facts about current
U.S. space capabilities --- the segment was basically a cost-free
commercial for the military-industrial complex.

In retrospect though, "The Battle Above" was pretty good compared to
[CNN's recent special, War in Space]{.underline}: The Next Battlefield.
The [latter might as well have been called **Sharknado in
Space**]{.underline} -- because the only far-out weapons technology our
potential adversaries don't have, according to the broadcast, seems to
be "sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads!"

First, [CNN needs to hire some **fact checkers**]{.underline}. Saying
"unlike its adversaries, the U.S. has not yet weaponized space" is
deeply misleading, like saying "unlike his political opponents,
President-Elect Donald Trump has not sprouted wings and flown away": A
few (admittedly alarming) weapons tests aside, [**[no country]{.mark}**
in the world [has]{.mark} yet **[weaponized
space]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Contrary to CNN, [**[stock]{.mark}**
market [**transactions** are **not**]{.mark}]{.underline} timed nor
[[synchronized through **GPS**]{.mark}, but a **closed
system**]{.underline}. [Cruise **[missiles]{.mark}** can [find their
targets]{.mark}]{.underline} even **[[without
GP]{.mark}S]{.underline}**, [because they have]{.underline} both GPS and
[precision inertial measurement units onboard]{.underline}, [and [**IMUs
don't rely** on **sat**]{.mark}ellite **[data]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Oh, and the British rock group Pink Floyd holds the only claim to the
Dark Side of the Moon: There is a "far side" of the Moon --- the side
always turned away from the Earth --- but not a "dark side" --- which
would be a side always turned away from the Sun.

More nefariously, the segment sensationalized nuggets of truth within a
barrage of half-truths, backed by a heavy bass, dramatic soundtrack (and
gravelly-voiced reporter Jim Sciutto) and accompanied by sexy and scary
visuals.

Make no mistake there are dangers in space, and the United States has
the most to lose if space assets are lost. The question is how best to
protect them. Here are a few facts CNN omitted.

The Reality

The U.S. has all of the technologies described on the CNN segment and
deemed potentially offensive: maneuverable satellites, nano-satellites,
lasers, jamming capabilities, robotic arms, ballistic missiles that can
be used as anti-satellite weapons, etc. In fact, the United States is
more technologically advanced than other countries in both military and
commercial space.

That technological superiority scares other countries; just as the U.S.
military space community is scared of other countries obtaining those
technologies in the future. The U.S. military space budget is more than
10 times greater than that of all the countries in the world combined.
That also causes other countries concern.

More unsettling still, the United States has long been leery of
treaty-based efforts to constrain a potential arms race in outer space,
as supported by nearly every other country in the world for decades.
Indeed, under the administration of George W. Bush, the U.S. talking
points centered on the mantra "there is no arms race in outer space," so
there is no need for diplomat instruments to constrain one. Now, a
decade later, the U.S. military -- backed by the Intelligence Community
which operates the nation's spy satellites -- seems to be shouting to
the rooftops that the United States is in danger of losing the space
arms race already begun by its potential adversaries. The underlying
assumption --- a convenient one for advocates of more military spending
--- is that now there is nothing that diplomacy can do.

However, it must be remembered that most space-related technologies --
with the exception of ballistic missiles and dedicated jammers -- have
both military and civil/commercial uses; both benign --- indeed, helpful
--- and nefarious uses. For example, giving satellites the ability to
maneuver on orbit can allow useful inspections of ailing satellites and
possibly even repairs.

Further, [the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates is **not unable**
to **protect** its **sat**]{.underline}ellite**[s]{.underline}**, as
repeated during the CNN broadcast by various interviewees and the host.
Many U.S. government-owned satellites, including precious spy
**[[sat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ellite**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[have
**capabilities to maneuver**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Many are
**hardened**]{.underline} [against
**e**]{.underline}]{.mark}[lectro-**[m]{.mark}**agnetic
**[p]{.mark}**ulse]{.underline}, [[sport **"shutters"** to
protect]{.mark} optical "eyes" [from]{.mark} solar [**flares and
lasers**, and]{.mark} use radio **[frequency hop]{.mark}**ping [to
**resist jamming**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Offensive weapons, deployed on the ground to attack satellites, or in
space, are not a silver bullet. To the contrary, U.S. deployment of such
weapons may actually be detrimental to U.S. and international security
in space (as we argued in a recent Atlantic Council publication, Towards
a New National Security Space Strategy). Further, there are benefits to
efforts started by the Obama Administration to find diplomatic tools to
restrain and constrain dangerous military activities in space.

These diplomatic efforts, however, would be undercut by a full-out U.S.
pursuit of "space dominance." This includes dialogue with China, the
lack of which Gen. William Shelton, retired commander of Air Force Space
Command, lamented in the CNN report.

Given CNN's "cast," the spin was not surprising. Starting with Ghost
Fleet author Peter Singer set the sensationalist tone, which never
altered. The apocalyptic opening, inspired by Ghost Fleet, posited a
scenario where all U.S. satellites are taken off-line in nearly one fell
swoop. Unless we are talking about an alien invasion, that scenario is
nigh on impossible. **[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}** potential
[**[adversary]{.underline}** [has]{.underline}]{.mark} such
[[capabilities]{.underline}, [nor will they
**ever**]{.underline}]{.mark} [likely do so]{.underline}. [[There
is]{.mark} just **[too much redundancy]{.mark}** in the
system]{.underline}.

### AT: Bioterror

#### No bioterror impact\-\--it assumes [every]{.underline} warrant.

Glenn **Cross 21**, PhD, Former Deputy National Intelligence Officer,
Weapons of Mass Destruction, \"Biological Weapons in The 'Shadow War',\"
War on the Rocks, 11/09/2021,
https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/biological-weapons-in-the-shadow-war/.

The [[threat of terror]{.mark}ists using]{.underline}
**[[bio]{.underline}]{.mark}**logical **[[agents]{.underline}]{.mark}**
exists but [[is]{.underline} **[very limited]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The
fear of nonstate actors using biological agents rose with Aum
Shinrikyo's 1995 failed efforts to spread botulinum and anthrax in
Japan. Fears of bioterror reached its most recent crescendo with the
2001 anthrax letter mailings, coming as they did within weeks after the
9/11 attacks. The [[threat]{.mark} of]{.underline} further [bioterror
attacks]{.underline}, however, [**[never]{.underline}**
[materialized]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Despite the fact that terrorist biological weapons attacks have not
materialized since the Amerithrax scare, [some continue to
argue]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} **[supposed]{.underline}**
[ease and lower cost of biological weapons development, production, and
use]{.underline} along [with]{.underline} the societal disruption of
[COVID-19 has]{.underline} **[incentivized]{.underline}** bad [actors to
adopt]{.underline} **[bio]{.underline}**logical
**[weapons]{.underline}**. These [concerns have been]{.underline}
**[echoed]{.underline}** [by others who assume]{.underline} that [misuse
is]{.underline} **[inevitable]{.underline}** and following [the COVID-19
example]{.underline} will result in mass casualties and crippling
political, societal, and economic repercussions.

However, [the bioterror threat seems to have]{.underline}
**[diminished]{.underline}** --- not grown --- [since]{.underline} the
20**[01]{.underline}** Amerithrax letter mailings. The core al-Qaeda
biological weapons efforts were first envisioned in the late 1990s and
began in earnest shortly afterward. Yet the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan
and the fall of the Taliban in late 2001 effectively disrupted
al-Qaeda's biological weapons work which largely centered on anthrax.
Left without a suitable safe haven, al-Qaeda was never able to
reconstitute its biological weapons efforts. The Taliban's return to
power in Afghanistan, however, may result in a reemergence of al-Qaeda
and its biological weapons ambitions. Time will tell whether the Taliban
now will grant safe haven to al-Qaeda that could be used for biological
weapons work. What is undoubted is that the Taliban and al-Qaeda have a
shared history and have continued to work closely together. Without a
presence in Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence will have a more difficult
time detecting any resurgent al-Qaeda biological weapons efforts.

The threat of a biological weapons effort by the Islamic State in Iraq
never materialized, although the group did manage to produce and use
chemical weapons agents until that program was effectively disrupted.
Other [terrorist [groups' interest]{.mark} in]{.underline}
**[bio]{.underline}**logical **[weapons]{.underline}** [[has
been]{.underline} **[rudimentary]{.underline}** [with a
focus]{.underline}]{.mark} [predominately [on]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[toxins]{.underline}** [such as ricin]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
botulinum]{.underline}. U.S. domestic extremists, self-radicalized
individuals, and lone actors also have gravitated toward ricin, but
[[no]{.underline} **[known casualties]{.underline}**]{.mark} [have
[resulted from]{.mark} the [decades-long interest]{.mark}]{.underline}
in ricin.

Some analysts, however, argue that the life science revolution and
global proliferation of related scientific and technical capabilities
has opened a Pandora's Box of biothreats. The argument goes that the
rapid revolution in genetic engineering --- including synthetic biology
--- the DIY bio movement, and the advent of technologies like CRISPR
(acronym for "clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats") makes their misuse likely. However, [as [noted in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} 2018 **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ational

### AT: AI

#### No emerging tech impact.

**Pinker et al. '20** \[Steven; PhD, Professor of Psychology @ Harvard;
Stuart Russell, Professor of Computer Science @ UC Berkeley; Lucas
Perry; "Steven Pinker and Stuart Russell on the Foundations, Benefits,
and Possible Existential Threat of AI"; June 29^th^, 2020;
https://futureoflife.org/2020/06/15/steven-pinker-and-stuart-russell-on-the-foundations-benefits-and-possible-existential-risk-of-ai/\]

Lucas [Perry]{.underline}: Now that's quite a beautiful picture of the
future. **[There's a lot of existential hope]{.underline}** there. [The
other side to]{.underline} existential [hope is existential
risk]{.underline}. Now this is an interesting subject, which Steve and
you, Stuart, I believe have disagreements about. So pivoting into this
area, and Steve, you can go first here, [[do you
believe]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[human beings]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[should]{.mark} we not [go extinct]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
meantime, [will [we build]{.mark} **artificial
[superintel]{.mark}ligence**[?]{.mark}]{.underline} [And **does that
pose** an existential **risk to humanity**?]{.underline}

Steven [Pinker]{.underline}: Yeah, [[I'm]{.underline}]{.mark} on record
as being **[[skeptical]{.mark} of that scenario]{.underline}** [and
**dubious about** the value of **putting** a lot of **effort into
worrying** about it]{.underline} now. [The concept of
**superintelligence** is]{.underline} itself **[obscure]{.underline}**.
In a lot of the discussions [[you could replace]{.mark} the word
"[superintelligence]{.mark}" [with]{.mark} "**[magic]{.mark}**" or
"**miracle**" and the [sentence would read]{.mark} the
[same]{.mark}]{.underline}. [You read about a]{.underline}n AI [system
that could **duplicate brains** in silicon]{.underline}, [or
solve]{.underline} problems like [**war in** the **Mid**dle
**East**]{.underline}, [or cure **cancer**]{.underline}.  [**It's just
imagining the possibility** of a solution and assuming]{.underline} that
[the ability to bring it about will exist]{.underline}, [without laying
out what that intelligence would consist of]{.underline}, or what would
count as a solution to the problem. 

So I find [the concept of **superintelligence** itself a **dubious**
extrapolation of an **unextrapolable continuum**]{.underline}, like
human-to-animal, or not-so-bright human-to-smart-human. [I don't think
there is a power called "intelligence"]{.underline} such [that we can
compare]{.underline} a squirrel or an octopus to a human and say, "Well,
imagine even more of that." 

[I'm]{.underline} also **[skeptical about]{.underline}** the
[**existential risk** scenarios]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} tend to
[come in two varieties]{.underline}. [One is]{.underline} based on
[the]{.underline} notion of a [will to power]{.underline}: [that **as
soon as you get a**n intelligent **system**, it will inevitably want to
dominate]{.underline} and exploit. Often [the [analogy is that]{.mark}
we humans have]{.underline} exploited and often [extinguished
animals]{.underline} because we're smarter than them, [so as soon as
there is an artificial system]{.underline} that's smarter than us,
**[[it'll do to us what we did to the dodos]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Or
that technologically advanced civilizations, like European
colonists]{.underline} and conquistadors subjugated and sometimes [wiped
out indigenous peoples, so that's what an AI system might
do]{.underline} to us. That's one variety of this scenario.

I think [that scenario confuses intelligence with
dominance]{.underline}, [based on the fact that]{.underline} in one
species, [Homo sapiens]{.underline}, they happen to [come bundled
together]{.underline}, because we came about through natural selection,
a competitive process driven by relative success at capturing scarce
resources and competing for mates, ultimately with the goal of relative
reproductive success. But [[there's **no reason**]{.mark} that **[a
system]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} [is **designed** to]{.mark} pursue [a
goal **would have as its goal**]{.mark},
**[domination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This goes back to our earlier
discussion that the ability to achieve a goal is distinct from what the
goal is.

It just so happens that in products of natural selection, the goal was
winning in reproductive competition. [For an artifact we design,
**there's just no reason** that **would be true**]{.underline}. [This
is]{.underline} sometimes [called the **orthogonality thesis**
in]{.underline} discussions of **[existential risk]{.underline}**,
although [that's just a fancy-schmancy way of referring to Hume's
distinction between our goals and our intelligence.]{.underline}

Now I know that [[there is an argument that says]{.underline}]{.mark},
"[[Wouldn't any]{.mark} intelligence [system have to maximize]{.mark}
its]{.underline} own [[survivability]{.mark}, because if it's given the
goal of X]{.underline}, well, [you can't achieve X if you don't exist,
therefore]{.underline}, as a subgoal to achieving X, [you've got to
maximize your own survival]{.underline} at all costs." I think
**[[that's fallacious]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [It's]{.underline}
certainly [**not** true that **all**]{.underline} complex [**systems**
have to **work toward**]{.underline} their own
**[perpetuation]{.underline}**. [My [**iPhone** **doesn't
take**]{.mark}]{.underline} any [**[steps to resist]{.mark}** my
dropping it into a toilet, or **letting [it run out of
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

You could imagine [**if it could be programmed** like a child **to
whine**]{.underline}, and to cry, and to refuse to do what it's told to
do [as its power level went down]{.underline}. **[We wouldn't buy
one]{.underline}**. And we know in the natural world, [there are plenty
of living systems that sacrifice their own existence for other
goals]{.underline}. When [a bee]{.underline} stings you, its barbed
stinger is dislodged when the bee escapes, killing the bee, but because
the bee [is programmed to maximize the survivability of the colony, not
itself]{.underline}, it willingly sacrifices itself. So [**it is not
true** that]{.underline} by definition [**an intelligent system has to
maximize** its own]{.underline} power or
**[survivability]{.underline}**.

But [[the]{.mark} more [common]{.mark} **existential threat
[scenario]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} not a will to power but
**[[collateral damage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [That [if **an AI**
]{.mark}**system** [is given a]{.mark}]{.underline} single
**[[goal]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [what if [it **relentlessly pursues**
]{.mark}**it** without]{.underline} [consideration of side
effects]{.underline}, including harm to us? [**There are famous
examples** that **I** originally **thought were spoofs**, **but** were
**intended seriously**, like]{.underline} giving an AI system the goal
of [**making** as many **paperclips** as possible]{.underline}, and [so
**it converts all** available **matter** in**to paperclips**, including
our own bodies]{.underline} ([putting aside the fact]{.underline} that
[**we don't need more** efficient **paperclip
manufacturing**]{.underline} than what we already have,
[and]{.underline} that [human **bodies are a** pretty **crummy source of
iron** for paperclips]{.underline}).

[Barely more plausible is the idea]{.underline} that [we]{.underline}
might [give an AI system the goal of curing cancer]{.underline}, and [so
it will  conscript us as involuntary guinea pigs and induce
tumors]{.underline} in all of us, [or that we might give it the goal of
regulating]{.underline} the level of [water behind a dam and it might
flood a town because it was never given the goal of not drowning a
village]{.underline}. 

[**The problem** with [these]{.mark} scenarios is that
**they'[re]{.mark} [self-refuting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They
assume]{.underline} that [an "intelligent" artifact would be designed to
implement a single goal]{.underline}, which is not true of even the
stupid artifacts that we live with. [[When we design **a
car**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we **don't just give the goal of** going
from A to B]{.mark} as **[fast]{.mark}** as possible]{.underline};
**[[we]{.underline}]{.mark}** also [**[install brakes]{.mark}** and
[a]{.mark} steering **[wheel]{.mark}** [and a **muffler**]{.mark} and a
**catalytic converter**]{.underline}. A lot of [[these
**scenarios**]{.underline}]{.mark} seem to
**[[presuppose]{.underline}]{.mark}** both [**[idiocy]{.mark}
[on]{.mark}** the part of the **[designers]{.mark}**]{.underline}

, [who would give a system control over the]{.underline} infrastructure
of the [entire planet without testing it]{.underline} first to see how
it worked, [**[and]{.mark}** an **idiocy on the** part of
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[allegedly intelligent
system]{.underline}**]{.mark}, which would pursue a single goal
regardless of all the other effects. **[This does not
exist]{.underline}** in any human artifact, [let alone one that claims
to be intelligent]{.underline}. [**[Giving an AI]{.mark}** system **[one
vaguely worded]{.mark}**, sketchy **[goal]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
empowering it [with control over the entire]{.underline} infrastructure
of the [planet]{.underline} without testing it first [**[seems]{.mark}**
to me just so **[self-evidently moronic]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [I
don't worry]{.underline} that [engineers have to be warned]{.underline}
against it.

I've quoted Stuart himself, who in an interview made the point well when
he said, "[No one talks about building bridges that don't fall down.
They just call it building bridges]{.underline}." Likewise, [AI that
avoids idiocies like that is just AI, it's not AI with extra
safeguards]{.underline}. **[That's what intelligence consists
of]{.underline}**.

#### No runaway AI

Edward Moore **Geist 15**, MacArthur Nuclear Security Fellow at Stanford
University\'s Center for International Security and Cooperation, Former
Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the RAND Corporation, Doctorate in
History from the University of North Carolina, "Is Artificial
Intelligence Really An Existential Threat to Humanity?", Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists, 8-9,
https://thebulletin.org/2015/08/is-artificial-intelligence-really-an-existential-threat-to-humanity/

Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies is an astonishing book
with an alarming thesis: Intelligent machines are "quite possibly the
most important and most daunting challenge humanity has ever faced." In
it, Oxford University philosopher Nick [[Bostrom]{.underline}]{.mark},
who has built his reputation on the study of "existential risk,"
[[argues]{.underline}]{.mark} forcefully [that **[a]{.mark}**rtificial
**[i]{.mark}**ntelligence [might be]{.mark}]{.underline} the most
[[apocalyptic]{.mark} technology]{.underline} of all. With intellectual
powers beyond human comprehension, he prognosticates, self-improving
artificial intelligences could effortlessly enslave or destroy Homo
sapiens if they so wished. While he expresses skepticism that such
machines can be controlled, Bostrom claims that if we program the right
"human-friendly" values into them, they will continue to uphold these
virtues, no matter how powerful the machines become.

[These views have found an eager audience]{.underline}. In August 2014,
PayPal cofounder and electric car magnate Elon Musk tweeted "Worth
reading Superintelligence by Bostrom. We need to be super careful with
AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes." Bill Gates declared, "I
agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why
some people are not concerned." More ominously, legendary astrophysicist
Stephen [Hawking concurred]{.underline}: "I think [the development
of]{.underline} full [artificial intelligence could spell the end of the
human race]{.underline}." Proving his concern went beyond mere rhetoric,
Musk donated \$10 million to the Future of Life Institute "to support
research aimed at keeping AI beneficial for humanity."

Superintelligence is propounding a solution that will not work to a
problem that probably does not exist, but Bostrom and Musk are right
that now is the time to take the ethical and policy implications of
artificial intelligence seriously. [The [extraordinary claim]{.mark}
that machines can become so intelligent as to gain demonic powers
**[requires extraordinary evidence]{.mark}**, particularly
[since]{.mark} artificial intelligence (AI) [researchers]{.mark} have
[**struggled** to create]{.mark} machines that show [much]{.mark}
evidence of [intelligence at all]{.mark}]{.underline}. While these
investigators' ultimate goals have varied since the emergence of the
discipline in the mid-1950s, the fundamental aim of AI has always been
to create machines that demonstrate intelligent behavior, whether to
better understand human cognition or to solve practical problems. Some
AI researchers even tried to create the self-improving reasoning
machines Bostrom fears. [Through decades of bitter
experience]{.underline}, however, [[they learned]{.mark} not only that
creating [intelligence is **more difficult** than]{.mark} they initially
[expected]{.mark}, but also that [it grows **increasingly
harder**]{.mark} the smarter one tries to become. [Bostrom]{.mark}'s
concept of "superintelligence,"]{.underline} which he defines as "any
intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in
virtually all domains of interest," [[builds upon]{.underline}]{.mark}
similar [**[discredited assumptions]{.mark}** about the nature of
thought]{.underline} that the pioneers of AI held decades ago. A summary
of Bostrom's arguments, contextualized in the history of artificial
intelligence, demonstrates how this is so.

In the 1950s, the founders of the field of artificial intelligence
assumed that the discovery of a few fundamental insights would make
machines smarter than people within a few decades. By the 1980s,
however, they discovered **[[fundamental
limitations]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[show]{.mark} that there will
**[always]{.mark}** be [**diminishing returns** to additional]{.mark}
processing [power and data]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although these
**[[technical hurdles]{.underline}]{.mark}** pose no barrier to the
creation of human-level AI, they [will likely **[forestall]{.mark}**
the]{.underline} sudden [emergence of [an unstoppable
"superintelligence."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The [risks of self-improving]{.mark} intelligent [machines are
**grossly exaggerated**]{.mark} and ought not serve as a **distraction**
from the existential risks we already face]{.underline}, especially
given that the limited AI technology we already have is poised to make
threats like those posed by nuclear weapons even more pressing than they
currently are. Disturbingly, little or no technical progress beyond that
demonstrated by self-driving cars is necessary for artificial
intelligence to have potentially devastating, cascading economic,
strategic, and political effects. While policymakers ought not lose
sleep over the technically implausible menace of "superintelligence,"
they have every reason to be worried about emerging AI applications such
as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's submarine-hunting
drones, which threaten to upend longstanding geostrategic assumptions in
the near future. Unfortunately, Superintelligence offers little insight
into how to confront these pressing challenges.

### AT: Peacekeepers

#### Peacekeeping [fails]{.underline} even with Chinese support

**Autesserre 19 ---** Séverine Autesserre is a French-American author
and researcher. She writes about war and peace, peacebuilding,
peacekeeping, humanitarian aid, the ongoing conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, and African politics. Autesserre, Severine. \"The
Crisis of Peacekeeping: Why the UN Can\'t End Wars.\" Foreign Affairs,

Both the peacekeeping leadership in New York and the rank and file in
the field tend to blame all these woes on the [Security
Council,]{.underline} which [provides]{.underline} **[neither adequate
resources nor clear mandates]{.underline}**. To ensure success, they
say, peacekeepers need more money, more logistical support, and more
people, along with more realistic instructions. And, they add, the
Security Council needs to force countries that contribute troops to stop
interfering with the operations on the ground and instead tell their
officers to respect the UN chain of command. But peacekeepers can\'t
hold the Security Council responsible for all their shortcomings.
Because they are the product of compromise, mandates are always vague,
and they always need to be interpreted. Besides, [even when powerful
states and troop-contributing countries devote **ample resources to a UN
mission**]{.underline}, the resulting efforts often fail.

[The problem is **bigger than mandates and resources**]{.underline}.
Above all, it has to do with two [strategic choices the UN frequently
makes]{.underline}: first, to **[work with national
elites]{.underline}** to stop violence from the top down and, second, to
[push for **quick elections**]{.underline} [as a way to consolidate the
peace.]{.underline} The standard UN approach to ending wars is to host
large, costly conferences in order to strike agreements between
governments and rebel leaders and then organize a national vote and
declare victory. Both tendencies are based on faulty assumptions.

The [weakness of the top-down approach]{.underline} is that [warfare is
often the result]{.underline} of **[not just national or international
competition]{.underline}** but local competition, too. In many conflict
zones, the fight is over such issues as land, water, livestock, and
low-level traditional and administrative power. [In South Sudan, for
example]{.underline}, it is [not only tensions between
President]{.underline} Salva Kiir [and the former vice
president]{.underline} and now rebel leader Riek Machar that [fuel the
current fighting; it is also **clan rivalries**]{.underline} and
countless spats between herders and farmers.

When it comes to the UN\'s fixation on elections, the problem is that
[pushing for a vote before a country is ready **may do more harm than
good**]{.underline}. In Angola in 1992, a premature vote triggered a
resumption of fighting between the ruling party and the main rebel group
(resulting in more deaths in two years than there were in the 17-year
war that the UN had supposedly ended).

Both of [these errors are on **full display**]{.underline} today [in
Congo]{.underline}, the site of both the world\'s deadliest conflict
since World War II and [the largest peacekeeping mission in the
world]{.underline}. The [UN attributes strife there to national and
international factors]{.underline}: a weak central government, tensions
between Congolese President Joseph Kabila and his opponents, and
disputes with neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. [It views
elections]{.underline}, which Kabila has delayed for years, as a [sort
of cure-all. In]{.underline} fact, much of the violence in Congo is
local in origin. Disputes often center on who will control neighboring
land, the exploitation of local mining sites, or the traditional or
administrative power over a village or a district. These tensions often
result in localized fighting in one village or territory but frequently
escalate into generalized conflict across a whole province and even at
times spill over into neighboring countries.

**[Compounding these mistakes]{.underline}** is [the UN\'s overriding
**disdain for all things local**]{.underline}. Because subject-area
experience is valued more than country expertise, [management positions
almost always go to **foreigners**, who usually have **no in-depth
knowledge of their host societies**]{.underline}, cultures, or
institutions. Often, staff lack the language skills to communicate with
local people\--or even, at times, with one another. In the mission in
Cyprus, for example, few peacekeepers speak Greek or Turkish; the same
is true for Arabic or Nuer in South Sudan, Albanian or Serbo-Croatian in
Kosovo, and French or Haitian Creole in Haiti.

[Peacekeepers\']{.underline} **[everyday behavior]{.underline}** only
[adds to the problem]{.underline}. Both the [UN\'s military personnel
and its civilian personnel **live in fortified compounds**]{.underline}
and [gather information]{.underline} mainly [from elites.]{.underline}
Sometimes, [the result is that they thoughtlessly apply universal
templates.]{.underline} For example, on seeing the [success of so-called
disarmament]{.underline}, demobilization, and reintegration programs in
Burundi and Sierra Leone, the [UN attempted similar initiatives in Haiti
and South Sudan, where conditions were different; **the efforts
failed.**]{.underline} At other times, **[dangerous
groupthink]{.underline}** [takes hold. In Congo, for]{.underline}
instance, between the last two rounds of elections, from 2006 to 2011,
[most peacekeepers held a simplistic view of the primary cause of the
violenc]{.underline}e (the illegal exploitation of mineral resources),
the main consequence (sexual abuse of women and girls), [and the best
solution]{.underline} (a stronger state). By [empowering the Congolese
government and its army]{.underline}, the [strategy]{.underline} that
emerged from this view actually **[led to an uptick in human rights
violations]{.underline}**, including sexual abuse.

[The preponderance of foreign staff and foreign ideas]{.underline} also
**[generates resentment]{.underline}** [among local]{.underline}
partners. **[In country after country]{.underline}**, [residents
complain that **peacekeepers are arrogant**]{.underline} and demeaning,
live in lavish accommodations, drive fancy suvs, and [spend far too much
time relaxing and far too little actually doing their jobs]{.underline}.
They [regularly disparage peacekeepers as **neocolonial**]{.underline};
local media portray them as parasites at best and thugs at worst. Fair
or unfair, these views often cause local people to refuse to cooperate
with UN initiatives, even when they support the underlying goals.

[A [slide toward authoritarianism could]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[challenge the current global order by diluting]{.underline}]{.mark}
U.S. influence in [[critical international institutions]{.mark},
[including the United Nations]{.mark}]{.underline} , the World Bank, and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF). [[Democratic decline]{.mark}
would [weaken]{.mark}]{.underline} Western [[efforts within these
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} to advance issues such as Internet
freedom and the responsibility to protect. In the case of Internet
governance, for example, Western democracies support an open, largely
private, global Internet. Autocracies, in contrast, promote state
control over the Internet, including laws and other mechanisms that
facilitate their ability to censor and persecute dissidents. Already
many autocracies, including Belarus, China, Iran, and Zimbabwe, have
coalesced in the "Likeminded Group of Developing Countries" within the
United Nations to advocate their interests. Within the IMF and World
Bank, autocracies---along with other developing nations---seek to water
down conditionality or the reforms that lenders require in exchange for
financial support. If successful, diminished conditionality would
enfeeble an important incentive for governance reforms. In a more
extreme scenario, [the [rising influence of autocracies could enable
these countries to bypass]{.mark}]{.underline} the IMF and World Bank
all together. For example, the Chinese-created Asian Infrastructure and
Investment Bank and the BRICS Bank---which includes Russia, China, and
an increasingly authoritarian South Africa---provide countries with the
potential to bypass existing [[global]{.underline}]{.mark} financial
[[institutions]{.mark} when it suits their interests. [Authoritarian-led
alternatives pose the risk that global]{.mark}]{.underline} economic
[[governance will become fragmented]{.mark} and less
effective]{.underline}.
