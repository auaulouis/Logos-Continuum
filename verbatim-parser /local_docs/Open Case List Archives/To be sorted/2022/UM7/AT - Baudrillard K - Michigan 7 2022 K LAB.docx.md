### Crimsonia = Russia

#### NATO's cyberwar games clearly intend for Crimsonia to resemble Russia.

The imaginary country Berylia (rather similar to Estonia) has been hit
by a cyber assault on its drone manufacturer. [The anonymous attackers
are probably linked to Berylia's enemy **[Crimsonia (very like
Russia).]{.mark}**]{.underline} They seek the laters cyber.

The CCDCOE has been running Locked Shields every year since 2010 with a
similar scenario: the fictional country of Crimsonia which seeks to
dominate the region launches a massive cyber attack against the equally
fictional Berylia. Berylia calls on its NATO allies for help. [Although
the scenario isn't real, the **[attacks]{.mark}** are meant to **[mimic
threats that are]{.mark}**, threat's like **[those NATO faces
from]{.mark}** potentially hostile countries including
**[Russia.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### **[Crimsonia = Russia and China]{.underline}**

#### **Crimsonia is intended as a stand in for Russia AND China.**

How does it work? Organised by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre
of Excellence (CCDCOE) based in Tallinn, Estonia, the Locked Shields
exercise is an annual network defence drill using real-world skills. The
scenario is based on an attack on the fictional country of Berylia -
hypothetically situated in the northern Atlantic - and an adversary
called Crimsonia that is creating some artificial islands. [Although the
adversary is not mapped to a specific NATO adversary, **[Crimsonia has
traits of both Russia and China in its ambitions and
conduct.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The idea is to test multiple teams\'
skills just as they would be tested if they were forced to remotely come
to the aid of NATO ally Berylia as it is targeted by \"a sophisticated
and intense series of cyber attacks\".

### Cyber War Games Good

#### Cyber Defense Exercises (CDX) are an effective tool to evaluate the effectiveness of defense systems and protect infrastructure

**Seker & Seker 20** (Seker, Ensar, and Kamile Nur Seker, Nato
Researcher and Cyber Security Expert. \"Cyber Defense Exercises (CDXs)
as a Testbed for Cyber Security Assessments. June 2020)

**[CDXs are suitable platforms]{.mark}** **[to test the IT and OT
systems]{.underline}** [to be able]{.underline} **[to create better
cyber security and cyber defense solutions]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}
**[In this chapter, we will take a closer look to Locked Shields CDX to
analyze how cyber exercises can be used as testbed
environments.]{.underline}** **[Lesson learned sections and evaluation
of the exercise by all participants, can give ideas to cyber experts to
improve and strengthen their security.]{.underline}** [So, it's fair to
say that]{.underline} **[CDXs can serve as excellent
testbeds]{.mark}**[.]{.underline} **[Cyber experts from different fields
who participate CDX can share their knowledge and experience each other
via these exercises. Figure 3 shows a model for CDXs as a testbed.Locked
Shields (LS) cyber defense exercise is organized annually by the NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE). It's
accepted by the authorities that Locked Shields is the world\'s largest,
most complex and technologically advanced cyber defense exercise. In
Locked Shields, blue teams are created by the NATO member nations or
NATO allied nations.]{.underline}** **[So, it is an international cyber
exercise in state level.]{.underline}** [Locked Shields could be a good
example to show how CDX can be used as testbed]{.underline}. **[Figure
4, 5, 6 shows some statistics about LS CDX.]{.underline}** [**Based on
Figure 4, while there were 9 blue teams in 2012 LS CDX, the number was
increased to 22 in 2018. In Figure 6, the number of participants to LS
CDX also growth (250, 250, 300, 400, 550, 800, 1000 respectively) in
same period.** This means LS CDX was able to attract more nations and
more cyber experts every year.]{.underline} **[According to Figure 5,
numbers of virtual machines were increased dramatically from 25 to 4000
in 6 years.]{.underline}** [It means LS CDX is getting more advance and
complicated each year.]{.underline} **[More than 1000 cybersecurity
experts from around the world have been involved in the 2018 Locked
Shields exercise and the national teams of 21 countries have
participated as blue teams.]{.underline}** [**The exercise involved
around 4000 virtualized systems and more than 2500 attacks by the red
team.** LS CDX]{.underline} **[follows a successful route to
adopting]{.mark}** [information technology
(]{.underline}**[IT]{.mark}**[)]{.underline} **[and]{.mark}**
[operational technology (]{.underline}**[OT)
systems]{.mark}**[.]{.underline} [**The organizers of LS CDX succeeded
in providing an interesting and complex environment for the blue teams
to defend these against an intensive attack campaign. While
blue**]{.underline} **[teams]{.mark}** [can put their skills to test,
they]{.underline} **[can]{.mark}** [also]{.underline} **[analyze and
test new technologies in a safe and secure environment.]{.mark}** **[In
the context of LS13, the following areas were most challenging for the
blue teams: Defending web applications. Detecting custom malicious code.
Mitigating BGP hijacking attacks. Initiating efficient information
sharing. In LS14, the most challenging areas are for blue teams:
Filtering and detecting malicious traffic over IPv6. Monitoring for
malicious WAN route changes and preventing BGP
hijacking/man-in-the-middle. Protecting custom web applications. Finding
pre-planted malicious programs and coping with RT‟s Anti-Virus evasion
techniques (publicly available free tools were in most cases enough to
evade AV solutions). Sharing actionable information with other blue
teams. In 2015,]{.underline}** **[new attack vectors included ICS/SCADA
systems and Windows 8 and 10 operating systems, as well as an element of
active defense. In 2017 the blue teams were tasked to maintain the
services and networks of a military air base of a fictional country,
which, according to the exercise scenario, experienced severe attacks on
its electric power grid system, unmanned aerial vehicles, military
command and control systems, critical information infrastructure
components and other operational infrastructure]{.underline}**. [The
size and scope of technologies, networks and devices used in Locked
Shields 2017 has increased considerably -- leading to more attacks and
specialized systems involved.]{.underline} [Specialized systems enable
teams to practice the defense of systems that they are not working with
on a regular basis. However, in the modern threat landscape]{.underline}
**[incidents with specialized systems may]{.mark}**
[potentially]{.underline} **[have a profound effect on]{.mark}** [a
military mission or]{.underline} **[the entire society]{.mark}[. In
2018,]{.underline}** **[the attacks cause severe disruptions in the
operation of the electric power grid, 4G public safety networks, drone
operation and other critical infrastructure components. While the aim of
the tech game is to maintain the operation of various systems under
intense pressure,]{.underline}** [the strategic part]{.underline}
**[should serve as a forum to understand the impact of decisions made at
the]{.mark}** [strategic and]{.underline} **[policy
level]{.mark}**[.]{.underline} **[When we analyze LS CDX, based on the
statistics and After Action Reports (ARR), it can be said
that,]{.underline}** **[the exercise improved itself during the years
and created a suitable]{.mark}** [testbed]{.underline} **[platform for
cyber experts]{.mark}**[.]{.underline} **[Via this platform,
professionals and decision makers in cyber were able to share their
knowledge and experience with each other and test their defense skills
and strategies against new technologies and new attacks. For future
studies, a technical tool will be developed on the scoring system, which
is a problematic issue for CDXs, and on the standardization of this
system and the development of a fairer system.]{.underline}** **[The
integration of new technologies such as power grid systems and drone
control systems into CDXs is a critical issue. With the integration of
these special systems into the exercises, the existing problems and the
methods to be followed are another work to be done in the
future.]{.underline} [The importance of defense exercises is increasing
day by day.]{.mark}** [It would be possible for]{.underline}
**[countries]{.mark}** [to be]{.underline} **[involved in]{.mark}**
[the]{.underline} **[global cyber defense exercises]{.mark}** [in the
international arena, spreading the development and implementation of
their own CDX platforms on a national basis, and allocating higher
budget figures to the planning and development of these exercises could
contribute to]{.underline} **[achieving beneficial outcomes in the
future]{.mark}** [to create stronger cyber defense systems**. The
emphasis on these exercises on the national and 18 international scene
will**]{.underline} **[provide benefits in terms of uncovering the
vulnerabilities]{.mark}** [in the area of the cyberspace, as well as the
revitalization of the cyber defense awareness, and also the integrated
technologies that can be followed in exercises related to the cyber
defense.]{.underline}

#### Data from cyber conflict modeling can be useful in research and development of new cyber defense technologies

**Granasen et al 19** (November 2019, Granåsen, Magdalena, Swedish
Defense Research Agency, Huskaj, Gazmend, Swedish Defense University,
Varga, Stefan, Royal Institute of Technology, "Data Collection and
Research in CDXs: Command and Control, Cyber Situational Awareness and
Intelligence Perspectives on Cyber Defense," 24th International Command
and Control Research and Technology Symposium)

[The]{.underline} **[results showed that]{.mark}** [the]{.underline}
**[data collected]{.mark}** **[for the case study of the Swedish blue
team during LS19]{.underline}** [**is meaningful** **and of sufficient
quality for further analysis**]{.mark} [within the three research
themes.]{.underline} **[Some issues concerning the quality of data were
raised in the results section. These and other issues are further
discussed in the current section. Concerning data quality, it can be
concluded that]{.underline}** [data loss in the collected data will not
impair the ability to conduct the analyses needed in order to explore
the research themes]{.underline} **[C2 , CSA and
intelligence.]{.underline}** **[Analysis of different data sources in
conjunction will be necessary in order to make sense of the data. The
language in chat logs was sparse, and although the researcher is
acquainted with the terminology used in these logs, it does not make
sense until correlated with other information such as observations or
published threat reports. As the exercise was organized by the CCDCOE,
the research team only had part control of the data. This is the reason
why data on the progress of threat reporting, score and network overview
(available services) was collected through screenshots.]{.underline}**
**[It will be a time-consuming task to manually transfer these
screenshots to a format that can be further analyzed. Still, the
research team assessed that a screenshot of the information was better
than not having access to this information at all. Using a
well-established CDX such as Locked Shields for research is
cost-efficient in that the scenario and scenario injects (including a
70-person red team), set-up, gamenet (including support personnel),
communication infrastructure, participant invitation, scoring system,
exercise control personnel and a lot of the administration already are
in place.]{.underline}** **[Furthermore, Locked Shields has gained a
reputation that attracts very proficient cyber security experts, while
it is likely that these people would not feel equally attracted to
participate in a pure research experiment. From a Swedish perspective,
one of the greatest benefits of participation in LS19 was the ability to
meet and work with people from other organizations. Research within an
international CDX clearly entails lack of experimental control and
reduced access to data for the researchers, as well as continuous
adjustments to fit the data collection to the exercise
schedule]{.underline}**. [However,]{.underline} **[it]{.mark}**
[also]{.underline} **[entails highly motivated, skilled and competitive
participants]{.mark}**[, and]{.underline} **[a far more complex exercise
environment than a normal research project would be able to
finance]{.mark}**[.]{.underline} **[The initial results from the surveys
indicated that]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[exercise as a
whole]{.mark}** [seemed to have]{.underline} **[progressed smoothly,
with positive ratings of teamwork, information sharing and]{.mark}**
[strategy, as well as]{.underline} **[cyber situational
awareness]{.mark}**[.]{.underline} **[The high performance score further
emphasizes the success of the team. It is therefore clear that the case
studied is well suited for analysis of how a successful team develops
its strategy and what functional structures for coordination in a cyber
defence team may look like. The participation of the research team can
also be viewed as a success story. The team was engaged from the very
beginning of the preparatory phase of the exercise. In this way, the
researchers were able to learn contextual factors, such as the team
leadership view on issues such as strategy and coordination, which may
have affected the final outcome of the exercise, that were not
necessarily written down or documented in any other way. The researchers
were given the opportunity to describe their initial planning, which
included the aim to be as non-intrusive as possible. This means that the
data collection did not include any \"freezes\" in the exercise in order
to collect data, neither were there any plans to collect excessive
unnecessary amounts of data (video recordings, key-logging or
screenshots). The research team explained their measures to preserve the
participants' anonymity (if this was requested).]{.underline}** [The
nature of the meetings, e.g., personal interactions between]{.underline}
**[exercise]{.mark}** [participants and the research team]{.underline}
**[contributed to mutual trust and confidence building]{.mark}**[. **The
cordial relationship between the researchers and the participants
probably contributed to the high survey response rates and a benevolent
attitude to answering the questions. Having three persons in the
research team meant a high workload, and an appreciation for that every
team activity would not be observed. It should be noted that there could
be a limit as to how many researchers are feasible for data collection
to reduce the 16 risk of collecting too much data, duplicates of data,
or disturbing the observed team. The inclusion of CSA-related questions
in the team's ordinary reporting procedure provided a less intrusive
method for collecting SA-related data than if a traditional probing
measure such as SAGAT or SART had been used. There was no indication of
that the inference of SA-related questions in the internal reporting
template disturbed the sub-teams. The internal reporting template was
designed and administered by the reporting team, and the sub-teams were
not aware of that some of the questions in the internal reporting
template were induced by the research team. The research team may have
positively affected the SA and even the performance in the team, in that
they directed the team's attention towards issues useful to include in
the threat reports as well as for the understanding of the threats. This
is, however, a risk with all data collection. For instance, the presence
of observers may affect the behavior of the team, and the questions in
the start-up survey may direct the team's focus towards the issues
mentioned in the survey. For integrity reasons as well as risk of data
overload, the research team made a deliberate decision to not to capture
network activity. It is assessed that network activity logs would
produce a lot of data of which only a small part would be useful.
Subsequently, a great deal of analysis would be required, and there
would probably not be a great deal of added value for the research
themes.**]{.underline} [**For the current paper, a pluralist methodology
\[31\] was employed, where different types of data were collected in
order to address the research themes from several perspectives**. It
needs to be acknowledged that some data will almost always suffer from
some data loss (for instance surveys), while other data is more
complete, but requiring quite a lot of analytic effort and needing to be
combined with other data in order to interpret it (i.e. communication
logs). Some data is based on subjective assessment (surveys,
observations).]{.underline} **[However who is best suited to assess the
workload, if not those who are experiencing it? The pluralist approach
finds answers in combinations and comparisons of data. The dataset will
suit the analysis within all three research themes, and the same data
items may be combined and analyzed in different ways to correspond to
research questions within different themes]{.underline}**. **[6. Summary
and Conclusions]{.underline}** **[The objective of this paper was to
explore the possibilities to]{.underline} [collect meaningful data for
research on]{.mark} [Command and Control (C2 ) Cyber Situational
Awareness (CSA), and]{.underline}** **[Intelligence in conjunction with
a]{.mark}**[n interorganizational]{.underline} **[cyber defense
team]{.mark}** [during a cyber defense exercise. The purpose of the data
collection was to explore the possibilities to conduct research within
these research areas. A variety of carefully selected data collection
methods specifically tailored to suit the needs for relevant data for
our research fields of interest was employed. Our research has shown
that a]{.underline} **[CDX]{.mark}** [indeed]{.underline} **[provided a
good opportunity to collect pertinent data to analyze]{.mark}** [Command
and Control,]{.underline} **[Cyber Situational Awareness and
Intelligence related research questions]{.mark}**[.]{.underline} **[The
trove of collected data will be used to write papers according to our
research themes. The working titles of some future papers in the works
are: i) Exploring the development of coordination structures and
strategy in a cyber defense team, ii) Acquiring Cyber Situational
Awareness in a cyber defense team, and iii) Intelligence in support of a
defensive cyberspace operation. The results obtained in this paper is
further expected to be useful for refining data collection methods for
CDXs.]{.underline}**

## Baudrillard Indicts

#### Baudrillard's logic is faulty, it doesn't take into account the thing to be simulated is equally affected by the real. War games and planning aren't simulations, they're the same as war, no meaning is lost.

**Von Hilgers 12** (Phillip, Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of
the History of Science at Harvard University, Managing Director at
Meetrics, "*War Games: A History of War on Paper*," Chapter 4:
Historiography in Real Time (2012), translated by Ross Benjamin,
6/23/22 - FI)

The Real of Simulations For a long time, media theories have burgeoned
regarding how media seem to capture the world in simulations. The [[fact
that media]{.mark} themselves [are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[not based on
virtualities but on realities]{.underline}]{.mark} --- which even former
radio officers occasionally find hard to master --- is [[often
overlooked]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus sociologist Jean
[[Baudrillard]{.mark} has [elevated the simulacrum to the central
concept for]{.mark}]{.underline} [the [description of
the]{.mark}]{.underline} state of the [[West]{.mark}ern
world]{.underline} --- [[without]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[asking
about the historical development of the simulation]{.mark}. [For
Baudrillard]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[simulacra have]{.underline}]{.mark},
in an escalating fashion, first [taken up the play with the
real,]{.underline} then taken the place of its appearances, and finally
themselves [[created a basis]{.mark} that is [no longer dependent on the
real]{.mark}]{.underline}. 32 In particular, the referential system of
the image has thereby undergone a transformation that leads from
reflection to self-referentiality. 33 [Th[e logic]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of this interpretation, however, implies that the real is excluded
from the]{.underline}]{.mark} [[simulation]{.mark} media [and their
history]{.mark} is [effaced]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[But]{.underline} [it
is]{.underline}]{.mark} [precisely [the development of war games that
shows how]{.mark}]{.underline} much [[the real intrudes into the
simulation media]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is the [case
[when]{.mark}ever]{.underline} [[the simulation reaches its limit and
suffers disturbances]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[thing]{.mark} to
be]{.underline} [[simulated is equally affected by the]{.mark} intrusion
of the [real]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [even if it]{.underline}]{.mark}
[sometimes [takes on the technical forms of the
simulation]{.mark}.]{.underline} In particular,
[[effects]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of the real emerge at the
communicative]{.mark} and mediatic [level]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the
military political war game, a Prussian legation councilor ' s ability
to empathize might underlie the position of the Polish foreign minister.
However, the communication practices that are thereby tested could not
be more real. [It is [in the war game]{.mark} that [the difference
between simulation and communication comes]{.mark} most clearly [to
light]{.mark}.]{.underline} Though [[infantry units in the]{.mark}
war]{.underline} [game]{.underline} that do not shoot with live
ammunition --- or if they do, then only at targets --- and tank
battalions that operate, in the absence of available tanks, with mockups
or entirely on paper exclude a world of real pitfalls from the outset,
their signal battalions [[do not proceed]{.mark} any [differently
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the war game than in war:]{.mark}]{.underline}
" The headquarters or the command post is set up in houses, in the open,
in vehicles or tents. [[The signals]{.mark} personnel
[set]{.mark}]{.underline} [[up]{.mark} the required wire and radio
connections [so]{.mark} that [during the exercise
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [entire communications [operation]{.mark}
including the messengers [proceeds as in]{.mark}]{.underline} [[a
war.]{.mark} "]{.underline} 34 To [make the situation
appear]{.underline} to the remaining battalions [" as in a
war,]{.underline} " recourse could be had to an old alliance between the
film industry and the military. It should be recalled that the chief of
the supreme army command, Erich Ludendorff, had already founded
Universal-Film AG (UFA) in 1917 for propaganda and psychological
warfare. The war game, however, made use not of film ' s contents but of
its production methods --- indeed, so much so that the general of the
signal corps, Praun, would use the word " film " as a synonym for " war
game " : " Mostly the director \[of the war game\] will have assembled
his ' insertions 'in a sort of ' screenplay, 'according to which the
film then proceeds. " 35 " Insertions "are measures undertaken by the
war game director during meticulous plans in the run-up to the game or
at the same point through the deployment of intercept companies so as to
confront the war game participants with exceptional situations on the
one hand and optimize one ' s own signals intelligence on the other
hand. 36 The borrowings from film thereby serve a form of psychological
warfare that is not directed against opponents but subjects one ' s own
battalions to stress tests: The [[staff must be occupied constantly in a
warlike form]{.underline}]{.mark}, thus to some extent put under
pressure. It is therefore the main art of the director to [[generate
realistically]{.underline}]{.mark} [the numerous "
[frictions]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[that occur]{.mark} continuously [in
w]{.mark}ar]{.underline}. The director must have prepared these well in
the form of " insertions. "Among these are the abundance of reports that
amass, especially during critical situations, [[false
reports]{.underline}, " [rumors]{.underline}, "[outof-date
orders]{.underline} [and reports]{.underline}, [deceptive
communications]{.underline}, [wishes of the
neighbors]{.underline},]{.mark} [[inquiries of higher-ranking command
posts]{.underline}]{.mark} --- these should rain down on the staff and
[[force the participants]{.underline}]{.mark} day and night [[to make
swift evaluations]{.mark} and discern the]{.underline}
[essential.]{.underline} Among the countless individual events of war
are [wire faults, unintelligible]{.underline} [telegraphs and radio
reports, decoding missions, prisoner interrogations,
evaluation]{.underline} [of aerial images, assessments of the enemy
demanded by superior posts, supplying]{.underline}
[missions.]{.underline} A captured enemy map with writing in a foreign
language can also perplex the responsible specialists. Such specialists,
or individual commanders or a whole section of the staff can be
completely or temporarily lost in the decisive moment, while the staff
operation must continue as in a case of emergency ( Ernstfall). Such
losses, caused by direct hits, paratroopers or partisans, then force the
remaining staff to instructive assistance. 37

#### Their theory of simulation is wrong and baseless nonsense - Reality exists 

**Schwabach 3** (Aaron Schwaback @ Jefferson School of Law - Professor
of Law and Director of Center for Global Legal Studies, J.D., University
of California at Berkeley Published : 2003, \<jonah\> \<IKS\> "Kosovo:
Virtual War and International Law," DOA: 7-8-16, pages 1-21)

Baudrillard presents fewer problems of interpretation; his word is
simulacrum (simulacre), which he uses in more or less the same sense,
albeit with more elaboration, that it is ordinarily used.10 [Academics
are often criticized for over-reliance on opaque jargon. In comparison
to many of his compatriots and their American emulators, Baudrillard
indulges in jargon only sparingly. For the most part, he **writes the
most arrant nonsense** in a clear, readily accessible
style]{.underline}. His basic point is that the Gulf War was not a war
but the simulacrum of a war; it happened not on the battlefield but on
television. All of the traditional trappings of the buildup to war were
presented, even grotesquely exaggerated, on television; at the end,
however, we (the audience) were deprived of the final battle, left with
neither victory for the Allies nor defeat for Saddam Hussein. In light
of the bold promise of the book's title, this is rather disappointing.
Rather than arguing unequivocally that the entire war was a fraud
perpetrated upon the television-viewing public, [Baudrillard is simply
**nattering on** again about simulacra.]{.underline} (At one point,
though, he does suggest that "\[o\]ne is reminded of Capricorn One," a
movie about a government conspiracy to fake a Mars landing in a film
studio and present it to the public as news.)11
[Baudrillard]{.underline}, after all, is a man who, like his compatriot
and predecessor Descartes, [spends an inordinate amount of time
wondering whether he exists]{.underline}. Unlike Descartes, however, [he
is not convinced that he exists merely because he thinks that he does.
His identity]{.underline}, [and that of everything and everyone else, is
**lost in a kaleidoscope of endlessly precessing simulacra** that
ultimately preclude the existence of any baseline reality]{.underline}.
The Gulf War is not then real or unreal in any absolute sense, because
there is no ultimate "reality." It is simply less real than some things
and more real than others. (Baudrillard draws many comparisons between
"events" in the war and television commercials, for example.) The Gulf
War (or simulacrum of war) is thus at least as real as international
law, and by extension so is the Kosovo war; I shall therefore have to
continue writing about all three. [Baudrillard begins by asserting that
"It might have been supposed that the defection of the Eastern Bloc
would have opened up new spaces of freedom for war by unlocking
deterrence. Nothing of the sort]{.underline}\[.\]"12
[Baudrillard]{.underline}, writing these words at the beginning of
1991,13 [was **simply too impatient**]{.underline}. As the world has
since learned to its dismay, the defection of the Eastern Bloc and
subsequent breakup of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia has opened up a
great number of new spaces of freedom for war, most notably in the
expression of the ethnic conflicts previously repressed by authoritarian
Communist regimes. [Baudrillard himself would undoubtedly deplore the
idea that the facts of his life might be responsible for his
opinions]{.underline}. But his reactions on such topics as America and
superpower conflict (and, as we shall see later, Arabs and Islam) are
often surprisingly conventional for a person of his age, gender and
nationality. Baudrillard was born in Reims in 1929.14 He would thus have
been three or four years old when Hitler came to power, fifteen during
the liberation of France, and sixteen when World War II ended. The
bilateral Allied/Axis conflict was almost immediately replaced with a
similar conflict between the more or less free-market countries of the
West and the communist countries of the Soviet bloc. As a result, it is
perhaps natural that Baudrillard would see a world with two opposing
ideological camps as a prerequisite for war, or at least for war of the
sort to which he is accustomed. [At the time of communism's collapse, he
found it difficult to believe in the possibility of war in a post-Soviet
world]{.underline}. By the time Baudrillard opined that the collapse of
the Eastern bloc had opened up no new spaces of freedom for war, in
fact, Croatia and Slovenia had already begun to make secessionist
noises; six months later the first of Yugoslavia's ethnic cleansing wars
would begin. The Romanian revolution (or its simulacrum) had already
taken place, as Baudrillard repeatedly acknowledges, after his fashion.
15 Iraq's invasion of Kuwait could have been designed as a test case for
the role of the United States in the post-Cold War world, as the first
major act of territorial aggression in which the response of the Soviet
Union (which itself would not last out the year) was more or less
insignificant. [Thus, simulacrum or not, the Gulf War was important
historically]{.underline}. Baudrillard himself says, somewhat
inconsistently in light of his other conclusions, that "what is at stake
in this one is war itself: its status, its meaning, its future."16 [Much
of what strikes Baudrillard as different about the Gulf
War]{.underline}, though, [is actually not new at all]{.underline}. For
example, [he sees the role of hostages as one of the Gulf War's novel
qualities: "The hostage has taken the place of the warrior. He has
become the principal actor, the simulacral protagonist, or rather, in
his pure inaction, the protagoniser of non-war."]{.underline}17 Later,
in Kosovo, the Serbian government would make an entire civilian
population hostage. Yet [the use of hostages in war,]{.underline} even
on this scale, [is hardly new; warring parties have always viewed
hostages "as exchange value and liquidity."]{.underline}18 [Using
hostages as human shields and bargaining chips is **as old as war
itself**.]{.underline} It is [when Baudrillard likens the plight of the
audience to the plight of the hostages]{.underline}, though, that [he
begins to **exhibit the indifference to human suffering** for which he
has so often been criticized]{.underline}.19 He writes that "[all of
us]{.underline} \[are\] [information hostages on the world media
stage]{.underline}....20 [We are already all strategic hostages in situ;
our site is the screen on which we are virtually bombarded day by day,
even while serving as exchange value]{.underline}."21 [It is this
element of the concept of simulacral war that is **most difficult to
accept**. The **difference between the hostage and the viewer** **should
be obvious** even to one who affects to disbelieve in his own existence;
the viewer can **simply turn off the television** and thus **escape**
his or her predicament]{.underline}. [**Nor do the viewers have
significant "exchange value,"** unless the governments concerned would
discontinue the charade of war if they thought no one was watching, or
unless the simulacrum exists only to the degree it is
perceived]{.underline}. Thus [the claim that "\[t\]he complement of the
unconditional simulacrum in the field is to train everyone in the
unconditional reception of broadcast simulacra" makes sense **only if
one also accepts** that the simulacrum experienced by the viewer is
identical to that experienced by the viewed]{.underline}. Those who
believe in the reality of human suffering are likely to react to this
idea with a certain amount of hostility, however. This reaction can only
be exacerbated by the assertion that "it is \[the hostages'\] virtual
death that is at issue, not their real death.

#### Baudrillard is just old and coping, while being nostalgic about the past, rambling to his grandchildren "back in my day blah blah blah" but doesn't propose to do anything because he knows he can't. Dhamee no date (Yousuf Dhamee, a rhizome, Publication date: Lost Futures, A Critique of Baudrillard, Cyber Space Hyper Test and Critical Theory, <https://cyberartsweb.org/cpace/theory/ydbaud.html>) 

In The Precession of Simulacra Jean Baudrillard attempts to disentangle
the phenomenon that the Post-Structuralist movement simultaneously
identified, decried and helped popularize: the disappearance of the
real. In examining the cultural climate of the West following 1970
Baudrillard finds a world where representation through a surplus of
images has obscured all former notions of truth. The annihilation of the
real has become a manifestation of Marx\'s nightmare of the commodity
fetish. He portrays the United States, in particular, as a grim
militaristic state controlled by the media\'s manipulation of images.
Baudrillard finds himself disempowered by the endlessly proliferating
images which confound the real. [**His position becomes that of [the
male hysteric]{.mark}** , due in part to the fact that intellect and
reason cannot make sense of the post-modern \"world of hallucinations\"
where image, reality, and surface representation blur into each other.
**Baudrillard in a sense [writes himself out of his own text]{.mark}. In
a world without truth the [theorist]{.mark}/the semiotician/the
intellectual (indeed the university itself[) becomes irrelevant]{.mark},
if not totally impotent.**]{.underline} The idea of the loss of meaning
is inherent in the concept of the simulacrum . Here the idea of an
accurate copy becomes to a certain extent passé. Baudrillard states that
we are removed from the binary which sets up copy and original; there
are only copies of copies. In fact he takes the notion farther: the
simulacra exists as a copy which has no original. According to
Baudrillard the \"imitation\" can, in fact, precede the original. This
results in a world without depth, a place where reality is only an
endless interplay of surfaces. Simulations are produced in order to hide
the fact that there is no original, no real. Baudrillard\'s intent is
not to expose the falseness of the simulated real, but to lament the
passing of the actual real. He seems to find the depthless world of
images oppressive. He writes of the \"murderous power of images,\" \"the
mirror of madness, and \"the blackmail of the truth.\" His emotionally
charged prose reflects a hysteria that derives from powerlessness. The
loss of reference points, which results from the death of originality,
contributes to the confusion that marks the modern world. As Baudrillard
points out, the charm of a simulation lies in being able to distinguish
copy from original. \"Because it is difference that constitutes the
poetry of the map and the charm of the territory, the magic of the
concept and the charm of the real.\" The loss of distinction between the
two leads to the loss of truth. [**Baudrillard, who [holds a
romanticized view of the real]{.mark}, seems [nostalgic for a time when
meaning existed]{.mark}.** \"By crossing into a space whose curvature is
no longer that of the real, nor that of truth, the era of simulation is
inaugurated by a liquidation of all referentials.\" **This statement
appears problematic because [he never can]{.mark} quite [prove]{.mark}
that [meaning]{.mark} has [ever existed and]{.mark} therefore [appears
to rewrite history]{.mark} in order [to make]{.mark} [others believe in
depth]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For example, in his discussion of the
Iconoclasts he assumes that the smashers of images were working under
[his own set of cultural assumptions. \"If they could have believed that
these images only obfuscated or masked the Platonic Idea of God, there
would have been no reason to destroy them . . . But their metaphysical
despair came from the idea that the image didn\'t conceal anything at
all , and that these images were in essence not images, but perfect
simulacra . . . \" **Baudrillard, like a flawed Freudian, can be seen
projecting his own beliefs onto the people he studies**. **By refusing
to allow the Iconoclasts their own truth, he falls victim to the same
cultural prejudices he decries in others**. At this point Baudrillard
resembles the ethnologists he so roundly criticizes.]{.underline} Even
if truth\'s existence is taken for granted (in a bygone era) Baudrillard
does not conclusively show how meaning could be empowering. [**Part of
[his problem with the simulacra stems from]{.mark} an intellectual
background heavily [steep]{.mark}ed in [Marxism.]{.mark} [Marxists
place]{.mark} a great deal of [importance on]{.mark} the
[process]{.mark} of [production.]{.mark} [Simulation]{.mark} can be seen
[a]{.mark}s [stripping production of]{.mark} its [meaning]{.mark}.**
When production becomes unreal its ultimate object, \"the product\" is
stripped of value. **This reality would [in turn strip Marxism of its
relevance,]{.mark} a fundamental problem for many Post-Structuralists,
who like Baudrillard have important ties with the Left.** What exactly
does it mean to be a Post-Structuralist and a Marxist? **The liquidation
of truth [makes political resistance]{.mark} seem somewhat
[futile]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} **[Baudrillard,]{.mark} significantly fails
to offer a means of fighting the collapse of reason, and in his writings
the theorist is [relegated to the role of commentator]{.mark}**:
Baudrillard is only able to announce that the apocalypse has
begun.]{.underline}

Should we the regret the dazzling ascent of this writer in the
Anglo-American world over the last decade? Certainly if the quality of a
writer in the social sciences is to be assessed only by the validity of
his or her propositions there is reason for regretting Baudrillard's
success. [**[Baudrillard has been]{.mark} wrong---[spectacularly
wrong---]{.mark}about a lot of things[.]{.mark}** One thinks of his
prediction of the [**impossibility of the Gulf war**;]{.mark} his
assertion that **[America is already utopia;]{.mark} his [reactionary
thesis]{.mark}** that the strength of the **[feminine is
seduction]{.mark}**; his eccentric defence of the concert against
quadrophonic sound which is predicated in the argument that **[Mozart
was never]{.mark} intended [to be heard]{.mark} through
[electronic]{.mark} systems of reproduction; and his [unsupported
statement that the body]{.mark} has become [a mere extension of
network]{.mark} television**. And one thinks of these things casually,
without systematically sifting through the careening waves of
Baudrillard's prose for other hostages to fortune or bad prophecies.
**In short, [Baudrillard fails the validity
test]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, it is by no means clear
that validity is the only or even the most important criterion to assess
the significance of an author's work. Other criteria such as courage and
sympathy are also relevant. In these respects Baudrillard is on stronger
ground. The success of his publications in the English-speaking world
since the 1980s suggests that his main themes of simulation and the
seductiveness of consumer culture have found sympathy with a large
audience of readers[. **[Baudrillard]{.mark} may be [wrong more often
than he is right]{.mark},** but he has unquestionably struck the
appropriate mood with which to approach questions of consumer
culture.]{.underline}

#### Hyperreality is itself postmodern, and fails to offer a critical understanding of culture other than explaining the obvious. Reality and meaning exists equally as it did in the past, the only thing that changed is the medium of exchange.

**King 98**(Anthony King, Department of Sociology at the University of
Exeter, 1998, Philosophy and Social Criticism vol 24 no. 6, A critique

This article criticizes the concept of hyperreality which is central to
Baudrillard's later writings and, in doing so, intends to make a wider
contribution to debates about postmodernism. In particular, I want to
argue that Baudrillard's hyperreality is an example of postmodern
sociology, rather than a sociology of postmodernism. **[By that, I mean
that the notion of [hyperreality is not]{.mark}, in the end, [a critical
concept]{.mark} providing a means by [which sociologists might
analyse]{.mark} contemporary [cultural]{.mark} change; rather, the
notion of [hyperreality is itself postmodern,]{.mark}]{.underline}** 48
demonstrating those very features of nihilism, fragmentation and doubt,
' which it highlights as central to recent social transformations. The
examination of the concept of hyperreality is intended to show that such
'postmodern sociologies' are limited and that they can be encompassed
(and dialectically superseded) by a sociology of postmodernism. The
critique of hyperreality (A) The sociological inadequacy of hyperreality
Baudrillard is undoubtedly correct to point to the importance of the
television as a central element in contemporary culture. It is a
startling development that in the last 30 years practically every
individual in capitalist countries is able to witness footage of events
from almost anywhere around the globe. It is also true that this footage
is invariably misleading, even though it is apparently so compelling and
'realistic'[. Television is only tangentially connected with the
realities it seeks to portray as well as contrasting dramatically with
the social experience of the viewers; **[we]{.mark} 52 witness riots,
wars and [massacres]{.mark} as they occur [from the comfort of our
living-rooms]{.mark}. [However,]{.mark} from these admittedly curious
features, [Baudrillard]{.mark} leaps suddenly and [unjustifiably]{.mark}
to the [claim that there is no longer any
reality.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The television screen creates a 'false'
reality and it is in that reality that we now live. However, the
television does not create a false reality either in its representation
of the world or in its reception by viewers. [Television coverage is
determined by the cultural norms of the society to which it broadcasts
and by those involved in the production of television. **Thus [any
footage is an interpretation]{.mark} of the world [and]{.mark} as such
[it is necessarily limited]{.mark}.** It is certainly true that
programme makers try to render this interpretation of the world as
compelling as possible to attract viewers and to sustain their claims
but **[those images are always and necessarily embedded in social
discourse, which is itself related to the historic development of the
society]{.mark}. The [images are not then free-floating]{.mark}, mere
[simulacra but]{.mark}, on the contrary[, concrete moves in a language
game]{.mark}.**]{.underline} They refer not so much to the reality of
the situations they portray but rather to the society to which they
communicate these images. [**Similarly the [viewers]{.mark} of
television programmes [do not regard these images as
empty]{.mark}**[,]{.mark}]{.underline} referenceless and fragmentary. On
the contrary, just as the creation of these images was embedded in the
interpretative practice of making sense of the world so do the viewers
try to interpret these images in such a way that they will be able to
make sense of their world. Whether the programme be a soap opera or news
footage, the viewers interpret the images according to their cultural
understandings (see, for instance, Fiske and Hartley, 1984; Hall, 1980;
Featherstone, 1988: 220-1, 1991: 5, 11), although those understandings
are under constant revision in order to make sense of new information.
[**Thus rather than becoming the primary and prior cultural factor in
contemporary society, the television is embedded in and dependent upon
pre-existing and historically produced understandings and discourses**.5
Furthermore, the footage does not exist above and beyond the lives of
viewers but, as the briefest autobiographical consideration will reveal,
**[the television is employed as a resource]{.mark}, where new
interpretations derived from its footage are used in the renegotiation
of social relations and understandings. [Viewers discuss what they watch
and make use of what they see to make sense of their own lives.]{.mark}
The argument for the fundamentally interpretative nature of the
television and, therefore, its [fundamental unoriginality]{.mark} as a
cultural form [undercuts]{.mark} Baudrillard's notion of [hyperreality
at an empirical level]{.mark}.**]{.underline} **In short, the television
just does not represent the ontological transformation of culture which
he envisages. [The production and consumption of the [television
operates in the same interpretative manner as]{.mark} the production and
consumption of [literature, theatre]{.mark} and, indeed, oral 53
story-telling.]{.underline}** All these methods of communication have to
operate according to the same interpretative norms, typical of all human
interaction, for the very reason that they are all primarily linguistic.
Baudrillard's failure to recognize the fundamentally interpretative
nature of television suggests some deeper philosophical and, in
particular, deeper epistemological shortcomings in his theories. The
recognition of Baudrillard's epistemological weakness brings us to the
second, philo- sophical strand of the argument against the notion of
hyperreality which will demonstrate that Baudrillard's notion of
hyperreality is founded in an unsustainable Cartesianism.

#### Baudrillard's theory is false, It misrepresents Simulacra and Simulation, It is a work of hypocrisy and The Matrix fails to represent his overall theoretical position.

"The Matrix is surely the kind of film about the matrix that the matrix
would have been able to produce." These were the infamous words that
Jean Baudrillard used to break his silence on The Matrix movies in a
2004 interview with [Le Nouvel
Observateur](https://baudrillardstudies.ubishops.ca/the-matrix-decoded-le-nouvel-observateur-interview-with-jean-baudrillard/).
[Baudrillard's idea of simulation]{.underline} --- which we explored
in-depth [in a previous
instalment](https://www.thelivingphilosophy.com/baudrillard-simulation/) ---
was the primary inspiration behind the Wachowski siblings' movie series.
His 1981 book *Simulacra and Simulation *was not merely [a prop in *The
Matrix*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6R94keJcHk) but was the main
inspiration for the movies and was required reading for the whole cast.
After the release of the first movie the Wachowskis reached out to
Baudrillard inviting him to work on the sequels but he turned down the
offer and in this interview we learn why. [[As it turns out
Baudrillard]{.mark}]{.underline} --- the "high priest of postmodernism"
--- hated the movies. In this article we are going to look at the three
reasons he gives for this disdain:1[. It misrepresents *Simulacra and
Simulation*, 2. [It is a work of hypocrisy and 3]{.underline}. [The
Matrix fails to represent his overall theoretical position]{.underline}.
[And]{.underline}]{.mark} [[following that we are going to look at why
Baudrillard is wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}. #1 The Misrepresentation of
The Matrix In 2004, a year after the release of the third Matrix movie,
Baudrillard finally broke his silence on the Wachowskis' cinematic
adaptation of his work. It was well known by now that his work was the
main inspiration behind the movies but he had never spoken publicly
about them until now. And he was not happy. His first criticism is the
rather damning claim that the movies completely miss the point of his
work and that it confuses the classical Platonic problem of illusion
with the postmodern problem of simulation. The Problem of Illusion The
classical formulations of the problem of illusion were given by Plato
and Descartes. Plato's version comes from his dialogue *The
Republic* where we find his allegory of the cave in which the mass of
humanity lives in an illusory state where they mistake the shadows cast
by a fire on the cave wall for reality. The philosopher is the one who
leaves the cave and emerges into the real light of the sun. A more
condensed version of this classical problem is found in Descartes'
work *Meditations* *on First Philosophy *where in a line of
investigation that culminates in his famous conclusion "I think there I
am", Descartes embarks on a quest for the foundations of knowledge. [[He
begins to question how he knows whether what he is experiencing is
rea]{.mark}l]{.underline}. It seems to be real, and yet, he writes: "How
often my sleep at night has convinced me of all these familiar things
--- that I was here, wrapped in my gown, sitting by the fire --- when in
fact I was lying naked [under the
bedclothes](https://books.google.gr/books?id=i7l6la9W5SUC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=How+often+my+sleep+at+night+has+convinced+me+of+all+these+familiar+things%E2%80%94that+I+was+here,+wrapped+in+my+gown,+sitting+by+the+fire%E2%80%94when+in+fact+I+was+lying+naked+under+the+bedclothes&source=bl&ots=7wzHqfc794&sig=ACfU3U0KIG7XawG-Ai4a1DszQ0eP7rYbjw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjEjN3eg5j3AhVrgf0HHToKBvcQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=How%20often%20my%20sleep%20at%20night%20has%20convinced%20me%20of%20all%20these%20familiar%20things%E2%80%94that%20I%20was%20here%2C%20wrapped%20in%20my%20gown%2C%20sitting%20by%20the%20fire%E2%80%94when%20in%20fact%20I%20was%20lying%20naked%20under%20the%20bedclothes&f=false)."
This is the classical problem of illusion. [[For Descartes this sitting
here beside the fire is reality while dreaming is an
illusion]{.underline}]{.mark}. With the problem of illusion there is a
clear and absolute distinction between reality and illusion. We see this
problem being directly referenced by Morpheus in the first movie:
Morpheus: "Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was
real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you
know the difference between the dream world [and the real
world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n0hKTizFwY)?" The Simulation
Hypothesis Baudrillard's simulation hypothesis is a tough idea to fully
grasp. For a deeper exploration check out [the previous
instalment](https://www.thelivingphilosophy.com/baudrillard-simulation/) where
you can read my futile attempts to wrap my brain around the nuances of
Baudrillard's brilliant simulation hypothesis. The bottom line is that
with the emergence of simulation in the [postmodern
age](https://www.thelivingphilosophy.com/modernism-vs-postmodernism/) we
have entered, this distinction between the real and the illusory, [to
use Baudrillard's term]{.underline}, 'implodes'. The difference between
reality and illusion becomes meaningless. With the emergence of the age
of simulation, the real has become inaccessible. We can no longer speak
of the real, [[it is no longer attainable]{.underline}]{.mark}. We only
have a simulated reality that Baudrillard calls the 'hyperreal' in which
reality and illusion have imploded into each other. In *Simulacra and
Simulation* he writes: "The impossibility of rediscovering an absolute
level of the real is of the same order as the impossibility of staging
illusion. [[Illusion is no longer possible]{.underline}]{.mark}, because
the real is [no longer
possible](https://books.google.gr/books?id=9Z9biHaoLZIC&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=The+impossibility+of+rediscovering+an+absolute+level+of+the+real+is+of+the+same+order+as+the+impossibility+of+staging+illusion.+Illusion+is+no+longer+possible,+because+the+real+is+no+longer+possible&source=bl&ots=3OU493cusY&sig=ACfU3U2RBXYssQ4uCKLqNkoEgrxXXEdTUg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwic45bHhJj3AhXA_rsIHS-zDk4Q6AF6BAgSEAM#v=onepage&q=The%20impossibility%20of%20rediscovering%20an%20absolute%20level%20of%20the%20real%20is%20of%20the%20same%20order%20as%20the%20impossibility%20of%20staging%20illusion.%20Illusion%20is%20no%20longer%20possible%2C%20because%20the%20real%20is%20no%20longer%20possible&f=false)."
It is this distinction between the problems of simulation and illusion
that Baudrillard, in the 2004 interview, claims the Matrix movies missed
entirely. [[The problem as he sees it is that the distinction between
what is real and what is illusion is far too clear
cut]{.underline}]{.mark}. There's a red pill that takes you to the truth
and there's a blue pill that leaves you in illusion. In the interview he
states that: "The actors are in the matrix, [[that
is]{.underline},]{.mark} [in the digitized system of
things]{.underline}; or, they are radically outside it, such as in Zion,
the city of resistors. [But [what would be interesting is to show what
happens when these two worlds collide]{.mark}]{.underline}. The most
embarrassing part of the film is that the new problem posed by
simulation is confused with its [classical, Platonic
treatment](https://baudrillardstudies.ubishops.ca/the-matrix-decoded-le-nouvel-observateur-interview-with-jean-baudrillard/#:~:text=The%20actors%20are,classical%2C%20Platonic%20treatment)."
So for Baudrillard the Matrix movies have completely missed the point
--- they have the real in Zion and the illusion in the Matrix. [[The
idea of the real is preserved]{.underline}]{.mark}. Of course any
serious fan of the Matrix movies will be shouting at their screen right
now saying that it is Baudrillard that has missed the point but we'll
come back to that in a minute. For now though we can say that
Baudrillard's first and his primary criticism of the movies is that they
have missed the point of *Simulacra and Simulation*. They have
misunderstood the idea of simulation and have set up an all-too-clear
distinction between the real and the illusory. #2 The Matrix would love
The Matrix Baudrillard's second criticism of the Matrix series is what
he sees as the hypocrisy of the movies. *The Matrix* is, on the surface
of things, [[a criticism of technology and how technology is gaining
more and more power over our lives]{.underline}]{.mark}. We learn that
the humans in the real world had gone to war with their machines:
Morpheus : We don't know who struck first, us or them. But we do know it
was us that scorched the sky. At the time, they were dependent on solar
power. It was believed they would be unable to survive without an energy
source as [abundant as the
sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5b0ZxUWNf0&t=141s&ab_channel=FlashbackFM).
However the machines find another power source --- humans and so
humanity become batteries that power the machine-run world. The entire
setup and story of the Matrix is as a cautionary tale about the danger
of technology and it is supposed to point us back to what really matters
--- our humanity, our freedom, our human love and connection. But
Baudrillard remarks that "*The Matrix* is surely the kind of film about
the matrix that the matrix would have been able to produce." The
interviewer picks up on this observation noting that it is: "a film that
purports to denounce technicist alienation and, at the same time, plays
entirely on the fascination exercised by the digital universe
and [computer-generated
images](https://baudrillardstudies.ubishops.ca/the-matrix-decoded-le-nouvel-observateur-interview-with-jean-baudrillard/#:~:text=It%20is%20also%20a%20film%20that%20purports%20to%20denounce%20technicist%20alienation%20and%2C%20at%20the%20same%20time%2C%20plays%20entirely%20on%20the%20fascination%20exercised%20by%20the%20digital%20universe%20and%20computer%2Dgenerated%20images)."
Baudrillard expands on his point further saying that *The Matrix* movie
is: "an instructive symptom, and the actual fetish of this universe of
technologies of the screen in which there is no longer a distinction
between the real [and the
imaginary](https://baudrillardstudies.ubishops.ca/the-matrix-decoded-le-nouvel-observateur-interview-with-jean-baudrillard/#:~:text=an%20instructive%20symptom%2C%20and%20the%20actual%20fetish%20of%20this%20universe%20of%20technologies%20of%20the%20screen%20in%20which%20there%20is%20no%20longer%20a%20distinction%20between%20the%20real%20and%20the%20imaginary.).
\[...\] The Matrix paints the picture of a monopolistic superpower, like
we see today, and then collaborates in its refraction. Basically, its
dissemination on a world scale is complicit [with the film
itself](https://baudrillardstudies.ubishops.ca/the-matrix-decoded-le-nouvel-observateur-interview-with-jean-baudrillard/#:~:text=The%20Matrix%20paints%20the%20picture%20of%20a%20monopolistic%20superpower%2C%20like%20we%20see%20today%2C%20and%20then%20collaborates%20in%20its%20refraction.%20Basically%2C%20its%20dissemination%20on%20a%20world%20scale%20is%20complicit%20with%20the%20film%20itself.)."
And when you think about it Baudrillard has a solid point here. *The
Matrix,* for all its criticism of technology, utilises it to make a
spectacle. [[The very thing that is so seductive about the Matrix movies
is the dazzling technological spectacle]{.underline} ---]{.mark} there's
Neo dodging bullets, learning kung-fu by downloading a computer program,
there's the gunfights running up walls, there's the world of the robots
and the sentinels, and then of course, there's the Matrix itself --- the
movie is a monolithic fetishization of the exact thing it sets out to
criticise. [[For Baudrillard this is part of the broader cultural
landscape that is so overwhelming]{.underline}]{.mark}. He says that
this: ["[is exactly what makes our times so
oppressive]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The system produces a negativity in
trompe-l'oeil]{.underline}, \[a trick of the eye\] which is integrated
into products of the spectacle just as obsolescence is built into
industrial products. It is the most efficient way of incorporating all
genuine alternatives. There are no longer external Omega points or any
antagonistic means available in order to analyze the world; there is
nothing more than [a fascinated
adhesion](https://baudrillardstudies.ubishops.ca/the-matrix-decoded-le-nouvel-observateur-interview-with-jean-baudrillard/#:~:text=That%20is%20exactly,a%20fascinated%20adhesion.)."
And so in our postmodern world there is no solid ground from which to
criticise the system. Che Guevara has been legitimised as an icon of
rebellious adolescents and sells millions of t-shirts and posters every
year. Critiques of the system on social media only further enshrine the
power of those technological monopolies. [[Resistance is
futile]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The [system is
all-engulfing]{.mark}]{.underline}. #3 A Glimmer of Irony In his third
criticism, Baudrillard moves from criticising *The Matrix* for
misunderstanding the idea of simulation, to criticising the movies for
failing to understand his philosophy in general. He says that: "The
pseudo-Freud who speaks at the film's conclusion puts it well: at a
certain moment, we reprogrammed the matrix in order to integrate
anomalies into the equation. And you the resistors, comprise a part of
it. Thus we are, it seems, within a total virtual circuit [without an
exterior](https://baudrillardstudies.ubishops.ca/the-matrix-decoded-le-nouvel-observateur-interview-with-jean-baudrillard/#:~:text=The%20pseudo%2DFreud%20who%20speaks%20at%20the%20film%E2%80%99s%20conclusion%20puts%20it%20well%3A%20at%20a%20certain%20moment%2C%20we%20reprogrammed%20the%20matrix%20in%20order%20to%20integrate%20anomalies%20into%20the%20equation.%20And%20you%2C%20the%20resistors%2C%20comprise%20a%20part%20of%20it.%20Thus%20we%20are%2C%20it%20seems%2C%20within%20a%20total%20virtual%20circuit%20without%20an%20exterior.)."
Baudrillard is of course referring to the scene with the Architect at
the end of the second movie *The Matrix Reloaded* [where the Architect
explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHZl2naX1Xk) that the
resistors in Zion are a part of the overall Matrix program. By giving
rebellious outliers the illusion of autonomy and an escape into reality,
they ensure the greater overall stability of the Matrix. [[But]{.mark}
[Baudrillard isn't happy]{.mark}]{.underline}. His criticism is that the
movies fail to enact his chosen form of rebellion which he summarises in
the interview as: "a glimmer of irony that would allow viewers to turn
this gigantic special effect [on its
head](https://baudrillardstudies.ubishops.ca/the-matrix-decoded-le-nouvel-observateur-interview-with-jean-baudrillard/#:~:text=a%20glimmer%20of%20irony%20that%20would%20allow%20viewers%20to%20turn%20this%20gigantic%20special%20effect%20on%20its%20head.)."
This ties in with Baudrillard's broader philosophy of what he
calls [Seduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gc6jVNujvE) and his
way of subverting this all-encompassing system within which we live. But
when it comes to the Matrix, this criticism doesn't make sense. [The
Wachowskis are being criticised for not being true to Baudrillard's
overall philosophy]{.underline}. He admits that they have created an
all-encompassing system of oppression as he maps out in his works but
criticises the movies for not also including his own chosen form of
rebellion. But it's an unfair criticism. [The Wachowskis don't reference
Baudrillard's entire corpus in The Matrix]{.underline}. They didn't get
the cast to read all of the French postmodernist's books. They were
primarily concerned with the problem of simulation as presented in the
book *Simulacra and Simulation*. This third criticism then is to my eyes
an unfair one because it criticises the movie for something it didn't
try to do. Baudrillard can dislike the film because it doesn't agree
with his philosophy but on this count he can't knock the Matrix movies
just because they aren't exactly how he would have liked them to be.
[[Why Baudrillard is Wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}. This brings us back to
Baudrillard's main criticism of *The Matrix* --- [it fails to portray
the difference between simulation and reality]{.underline} --- it makes
the distinction too clear cut. This criticism might be applied to the
first Matrix movie but remember this interview took place a year after
the third movie had been released. Also Baudrillard referenced the
conversation with the Architect at the end of the second movie in the
interview so we know he has the second movie and so we can safely assume
that he has also seen the third. And assuming that's the case,
Baudrillard has somehow dramatically missed the point because anyone who
has seen the third movie or even just the end of the second movie would
find it difficult to support Baudrillard's critique. The third
movie, *The Matrix Revolutions*, completes the fractalizing of
epistemological doubts that had begun in the first movie. [[In the
original movie we find out that the entire reality Neo is living in is a
virtual reality universe]{.underline}]{.mark}. Neo escapes this Matrix
and meets the other rebels who live in Zion --- the underground city of
humans in 2199. The second movie muddies the waters even more when we
learn that even this rebel colony is part of the system. The Architect
informs us that previous iterations of the Matrix had failed to account
for the rebellious minority and so this rebellious anomaly had been
incorporated into the design of this Matrix. [[The upshot is that yes
Zion is the real world but the rebellion that Zion represents is not
real]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is a simulated rebellion that serves the
purpose of stabilising the Matrix. So already with the second movie we
have the destabilisation of the neat dichotomy between reality and
illusion. Already we have entered a blurred state of reality where even
though Zion occurs in the real world it is a hyperreality --- it is not
a spontaneous utterance of nature but a crafted and predicted simulation
of rebellion despite what its members may believe. This destabilisation
of the reality principle reaches a new level at the end of the second
movie which is picked up in the third as well. At the end of the second
movie we see Neo destroying the sentinel robots --- fighting them in the
real world using the same sort of superpowers that we see him using
inside the Matrix. Then, in the third movie we see his ability to see
code when he goes blind and we also have the strange moment when a
sentinel flies *through* him.These instances muddy the waters of reality
more. We are now left questioning what is Matrix and what is reality and
it seems that we can no longer truly tell one from the other.The "real"
world of Zion and Machine City seems to be equally prey to the peculiar
powers of Neo as the world of the Matrix. By the end of the series we
can no longer say for certain what is real. Neo sues for peace with the
machines but he does not know for sure what is reality. I've seen some
people online argue that from the moment Neo leaves the room of the
Architect he is in a new level of virtual reality. Others have argued
that Zion was always a simulation. [[The bottom line
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, the distinction between the real and the
illusory has been muddied so much that we no longer know where one ends
and the other begins. The distinction, [[has as Baudrillard would
say]{.underline}]{.mark}, imploded.Final Thoughts In their introduction
to the 2004 box set The Ultimate Matrix Collection, the Wachowski
siblings say that"It was our sincerest hope that our movies might
inspire or perhaps provoke a little Socratic interaction, something
beyond, 'Remember that one part? [That was
cool'](https://books.google.gr/books?id=7mW5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT23&lpg=PT23&dq=It+was+our+sincerest+hope+that+our+movies+might+inspire+or+perhaps+provoke+a+little+Socratic+interaction,+something+beyond,+%E2%80%98Remember+that+one+part?+That+was+cool%E2%80%99&source=bl&ots=AgiyjxGVU8&sig=ACfU3U0f-rtQsfVJzLewSFPVkteCi6Nj9w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiC2-XoiJj3AhWFOewKHRYaCrYQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=It%20was%20our%20sincerest%20hope%20that%20our%20movies%20might%20inspire%20or%20perhaps%20provoke%20a%20little%20Socratic%20interaction%2C%20something%20beyond%2C%20%E2%80%98Remember%20that%20one%20part%3F%20That%20was%20cool%E2%80%99&f=false)".There
can be no doubt of their success. The Matrix movies are far from perfect
and Baudrillard's second criticism still stands. But that being said, I
can't think of any other movie except for maybe Kubrick's *2001: A Space
Odyssey* that has inspired so much philosophical engagement --- hundreds
of articles that transcend the [Analytic/Continental divide in
philosophy](https://www.thelivingphilosophy.com/analytic-vs-continental-philosophy/).The
Wachowski siblings created a work of art that has sparked a
philosophical conversation in a way that no other movie ever has. It is
easy to get distracted by the criticisms of the Matrix movies, and to
miss the greater success of the movies as attaining their initial goal.
The Wachowskis set out to make a movie that got people thinking and they
succeeded at a scale that outstripped all expectations.

#### Baudrillard's defenders are mere propagandists that reduce their own scholarship to accumulation. 

**Horrocks 95**(Christopher Horrocks, Senior Lecturer in the Faculty of
Design at Kingston University, August 16th 1995, Baudrillard and the
Millennium\[Postmodern Encounters\], Beyond the Millennium:
Anti-Baudrillard, the Vital Illusion and the Return of the Mirror
People, pf 78-80)

Beyond the Millennium: AntiBaudrillard, the Vital Illusion and the
Return of the Mirror People It is beside the point to condemn Jean
Baudrillard for either spurning the tasks of rational and ethical
judgement set by philosophers, or for his \'failure\' to account for
real human injustice, misery and oppression. Christopher Norris, Douglas
Kellner, Alex Callinicos and a host of other writers in the Kantian or
Marxist tradition have taken 58 Baudrillard to task, accusing his
\'trash-theory\' of being part of a modernist sensibility that
substitutes art for philosophy, value for truth, image for reality, or
Baudelaire for Kant.\"? Yet people do support Baudrillard\'s right to
comment on our condition. [For example, sociologist Zygmunt Bauman has
attacked those rationalist **[critics]{.mark} of Baudrillard who
[assume]{.mark} that [criticism]{.mark} only [carries weight if one\'s
feet are set on the rock]{.mark} of absolute and universal truth[.
These]{.mark} critics [are always the last to claim that their stance is
part of]{.mark} historical, social and mundane [transformations]{.mark}.
7**8 As Chris Rojek notes, Baudrillard\'s tone and style is hardly one
of indifference or happy consumerism. **Rather, [Baudrillard
writes]{.mark} like \'a man who is [strapped to]{.mark} the mast of [the
pathological society,]{.mark} who [sees everything without illusions
and]{.mark} who [accepts that there is no cure around the
corner\';\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} In fact, Baudrillard himself puts
forward his critics\' standard complaints. [These apostles of reality
and truth, he says, **[claim]{.mark} that [he]{.mark} is monstrous for
[discrediting reality]{.mark} while there are so many in the world who
find even existence difficult; that he fails to attack affluence on
behalf of the poor; that he disparages class struggle when there are
those who have not had their revolution; or that he insults feminism and
human rights when many have not yet acquired those rights.** Baudrillard
sees[, **however**]{.mark}**, that these [good intentions disguise a
contempt]{.mark}.** In phrasing reality as a version of life insurance
or a human right and, worse**, assuming that [people place hope]{.mark}
only [in]{.mark} the [visible proofs]{.mark} of their
existence**]{.underline} (\'a plaster-saint realism\'), such critics
take them for naive and feeble-minded. [This contempt simply **[reflects
the desire of the propagandists]{.mark} of reality [to reduce]{.mark}
their own [lives to an accumulation]{.mark} of facts, evidence, causes
and effects.**]{.underline} \'Well-ordered resentment always begins at
home\', Baudrillard concludes. 80

#### Baudrillard's theory is wrong, it results in a world without depth, and a place where reality is only an endless interplay of surfaces. Simulations are produced in order to hide the fact that there is no original, no real.

Hastings and based in the firm\'s Los Angeles office. A Critique of
Baudrillard, cyberartsweb.org/cpace/theory/ydbaud.html. 🐸

In The Precession of Simulacra Jean Baudrillard attempts to disentangle
the phenomenon that the Post-Structuralist movement simultaneously
identified, decried and helped popularize: the disappearance of the
real. In examining the cultural climate of the West following 1970
**[[Baudrillard finds a world where representation through a surplus of
images has obscured all former notions of truth]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The annihilation of the real has become a manifestation of Marx\'s
nightmare of the commodity fetish[. He portrays the United States, in
particular, as a grim militaristic state controlled by the media\'s
manipulation of images. Baudrillard [f]{.mark}inds himself disempowered
by the endlessly proliferating images which confound the
real]{.underline}. [**[His position becomes that of the male
hysteric]{.underline}** ,]{.mark} due in part to the fact that intellect
and [reason cannot make sense of the post-modern \"[world of
hallucinations]{.mark}]{.underline}\" where image, reality, and surface
representation blur into each other. **[[Baudrillard in a sense writes
himself out of his own text.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In a world without
truth the theorist/the semiotician/the intellectual (indeed the
university itself) becomes irrelevant, if not totally impotent.

[T**[he idea of the loss of meaning is inherent in the concept of the
simulacrum]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[.]{.underline}** Here the idea of
an accurate copy becomes to a certain extent passé**[. [Baudrillard
states that we are removed from the binary which sets up copy and
original; there are only copies of copies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
fact he takes the notion farther: **[the simulacra exists as a copy
which has no original]{.underline}**. According to Baudrillard the
\"imitation\" can, in fact, precede the original. **[[This results in a
world without depth, a place where reality is only an endless interplay
of surfaces.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Simulations are produced in order to
hide the fact that there is no original, no real[**.** [Baudrillard\'s
intent is not to expose the falseness of the simulated
real]{.underline}]{.mark}, but to lament the passing of the actual real.
He seems to find the depthless world of images oppressive. He writes of
the \"murderous power of images,\" \"the mirror of madness, and \"the
blackmail of the truth.\" [[His emotionally charged prose reflects a
hysteria that derives from powerlessness]{.underline}]{.mark}. The loss
of reference points, which results from the death of originality,
contributes to the confusion that marks the modern world. As Baudrillard
points out, the charm of a simulation lies in being able to distinguish
copy from original. \"Because it is difference that constitutes the
poetry of the map and the charm of the territory, the magic of the
concept and the charm of the real.\" [[The loss of distinction between
the two leads to the loss of truth.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[[Baudrillard, who holds a romanticized view of the
real,]{.mark}]{.underline}** seems nostalgic for a time when meaning
existed. \"[By crossing into a space whose curvature is no longer that
of the real, nor that of truth, the era of simulation is inaugurated by
a liquidation of all referentials.\" This statement appears problematic
because he never can quite prove that meaning has ever existed and
therefore appears to rewrite history in order to make others believe in
depth.]{.underline} For example, in his discussion of the Iconoclasts he
assumes that the smashers of images were working under his own set of
cultural assumptions. \"[If they could have believed that these images
only obfuscated or masked the Platonic Idea of God, there would have
been no reason to destroy them .]{.underline} . . But their metaphysical
despair came from the idea that the image didn\'t conceal anything at
all , and that these images were in essence not images, but perfect
simulacra . . . \" Baudrillard, like a flawed Freudian, can be seen
projecting his own beliefs onto the people he studies. By refusing to
allow the Iconoclasts their own truth, he falls victim to the same
cultural prejudices he decries in others. **[At this point Baudrillard
resembles the ethnologists he so roundly criticizes.]{.underline}**

Even if truth\'s existence is taken for granted (in a bygone era)
Baudrillard does not conclusively show how meaning could be empowering.
**[Part of his problem with the simulacra stems from an intellectual
background heavily steeped in Marxism]{.mark}**. Marxists place a great
deal of importance on the process of production. Simulation can be seen
as stripping production of its meaning. When production becomes unreal
its ultimate object, \"the product\" is stripped of value. **[[This
reality would in turn strip Marxism of its relevance, a fundamental
problem for many Post-Structuralists, who like Baudrillard have
important ties with the Left]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What exactly does
it mean to be a Post-[Structuralist and a Marxist? The liquidation of
truth makes political resistance seem somewhat futille. Baudrillard,
significantly fails to offer a means of fighting the collapse of reason,
and in his writings the theorist is relegated to the role of
commentator: Baudrillard is only able to announce that the apocalypse
has begun]{.underline}

## Alt Fails/Solvency Turns

#### Baudrillard's alternatives are ambiguous and overly conflated, and puts "liberation" at a huge cost. 

**Robinson 13**(Andy Robinson, is a political theorist and activist
based in the UK. He is the co-author (with Athina Karatzogianni) of
Power, Resistance and Conflict in the Contemporary World: Social
Movements, Networks and Hierarchies (Routledge, 2009). He has recently

Baudrillard and Activism: a critique, Cease Fire,
https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/in-theory-baudrillard-14/)

Baudrillard's critique of Marx is interesting, and I think largely
valid. What he puts in place of Marx's theory is, however, contentious.
His recent work gives the impression of a disillusioned Situationist
seeking to find an alternative to revolution in a world where none is
apparent. As a result, he finds ways to read conformist mass practices
as unconscious resistances, irrational systemic functioning and
implosion, and so on. [**[Baudrillard]{.mark} is also [too prone to
conflate system collapse with liberation]{.mark}.** There are scenarios
of implosion which would not lead to liberation. **One might, for
instance, think of [climate change due to overconsumption as]{.mark} a
scenario of [system-collapse]{.mark}. This [would bring]{.mark} about
the [end of the code, but also]{.mark} possibly the end of
[humanity.]{.mark}**]{.underline} In some ways, the idea of implosion
echoes Sing Chew's theory of world-system collapse. Based on previous
episodes of collapse, Chew argues that the world-system will collapse
when it reaches its ecological limits. It won't explode; it will
collapse inwards and break down as the processes which sustain it are
reversed. Each 'civilisation' is followed by a 'dark age'. Populations
move outwards from cities, power is diffused, and local knowledge
replaces global knowledge. This is not quite what Baudrillard has in
mind, but similar enough to be suggested as an effect of continued
implosion. Or maybe implosion should be compared to the 'extraordinary
communities' of disaster, to the sudden collapse of the system's
management structures after which people take over their own
self-management (as in Argentina), to the fraying round the edges of a
system which can no longer secure the code at its more remote limits (as
in Africa). **[[Perhaps]{.mark} as the [code burns itself up]{.mark}, we
will be left [occupying wastelands]{.mark} where we [are finally
free]{.mark}, [but at great cost]{.mark}. Hence, an implosive collapse
of the system might give rise to a hope for other social
forms.]{.underline}** It might, after all, be liberation in disguise.
What of the crucial concept of 'symbolic exchange'? Baudrillard's
discussion of symbolic exchange oscillates between three poles. Firstly,
it refers to the experience of living in an embedded society, with
rituals, exchanges and local knowledges. Secondly, it refers to the
crisis-effects of the decomposition of the code, which create symbolic
exchange as their effect. Thirdly, it refers to a kind of experience
beyond the regime of simulation, through arbitrary connections. [**The
[political effects of]{.mark} the process [Baudrillard advocates
is]{.mark} thus rather [ambiguous.]{.mark}** Does the rise of symbolic
exchange herald a return to embedded forms of social relations, to some
kind of modern band or tribe which reproduces aspects of embedded forms,
or something else entirely]{.underline}? The recovery of immediacy,
connectedness, uncoded relations, 'exchange' between signs and the
world, are important aspects of disalienation. However, I have issues
with the Lacanian view of the subject which underpins Baudrillard's
theory of symbolic exchange. [**It is [possible to endorse]{.mark}
[Baudrillard's view of the death]{.mark} of value in capitalism and the
creation of a self-reproducing code, without necessarily seeing the
alternative in terms of symbolic exchange and death.** A wide variety of
other theories are attempting the same thing -- from 'anti-civilisation'
theories to Agamben's 'whatever-singularity'. **It might be more useful
to hitch Baudrillard's critique [to a more affirmative theory,]{.mark}
than to attempt to follow his 'fatal' strategies.**]{.underline}

#### Baudrillard theory of is extremely hostile towards minority struggles and over totalizes systems control.

[**There are serious limits to Baudrillard's work, in terms of his
[hostil]{.mark}ity [to 'minority' struggles]{.mark}. Many of his
[formulations are inadvertently sexist and racist]{.mark}. There are
also times when Baudrillard comes across as [ableist]{.mark} in his
critiques of the therapeutic.** There are also times when Baudrillard
attacks activism in strong terms: Hippies reproduce capitalist
ideology**; [Feminists]{.mark} displaying images of porn are actually
being seductive, against their will**; The left is keeping capitalism
alive with its moral critiques and its quests for meaning. **There are
times when it is [hard to tell if Baudrillard is]{.mark} a
[reactionary,]{.mark} attacking the concerns of progressives, or an
ultra-left, [criticising every rebellion as insufficiently
extreme]{.mark}. One limit to [Baudrillard's theory]{.mark} is his
tendency to [over-totalise]{.mark}.** Baudrillard is talking about
tendential processes, but he often talks as if they are totally
effective. There are still, for instance, a lot of uncharted spaces, a
lot of unexplained events, a lot of things the system can't handle.
While Baudrillard is describing dominant tendencies in the present**,
these tendencies coexist with older forms of capitalism, in a situation
of uneven development**.]{.underline} The persistence of the system's
violence is a problem for Baudrillard's perspective: the smooth regime
of neutralisation and inclusive regulation has not ended older
modalities of brutality. [At times, **Baudrillard [exaggerates
greatly]{.mark} the extent to which the [old]{.mark} authoritarian
version of [cap]{.mark}italism [has been replaced by]{.mark} subtle
[regimes of control]{.mark}. He [exaggerates]{.mark} the extent to which
c[ontemporary cap]{.mark}italism [is tolerant, permissive and
'maternal']{.mark}**. This may be because his works were **[mostly
written in]{.mark} France in the 19[70s-80s]{.mark}, [when]{.mark} the
dominant [ethos was]{.mark} still largely [social-dem]{.mark}ocratic**.
What Baudrillard recognises as the retrograde version of capitalism
associated with the right-wing was to return with a vengeance,
especially after 911. **Another problem is a [lack of]{.mark} a
[Southern dimension.]{.mark} Like many Northern authors, [Baudrillard's
approach mainly]{.mark} applies to the functioning of
[cap]{.mark}italism [in the North.]{.mark}** []{.mark}]{.underline}The
penetration of the code is substantially less in countries where
information technology is less widespread. In parts of Africa, even
simple coding exercises such as counting votes or recording censuses are
extremely difficult. This is for the very reasons of respondent
reflexivity which Baudrillard highlights. People will under-record
themselves to stay invisible, or over-record themselves to obtain
benefits. And without massive resources to put into its bureaucracies,
the system is unable to find enough people who will act as transmitters
for the code. Instead, people use their power to extract what they can
from the system. Explosions still happen regularly in the South.
Furthermore, a contracting system 'forcibly delinks' large portions of
the globe. Its power on the margins is lessened as its power at the core
is intensified. As the system becomes ever more contracted and
inward-looking, liberated zones may appear around the edges. [Without an
element of border thinking, **Baudrillard tends to [exaggerate]{.mark}
the [system's completeness and effectiveness]{.mark}. Baudrillard
assumes that any excess is everywhere absorbed into the code. He ignores
the persistence of borderlands. And when he talks about the South, [he
admits]{.mark} that the old regime of production might still exist here:
people still work seeking betterment; [colonial wars are fought]{.mark}
to destroy persisting symbolic exchange; Saddam was not playing the Gulf
War by the rules of deterrence. The Arab masses are still able to become
inflamed by war or non-war; Iran and Iraq can [still fight a real
war]{.mark}, not a simulated non-war. So perhaps [only a
minority]{.mark}, only the included layers [within the North, are
trapped]{.mark} within simulation and the 'masses'. Perhaps [reality has
not died, but been displaced to the South.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

A second approach focuses on why cyber norms emerge only slowly,
building on the existing IR norms literature (Finnemore & Hollis, 2016).
Early works in this area focused on the debate among states, especially
at the United Nations, followed by a growing number of proposal from the
private and the civil sector (Hurwitz, 2014). However, cyber norms
remain contested at the international level (Grisby, 2017). More
recently, the interest of researchers shifted to the role of the
creators (mostly private entities) and exploiters (sub-, semi-, and
non-state actors) of digital technologies in shaping the behavioral
standards that new regulation needs to take into account (Hurel &
Lobato, 2018). **[States]{.underline}** [need to know how their
**intelligence services**]{.underline} [work in cyberspace, because
through their **tools** and **practices**]{.underline} [they set
practical norms of acceptable (**cyber) espionage**]{.underline} with
[far-reaching effects on **state behavior** in]{.underline}
**[cyberspace]{.underline}** (Georgieva, 2019). [The focus on the role
of **intelligence** agencies in cyber conflict]{.underline}--as [both
the biggest threat and the most **capable provider** of]{.underline}
**[safety]{.underline}**--[opens up interesting questions linked to the
**larger transformation**]{.underline} [of these agencies in the context
of the **digitization of society**]{.underline}. [Some authors argue
that cyber conflict is primarily an **intelligence game**]{.underline},
because setting up cyber exploitation is much more expensive than
countering released exploitation, which increases the incentive to keep
the target at risk (Lindsay, 2017).

A third approach explores the broader repercussion of cyber conflict
dynamics for government and governance. The concept of networked
governance seems especially apt at capturing the essence of cyberspace
as co-constituted by technical devices and networks and socio-political
institutions (Hofmann, 2016). The key governance challenge in cyberspace
is fragmentation of authority and accountability. A case in point is the
lack in public transparency and trusted knowledge about the perpetrators
behind most cyber incidents. Although the number of public attributions
of cyber incidents by states and threat intelligence firms has been on
the rise, both types of actors have political and economic reasons not
to fully disclose their evidence (Egloff, 2019). As a consequence,
attribution claims remain contested in the public domain, undermining
the legitimacy of state action--from insurance matters and criminal
proceedings to mechanism of international cooperation and potentially
escalation control.

Cluster 3: Securitization, practice, and assemblages

Looking back at the beginnings of the cyber threat story, the policy
debate was riddled with cyber-doom scenarios and constant attempts to
mobilize in the political process. As a reaction to what was considered
a "hype," some scholars started to get interested in why and how this
issue was presented the way it was and with what consequences. Early
work to analyze the issues surrounding the politics of Internet from IR
and critical security studies perspectives emerged at the end of the
1990s (Deibert, 2002; Eriksson, 2001; Saco, 1999). A bit later, there
was a concentrated effort to apply variations of securitization theory
to the issue of cyber security politics (cf. Dunn Cavelty, 2008; Hansen
& Nissenbaum, 2009; Lawson, 2013). Securitization signifies the
representation of a fact, a person, or a development as a danger for the
military, political, economic, ecological, and/or social security of a
political collective and the acceptance of this representation by the
respective political addressee (Buzan, Waever, & De Wilde, 1998). The
successful securitization of a topic justifies the use of all available
means to counter it--including those outside the normal political rules
of the game.

Following the theory, the prime questions this literature engaged with
were related to the object of security, to what or whom was considered
the main threat, and to what policy responses flowed from these threat
constructions (Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010). Given its theoretical
underpinnings, the Copenhagen School focuses mainly on official
statements by heads of state, high-ranking officials or heads of
international institutions (Hansen, 2006, p. 64). What a focus on elite
speech acts ignores, however, is how these discursive practices are
facilitated or prepared by practices of actors that are not so easily
visible. The social competition for the definition of reality is not
only held in the open political arena. There are always state and
nonstate actors "under the radar"--that is, specialized bureaucratic
units, consultants or other experts--which have the capacity to
establish "the truth" about certain threats, thus pre-structuring the
discursive field in relevant ways (Huysmans, 2006, p. 72).

Cyber security, so the common assumption, arises from the interaction of
technologies, processes, and everyday practices. Thus, the literature
pays particular attention to how a variety of actors uses different
representations of danger to create or change different political,
private, social, and commercial understandings of security in selected
public spheres. In addition, it gives more weight to material aspects of
the issue in the tradition of STS (Balzacq & Dunn Cavelty, 2016;
Collier, 2018; Shires, 2018; Stevens, 2016), looking at the
co-constitution of technology and politics. In particular, it recognizes
that the political reading of cyber security cannot be divorced from
particular knowledge practices in different communities.

As the most recent research focus to emerge, literature in this cluster
covers a variety of topics, united by a focus on understanding how cyber
security emerges as an assemblage of people, objects, and enacted ideas.
Questions of authority and power are most directly addressed by research
in this cluster. C. Stevens (2019) sets out to better understand the
role of cyber security companies by looking at Symantec's analysis of
Stuxnet and the publication of their reports in the public. Tanczer
(2019) focuses on the increasingly blurred boundaries between field of
security professionals and hackers, pointing to changes in the larger
context of security and insecurity that are reflected in the practices
of these technical experts and in the conception of them. Shires (2019)
looks at how the cyber security industry portrays cyberspace as a
terrain of persistent threat, systemic vulnerability, and intelligence
ambiguity, a classic "noir" narrative that results from systemic
economic deficiencies (distorted incentives for protection) and from
systemic political deficiencies (black markets for new exploits). By
focusing on non-traditional actors and aspects of politics, this type of
research is able to make invisible aspects of cyber security visible.

Conclusion: [Where is **cyber security**]{.underline}
[politics]{.underline} research [headed]{.underline}?

[Over the past decade, **research** in **cyber security**]{.underline}
[politics has seen the emergence of a **growing**
interdisciplinary]{.underline} **[body]{.underline}** [of work that is
at the same time **theoretically informed**]{.underline}, [grounded in
**empirical observations**, and **policy-relevant** in many of its
insights. We have ended our **intellectual history** by outlining three
research clusters. In place]{.underline} of a summary of the past and
present evolution of cyber security as a security political issue, we
want to look into a possible future of research on cyber security
politics in this concluding section. We do this based on the same
assumption discussed at the beginning of this article: that the
trajectory of both cyber security research and cyber security policy
will continue to be shaped by the interplay between technology,
politics, and science. The direction in which research and policy will
move will be co-constituted by technological possibilities, political
choices, and scientific practices. We end our intellectual history with
a brief outlook on likely developments in all three areas.

Digital technologies have politics, and technological possibilities and
developments will require new governance mechanisms, while at the same
time being shaped by politics. First, the interconnectedness between
ever more complex socio-technical systems is bound to increase. Cyber
security will grow in importance as a topic as countries all around the
world strive to shape digital transformation processes that affect
society, economy, and the state alike. In the context of what has been
called fourth industrial revolution, the complexity of socio-technical
systems will increase due the ubiquitous digitalization and automation
of technical processes that support a great variety of socio-political
institutions. As these technical system become tighter coupled and
integrate more aspects of society and economy, cyber security concerns
will inevitably expand to more policy fields at both the national and
international level. These developments will create new demands for
technical and organizational research that needs to be better integrated
with approaches from the social and political science.

Second, cyberspace will become increasingly dependent on space-based
technologies and interlinked with newly emerging technologies in the
fields of quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI). This will
increase the size of cyberspace. More importantly, as an enabling
technology with diverse applications in all areas of life, AI will link
cyberspace to more policy fields. AI will become an essential element of
cyber security and will have a profound impact on the speed, scale,
duration, autonomy, and complexity of cyber operations, for both offense
and defense. These new technologies will be primarily developed by
global technology firms and the private sector. As a consequence, state
actors will likely become more dependent on technology firms and
independent technology experts, further transforming the relationship
between public and private actors. The fact that there is considerable
**[uncertainty]{.underline}** regarding the tempo and scope of these
technological [developments creates new demands for
**research**]{.underline} [that maps, assesses, models, and]{.underline}
**[forecasts]{.underline}** [new **technological
possibilities**]{.underline}. [As social scientists, we need to
understand the increasingly salient **political** and]{.underline}
social **[aspects]{.underline}** [that will affect the patterns of
**cooperation**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[conflict]{.underline}** in politics and society at the national and
international level.

**[Political choices]{.underline}** [at the **national**]{.underline}
and international **[level]{.underline}** [have a **technological
dimension**. Politics will **influence** and **govern
technology**]{.underline} [development while at the same time being
**pre-structured** by **technology**]{.underline}. [First, we can expect
that **political**]{.underline} and military **[actors]{.underline}**
[will attempt to better understand the (limited) **strategic
utility**]{.underline} [of cyber operations below the level of **armed
conflict**]{.underline}, [in order to find the right balance between
**restraint** and **exploitation**]{.underline}. [One key challenge in
this context is ho**w best** to **manage** the]{.underline}
**[transformation]{.underline}** of [state intelligence services in the
digital age and their **growing dependence**]{.underline} on private
intelligence firms. Another key challenge is linked to information
operations and propaganda that might be spread more targeted and
effectively via AI technologies and social media platforms. These
political developments raise important research questions that require
interdisciplinary answers.

Second, public actors will uphold their efforts to control the risk of
escalation trough international cooperation. [States cannot secure
cyberspace on their own, without taking into account **market** and
**social forces**; yet no]{.underline} **[stable cyber
governance]{.underline}** [framework will emerge without greater
**convergence** on **responsible behavior**]{.underline} [among **great
powers**]{.underline}. [As long as great powers
**disagree**]{.underline} [about what represents responsible use of
**cyber operations** in]{.underline} **[state
interactions]{.underline}**, and [for that matter what forms of
espionage and interference in the political process of other states
through cyberspace are acceptable, **little** top-down
**progress**]{.underline} [will materialize]{.underline}. **[Bottom-up
progress]{.underline}**, [on the other hand, presupposes that the actors
become **more visible**]{.underline} [for each other in order to
**successfully work together**]{.underline} [in a multi-stakeholder
framework]{.underline}. **[Research]{.underline}** [can shed light on
**invisible actors** and **analyze**]{.underline} [the interaction
between market]{.underline} **[dynamics]{.underline}** [and **political
dynamics**]{.underline} in stabilizing cyberspace, it can evaluate if
the socio-technical institutions that secure cyberspace reflect the
tools and practices of public and private actors.

Third, the key governance challenge at the domestic political level is
how to overcome fragmentation of authority and accountability. Tighter
coupling of technical systems and their growing interconnectedness with
socio-political institutions creates growing demand for governance in
networks, which in turn means that governments increasingly share
responsibility with actors from business and society. The integration of
policy into a coherent overall framework involves difficult trade-offs
between security and privacy and creates horizontal and vertical
coordination and cooperation problems across government and at the
intersections between state, economy, and society. Research can evaluate
how states can fine-tune their multidimensional roles. How states decide
to regulate their technology base is moreover directly linked to how
they anticipate this will influence their relative economic, political,
and military power at the international level. Academics in this context
can study how different (democratic and authoritarian) political systems
balance regulation and market forces differently and what this means for
state access to the private technology sector, export control systems of
dual-use technologies, and screening mechanisms of foreign investment
into the strategically relevant technology base.

Scientific practice, as our third and final sphere of interest, will
keep coevolving with the anticipated changes in the spheres of
technology and politics. We started the article with the ascertainment
that there is no "field" or "subfield" of cyber security politics--and
we conclude with a wish that this remains true in the future. [Research
at the **intersection**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
**[cybersecurity]{.underline}** [and **security politics** in order to
remain **relevant**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[policy
choices]{.underline}** [and cognizant of technological possibilities
needs to **speak to** a variety]{.underline} of **[other bodies of
research]{.underline}**, [free to choose interesting and pressing issue
without **disciplinary constraints**; it needs to co-opt some of the
**new data** analytical tools]{.underline} **[offered by
AI]{.underline}**, [and it needs to flexibly overcome some of the
**institutional barriers**]{.underline} [that slowed down its
**independent contribution** to **cyber security**]{.underline}.

A first key challenge for cyber security politics research is conceptual
and linked to the integration of theoretical knowledge from different
disciplines and research traditions. Researchers need to better
integrate concepts and mechanisms from IR and security studies, IPE, and
intelligence studies to analyze the transformation of intelligence
services and how this affects their relationship with private cyber
security and intelligence firms. They need to better understand the
interplay between (black) security markets and (covert) security
political dynamics if they want to explain the co-existence of strategic
restraint and low-level subversion in cyberspace. Cyber security
politics research must pay more attention to economic aspects of the
phenomena at hand. Practice theory with its focus on technological
possibilities and socio-technical processes allows to integrate these
different approaches at the empirical level. STS offers a productive
lens for understanding the mutual interplay between the technical and
the socio-political sphere and, from an analytical point of view, to
deal with the opaqueness of cyber operations. Such an approach is of
critical importance in an attempt to shed light on how the cyber
security policy and practice of states, both at the national and the
international level, are facilitated or thwarted by the interests and
practices of actors that are not easily visible, in- and outside of
governments.

A second key challenge or indeed an opportunity for cyber security
politics research is linked to the fact that more data about cyber
operations by many different actors around the world and better tools to
monitor and analyze this data are becoming available. While there is
room for theory development and theory testing, we will likely enter an
era of empirical work. In-depth qualitative studies on the role of
invisible actors in state interactions linked to cyber security can be
combined with more data-driven approaches that evaluate how new AI tools
affect the cyber offense-defense balance. As state actors begin to
integrate these tools in their border guards, police corps, armies and
disaster response structures, important social and political questions
will arise linked to privacy, bias, and control. Conversely, governments
and societies will need to discuss how much of this new data should be
made publicly available and what this means for data protection and
privacy. From a research point of view, these developments call for more
interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computer science,
mathematics, economics, and political science.

A third key challenge for cyber security politics research is linked to
overcoming the institutional barriers that slow down its independent
contribution to cyber security and cyber security politics. Universities
can help the public actors at the national and international level to
catch up in their technology competence, while educating the next
generation of experts for society and industry.
**[Academia]{.underline}** [can contribute to the study of **cyber
conflict** and through its **independent**]{.underline} [and
peer-reviewed **knowledge**]{.underline} [broaden the knowledge base for
some of the **difficult**]{.underline} [policy choices discussed
above]{.underline}. [Science can collaborate with the **private** and
**public actors**]{.underline} [in the development of **evidentiary
standards**]{.underline} and [norms that will underpin the **future
resilience**]{.underline} [of sociotechnical systems]{.underline}, and
[in the negotiation and establishment of new norms and institutions that
should govern the use and misuse of these systems. Yet in order to free
its full **potential**]{.underline}, [universities must overcome the
**institutional barriers** that]{.underline} slow down
**[interdisciplinary]{.underline}** [and more so **transdisciplinary
research**]{.underline} [intersection of science,
technology]{.underline}, while [building a network of institutions and
programs that together can considerably expand the body of **public
knowledge**]{.underline} surrounding these societally and politically
relevant questions.

### AT: Charity Cannibalism

#### Images of suffering are key to compassion

**Porter 6** (Prof & head of the School of International Studies at the
University of South Australia, (Elisabeth, Hypatia 21.4, project muse)

I have explained what constitutes suffering and that attentiveness
affirms dignity. I clarify further the nature of attentiveness. If
morality is about our concerned responsiveness, attention is the
prerequisite to intense regard. Iris Murdoch borrowed the concepdt of
\"attention\" from Simone Weil \"to express the idea of a just and
loving gaze\" (1985, 34) on the reality of particular persons. Part of
[[the moral task is]{.mark},]{.underline} as Murdoch reiterated, [[to
see]{.mark} the world in its reality---to see [people struggling]{.mark}
in pain and despair.]{.underline} Weil, too, gave \"attention\" a
prominent place, grounded in concrete matters of exploitation, economic
injustice, and
oppression.[23](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/hypatia/v021/21.4porter.html#FOOT23)
Her emphases were pragmatic in struggling against the debilitating
nature of life---how \"it humiliates, crushes, politicizes, demoralizes,
and generally destroys the human spirit\" (quoted in R. Bell 1998,
16)---and idealistic in striving to put ideals into practice. Too
readily, we think about suffering in the height of media accounts of
famine, suicide bombings, terrorist attacks, refugee camps, and war\'s
destructive impact, and retreat quickly into our small world of
self-pity. As Margaret Little explains, Murdoch\'s point was that \"the
[seeing itself is a task---the task of being attentive to one\'s
surroundings]{.underline}\" (1995, 121). [[We need to \"see\" reality in
order to imagine what it might be like for others]{.mark}, even when
this includes horrific images from war
violence.]{.underline}[24](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/hypatia/v021/21.4porter.html#FOOT24)
Yet despite the presence of embedded journalists, media reporting of
such events as the invasion of Iraq has remained entirely typical in
that \"the experience of the people on the receiving end of this
violence remains closed to us\" (Manderson 2003, 4). [[Without political
imagination, we will not have compassionate nations]{.mark}. \"Without
being tragic spectators, we will not have the insight required if we are
to make life somewhat less tragic for those who . . . are hungry, and
oppressed, and in pain]{.underline}\" (Nussbaum 1996, 88). In order for
[political leaders]{.underline} to demonstrate \[End Page 113\]
compassion, they [should display the ability to imagine the lives led by
members of the diverse groups that they themselves lead. [Otherwise,
dispassionate detachment predominates and acts like the 2003 invasion of
Iraq]{.mark} lead to talk of freedom without seeing fear, assume
liberation without replacing the losses, and abuse power without
addressing people\'s pain.]{.underline} \"The difference, for instance,
between someone who discerns the painfulness of torture and someone who
sees the *evil* of it is that the latter person has come to see the
painfulness as a reason not to torture\" (Little 1995, 126). Attentive
ethics in international relations is about priorities and choices.

#### Multiple studies prove you're wrong about people enjoying suffering and that images are necessary for action

**Kyriakidou 21** (Maria, Senior Lecturer at the School of Journalism,
Media and Culture, "The Audience of Human Communication", 2021, 'er')

- makes a psycho claim that baudrillard debaters unconsciously distance
  themselves from suffering through these args. probably the funniest
  card i've ever cut.

Researching the audience of suffering Limited but [growing [empirical
research on audience responses to mediated
suffering]{.mark}]{.underline} has been predominantly inspired by the
reception paradigm of audience studies, whereby media viewers and users
are approached as actively constructing meaning and interpreting media
messages through various degrees of involvement and positioning in
relation to the media (Livingstone, 1998; Morley, 1980, 1992). Given
their qualitative nature, these studies [have]{.underline} been
small-scale, [in-depth explorations of viewers' reactions to mediated
suffering]{.underline}. They have employed a variety of methods, such as
focus groups, interviews and diaries. They have predominantly studied
how audiences relate to news stories of suffering (Höijer, 2004;
Huiberts & Joye, 2017; Kyriakidou, 2011) and, less often, to suffering
witnessed through non-news programmes (Ong, 2015b; Scott, 2014); very
few studies have explicitly studied audience engagement with
humanitarian campaigns (Seu, 2003; 2010; von Engelhardt & Jansz, 2014[).
In her seminal work on the topic, Höijer explored audience reactions to
the 'discourse of global compassion' constructed by the media through
the reporting of humanitarian crises, wars and political conflicts and
their innocent victims]{.underline} (Höijer, 2004). [Her
[research]{.mark}]{.underline}, based on empirical material gathered
through interviews and focus groups in Norway and Sweden, studied
viewers' reactions to media reports of war and violent news and
[[concluded that compassion is]{.mark} most often [directed to]{.mark}
particular [images of suffering]{.mark}]{.underline} and varies in its
forms and expressions. Höijer concludes by describing the complexity of
audience responses to suffering as 'a twosided effect of global
compassion on the one hand, and ignorance and compassion fatigue on the
other' expressed through 'different forms of compassion as well as
different forms of indifference' (Höijer, 2004, p. 528). Indifference
mostly reflected a critical stance and suspicion of media texts as
either propagandistic or reflecting sensationalist, nationalistic
mindsets, as well as overfamiliarity with images of suffering.
Compassion, on the other hand, can be 'tender-hearted', 'blamefilled',
'shame-filled' and 'powerlessness-filled', according to Höijer.
Interestingly, although the author acknowledges a variety of affective
responses here, such as indignation or guilt, these are all described as
being expressions of the same emotion, namely compassion. [Focusing on
the audience of humanitarian appeals, Seu also employed focus
groups]{.underline} in a UK-based study of audience responses to NGO
campaigns and news stories of human rights violations (Seu, 2003; 2010).
Her analysis, focusing on the issue of audience (in)action and drawing
upon the principles of psychology, psychoanalysis and rhetoric,
[illustrates the different ways [people discursively distance themselves
from the suffering of others]{.mark}]{.underline} and justify their
unresponsiveness to human rights appeals. Scepticism about NGOs, their
messages and international aid generally are given as reasons for such
distancing. Cohen and Seu (2002, p. 189) **[describe such [argumentative
strategies as]{.mark}]{.underline}** a 'vocabulary of denial'
**[[serving to avoid moral responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** for
witnessed suffering. Desensitisation, Seu argues, is a 'defense'
mechanism against the realisation that 'our social responsibility and
human compassion, for whatever reason, do not stretch enough to getting
us involved' (Seu, 2003, p. 191). In a large-scale, UK-based study,
Martin Scott (2014) combined focus group discussions with diaries,
whereby participants were asked to log their daily media engagement.
This research design allowed the author to move beyond the news genre
and explore the mediation of distant suffering more broadly, including
through other, factual television programmes. Influenced by Boltanski's
work, Scott analysed his material through the perspective of the options
for action and emotion available to the viewers. He found substantial
evidence of indifference to mediated encounters with distant suffering,
particularly among young participants, as well as what he describes as
'solitary enjoyment', whereby research participants positioned
themselves as observers of others' suffering, devoid of any moral
obligation to act (Scott, 2014, p. 13). An equally common type of
engagement among participants was a tendency to evaluate media texts in
terms of their accuracy and informational value (Scott, 2014, p. 10).
Feelings of anger and indignation, per Boltanski's topic of
denunciation, were rather limited (Scott, 2014, p. 11). Given that
participants seemed to be more emotionally involved with documentaries
and current affairs programmes (Scott, 2014, p. 18), [Scott's study
confirms Chouliaraki's argument that [media]{.mark} texts [that
represent suffering in its complexity]{.mark} and humanise the victims
[are necessary for constructing options for action and emotion]{.mark}
on the part of the viewer]{.underline} (Chouliaraki, 2006).

### AT: Cyber Security = Simulation

**Cyber-security research is based in [sound research]{.underline}. Cold
war threat inflation is a [thing of the past]{.underline}.**

**Cavelty and Wegner 20** (Myriam Dunn and Andreas, PhDs from Zurich and
lecturers, "Cyber security meets security politics: Complex technology,
fragmented politics, and networked science", 2019, Contemporary Security
Policy, DOI: 10.1080/13523260.2019.1678855,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2019.1678855>)

Cluster 1: [The **reality of cyber conflict**]{.underline}: Explaining
state restraint and practices

[In the **beginning** of this **intellectual history**, political
aspects of **cyber security**]{.underline} [were discussed almost
**exclusively** in publications]{.underline} originating in U.S.
**[think tanks]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[war
colleges]{.underline}** (for example: Arquilla & Ronfeldt, 1992). [This
literature had **little ambition**]{.underline} to contribute to an
academic debate. The two main questions it tackled were "who (or what)
is the biggest danger for an increasingly networked
nation/society/military/business environment" and "how to best counter
the new and evolving threat."

[The]{.underline} first [cluster is characterized by a
**reevaluation**]{.underline} [of the threat based on **empirical
evidence**]{.underline} [and a **gradual application**]{.underline} [and
adaption of "**old**]{.underline}" **[IR]{.underline}** [and strategic
studies]{.underline} [concepts to **cyber security**]{.underline}
(Kello, 2013). [Two cyber incidents]{.underline}--[the discovery of
**Stuxnet**]{.underline} [in 2010 and later the **Snowden
disclosures**]{.underline} in 2013--[were **instrumental**]{.underline}
in [shifting the focus of both **policymakers**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[researchers]{.underline}** [from the **threat
politics** of "**what if**]{.underline}"-[scenarios that had dominated
the 1990s and early 2000s]{.underline} [to the **reality** of the
**strategic use**]{.underline} [of **cyberspace**]{.underline} [by state
actors.]{.underline} In this new context, [literature in **IR**
and]{.underline} **[strategic studies]{.underline}** [could be used to
examine how **state actors**]{.underline} [use cyber instruments for
their **political** or **military advantage**]{.underline} and analyze
their impact on national and international security (Borghard &
Lonergan, 2017; Kello, 2017; Maness & Valeriano, 2016). [A strong
disciplinary]{.underline} "**[pull]{.underline}**" is [visible in how
early works **zoomed**]{.underline} in [on an alleged **offensive
advantage**]{.underline} in [cyberspace due to the ubiquity of technical
vulnerabilities (Peterson, 2013), grappled with the problem of
**escalation dynamics** in cyberspace]{.underline} (Liff, 2012), and
asked how deterrence might be adapted in order to uphold stability in
cyberspace (Wilner, 2019).

As researchers began to build data sets of cyber operations (Kostyuk &
Zhukov, 2019; Valeriano & Maness, 2014) to link cyber issues to the
larger agenda of conflict studies, [an empirical puzzle emerged that
**challenged** many of the **theoretical tenets**]{.underline} [and
standards assumptions of the **older literature**]{.underline}. Most
cyber operations did not seem escalatory, nor were they determined by
power asymmetries or changed the existing strategic balance.
**[Overall]{.underline}**, [states seemed to exercise a fair
amount]{.underline} of **[restraint]{.underline}** in cyberspace
(Gartzke, 2013; Gartzke & Lindsay, 2015; Valeriano & Maness, 2015).
**[At the same time, however]{.underline}**, [a lot of cyber operations
linked to **state rivalries occurred**]{.underline}, though as mere
add-ons to existing conflict dynamics and not independent of a broad
range of other foreign policy instruments (Betz & Stevens, 2011).

Reacting to this puzzle, the literature in this cluster has begun to
move in two directions: First, and comparable to the evolution of the
strategic studies literature during the nuclear age, some
[authors]{.underline} have started to integrate additional non-systemic
explanatory factors into their analyses of cyber conflict. While some
[explore the role of beliefs]{.underline} [and **cognitive
biases**]{.underline} in cyber policy decision making (Gomez, 2019),
[others]{.underline} zoom in on the destabilizing role of bureaucratic
politics and other deficiency of the policy process especially in crisis
decision making. Second, and more consequentially, many authors
acknowledge that the emerging empirical picture reflects the structural
feature of cyberspace as an operating environment, which is marked by a
high degree of technical interconnectedness and constant political
contestation (Fischerkeller & Harknett, 2018; Smeets, 2018). Taking this
into account, operating strategically in cyberspace seems to be more
technically and organizationally demanding than the "cheap and
easy"-metaphor suggests, while at the same time offering little enduring
strategic gains in the sense of changing a rival's political goals
(Lewis, 2018; Slayton, 2017)

### AT: Fiat = Simulation

#### Fiat is good, makes us more focused on social relations and less militarized especially in the context of NATO.

**Shearer 21** (Allan, School of Architecture Associate Dean for
Research and Technology, Roleplaying to Improve Resilience,

Figure 2 presents a graphic comparison of the three assessments of
critical uncertainties. Direct comparison is imperfect because each
assessment was approached differently -- again, in the first assessment,
students worked in interdisciplinary groups, in the second**[, [students
worked]{.mark} alone while [imagining the priorities of a fictional
character]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and in the third, students worked
individually and from their own perspectives. While analytically messy,
the results are a direct outcome of intentionally putting the students
in positions where they had to think about the city from multiple
perspectives. Nevertheless, [observations can be made]{.underline}. It
may be notable that in the first assessment (a group-based activity),
the two PMESII factors that were used most commonly were Military and
Infrastructure, both in terms of number of times cited and number of
connections to different factors. The only relationship to receive more
than one mention was Social-Infrastructure. The factors that were used
least commonly were Political and Social. The initial identification of
Military and Infrastructure factors might be expected given both that
the base scenario was developed by NATO and that policy and planning
programmes commonly emphasize infrastructure to support health, safety
and welfare services. [In the]{.underline} second ([role-based)
exercise]{.underline}, the results were reversed[. [Political and Social
factors came to the forefront. Military]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
Infrastructure [categories were]{.mark} still used, but [not as
dominant]{.mark}ly]{.underline}. Also of note in the second assessment,
all relationships are flagged by at least one person except the one
between Economics and Information. In the third assessment,
Infrastructure and Social are the most mentioned categories (19 and 12
respectively) and their connection is the most cited link pairwise.
Perhaps curiously, in the third assessment, issues that relate to
Information are not identified as of critical importance. This result
suggests follow-up investigation given current conversations about 'fake
news'.46 Looking across the results it can be seen that between the
first and third assessment more relationships are identified, and that
can be recognized as supporting the primary goal of the exercise.
Perhaps also, the connection to Political topics or concerns, which was
prominent in the second assessment, was carried through into the third
assessment. Referring to Table 1, the base political question is: 'How
is a member (typically a citizen) identified, what rights pertain to a
member and how do those rights differ from non-members?' As a set of
exercises, [participants were asked to play roles beyond
their]{.underline} professional and sometimes educational
[experiences]{.underline}. [Several of the students offered]{.underline}
unsolicited comments that the experiment was unlike anything they had
ever done in school or professional life. While each person was able to
provide some level of [analytical thinking]{.underline} (through the
PMESII diagrams, maps and memo) [that reflected the role s/he was asked
to play]{.underline}, it must also be said that there were differing
levels of comfort in trying to play these roles during the game. A
sentiment expressed immediately following the exercise during a group
discussion was that empathy may be the decisive criteria, but it will
not be empathy with the person who delivers the news per se, but with
the situation that is shared through real time Virtual Reality
transmissions. The presentation of news would be replaced by experience
(even if mediated experience) and without that experience, there would
be no buy-in. David Chandler, who has written extensively on the role of
resilience as a framing mechanism for governance in the Anthropocene,
has commented, '[For resilience-thinking, the type of knowledge that is
possible is necessarily concrete rather than abstract; therefore,
complexity- and resilience-thinking lends itself to action-research
methods engaging with actors in the situation]{.underline}.'47
**[[Wargames and role-playing may be simulations, but they]{.mark} do
[serve to ground our understanding]{.mark}]{.underline}** of specific
situations. To the degree that urban policy makers, planners and
designers help create environments that allow strangers to live among
one another, [[role-playing may bring in an aspect of professional
practice that is otherwise absent]{.mark} or underdeveloped in the
students' training and education.]{.underline}

### AT: Nuclearism

#### Nuclear reps aren't too bad

**Wittner 17** (Lawrence, prof of history @ SUNY, cited by Duncan
Meisel, \"Mass Mobilization Stopped Nuclear War Before and It Can
Again,\" Toward Freedom, 10-31-2017,
<https://towardfreedom.org/archives/activism/mass-mobilization-stopped-nuclear-war-before-and-it-can-again>)

- threats good, fear good, demands key

[A common thread running through the entire post-1945 period is that
people **don't want to think about nuclear war**. When they're
**forced**]{.underline} [to think of it]{.underline}, when they can't
escape it, [they]{.underline} [**want to stop it**. But when it's not in
the **headlines**]{.underline} any more and governments are growing more
reasonable, [they'd]{.underline} **[just as well not]{.underline}**
think about it. If nuclear war did break out today, you can bet more
people would focus on it, but, of course, we don't want that war to have
to take place. [The peace movement's challenge is to maintain
its]{.underline} **[momentum and sense of danger]{.underline}** [---
even though the world might]{.underline} **[seem]{.underline}** [safer
and there are fewer nuclear weapons in the world. If the nations of the
world are **maintaining their arsenals**, the struggle]{.underline}
**[hasn't come to an end.]{.underline}** Do you think [the moment we're
experiencing today with]{.underline} **[Trump]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[North Korea]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[potentially]{.underline}** [a driving force for]{.underline}
**[another peak]{.underline}** [of movement **energy**?]{.underline}
What's different today? It's possible that there will be some revival of
the nuclear disarmament movement, [but we]{.underline} **[haven't
seen]{.underline}** [the surge of resistance **yet**.]{.underline} I'm a
co-chair of the national board of the group Peace Action, so I'm very
well aware of how peace groups are doing. While Peace Action isn't doing
badly, we're certainly not yet experiencing the surge of action in the
streets, such as when its predecessors, SANE and the Nuclear Freeze
Campaign, were taking off. One reason it's not taking place is that the
mass media rarely focus on the danger of nuclear war, and when they do
focus on it, it's the danger of some other country waging war on the
United States. One day it's Iran, another day it's North Korea --- but
they don't seem to get to the basic problem that nine countries have
15,000 nuclear weapons in their arsenals. It's a worldwide phenomenon,
as is the persistence of the idea of nuclear weapons as the ultimate
guarantor of national security. Right now there's also a sense that only
Koreans are vulnerable, that most Americans aren't at risk of being
bombarded by nuclear missiles. At the height of popular protest in the
1980s, millions of people were in the streets --- in part because U.S.
and Soviet arsenals could reach both sides quite easily. That got people
to wake up and realize that nuclear war wasn't such a hot idea after
all. How big a role did fear play in these spikes of organizing? How can
people dealing with fear of the Trump administration, or of North Korean
nuclear mobilization, help direct that energy into making nuclear
conflict less likely? I think [fear has probably been]{.underline}
**[the most important factor in mobilizing people.]{.underline}** When
you look at things psychologically, people should be afraid of nuclear
weapons and nuclear war. It seems irrational to go bury your head in the
sand and not worry about them. But it's also true, in two ways, that
fear is dangerous. One is that it can be demobilizing, that people get
so scared they're scared silent. They become so frightened they retreat
and they don't feel powerful any more. They might take drugs instead of
taking action. A second danger is that, if people are scared of nuclear
war, the hawks have an answer for them. They turn fear on its head: Yes,
they say, nuclear war could be a bad thing, that's why we need nuclear
weapons to deter the bad Russians, Iranians, North Koreans and so on.
This means fear may reinforce the desire for nuclear weapons rather than
for getting rid of them. [For these reasons, the use of nuclear fear has
to be]{.underline} very [**careful**. Peace activists have to make the
case that **as long as nuc**lear weapon**s exist there's no real
security from nuclear war**, and therefore we need to **get rid of
nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. That's the best case that can be made by
nuclear disarmament forces: The arms race is a race no one wins. What
are some of the forgotten "paths not taken" of weapons not built or
decisions not made as a result of anti-nuclear organizing? How might the
world be different if those things had been built? The neutron bomb was
being proposed during the Carter administration. This enhanced radiation
weapon was designed to destroy people rather than property, and was
scheduled by the Carter administration to be deployed in Western
European nations. But once peace groups learned of it and began to focus
on its terrible effects, this caused massive protests in Western
European nations and, eventually, an unwillingness to support the
neutron bomb deployment by their government officials. As a result, the
Carter administration finally concluded that, if Western governments
weren't willing to stand up for it, the U.S. government wasn't going to
be the villain of the piece. So Carter canceled plans for its
deployment. The MX missile was the jewel in the crown of the Reagan
administration during its first term of office. Peace groups said that
it was a first-strike weapon, and there was so much popular protest
against it that Reagan couldn't get funding through Congress.
Eventually, a plan that began as 200 missiles barely slipped through
with 50 missiles. That failure became the basis of the U.S. government's
push for strategic arms reduction treaties, for it meant the U.S.
government couldn't keep pace with development of intercontinental
ballistic missiles. And the next best thing was seeing to it that
neither country had those weapons. The best way to do that was to sign a
treaty: the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, which Gorbachev
welcomed and showed him, in many ways, to be a peace person, strongly
influenced by the movement. Gorbachev had his own peace-oriented ideas,
but he also received a large amount of information from the disarmament
movement in the United States and around the world. He would take time
out of his meetings with heads of state to meet with representatives of
groups like the Freeze campaign, SANE, and International Physicians for
the Prevention of Nuclear War. So, Gorbachev and Reagan's detente and
the overall drawback from the nuclear brink were heavily influenced by
the peace movement --- not just through public pressure but also through
direct engagement. Are there other potentially winnable campaigns of
this kind available to anti-nuclear weapons activists today that might
limit the likelihood of the Trump administration using nuclear weapons?
It seems to me there are two ways [to **develop mass
pressure**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} **[Trump]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Congress]{.underline}** [in connection with the
general problem of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The first has to do
with the trillion dollar nuclear "modernization" program --- the plan to
upgrade the entire nuclear weapons complex, build new bombers and
missiles and submarines and so on. That cost is so great that it
provides the opportunity to reach people who are already concerned about
the arms race or are satisfied with the weapons we already have and
don't want to bankrupt the country. So [you can **make
demands**]{.underline} for cutbacks in the "modernization" plan or
stopping it entirely and mobilize a sympathetic constituency. A second
way is to focus on Trump's mental instability: The fact that he's a
reckless, dangerous leader, who really shouldn't have the button to
launch nuclear war in his hand. That's what the currently proposed
Markey-Lieu bill seeks to address: Under its provisions, unless there's
a nuclear attack on the United States, the president cannot initiate
nuclear war without a Congressional declaration of war. Since Congress
hasn't declared war since 1941, that's a pretty big restriction.

### AT: Operational Warfare

#### Experts are credible, and don't do any of that nasty operational warfare business.

**Ravenal 9** -- Professor Emeritus at the Georgetown University School
of Foreign Service

Earl Ravenal, "Designing Defense for a New World Order," Critical
Review: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Politics and Society

[The underlying notion of "the security bureaucracies . . . looking for
new enemies" is a **threadbare concept**]{.underline} that has somehow
taken hold across the political spectrum, from the radical left (viz.
Michael Klare \[1981\], who refers to a "threat bank"), to the liberal
center (viz. Robert H. Johnson \[1997\], who dismisses most alleged
"threats" as "improbable dangers"), to libertarians (viz. Ted Galen
Carpenter \[1992\], Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy of the
Cato Institute, who wrote a book entitled A Search for Enemies). [What
is missing from]{.underline} most analysts' [claims of "threat
inflation," however, is **a convincing theory of why**]{.underline},
say, [the]{.underline} American [government]{.underline}
significantly(not merely in excusable rhetoric) [might magnify and even
invent threats]{.underline} (and, more seriously, act on such inflated
threat estimates). In a few places, Eland (2004, 185) suggests that such
behavior might stem from military or national security bureaucrats'
attempts to enhance their personal status and organizational budgets, or
even from the influence and dominance of "the military-industrial
complex"; viz.: "Maintaining the empire and retaliating for the blowback
from that empire keeps what President Eisenhower called the
military-industrial complex fat and happy." Or, in the same section: In
the nation's capital, vested interests, such as the law enforcement
bureaucracies . . . routinely take advantage of "crises"to satisfy
parochial desires. Similarly, many corporations use crises to get pet
projects\-\-- a.k.a. pork\-\--funded by the government. And national
security crises, because of people's fears, are especially ripe
opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182) Thus,
"[bureaucratic-politics" theory]{.underline}, which once made several
reputa- tions (such as those of Richard Neustadt, Morton Halperin, and
Graham Allison) in defense-intellectual circles, and spawned an entire
sub-industry within the field of international relations,5 [is put into
the service of dismissing putative security threats as
imaginary]{.underline}. So, too, can a surprisingly cognate theory,
"public choice,"6 which can be considered the right-wing analog of the
"bureaucratic-politics" model, and is a preferred interpretation of
governmental decision- making among libertarian observers. As Eland
(2004, 203) summarizes: Public-choice theory argues \[that\] the
government itself can develop sepa- rate interests from its citizens.
The government reflects the interests of powerful pressure groups and
the interests of the bureaucracies and the bureaucrats in them. Although
this problem occurs in both foreign and domestic policy, it may be more
severe in foreign policy because citizens pay less attention to policies
that affect them less directly. There is, in this statement of
public-choice theory, a certain ambiguity, and a certain degree of
contradiction: Bureaucrats are supposedly, at the same time, subservient
to societal interest groups and autonomous from society in general. This
journal has pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely
consequence of the public's ignorance of most areas of state activity
(e.g., Somin 1998; DeCanio 2000a, 2000b, 2006, 2007; Ravenal 2000a). But
state autonomy does not necessarily mean that bureaucrats substitute
their own interests for those of what could be called the "national
society" that they ostensibly serve. I have argued (Ravenal 2000a) that,
precisely because of the public-ignorance and elite-expertise factors,
and especially because the opportunities\-\--at least for bureaucrats (a
few notable post-government lobbyist cases nonwithstanding)\-\--for
lucrative self-dealing are stringently fewer in the defense and
diplomatic areas of government than they are in some of the
contract-dispensing and more under-the-radar-screen agencies of
government, the "public-choice" imputation of self-dealing, rather than
working toward the national interest (which, however may not be
synonymous with the interests, perceived or expressed, of citizens!) is
less likely to hold. In short, state autonomy is likely to mean, in the
derivation of foreign policy, that "state elites" are using rational
judgment, in insulation from self-promoting interest groups\-\--about
what strategies, forces, and weapons are required for national defense.
Ironically, "public choice"\-\--not even a species of economics, but
rather a kind of political interpretation\-\--is not even about "public"
choice, since, like the bureaucratic-politics model, it repudiates the
very notion that bureaucrats make truly "public" choices; rather, they
are held, axiomatically, to exhibit "rent-seeking" behavior, wherein
they abuse their public positions in order to amass private gains, or at
least to build personal empires within their ostensibly official niches.
Such sub- rational models actually explain very little of what they
purport to observe. Of course, there is some truth in them, regarding
the "behavior" of some people, at some times, in some circumstances,
under some conditions of incentive and motivation. But the factors that
they posit operate mostly as constraints on the otherwise rational
optimization of objectives that, if for no other reason than the playing
out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial
imperatives. My treatment of "role" differs from that of the
bureaucratic-politics theorists, whose model of the derivation of
foreign policy depends heavily, and acknowledgedly, on a narrow and
specific identification of the role- playing of organizationally
situated individuals in a partly conflictual "pulling and hauling"
process that "results in" some policy outcome. Even here,
bureaucratic-politics theorists Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow (1999,
311) allow that "some players are not able to articulate \[sic\] the
governmental politics game because their conception of their job does
not legitimate such activity." This is a crucial admission, and one that
points\-\-- empirically\-\--to the need for a broader and generic
treatment of role. Roles (all theorists state) give rise to
"expectations" of performance. My point is that [virtually every
governmental role, and especially national-security roles]{.underline},
[and particularly the roles of the uniformed mili- tary,
embody]{.underline} expectations of devotion to the "national interest";
rational- ity in the derivation of policy at every functional level; and
[**objectivity** in the treatment of parameters, especially external
parameters such as "threats" and the power and capabilities of other
nations.]{.underline} [Sub-rational models]{.underline} (such as "public
choice") [fail]{.underline} [to take into account even a partial
dedication to the "national" interest]{.underline} ([or even the
possibility that the national interest may be honestly misconceived in
more paro- chial terms). In contrast, an official's role connects the
individual to the (state-level) process, and moderates the]{.underline}
(perhaps otherwise) [self-seeking impulses of the individual.
Role-derived behavior tends to be formalized and codified; relatively
transparent and at least **peer-reviewed**, so as to be consistent with
expectations; surviving the particular individual and trans- mitted to
successors and ancillaries; measured against a standard and thus
corrigible; defined in terms of the performed function and therefore
derived from the state function; and uncorrrupt, because personal
cheating and even egregious aggrandizement are conspicuously
discouraged]{.underline}. My own direct observation suggests that
[defense decision-makers attempt to "frame" the structure of the
problems that they try to solve on the basis of the **most accurate
intelligence**. They **make it their business to know** where the
threats come from. Thus, threats **are not "socially
constructed**"]{.underline} (even though, of course, some values are). A
major reason for the rationality, and the objectivity, of the process is
that much security planning is done, not in vaguely undefined circum-
stances that offer scope for idiosyncratic, subjective behavior, but
rather in structured and reviewed organizational frameworks.
Non-rationalities (which are bad for understanding and prediction) tend
to get filtered out. [**People are fired for presenting skewed
analysis** and for making bad predictions. This is because something
important is riding on the causal analysis and the contingent
prediction.]{.underline} For these reasons, "[public choice" does not
have the "feel" of reality to many critics who have participated in the
structure of defense decision-making. In that structure]{.underline},
obvious, and even not-so-obvious,["rent-seeking" would not only be
shameful; it would present a **severe risk of career
termination**.]{.underline} And, as mentioned, the defense bureaucracy
is hardly a productive place for truly talented rent-seekers to
operatecompared to opportunities for personal profit in the commercial
world. A bureaucrat's very self-placement in these reaches of government
testi- fies either to a sincere commitment to the national interest or
to a lack of sufficient imagination to exploit opportunities for
personal profit.

#### Operational warfare is useless as a concept and probably wrong

**Chandler 9** (David, prof of IR @ westminster, \"Liberal War and
Foucaultian Metaphysics,\" Review of Dillon and Reid's The Liberal Way
of War: Killing to Make Life Live,
www.research.kobe-u.ac.jp/gsics-publication/jics/chandler_18-1.pdf)

[This is a book about the 'liberal way of war']{.underline}. But [the
liberal referred to in the title remains under theorized]{.underline}.
On several occasions the authors highlight the distinction between the
liberal way of war and the general framing of war in the modern liberal
era as a geo-strategic contestation, taking the territorial state as its
referent object. For Dillon and Reid, 'liberalism never fitted this
model of modern politics and the modern problematization of war very
well'（p.83). They therefore seek to define liberalism and the liberal
way of war as distinct from war in the liberal era. **[The liberal way
of war refers not to real wars and conflicts but to an abstract model of
conflict]{.underline}**, defined as a desire to'remove war from the life
of humanity'which'derives from the way in which liberalism takes the
life of the species as its referent object of politics ─
biopolitics'（p.84）. [In this framing, the liberal nature of war very
much depends on the self-description of the conflict by its
proponents]{.underline}: these range from Gladstone's occupation of
Egypt in the cause of'suffering humanity', to US liberal ideological
constructions of the cause of'freedom'in the Cold War struggle against
the Soviet Union up to Bush and Blair's war on Iraq in the cause of
humanity（p.6）. As the authors state, of course, [wars may be fought on
other grounds than universal humanity: 'liberal states may...also act as
geopolitical sovereign actors as well...and may also have geopolitical
motives]{.underline} for the wars they wage'（p.84）.¶ **[It is clear
from the beginning that the distinctiveness of 'the liberal way of war'
which they seek to explore cannot be more than a fool's
quest]{.underline}**. They assert that they will critically uncover the
paradox of liberal war: why it is that Realist or geostrategic war
accepts the necessity of war but attempts to limit it, while liberals
wish to end war but, to do so, are willing to fight unlimited wars. Yet,
they admit that **[this starting point is already an ideological dead
end]{.underline}** [─ the wars of the twentieth century give the lie to
the idea that there is some distinction between 'unending crusades' and
'limited jousts between rationally calculative political subjects': war
has its own dynamic]{.underline}（p.7). [Nevertheless, Dillon and Reid
press on and seek to go beyond a Schmittian critique]{.underline} to
ground this paradox in the biopolitical'driver'of the liberal way of
rule ─ biopolitics: wars waged under the banner of the human（against
humans）are liberal and, allegedly biopolitical, as human life is
declared to be the referent in need of being secured. [These wars are
alleged to be fought differently to geo-political wars for territory,
because the 'drivers' of war are not territorialized interests but the
biopolitical framings of the needs of the human, how human life can and
should be lived.]{.underline} [Inevitably there are **insuperable
methodological hurdles** to this Sisyphusian task]{.underline}. Already,
[there occurs the first fundamental aporia: how do we tell the
difference between a liberal and non-liberal war?]{.underline} [There
appears to be no way of preventing the category of liberal war from
becoming a lifeless and descriptive one: wars are liberal and fought
biopolitically only if we are told that these are the motives by those
fighting them]{.underline}.¶ **[This separation of liberal ways of war
from territorialised framings of geostrategic contestation makes little
sense]{.underline}** [as a framework for understanding]{.underline}
either liberal rule or liberal ways of [war]{.underline}. In fact, [in
defining liberal war in this way the connection between liberal rule and
war is entirely severed]{.underline}. ['Liberal war may on occasions
also be geopolitical; which is to say that war may be simultaneously
geopolitical as well as biopolitically driven since the imperatives
behind war are never uniform or simple; but what distinguishes the
liberal way of war as liberal are the biopolitical imperatives which
have consistently driven its violent peace-making.'（p.85）Liberal rule
has also resulted in wars for territory or in defence of
territories]{.underline}; nevertheless, a story, of course, could have
been told about how views of the human fitted those of struggles to
command territory. [This is acknowledged, but sits uneasily with the
narrow view of liberal war for species life.]{.underline} If the racial
doctrines of European empires, up to and including the genocidal racism
of the Nazi regime, were also biopolitically driven ─ and the authors,
indeed, write of race as part of the'liberal biopolitics of the
seventeenth century'─ then [it seems difficult to separate a liberal way
of war from allegedly 'non-liberal' wars of territorial
control]{.underline}.¶ It seems clear that Dillon and Reid do not seek
to take the logical step of arguing that the view of the human reflects,
and is reflected by, how the human is ruled and how wars are both
thought and fought. Why? Because for them there is something
suprahistorically unique and distinct about the liberal way of war: a
distinctly liberal view which foregrounds the human as the referent of
security. Therefore, **[a second aporia arises: on what basis is this
specifically 'liberal'?]{.underline}** [It would appear that every form
of rule and of war has at least an implicit view of the 'human' and
through this view of the human the form of rule and the way of war are
rationalized. There is not and cannot be anything specifically 'liberal'
about this]{.underline}. The humanity in need of securing, through war
on other humans, could be formed by Alexander the Great's stoic
cosmopolitan vision, or could be'God's chosen people', 'the master
race', or 'the gains of the proletarian revolution': there is little
doubt that beliefs of what the human is, or could become, were a vital
part of many non-Liberal dispositifs ─ the discourses and practices - of
both rule and war. ¶ **[The key starting assumption, that the liberal
way of war can be isolated from any other - and]{.underline}** its
alleged specific form, of '**[unending violence', explained by its
referent of the human - appears to be]{.underline}** a **[particularly
unproductive]{.underline}** one. [At the level of abstraction at which
Dillon and Reid choose to work, there is very little here that would
help to distinguish between a liberal and a non-liberal way of
war]{.underline}（the asserted purpose of the book）. Of course, what
matters is what this view of the human is. Here [Dillon and
Reid]{.underline} appear to [recognise the limits of their
essentializing approach]{.underline}: ...just as the liberal way of rule
is constantly adapting and changing so also is the liberal way of war.
There is, in that sense, no one liberal way of rule or one liberal way
of war. But there is a fundamental continuity which justifies us
referring to the singular...the fact that each takes the properties of
species existence as its referent object...finding its expression
historically in many changing formations of rule according...to the
changing exigencies and understanding of species being...（p.84）¶
[Rather than understand our forms of post-political rule and
post-territorial war today on their own terms]{.underline} and then
consider to what extent this way of rule and war can be theorized, and
to what extent, if any, Foucault's conception of biopolitics may be of
assistance, [Dillon and Reid start out from the assumption that we live
in a liberal world of rule and war and that therefore both can be
critiqued]{.underline} through the framework developed by Foucault in
his engagement with understanding the rise and transformation of liberal
forms of rule. [In transposing Foucault's critical engagement with
liberal ways of rule to an understanding of liberal ways of war, Dillon
and Reid take a body of historical work about the changing political
nature of liberal rule and transpose it into an essentialised and under
theorized understanding of liberal war.]{.underline} This is no mean
feat; how they manage this accomplishment will be discussed in the next
two sections.

### AT: Reps Matter

#### Reps don't shape reality and there's no impact

**Van Rythoven 19** (Eric, PhD from Carleton, Researcher @ journal of
global security studies, "The Securitization Dilemma," Journal of Global
Security Studies, 7-16-2019,
<https://academic.oup.com/jogss/article-abstract/5/3/478/5532523?redirectedFrom=fulltext#137694797>)

Tragedy is largely absent from the existing normative debate on
securitization. Instead, the [debate has]{.underline} become [organized
around whether securitization is a "negative" or "positive"
concept]{.underline}. In the classic formulation, the Copenhagen School
points to how "\[n\]ational security should not be idealized. It works
to silence opposition and has given power-holders many opportunities to
exploit 'threats' for domestic purposes" (Buzan et al. 1998, 29;
Williams 2003). [Securitization has negative effects when it functions
as "a political technology that consistently favors the interests of the
powerful and enables violence and exclusion"]{.underline} (McDonald
2015, 154). Correspondingly, Wæver admits a "'bias' for
desecuritization" or de-escalation, although he quickly notes that this
is "not always better than securitization" (Wæver 2011, 469). [At the
same time]{.underline}, a number of approaches point to cases where
[securitization]{.underline} [is ethically desirable]{.underline}. In
her compelling consequentialist argument, for example, Floyd asks
"whether the consequences of, and the gains from, the securitization are
preferable relative to the consequences and gains from a politicization"
(2007, 338). Relatedly, Roe contends that "[the extent to which
securitization necessitates a lack of openness and deliberation has been
overexaggerated" and suggests it may even elicit unappreciated forms of
cooperation]{.underline} (2012, 250).

[The problem with the negative/positive debate is that it appears to
impose moral certitude where there often is none.]{.underline}
[Registering securitizing moves as clearly positive or negative can be
difficult because their effects can be mixed and temporally
distant]{.underline}. The difficulty in making this determination may
also be an indicator of the uncertainty surrounding securitizing moves.
[In the end, because the outcomes of security claims are uncertain, we
cannot know in advance whether they will lead to positive or negative
consequences.]{.underline} Instead, [we should entertain a distinctly
tragic vision of securitization that council]{.underline}s [an ethic of
self-limitation]{.underline}. The core of this tragic vision is a
recognition that the powerful allure of using security talk to "gain
control" over a situation will always be present (Wæver 1995, 54).
However, we should also recognize that this control is always illusory
because it presumes all of its effects can be predetermined. The tragedy
of securitization is that the failure to recognize how contingency
imposes limits on action lures political actors into a false sense of
certainty and the conviction that they can determine the future. This
leads to a hubristic adoption of "misplaced certainty," such as when
Vice President Dick Cheney declared in August of 2002 that "there is no
doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction" (quoted
in Mitzen and Schweller 2011, 3). A similar situation emerged when
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld subsequently claimed in November
that the Iraq conflict could be "\[f\]ive days or five weeks or five
months, but it certainly isn't going to last any longer than that"
(Esterbrook 2002). A similarly misplaced certainty is evident in US
General Stanley McChrystal's assurances to the Obama administration in
2009 that a surge in troops and resources were critical to stave off
American defeat in Afghanistan (Woodward 2009). More recently, it is
visible in President Donald Trump's 2018 assertion that he was "100
percent right" on the weaknesses of the Iran nuclear deal (CNN 2018).

Yet, tragedy cuts both ways. [Blanket opposition]{.underline} [to
securitizing moves]{.underline} can also [have unanticipated
effects]{.underline}. Ironically, the [desecuritization of an issue may
not just result in its repoliticization]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} its [disappearance from public view]{.underline} (Floyd
2010, 57--58). [Viewing security discourse as negative also underplays
how the management of threats can serve as a focal point for democratic
cooperation among different political actors]{.underline} (Roe 2012,
250, 257--58). The point is not that every security discourse and the
practices it justifies has catastrophically perverse consequences.
Instead, the goal is to highlight a sensible restraint over the limits
of seeing into the future, how this shapes choice, and the dangers of
hubris that follow. [When]{.underline} properly [adapted]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} this [constructivist context]{.underline}, the tragic
vision of [securitization can be an important tool in cultivating
prudence and restraint]{.underline} (cf. Lebow 2003, 364).

The problem with this tragic vision is that it points to
[processes]{.underline} that [are never]{.underline} entirely [in our
possession]{.underline}. [Whether in the form of background
knowledge]{.underline} (Pouliot 2008), [habits]{.underline} (Hopf 2010),
[or routines]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006), much of [social life occurs
without conscious deliberation]{.underline} and reflection. These forms
of unthinking action impair reflexivity and limit actors' ability to see
how the world might be different and thus how outcomes can be uncertain.
In some cases, this can be benign, such as the unreflexive amity between
Canada and the United States that allows these countries to "escape"
from the traditional security dilemma (Collins 2014, 572--73). But just
as practices of amity can be habitual, so too can enmity. [The hawkish
US senator may designate Iran's nuclear program as threatening because
that is what hawkish US senators do, and there is no perceived way to be
hawkish otherwise]{.underline}. The result is that the uncertainty
surrounding securitizing moves becomes concealed under an unthinking
veil of common sense. The tragedy of securitization then is not only
that political figures often exceed their limitations by ignoring how
contingency can derail securitizing moves---it is that these limitations
often never even register

This means overcoming the tragedy of securitization require a certain
degree self-reflexivity. This is similar to what Booth and Wheeler
describe as the "security dilemma sensibility," or an actor's ability
and willingness to reflect upon their actions, including one's own role
in provoking insecurity in others (2008, 7). By sensitizing leaders to
how uncertainty is an endemic feature of political life, and how their
actions can be interpreted in unintended ways, security competition can
be mitigated, at least in part (Booth and Wheeler 2008, 265). Yet, these
moments of self-awareness and [reflection]{.underline} [are
difficult]{.underline} precisely [because there are powerful forces that
demand simplicity and closure: namely our desire for a stable sense of
self or what is widely referred to as ontological security]{.underline}
(Mitzen 2006). [Reflecting on the uncertainty of international politics
can erode one's sense of identity and agency]{.underline}, [ultimately
leading to a "deep, incapacitating state of not knowing how to get by in
the world"]{.underline} (Mitzen and Schweller 2011, 29). Booth and
Wheeler's security dilemma sensibility may have the laudable goal of
alerting leaders to the role of uncertainty in political life, but this
confronts the problem that many would prefer that it remain hidden.

The consequence is that this tragic aspect of the securitization dilemma
takes on an intractable character. Either unwilling or unable to "know
one's limits," as Herz would say (1950, 179), the role of uncertainty
becomes hidden and security claims appear as a reliable strategy for
control and influence. Like the classic realist dilemma, the
securitization dilemma is pervasive because it is often invisible. The
compelling need for a logic of selflimitation---of a careful and
reflective use of security language and how it can be derailed by
contingency--- is obscured because of an aversion to
recognizinguncertainty. It is this specter of a need for reflection and
restraint that may not be realized, I suggest, which demands that we
rethink the role of the analyst in provoking reflexivity among
power-holders.

Conclusion: Rethinking the Role of the Analyst

Motivated by the absence of unintended and perverse consequences in
constructivist theorizing of security, this article has pursued a
reconceptualization of the security dilemma. Viewing the dilemma as a
logic of limitation shaped by choice, uncertainty, and tragedy, the
argument focuses on transposing this logic to the constructivist context
of securitization theory. By showing how the choice to engage in the
social construction of threats is complicated by uncertainty and the
tragic failure to recognize one's own limits, the dilemma analytic helps
us to understand how securitization can be both a potent instrument for
mobilization, as well as a volatile source of unpredictability.
Moreover, this conceptual lens lays the foundation for an ethical
imperative of self-limitation among securitizing actors---albeit one
made difficult given the desire for simplicity and closure. Far from a
rebuke of constructivist theorizing, the argument shows that taking the
social character of security seriously means appreciating how political
claims are always vulnerable to being derailed by different types of
contingency.

This reconstructive move has important implications for studying the
social construction of security. First, while the initial influence of
realism on securitization theory is well-documented (Floyd 2010; Gad and
Peterson 2011), few attempts have been made to show how engaging with
these realist roots can yield new insights.22 Here, the reconstruction
of the security dilemma demonstrates how [returning to realist themes
can yield a fresh insights]{.underline}. Second, the argument pushes
scholars studying securitization to expand their universe of outcomes
beyond the reductive binary of success and failure and to consider cases
of perverse and unintended consequences. Not only are these outcomes
relatively common, they undercut the prevailing image of securitization
as a reliable technology of control. Third, the securitization dilemma
shows why uncertainty is more of an enduring problem for social action
than constructivists typically acknowledge. Contra earlier arguments
where learning and socialization effectively mitigate the problem of
uncertainty (Wendt 2006, 208--9), this perspective stresses how
contingency means that social acts like securitizing moves can have
unpredictable effects.

The most important result of this reconstruction, however, may be in how
taking the tragic element of the dilemma seriously reorders the
political role of the analyst. [Rather than assessing]{.underline} the
validity of [a particular security discourse]{.underline}, [or exposing
its socially constructed nature]{.underline}, [this
perspective]{.underline} asks the analyst to [provoke]{.underline}
[reflexivity]{.underline} [on behalf of power-holders over the risks
associated with securitization]{.underline}. While this entails a bias
toward deescalation and desecuritization, unlike other approaches this
is [not achieved through]{.underline} overt references to
[an]{.underline}y liberal, democratic, or [emancipatory
ideal]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline}, [it is packaged for
power-holders as a strategy of self-preservation]{.underline}. Here, the
analyst presents the move to securitize as a risk-laden and potentially
self-defeating strategy. The analyst points to a series of precedents
showing how such a strategy can produce perverse consequences: how
today\'s tough talk can become tomorrow\'s liability; how audiences can
interpret threatening messages in unexpected ways; and how today\'s
framing of security can lead to perverse consequences tomorrow. By
foregrounding the problem of uncertainty, the analyst works to
accentuate and impress upon actors the dilemmatic quality of
securitizing moves.

Yet, the problem with presenting the move to securitize as a risk is
that it may become accepted. Ironically, framing an escalation in enmity
as possible but dangerous is precisely what may legitimize such a move
in the eyes of risk-insensitive actors. This is Huysmans' (2002) now
familiar normative dilemma of writing security. The indeterminacy of
language means that political actors may interpret advice in
unpredictable ways. Frustratingly, this may include the precise opposite
of the analyst\'s intention. This situation is likely inescapable, but
it may be mitigated. What I suggest is that analysts should strive to
cultivate a deeper subjectivity of risk sensitivity, comparable to Booth
and Wheeler\'s security-dilemma sensibility, among political actors.

Key to this argument is how visions of the future satisfy the human
desire for certainty. As Berenskoetter argues, "visions depicting the
self in an imagined future order serve as anxiety controlling
mechanisms" (2011, 654). Visions of the future inoculate actors against
the anxiety of uncertainty by providing a narrative of where they are
going and how to get there. Indeed, normative debates on securitization
are already loaded with such visions. The impulse to securitize is
underpinned by a utopian future where the security frame can finally
mobilize a response to an otherwise intractable problem. Conversely, the
impulse to desecuritize is sustained by a dystopian future defined by
unrestrained authoritarian politics. A tragic vision of the future does
something different: it presents a future where the only thing we can
know decisively is that it is indeterminate and attempts to conclusively
control it are vulnerable to failure. The very recognition of
fundamental limits on human freedom (Steele 2007, 281--82) becomes
transformed into a source of ontological security. This tempers the
human need for cognitive closure by reconfiguring it into what Herz
understood as a "fundamentally humble posture toward the value and
precariousness of life" (Sylvest 2008, 442). [An actor with a greater
sensitivity to indeterminacy may still pursue securitizing moves, but
with a cautious awareness that they are volatile acts best pursued
sparingly]{.underline}. [The analyst does not simply educate political
leaders by pointing to the indeterminacy of the world; she seeks to make
political subjects more sensitive toward it by crafting visions of a
precarious future.]{.underline}

Finally, this tragic vision cannot, and should not, escape its own need
for reflexivity. Its scholarly proponents need to engage in their own
process of self-reflection, focusing on how their knowledge and
interests are themselves historically situated. The ethic of restraint
is a value, and not necessarily the value for all historical
circumstances. A recognition of the social construction of security
"facts" must be sobered by a recognition of the social construction of
security "values" (Hamati-Ataya 2012, 685).

**Mellor 13**, Ewan E. Ph.D. candidate, Political and Social Sciences,
European University Institute, 2013, "Why policy relevance is a moral
necessity: Just war theory, impact, and UAVs,"

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} section of the [paper
[considers]{.mark}]{.underline} more generally [[the need for]{.mark}
just war [theorists to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[engage]{.mark} with
[policy debate]{.mark}]{.underline} [[about]{.mark} the use of
[force]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as to engage with the more
fundamental moral and philosophical principles of the just war
tradition. It draws on John Kelsay's conception of just war thinking as
being a social practice,35 as well as on Michael Walzer's understanding
of the role of the social critic in society.36 It argues that the just
war tradition is a form of "practical discourse" which is concerned with
questions of "how we should act."37 Kelsay argues that: \[T\]he criteria
of jus ad bellum and jus in bello provide a framework for structured
participation in a public conversation about the use of military force .
. . citizens who choose to speak in just war terms express commitments .
. . \[i\]n the process of giving and asking for reasons for going to
war, those who argue in just war terms seek to influence policy by
persuading others that their analysis provides a way to express and
fulfil the desire that military actions be both wise and just.38 He also
argues that "[[good]{.mark} just war [thinking
involves]{.mark}]{.underline} [[continuous]{.mark} and complete
[deliberation]{.mark}]{.underline}, in the sense that one attends to all
the standard criteria at war's inception, at its end, and throughout the
course of the conflict."39 [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} is important as
it [[highlights the need]{.mark} for]{.underline} just [war scholars
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[engage with]{.mark} the [ongoing operations
]{.mark}]{.underline}in war and the specific policies that are involved.
The question of whether a particular war is just or unjust, and the
question of whether a particular weapon (like drones) can be used in
accordance with the jus in bello criteria, only cover a part of the
overall justice of the war. [[Without]{.mark} an [engagement]{.mark}
with the reality of war]{.underline}, [in terms of the [policies used in
waging it]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [it is impossible to engage with the
"moral reality of war]{.underline}]{.mark},"40 in terms of being able to
discuss it and judge it in moral terms. Kelsay's description of just war
thinking as a social practice is similar to Walzer's more general
description of social criticism. The just war theorist, as a social
critic, must be involved with his or her own society and its practices.
In the same way that the social critic's distance from his or her
society is measured in inches and not miles,41 the just war theorist
must be close to and must understand the language through which war is
constituted, interpreted and reinterpreted.42 It is only by
understanding the values and language that their own society purports to
live by that the social critic can hold up a mirror to that society to
demonstrate its hypocrisy and to show the gap that exists between its
practice and its values.43 The tradition itself provides a set of values
and principles and, as argued by Cian O'Driscoll, constitutes [[a
"language of engagement" to spur participation]{.mark}]{.underline} in
public and political debate.44 This language is part of "our common
heritage, the product of many centuries of arguing about war."45 These
principles and this language [[provide the terms through which
people]{.mark} understand and come to [interpret
war]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} not in a deterministic way but
[[by]{.underline} [providing]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[categories]{.mark} necessary [for]{.mark} moral understanding and
[moral argument ]{.mark}]{.underline}about the legitimate and
illegitimate uses of force.46 By spurring and providing the basis for
[[political engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} the just war tradition
ensures that the acts that occur within war are considered according to
just war criteria and [[allows policy-makers to be held to
account]{.underline}]{.mark} on this basis. Engaging with the reality of
war requires recognising that war is, as Clausewitz stated, a
continuation of policy. War, according to Clausewitz, is subordinate to
politics and to political choices and these political choices can, and
must, be judged and critiqued.47 Engagement and political debate are
morally necessary as the alternative is disengagement and moral
quietude, which is a sacrifice of the obligations of citizenship.48
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} engagement must bring just war theorists
into contact with the policy makers and [[will]{.underline} [require
work that is]{.underline}]{.mark} [accessible and [relevant to policy
makers]{.mark}]{.underline}, [however]{.underline} [[this does not mean
a sacrifice of critical distance]{.underline}]{.mark} [or an abdication
of truth in the face of power]{.underline}. [[By]{.underline} [engaging
in detail with]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [policies]{.mark} being
pursued]{.underline} and their concordance or otherwise with the
principles of the just war tradition the [[policy-makers will be forced
to account for]{.mark} their [decisions]{.mark}]{.underline} and justify
them in just war language. In contrast to the view, suggested by Kenneth
Anderson, that "the public cannot be made part of the debate" and that
"\[w\]e are necessarily committed into the hands of our political
leadership",49 it is incumbent upon just war theorists to ensure that
the public are informed and are capable of holding their political
leaders to account. To accept the idea that the political leadership are
stewards and that accountability will not benefit the public, on whose
behalf action is undertaken, but will only benefit al Qaeda,50 is a
grotesque act of intellectual irresponsibility. As Walzer has argued, it
is precisely because it is "our country" that we are "especially
obligated to criticise its policies."51 Conclusion This paper has
discussed the empirics of the policies of drone strikes in the ongoing
conflict with those associate with al Qaeda. It has demonstrated that
there are significant moral questions raised by the just war tradition
regarding some aspects of these policies and it has argued that, thus
far, just war scholars have not paid sufficient attention or engaged in
sufficient detail with the policy implications of drone use. As such it
has been argued that it is necessary for just war theorists to engage
more directly with these issues and to ensure that their work is policy
relevant, not in a utilitarian sense of abdicating from speaking the
truth in the face of power, but by forcing policy makers to justify
their actions according to the principles of the just war tradition,
principles which they invoke themselves in formulating policy. By
highlighting hypocrisy and providing the tools and language for the
interpretation of action, the just war tradition provides the basis for
the public engagement and political activism that are necessary for
democratic politics.52

[compromise]{.mark}]{.underline} and coordinate with other governments
in negotiations and crises. During the Cold War, political scientist
Robert Mandel noted how [crisis [exercises]{.mark}]{.underline} and war

nuclear crisis\*held in 2009 and 2010 at the Brookings Institution's
Saban Center and at Harvard University's Belfer Center, and involving
former US senior officials and regional experts\*highlighted the dangers
of misunderstanding foreign governments' preferences and misinterpreting
their subsequent behavior. In both simulations, the primary criticism of
the US negotiating team lay in a failure to predict accurately how other
states, both allies and adversaries, would behave in response to US
policy initiatives.7∂ [By university age, students]{.underline} often

[been used]{.mark} successfully [to teach students]{.mark} about such
disparate topics as European politics, the Kashmir crisis, and US

exercises certainly encourage students to learn political and technical
facts\* but they learn them in a more active style. Rather than sitting
in a classroom and merely receiving knowledge, students actively
research ''their'' government's positions and actively argue, brief, and
negotiate with others.13 Facts can change quickly; simulations teach
students how to contextualize and act on information.14

### AT: War is Simulation

[Hobbs 06 -- Lecturer in Media and Public Relations at the University of
Newcastle]{.underline}

(Mitchell, "Reflections on the Reality of the Iraq Wars: The Demise of
Baudrillard's Search for Truth?,"
https://www.academia.edu/2569231/Reflections_on_the_reality_of_the_Iraq_Wars_the_demise_of_Baudrillards_search_for_truth)

Although Baudrillard's work on "simulation" and "simulacra" is valuable
in highlightingthe relationship between the mass media and reality, and,
in particular, the ways in which media content (images and narratives)
come to be de-contextualised, his theses are per se insufficient for the
analysis of the contemporary mass media. For instance, asmedia theorist
and researcher Douglas Kellner (2003:31) notes, beyond the level of
media spectacle, [[Baudrillard does not help]{.underline}]{.mark}
readers [[understand events such as the Gulf War, because he
**reduces**]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[actions]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of actors [[and **complex political issues** to]{.underline}]{.mark}
categories of [["simulation"]{.underline}]{.mark} and "hyper-reality",
in a sense [["**erasing their concrete
determinants**"]{.underline}]{.mark}. Kellner, who like Baudrillard, has
written extensively on media spectacles, including theGulf Wars, sees
Baudrillard's theory as being "one-dimensional", "privilege\[ing\] the
form of media technology over its content, meaning and...use" (Kellner,
1989:73). In thisregard, [[Baudrillard]{.mark} [does not account for the
political economic dimensions of the newsmedia, nor the cultural
practices involved]{.mark}]{.underline} with the production of news
(Kellner, 1989:73-74). Thus, [[he suffers from]{.underline}]{.mark} the
same technologically **[[deterministic
essentialism]{.underline}]{.mark}** thatundermined the media theories of
Marshall McLuhan, albeit in a different form (Kellner,1989:73-74).
Although Kellner (2003:32) believes that Baudrillard's pre-1990s works
on "the consumer society, on the political economy of the sign,
simulation and simulacra,and the implosion of \[social\] phenomenon" are
useful and can be deployed within criticalsocial theory, he prefers to
read Baudrillard's later, more controversial and obscure, workas
"science fiction which anticipates the future by exaggerating present
tendencies" In order **[[to understand war]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
its relationship with the media in the contemporary era [[it
is,]{.underline}]{.mark} then, [[necessary to move beyond
Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark}'s spectacular theory of media
spectacle. For [[although our culture is resplendent with
images]{.underline}]{.mark}, signs and narratives, circulating in
aseemingly endless dance of mimicry (or, rather, simulacra), [[there are
**observable social institutions and practices
producing**]{.underline}]{.mark} this **[[semiotic
interplay]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although all that is solidmight melt
into air (Marx and Engles, 2002:223), appearances and **[[illusions are
not an end for]{.underline}]{.mark}** sociological
**[[analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but are rather a seductive
invitation to further social inquiry. As the research of Douglas Kellner
(1992; 1995; 2005) has shown, [[when]{.underline}]{.mark} media
[[spectacles are **dissected by critical**]{.underline}]{.mark} cultural
[[**analysis**, re-contextualisation is possible]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Images and narratives can be traced back to their sources:
whether]{.underline}]{.mark} they lie in Hollywood [[fantasies or
**government 'spin'**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In short, **[[by assessing
the veracity of competing texts, war]{.underline}]{.mark}** (as
understood by media audiences) **[[can be re-connected to its
antecedents and consequences.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Indeed, [[through
wrestling with]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[ideological
spectres]{.underline}]{.mark} of myth and narrative,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} by [[searching]{.underline}]{.mark} widely
[[for critically informed explanations]{.underline}]{.mark} of different
events, the social sciences can acquire an understanding of the
'truthfulness' of media representations; of the 'authentic' in a realm
bewildered by smoke and mirrors. As long as there are competing media
voices on which to construct a juxtaposition of 'truths', sociologists
can, to a certain extent, force the media to grapple with their own
disparate reflections. 3 CONCLUSIONS 3.1 REST IN PEACE BAUDRILLARD? In
the final analysis, then, Baudrillard's work on the Gulf War and the
September 11terrorist attacks should (respectfully) be laid to rest. For
although some, such as RichardKeeble (2004:43), have followed
Baudrillard in arguing that "there was no war in the gulf in 2003", such
statements are somewhat antithetical to the truth aims of the social
sciences. Baudrillard, being both an icon and iconoclast, pushed his
language and arguments to rhetorical extremes in order to force the
collapse of representations andarguments he saw as having supplanted
truth. His fatal theory was in a sense intellectual 'hype', for a
capricious world in which only 'hype' can be noticed. Yet in shouting
his arguments he served to obfuscate their nuance and subtext, the very
intellectualessences of his work and, ultimately, his contribution to
the body of knowledge. However, although fatal theory is of little
practical use for media researchers seeking anempirically derived
'truth', Baudrillard's oeuvre is still (somewhat) instructive,
remindingus of the importance of de-mystifying reality. For although the
voice of the scholar is that of a pariah in the entertainment driven
public sphere, [[we must force our voices into the public
sphere]{.underline}]{.mark} if we are to re-contextualise events such as
the Iraq war, [**[by providing]{.mark}**]{.underline} audiences with
**[[better, more veracious accounts of events]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[Failing this]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we will continue to find our
'defence' forces]{.underline}]{.mark} engaged [[in military operations
under spurious]{.underline}]{.mark} casus belli
[[arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}. Accordingly, despite the many faults
of his work, Baudrillard should not beforgotten. For although his
contribution was more of a slap-of-the-face than a gentlepush in the
right direction, his ideas regarding simulacra and reality have helped
to further our understanding of media spectacles (and their potential
repercussions). In apost-Baudrillard world, as social inquiry (it is to
be hoped) returns to a more empiricallyinformed understanding of the
media, we should not forget the implications posed by thiscultural
field. For if sociology seeks to explain the social world, then it must
work to prevent the dislocation of reality from the 'real' that
Baudrillard so feared.

explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHZl2naX1Xk) that the
resistors in Zion are a part of the overall Matrix program. By giving
rebellious outliers the illusion of autonomy and an escape into reality,
they ensure the greater overall stability of the Matrix. But
[[Baudrillard isn't happy]{.underline}]{.mark}. His criticism is that
the movies fail to enact his chosen form of rebellion which he
summarises in the interview as: "a glimmer of irony that would allow

Not being happy leads to drinking

This type of depression is linked to changes in light stemming from a
shift in seasons. Typically, symptoms of SAD start to emerge in the fall
and gradually worsen during the winter. Research shows that a lack of
light during the winter months contributes to a case of the "winter
blues". Oftentimes, these gloomy moods shift to optimistic spirits
through spring and summer. For a formal diagnosis, SAD symptoms must
present themselves for at least the last two consecutive years.Symptoms
of SAD include: [[Feeling sad]{.underline}]{.mark} and irritable most
days Oversleeping Gaining or losing more weight than usual Experiencing
changes in appetite Having a "heavy feeling" in arms and legs Alcohol
can be used to achieve a temporary sense of pleasure during dreary
months. However, frequent and excessive drinking can **[[lead
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** a full-blown addiction that lingers long after
fall and winter. This is because the body becomes dependent on the
chemicals released by alcohol to achieve feelings of happiness. As a
result, a person will begin to crave alcohol in order to achieve a
feeling of satisfaction. Psychotic Depression A more severe form of
depression, psychotic depression involves hallucinations, paranoia or
delusions. This type of depression can cause individuals to hear voices
or make them believe that someone is out to harm them. Some signs of
psychotic depression are: Extreme mood swings Staying awake all night
and sleeping all day Neglecting self-care, such as bathing Incoherent
speech Combining **[[drinking]{.underline}]{.mark}** with psychotic
depression can be extremely dangerous to one's health and well-being, as
well as those around them. Rather than providing a sense of calmness,
alcohol actually exacerbates the symptoms of psychotic depression. A
person's paranoia intensifies dramatically while under the influence,
resulting in bizarre behavioral outbreaks, mania and thoughts of
suicide.

Drinking causes extinction

🐸

In the context of Alcohol Use Disorders, the problematic behavior is
drinking alcohol and the reward is the release of endorphins. This
behavior has been rewarded each and every time you've had a drink your
entire life. The solution is to withhold the treat--the pleasurable
buzz--until your brain learns that it will no obtain the expected reward
it's seeking. When your brain learns that
**[[drinking]{.underline}]{.mark}** no longer **[results in]{.mark}** a
pleasurable reward, extinction has occurred. But **[extinction]{.mark}**
with the Sinclair Method does not happen overnight. Factors That
Influence the Rate of Extinction Extinction can be more complex, though,
especially in adults who have developed ingrained behaviors that produce
harmful consequences (e.g. alcoholism). This is why it's important to
understand how to influence the rate of extinction. A behavior does not
have to be rewarded every single time it occurs, in order for it to
continue. Rewards that are given at regular or irregular intervals are
highly reinforcing as well

#### Invoking simulacra is a capitalist ploy to distract from materialism

**Schwabach 3** (Aaron Schwaback @ Jefferson School of Law - Professor

Although this theme has attained the status of a cliche, one
carefullydeveloped depiction is that in Joe Haldeman's novel Forever
Peace.78 The story's protagonist, Julian Class, is a University of Texas
professor and [U.S. Army sergeant who spends]{.underline} ten days each
month [remotely operating a military robot metonymically (and
ironically) called a soldierboy]{.underline}. Together Class and the
soldierboy **[form a cyborg]{.underline}** -- a concept often linked in
fiction and criticism with problems of identity. 79 Class, in the person
of the soldierboy, [fights against third-world guerrillas who, unlike
him, **are actually present.** In one disturbing scene, he and his
fellow soldiers discuss having killed two ten-year-old girls who fired
upon the soldierboys.]{.underline}80 [The girls could not have inflicted
serious damage on the robot, and, of course, could not have injured
Class or his fellow operators, who were far away and safe at the
time.]{.underline} The scene could have been written in response to
Baudrillard's solipsistic view of virtual war as nothing more than
non-intersecting simulacra -- [for Baudrillard, the simulacral war that
the "Americans" experienced **never mirrored that experienced by Saddam
Hussein**]{.underline}: "\[T\]he two adversaries did not even confront
each other face to face, the one lost in its virtual war won in advance,
the other buried in its traditional war lost in advance."81 Haldeman's
reader, however, is left with the horrified awareness that, [while
Class's war is a simulacrum, **the little girl's death is real.
Inhabiting worlds of simulacra** is a **luxury** enjoyed by **academics
from wealthy countries, like Jean Baudrillard**]{.underline} and Julian
Class, [one of whom may be no more and no less real than the
other]{.underline}. [**Those who actually risk death** in war, though,
**enjoy no such luxury**, but **must believe in the reality** of war and
their own existence]{.underline}.

#### Baudrillard is wrong -- class struggle cannot be defined by signs when signs don't control the world

[SIGN FETISHISM]{.underline}: [ISSUES WITH BAUDRILLARD\'S
THOUGHT]{.underline} While there are plenty of useful and practical
insights to be found [in the work of]{.underline} early
[Baudrillard]{.underline}, [there are]{.underline} also [many worrisome
tendencies that begin to show themselves]{.underline} in said texts. In
FCPES, [Baudrillard asserts multiple times that modern capitalism has
put its]{.underline} core [emphasis on sign value and the reproduction
of the system]{.underline} through the dogmatic (re)production of the
code. For Baudrillard, \"sign exchange value is fundamental --- use
value is often no more than a practical guarantee;\" [he intends for
this to be a critique of]{.underline} a supposed ahistorical view of
human needs that [Marx]{.underline}ists uphold.15 Reacting to this
perceived ahistoricism, [Baudrillard]{.underline} simply [ends up
bending the stick too far in the opposite direction]{.underline}. [One
only needs to look to Marx]{.underline} in Capital, Vol. 1, [to combat
this over-enthusiastic stick-bending]{.underline}. Marx states that
\"[the commodity is]{.underline}, first of all, [an external
object]{.underline}, a thing [which through its qualities satisfies
human needs]{.underline} of whatever kind. [The nature of these
needs]{.underline}, whether they arise, for example, from the stomach,
or the imagination, [makes no difference]{.underline}.\"16 It is clear
that [Marx never saw use values as fulfilling static human
needs]{.underline}; indeed, in Marx's conception, human needs are
subject to social-historical transformation, and are fulfilled by social
use values. [There is thus no need]{.underline}, [as Baudrillard
does]{.underline}, to disregard use values as ahistorical and false, nor
is there a need to conceive of use value as a purely discursive
guarantor of exchange value. [Sign value is simply that part of the
commodity]{.underline}, one might say, that fulfills that
social-imaginative need of fitting into a particular position in the
capitalist social hierarchy, which is explained by the link between sign
value and use value (SgEV-UV). [Baudrillard's totalizing view of sign
value]{.underline} and the code also poses two other problems; it [is
vaguely defined yet monolithic]{.underline}. [Baudrillard seems to think
that the code of capitalist society --- that of political economy --- is
singular]{.underline}, without contradiction. [This is just not
true]{.underline}. As Valentin Vološinov states in his work Marxism and
the Philosophy of Language: [Existence reflected in sign is]{.underline}
not merely reflected but [refracted]{.underline}. How is this refraction
of existence in the ideological sign determined? [By an intersecting of
differently oriented social interests within one and the same sign
community]{.underline}, i.e., by [the class struggle]{.underline}.
[Class does not coincide with the sign communit]{.underline}y, i.e.,
with the community which is the totality of users of the same set of
signs for ideological communication. Thus [various different classes
will use one and the same language]{.underline}. As a result,
[differently oriented accents intersect in every ideological sign. Sign
becomes an arena of the class struggle]{.underline}.17 [Signs
are]{.underline} not singular [in their meaning]{.underline}, but
[multiaccentual]{.underline} --- [they are overdetermined by a
multiplicity of codes]{.underline} (class, race, gender, sexuality and
so on), and the [sign value of a commodity may differ according to how
it speaks to these codes]{.underline}. [Baudrillard's monolithic
formulation]{.underline} of the code [is]{.underline} actually what
Vološinov points to as [the goal of]{.underline} [the ruling
class]{.underline}: \"to extinguish or drive the inward struggle between
social value judgements which occurs in \[the sign\], to make \[it\]
uniaccentual.\"18 [Forgoing the sign as a site of class
struggle]{.underline}, [Baudrillard wishes to abandon the logic of the
sign altogether]{.underline}, [substituting it for what he
calls]{.underline} \"[symbolic exchange]{.underline}.\" Symbolic
exchange, while [taking on various definitions in Baudrillard's
thought]{.underline},19 most concretely [refers to any social practice
that defies]{.underline} the \"repressive, reductive, rationalizing
metaphysic of [utility]{.underline}.\"20 Pulling from Georges Bataille's
theory of the general economy21 and Marcel Mauss's analysis of gift
economies,22 [Baudrillard sees symbolic exchange as that which defies
the equalizing, totalizing logic of the sign]{.underline} -- it is
ambivalent to the logic of value as such, and acts as the radical
negation of the value systems of capitalist society, allowing for the
destruction of (sign) value logic and the possibility for other ways of
being in the world to emerge. [Practices of symbolic exchange for
Baudrillard include gift-giving]{.underline}, sacrifice, and excessive
festivities. [As Baudrillard put it]{.underline}, \"the symbolic social
relation is the uninterrupted cycle of giving and receiving, which, in
primitive exchange, includes the consumption of the 'surplus' and
deliberate anti-production.\"23 As Douglas Kellner has noted, the
politics of symbolic exchange are similar to the politics of difference
and the micropolitics of desire advocated by many of Baudrillard's
contemporaries. The issue with Baudrillard's version of this politics,
however, [is that it comes up against his own monolithic]{.underline},
all-consuming, all-encompassing conception of the code, which can
seemingly co-opt and absorb all opposition. Thus, as Kellner notes,
[Baudrillard can only advocate a vague]{.underline},
[unhelpful]{.underline}, [ultra-leftist practice of]{.underline}
\"[total refusal]{.underline}, total [negativity and the utopia of
radical otherness;\" a position which forgoes any possibility for a
material revolution]{.underline}.24 [Baudrillard's sign fetishism only
proceeds to get worse over time]{.underline}. Forgoing even the notion
of a critical political economy of the sign, [Baudrillard later comes to
believe that the reproduction of society no longer centres on
reproducing the mode of production]{.underline}, [but the code itself:
The other production]{.underline}, that of values and commodities, that
of the belle epoque of political economy, has for a long time had no
specific meaning. What [every society looks for in continuing to
produce, and to overproduce]{.underline}, [is to restore the real that
escapes it]{.underline}. [That is why today this]{.underline}
\"material\" [production is that of the hyperreal
itself]{.underline}.[25]{.underline} There is no longer a \"real\" base
where production takes place. There is only a \"hyperreal,\" something
that appears more real than the real world itself --- we live, according
to Baudrillard, in a world smoothed of all its real contradictions, and
where apparent contradictions merely exist to perpetuate an illusion of
what our society is supposed to look like. Taken to its most nihilistic
conclusions in Fatal Strategies (1983), this theory asserts that objects
have come to rule subjects, and the social has officially been wiped
out. We as subjects must accept this defeat and adopt objecthood
ourselves. What is probably most compelling about Baudrillard to many
--- including post-leftist TikTokers --- is what feels like the
descriptive power of some of the borderline science-fiction predictions
he makes in works like Fatal Strategies. With the development of the
internet and its acceleration of communication, it can often feel for
middle-class young people that they are living out most of their lives
in the hyperreal. The code of corporate social media spaces seems to
pull them in, hijack their sense of belonging, and render them passive
consumers of content. All media has become seemingly cool --- cold, even
--- and them along with it. For young people who have grown up with the
internet as a core part of their social experiences, this can feel all
too real. Alienation, for us, is automatically linked to the sensation
of simulation, the proliferation of the code, and not immediately
identified with material strife. The issue here, however, is that [the
world has not been reduced to the code]{.underline}. [The development
and proliferation of hierarchical sign-systems]{.underline}, the
building blocks of ideology, [quilted through the power of material
institutions in the capitalist mode of production]{.underline}, [is
undeniable]{.underline}. There is certainly a different ideological
apparatus to contend with that requires new thinking and modes of
analysis to comprehend fully. But [there is still a material base
co-constituted with this ideological apparatus]{.underline}; there is
still [material exploitation at the site of capitalist
labour]{.underline}, and the extraction of surplus value is still
central to reproduction of capitalist society. [Exploitation of labour
and the labour of consumption under late capitalism are both significant
and central experiences of the subject in advanced capitalist
societies]{.underline}; [consumption on its own is not]{.underline}. In
his sign fetishism and monolithic conception of the code, [Baudrillard
ended up taking the side of capital]{.underline}, [erasing any potential
for resistance against capitalism]{.underline}.

#### Baudrillard's theory essentializes and valorizes the feminine and reproduces explicit binaries that subjugates and undermines women

A Keith **Goshorn**, critical theorist, associate professor of sociology
at colgate university, Baudrillard: A Critical Reader, edited by Douglas
Kellner, 19**94**, pg. 258-260

Yet more crucial than the above general considerations should be an
examination of **[[Baudrillard's rather careless employment of a
category of "the feminine]{.mark},]{.underline}**" particularly in
constructing one of his central theoretical figures, **[[the notion of
seduction.]{.underline}]{.mark}** this usage of "the feminine" here and
elsewhere in his writing surely appears, on the surface, to be
**[risking [a narrowly essentialized definition
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** the term, and one drawn *from* the social
postures of a previous century at that. Worse, he might be said to be
participating in a continued "metaphorization" of [**[the
feminine]{.underline}**,^3^]{.mark} which marks the distancing and
objectification of women as Other-ness. Seen in this light, his posture
would only be typical of a long history of male philosophers trying to
"place into discourse" an idealized or imaginary "feminine" while
remaining relatively indifferent to or ignorant of the status of the
"real" women around them. Furthermore, can he also fairly be charged
with **[[employing an outmoded]{.mark} binary and oppositional sense of
[masculine/feminine polarity]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- even though he
is obviously trying to exca­vate through the theory of seduction a
strategy which, even in the words of his harshest critics, seems to \...
. subvert \... fixed dualities between masculine and feminine"^4^?
**[[The charges of his allegedly essentialized usage of
femininity]{.mark} (and masculinity) [must be weighed not against any
possible ameliorations by elder male generational
oversight]{.mark}]{.underline}** (if it is indeed only that), but
against the possibility that his intention has been rather to
deconstruct the historical function of the *category* itself and how
**it** has supposedly been used. From this perspective, his aim is not
primarily to create a discourse of female submission, but to develop a
counterfactual sub-discourse which set an overt agenda by which
masculine prerogatives have only constructed themselves in defensive and
insecure postures against a naturally superior female order and its
dominant set of "secret" goals. While any, even preliminary,
understanding of his precarious position here will require some defining
extrapolations of what a deliberately uncipherable and
non-representative theory of seduction represents, a fair-minded
critique will require some speculation as to what purpose the author
intended by such a theory as well as a judgment of its results. One must
then determine what advantages and disadvantages Baudrillard has given
himself in trying to counter the tyranny of the rationalist productivist
ethic with language drawn from a long-passed epoch rife with sexist and
"aristocratic overtones. And, finally, we can ask whether he may be
wisely obliged to abandon an unworkable theory of seduction in his
at­tempt to formulate a subversive counter-weight to the dominating mode
of capitalist productivism. And, regardless of our judgment on any of
the above, at this point in time, our attention is merited by any
theorist who undertakes to question and challenge, even indirectly, the
cultural foun­dations of the religion of "free market economy" which,
along with its semiotic viruses of commercial promotionalism and the
commodification of discourse, have so thoroughly naturalized themselves
into nearly all aspects of contemporary life, especially its discourse
of "sexuality." Baudrillard deserves further scrutiny from feminists
most particularly here for his attention to the exchange value basis of
traditional sexuality and its reflection of capitalist objectification,
paradoxically reproduced by its emphasis on individualist "subjectivity"
or subjective "individualism." For this sexuality as feminists have
known all along, is tainted as a sub-set derivative of what Baudrillard
calls "the abjection of free enterprise." Although it is unavoidably
necessary in addressing the issues at stake in this essay to use the
conventional distinctions of "male" critics and "fe­male" critics, I do
not intend to suggest in any way a grouping of qualities around or
inherent to either. Likewise, I do not mean to imply anything
necessarily synonymous between "women" and "feminists," even if these
two do occasionally get thrown together here. Furthermore, it should be
obvious by now that to be a feminist is not to automatically belong to
one gender or the other. Indeed, one of the foremost points I hope to
establish is that **[[Baudrillard's continuance in identifying
women]{.mark} only [with]{.mark} certain universalized ["feminine"
qualities is a severely detrimental limitation to the overall]{.mark}
more-radical [intentions of his]{.mark} theoretical
[project.]{.mark}6]{.underline}** This becomes evident when we begin to
see the contradictions that result from his ac­ceptance of the Freudian
axiom of a single, masculine libido theory of sexuality implicit in his
early writings on seduction, in contrast to his later theorizations of
entering a condition of *transsexuality* which begin to resonate with
the more progressive feminist notions of gender as a culturally learned
performativity. His notion of transsexuality is but an aspect of a
greater cultural movement of *transvestism,* which is the term he
utilizes to characterize the implosion of previous fixed cultural
polarities into what he sees as our current state of
*indeterminacy.^7\ ^*Ultimately, more is at stake here than simply
deciding whether Baudrillard has made sexist remarks, held onto
essentialized notions of women and "the feminine," or has been a
deliberately antagonistic provocateur of feminism and the social
movements for women's "liberation." What fi­nally matters in the
resolution of such questions is whether significantly new currents of
thought have arisen which have possibly erased the need or the basis for
past antagonisms. The one thing which I would assert with some certainty
at the outset is that both the adherents of the multiple strains of
today's feminism as well as the multiple adherents of Baudrillard's
theoretical project will be far better off if they can listen to and
learn from each other. For the French theorist is no more a 'traditional
male' than he is the embodment of his self-described 'supreme
femininity.[' **[And the most alert of today's feminists]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[no more [see themselves as a group of non-liberated]{.mark}
"autonomous feminine [subjects"]{.mark} than they are a group of
"non-seductive female []{.mark}phallocrats" as seen in the eyes of some
of their detractors.]{.underline}**

###  Repo. Futurism Link

#### Baudrillard's theory of the Hyper-real is inscribed within notions of *Reproductive Futurism*-a simulacrum which is self-replicating, repetitive, and meaningless- seeing Queer bodies as functionally "useless" and future negating because they do not possess the *natural* capacity for sexual reproduction.

SY

This paradox determines the trajectory of a recent essay by Jean
Baudrillard that was published under the deliberately inflammatory
title, ''The Final Solution.'' Baudrillard asserts that the human
species is confronting a life-and-death crisis around the question of
reproduction, more specifically, around its determination by way of
sameness or difference. But a vortex of contradictions engulfs his use
of these various terms, occasioning, or rather seeming to occasion, a
transvaluation of values in accordance with which they appear to signify
against our expectations: ''[There is something occulted inside us: our
deaths. But something else is hidden there, lying in wait for us within
each of our cells: the forgetting of death. **In our cells our
[immortality lies in wait for us]{.mark}. It's common to speak of the
struggle of life against death, but there is an inverse peril. And [we
must struggle against the possibility that we will not die. At the
slightest hesitation in the fight for death---a fight for division, for
sex, for alterity, and so for death]{.mark}---[living beings
become]{.mark} once again indivisible, [identical]{.mark} to one
another---[and immortal]{.mark}**.''49 Far from speaking, with the
sinthomosexual, for the death drive and its disarticulation of forms,
**[Baudrillard]{.mark} remains an [advocate]{.mark} here [of
reproductive futurism,]{.mark} explicitly [enlisting]{.mark} this notion
of death, this resistance to [immortality,]{.mark} against the force of
the death drive, which he assimilates to, and disavows as, the paradigm
of sameness: ''[The death drive]{.mark}, according to Freud, [is]{.mark}
precisely this [nostalgia for a state before]{.mark} the appearance of
individuality and sexual [differentiation]{.mark}, a state in which we
lived before we became mortal and distinct from one
another''**]{.underline} (interesting) (). He may trumpet what he calls
here the ''fight for death'' in thus opposing himself to the death
drive, disparaged as eternal pursuit of the Same and hence as
immortality, but opprobrium, in [Baudrillard's argument, still attaches
to the death drive only insofar as it constitutes a mortal threat to the
survival of the human]{.underline}---insofar, that is, as its sameness
might make human difference different. The immortality for which he
reproves it, then, threatens the human precisely with a death he would
have us fight against. It names the endless negation of form, and so of
what, for Baudrillard, defines the value of ''difference'': that is, our
distinctly human identity. As he sketches an evolutionary movement from
[''the absolute continuity found in the subdivision of the same---in
bacteria---to the possibility of life and death'' (), by which latter
phrase he indicates the attributes of sexual reproduction,
**[Baudrillard, complicit with]{.mark} tendencies of [scientific
discourse]{.mark} in general, [celebrates]{.mark} the triumph of [sexed
reproduction]{.mark} over genetic duplication in a teleological
narrative that itself [reduplicates the Freudian]{.mark} account of
[genitality's triumph]{.mark} over the various ''[partial''
drives]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Naturalizing this trajectory from the
replication he associates with genetic immortality to the procreation
made possible by encountering sexual, and therefore genetic, difference,
Baudrillard sounds the note of futurism's persistent love song to
itself, its fantasy of a dialectic capable of spinning meaning out of
history, and history out of desire: Next \[after the evolutionary moment
of bacterial replication\], the egg becomes fertilized by a sperm and
specialized sex cells make their appearance. The resulting entity is no
longer a copy of either one of the pair that engendered it; rather, it
is a new and singular combination. **[There is a [shift from pure and
simple reproduction]{.mark} to procreation: the [first two will
die]{.mark} for the first time, and [the third]{.mark} for the first
time will be [born]{.mark}. We reach the stage of beings that are
[sexed, differentiated, and mortal.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The earlier
order of the virus---of immortal beings---is perpetuated, but
henceforward this world of deathless things is contained within the
world of the mortals. In evolutionary terms, the victory goes to beings
that are mortal and distinct from one another: the victory goes to us.
() [**Or goes to ''[us'' so long as ''we'' don't identify]{.mark}---or
get identified by others---[with]{.mark} the regressive ''order of [the
virus]{.mark},''** of immortal sameness or repetition, that threatens
''us'' with the sort of death Baudrillard refuses to embrace (a death
through viral replication like that associated with what was referred
to, twenty years ago, as ''the gay plague''): **''This is the revenge
taken on mortal and sexed beings by immortal and undifferentiated life
forms. This is what could be called the final solution''**]{.underline}
(). Thus death, the corollary of difference, can function as a value
for Baudrillard in the context of individual identities alone (because
this, after all, allows for the Couple's dialectical survival in the
''third ''); it retains its negative valence where the species itself is
concerned.50 [The latter's impulse to immortality, to perpetuating its
self-perpetuation through the mechanics of genetic exchange, must resist
the backward appeal of ''involution,'' which signifies, for Baudrillard,
the regressive ''nullification of differences'' **(). It must, that is,
remain the same in its difference from the lethal sameness it condemns
for its nullification of difference, thus affirming as constant the One
of the Couple and the fantasy of the sexual relation as the ''duality
that puts an end to perpetual indivision and successive iterations of
the same'' ()**.]{.underline} Unless, of course, such iterations of the
same put an end to it instead. And that, according to Baudrillard, is
precisely what ''sexual liberation'' intends: [The first phase of sexual
liberation involves the dissociation of sexual activity from procreation
through the pill and other contraceptive devices---a transformation with
enormous consequences. The second phase, which we are beginning to enter
now, is the dissociation of reproduction from sex. First, sex was
liberated from reproduction; today it is reproduction that is liberated
from sex, through asexual, biotechnological modes of reproduction such
as artificial insemination or full body cloning. **This is also a
liberation, though antithetical to the first. We've been sexually
liberated, and now we find ourselves liberated from [sex]{.mark}---that
is, virtually [relieved of the sexual function]{.mark}. Among the clones
(and among human beings soon enough), sex, as a result of this automatic
means of reproduction, becomes extraneous, a useless function.**
()]{.underline}[)]{.mark} The meaning of ''sex,'' which Baudrillard
had identified earlier as a mode of reproduction (''sexed,
differentiated, and mortal'') distinct from that of ''deathless things''
(such as viruses and bacteria) by virtue of its mingling of genes to
create ''new and singular combination\[s\],'' undergoes an important
mutation here. How else to explain his odd characterization of
artificial insemination as ''asexual'' and (continuous in this with
cloning) as reproduction ''liberated from sex''? [**For whatever the
mechanism by which it's achieved---and ''[artificia]{.mark}l'' seems
largely a diacritical [term intended to naturalize]{.mark} the
[procreative function of heterosexual
intercourse]{.mark}---**insemination, the fertilization of egg by sperm,
defines the very principle of sexual reproduction for Baudrillard. **But
the evolutionary argument for genetic combination (the essay's original
meaning of ''sex'') has morphed, as it often seems to do, into a panicky
offensive against reproduction without heterogenital copulation (the
subsequent meaning of ''sex''**]{.underline}**).**What can the lament
for the putative loss of the sexual function mean, therefore, if not its
very opposite: that heterosexuality, stripped of its ancient
reproductive alibi, must assume at last the despiritualized burden of
its status as sexual function, as sinthomosexuality; that in the face of
what Baudrillard calls ''automatic'' or ''biotechnological'' modes of
reproduction, it must recognize the ''extraneous'' element in sex that
is never extraneous to sex and that marks it as a ''useless function,''
as a meaningless and unrecuperable expense, or even, as Jacques Derrida
has written with regard to différance, ''as expenditure without reserve,
as the irreparable loss of presence, the irreversible usage of energy,
that is, as the death instinct.''51 Like Faron, the narrator of The
Children of Men, for whom sex in a world without procreation---without
''the hope of posterity, for our race if not for ourselves''---becomes
''almost meaninglessly acrobatic,[**'' Baudrillard [recoils]{.mark} in
horror before [this ''useless'' sexuality]{.mark}. And a ''useless
function'' for Baudrillard, as his use of the same phrase elsewhere
suggests, means [one that refuses meaning:]{.mark}** ''At the extreme
limit of computation and the coding and cloning of human thought
(artificial intelligence), language as a medium of symbolic exchange
becomes a definitively useless function**. For the first time in history
we face the possibility of a Perfect Crime against language, an
aphanisis of the symbolic function.'**]{.underline}**'52** Aphanisis,
the term Ernest Jones introduced to identify the anxiety-inducing
prospect of the disappearance of desire, refers in the passage from
Baudrillard to the fading or, more ominously, to what he describes as
the **''global extermination of meaning''**, the unraveling of the braid
inwhich reproductive futurism twines meaning, desire, and the fantasy of
(hetero)sexual rapport. At the same time, though, it also evokes the
subsequent use of theword by Lacan, for whom it refers instead to the
fading or disappearance of the subject,whose division the signifier
effects in such a way that ''there is no subject without, somewhere,
aphanisis of the subject.'' Lacan will then go on to add, ''There is an
emergence of the subject at the level of meaning only from its aphanisis
in the Other locus, which is that of the unconscious.''53 Meaning, that
is, against whose aphanisis Baudrillard's jeremiad is launched, always
already entails, for Lacan, the aphanisis of the unconscious: ''When the
subject appears somewhere as meaning, he is manifested elsewhere as
'fading,' as disappearance'' (). Appalled by the imminence of a
''final solution,'' the liberation from sexual difference intended by
the force of ''perpetual indivision and successive iterations of the
same,'' Baudrillard holds fast to the meaning whose ''global
extermination'' sinthomosexuality is always imagined to effect and whose
Symbolic exchange jouissance would reduce to a ''definitively useless
function.''54 [**And he does so in the hope of perpetuating the temporal
movements of desire, of [shielding]{.mark} himself [from the
unconscious]{.mark}**(and the iterations of the drive, and securing,
through futurity, through the victory of narrative duration over irony's
explosive negativity, a ground on which to stand: ''The stakes,'' he
warns, ''are no longer only that 'history' is slipping into the
'posthistorical,' but that the human race is slipping into the void''
().]{.underline} And all because (heterosexual) sex has ''become
extraneous, a useless function,'' has become, that is, void of content
once the inspiriting meaning it carried---both like, and in the form of,
a Child---has vanished into the unregenerate materiality of the
signifier.55 For ''the signifier,'' as Lacan declares in his
interpretation of ''The Purloined Letter,'' ''is not functional''; it
exceeds its use-value in the service of signification and, especially as
localized in what the essay punningly engages as ''the letter,'' it
brings us back to the Real, to the fatality of ''what remains of a
signifier when it has no more signification.''56 Apostrophizing just
such a signifier, Lacan, in his reading of Poe's short story, makes
clear just what SINTHOMOSEXUALITY 65 Downloaded from

that presence of death which makes a human life a reprieve obtained from
morning to morning in the name of the meanings whose sign is your
crook'' (). **[[Baudrillard]{.mark}, like Silas Marner and Scrooge,

continuation of the reprieve by which he [perpetuates the fantasy space
essential to his desire.]{.mark}]{.underline}** 'We see no white winged
angels now,'' George Eliot observes. ''But yet men are led away from
threatening destruction: a hand is put in theirs, which leads them forth
gently towards a calm and bright land, so that they look no more
backward; and that hand may be a little child's.'' Or rather, though
that Child be as helpless as Eppie, as delicate as Tiny Tim, it must be
the hand of a ''little child'' that lifts us into the future and thereby
saves us, in the words of Baudrillard, from ''slipping into the void''
of all that is ''backward'' or ''involuted,'' of all that he condemns as
''successive iterations of the same'' that are, themselves, precisely
what old Mr. Lammeter knows we value in the Eppies and Tiny Tims who
embody reproductive futurism. As those faces of Eppie and Tiny Tim turn
their eyes to us once more, soliciting the compassion that always
compels us to want to keep them safe (in the faith that they will confer
on us the future's saving grace), let me end with a reference to the
''Fourteen Words,'' attributed to David Lane, by which members of
various white separatist organizations throughout the United States
affirm their collective commitment to the common cause of racial hatred:
''We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white
children.''57 So long as ''white'' is the only word that makes this
credo appalling, so long as figural children continue to ''secure
\[our\] existence'' through the fantasy that we survive in them, so long
as the queer refutes that fantasy, effecting its derealization as surely
as an encounter with the Real, for just so long must sinthomosexuality
have a future after all. For what keeps it alive, paradoxically, is the
futurism desperate to negate it, obedient in that to the force of a
drive that is futurism's sinthome.

#### Baudrillard's critique of spectacle and images fails to trace the genealogy of such events ultimately reifying the colonization of everyday life. 

**Jelly-Schapiro 18** (Eli, Associate Professor of English at the
University of South Carolina, *"Security and Terror: American Culture
and the Long History of Colonial Modernity*," This Is Our Threnody":
Writing History as Catastrophe, (2018), 6/27/22 - FI)

The conjoined critiques of spectacle, exception, and imperial capital,
though, are unevenly revelatory of the colonial essence and history of
contemporary culture and politics. This unevenness is an effect of
theory's symptomatic nature---the ways in which theory often echoes the
form of its critical object. The works I critically engage in this
chapter are exemplary instances of this formal echo. [[In their
critiques of spectacle,]{.mark} Jean [Baudrillard]{.mark}]{.underline}
and Slavoj Žižek [**[reproduce the ahistoricity of the image]{.mark},**
[leaving **untraced the genealogical**]{.mark} routes [that connect
commodity ascendance in the postcolonial metropole to the]{.mark} pure
**[articulation of commodity rationality in the
colony]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In their theorizations of bare life and
the state of exception, meanwhile, Giorgio Agamben and Judith Butler
affirm the exceptionalism of the War on Terror's political technologies.
Finally, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's critique of an emergent
imperial order adopts two abiding tropes of the "globalization" concept:
the assumption of an imminent or achieved planetarity---the
disappearance of the "outside" that is essential to colonial
rationality---and the assumption that the defining political forms of
this globalism originate in the advanced capitalist world. Spectacle,
Capital, Terror As theorized by Theodor Adorno and others, the mass
violence of the twentieth century redefined the aesthetic and political
implications of the sublime. Kant and Burke recognized that performances
of political violence could produce the sublime, but they reserved the
term "nature" for the non-human world. Writing in the eighteenth
century, they did not see, or anticipate, the profound reification of
social life under capital---the ways in which historically contingent
social relations, and the violence inherent therein, are rendered by the
mythos of capital as natural. In the context of this "second nature,"
the sublime acquires a different resonance and effect. Spectacular
instances of political violence, and indeed the relentless spectacle of
commodity culture, do not permit the second moment in Kant's dynamic
sublime, wherein human reason and rationality reasserts its dominance
over the irrationality of nature---because the irrationality of "second
nature" violence is inextricable from rationality itself, and because
there is no longer a position of safe remove, an outside, from which one
can regard and redeem the sublime. 4 The naturalization of commodity
rationality was a key concern of the thinkers of the Situationist
International. Guy Debord published his seminal Society of the Spectacle
in 1967. Debord named, in that book's title and in its interior
contents, a new form of capitalism based on the subjection of ever more
realms of human social life to the rationality of the market. In so
doing he described one of the defining characteristics of neoliberalism
before the neoliberal era had properly begun. (Most historians of
neoliberalism locate its inception in the early 1970s.) The prescience
of Debord's critique, and the endurance of the state of affairs he
highlighted and foretold, has ensured that the Society of the Spectacle
remains a relevant text, one with much to say about the culture and
techniques of contemporary capital accumulation. The "colonization of
everyday life" was enabled by the ascent of the image---as a commodity
in itself and as a screen that conceals, like a fetish, the reality of
capitalist social relations. Debord's use of the term
"colonization"---and Henri Lefebvre's echo of it---might be read as
proposing an obfuscatory analogy between the radically different
modalities of commodity rationality in the colony and metropole. His
choice of metaphor, though, evinces the historical articulation of,
rather than collapses the distance between, colony and metropole.
Invoking "colonization" rather than simply "commoditization" evokes the
dialectical relation between the violence of extractive industry in the
space of the colony and the saturation by the commodity form of all
spheres of human social life in the consumerist societies of the
overdeveloped world. It points, in other words, toward the history of
colonial violence that conditions---is synchronically and diachronically
connected to---cultures of alienation and exploitation in the
postcolonial metropole Reflecting the televisual glare of the Twin
Towers' collapse, several widely cited [theoretical texts composed in
the near aftermath of September 11]{.underline} summon Debord's
critique---[notably Jean Baudrillard's The Spirit of
Terrorism]{.underline} (2002), Slavoj Žižek's Welcome to the Desert of
the Real (2002), and the Retort group's Afflicted Powers (2004). The
contemporary critique of spectacle confronts the same theoretical aporia
negotiated by Debord: How to highlight the primacy of the image without
submitting to its power? How to reveal the ubiquity of commodity culture
without reinforcing its omnipotence and reproducing it's a historicity?
The Retort group observes that "[[the]{.mark} [**colonization of
everyday life"** is]{.mark} simply "'**[globalization' turned
inward]{.mark}**.]{.underline}" 5 [The [contemporary **critique of
spectacle**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} I want to argue,
[[mimics]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than resists [[this **inward
turning**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [violence of spectacle expresses
itself in both subjective and objective forms]{.underline}. [Subjective
violence,]{.underline} as Žižek has outlined this distinction, refers to
"violence [performed by a clearly identifiable agent]{.underline}"---the
violence that shows up on the evening news, the violence that disrupts
the peaceful workings of everyday social and political order. 6
[Objective violence]{.underline}, by contrast, [refers to the
often-invisible violence of the system itself]{.underline}---the
pervasive and perpetual violence of capital in its globalized form.
[Spectacular instances of subjective violence serve one of two
contradictory purposes. The dramatic car accident viewed by millions on
YouTube distracts from rather than directs our attention to the slow
ecological violence of automobile culture.]{.underline} [But the logic
of the terrorist attack]{.underline}---and indeed, as Retort cites, that
of "the ruined small farmer from South Korea, slashing his arteries in
defiance on the barricades at Cancun" 7 ---[avows that another form of
subjective violence is possible, one that will cut through the thick
screens of fetishism and reification.]{.underline} [The potentiality of
the "image-event" in exposing and resisting the objective violence of
commodity culture is one central concern of the contemporary critique of
spectacle.]{.underline} "The events in New York," Baudrillard writes in
The Spirit of Terrorism , "have radicalized the relation of the image to
reality. Whereas we were dealing before with an uninterrupted profusion
of banal images and seamless flow of sham events, the terrorist act in
New York has resuscitated both images and events." 8 The meeting of
image and event, though, is not seamless. "At the same time that
\[images\] exalt the event," [[Baudrillard
contends]{.underline}]{.mark}, "they also take it hostage. They serve to
multiply it to infinity and . . . are a diversion and neutralization. .
. . The image consumes the event, in the sense that it absorbs it and
offers it for consumption." 9 [The [force of the real event is
correlated to the symbolic power of its proliferation]{.mark} as image.
But [the reduction of the event to its image denies the experience of
the event as reality]{.mark}. [Baudrillard]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[elaborates]{.mark} this paradox by suggesting that [the destruction of
the Twin Towers elucidated the contest between, and entwined nature of,
reality and fiction]{.mark}.]{.underline} For many observers,
[Baudrillard notes, [September 11,]{.mark} 2001,]{.underline}
[[represented the "resurgence of the real . . . in an allegedly virtual
universe]{.mark}"]{.underline} (a resurgence that corresponded with "the
resurrection of history beyond its proclaimed end").
[Baudrillard]{.underline} is wary of this reading, however, and [insists
instead that if reality appears, in the event of the Twin Towers'
collapse, to overtake fiction, "this is because it has absorbed
fiction's energy, and has itself become fiction."]{.underline} 10 The
image precedes and surpasses the real event: "Rather than the violence
of the real being there first, and the frisson of the image being added
to it, the image is there first, and the frisson of the real is added."
[11 [The image delivers the real]{.mark}. In other words, the violence
of September 11 does not represent the return of history or the return
of the real.]{.underline} [It represents, rather, [the triumph of the
symbolic.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[In **Baudrillard's reading**]{.mark},
the [image-event of September 11 was **empty of political
content**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The political aims of its actors, the
historical forces from which it emerged and to which it responds---all
of this is eclipsed by the image. Every replay of the towers falling
serves to further evacuate the event of its historical and political
meaning. [[Yet in making this observation]{.mark} so central to his
account, [Baudrillard]{.mark} finds himself [stuck in]{.mark} something
of [a critical cul-de-sac]{.mark}.]{.underline} [His [emphasis on
September 11 as **spectacle**]{.mark}---[and his]{.mark} corresponding
[neglect of the concrete social relations within which the spectacle
operates]{.mark}---[serves to **reinforce** rather than resist the
**fetishism of the image**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The
question]{.underline}]{.mark} his account [ultimately
prompts]{.underline}, then, [[is how to "\[preserve\] intact the]{.mark}
unforgettable [incandescence of the image" 12 without being blinded by
it]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is not to condemn or dismiss Baudrillard's
essay---a slim and narrow volume that does not aspire to any kind of
comprehensive reading of global politics---but to [shed light upon the
ways in which the **dominance of the image is reprised** in the moment
of critique.]{.underline}

#### In Baudrillard's work we can trace we can trace a neo-primitivism logic -- as a projection of the western fantasy. 

**Li 06** (Victor, an award-winning multimedia journalist based in
Chicago, "*The Neo-primitivist Turn: Critical Reflections on Alterity,
Culture, and Modernity*," Primitivism without Primitives, or Towards
Alterity, Culture, and Modernity, (2006), 6/27/22 - FI)

[[Neo-primitivism as a primitivism without primitives will]{.mark}
logically [seek to]{.mark} dismiss or [drop the term
']{.mark}primitivism' [altogether]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is, after
all, a problematic term that some anthropologists as early as the 1940s
sought to eliminate altogether from their vocabulary. 121 [[But]{.mark}
though the term may be dropped, [a primitivist deep structure that
privileges]{.mark} the Other of modernity -- [an Other]{.mark} that
critically interrogates the modern -- [is retained.]{.mark}]{.underline}
The disappearance of the term 'primitivism,' like the vanished or
vanishing primitive, is thus not so much a complete effacement as a
displacement and transposition onto other terms or concepts that now
occupy the oppositional role to modernity that primitivism once did. I
will examine in the chapters that follow how primitivism has been
displaced into three new terms: alterity, culture, and, paradoxically,
modernity. That alterity should be a form of neo-primitivism is perhaps
not so surprising[. [A postmodern ethics]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of
alterity has sensitized us to the dangers of ethnocentric claims
to]{.mark} universal [sameness]{.mark}]{.underline}. Particular, local
forms of otherness have been mobilized in the struggle against the
universalizing metanarratives of a Eurocentric modernity. These local
others, often non-Western or seen as marginal to modernity, are not
directly referenced as primitives or represented as such in order to
avoid the evolutionary, hierarchical implications of the term.
[[Nevertheless]{.mark} [their alterity, symmetrically opposed to Western
modernity, continues to exhibit]{.mark} characteristics present in
earlier [descriptions of primitive cultures and societies]{.mark}. The
concept of alterity thus [follows the fetishisitic logic of
neo-primitivism in disavowing the primitive only to reinscribe its
difference]{.mark} once again.]{.underline} 122 As we will see, in the
next chapter on alterity, Jean [[Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark} not
only opposes the Eurocentric representation or incorporation of the
primitive, he [[argues that there are no longer any
primitives]{.underline}.]{.mark} [He remarks [that the death]{.mark} or
disappearance [of primitive others like the South American Indians
is]{.mark} [not only a sign of their]{.mark} uncompromised [alterity
but]{.mark} also of [their return as ']{.mark}viral [spectral
presence]{.mark}\[s\] \... \[[infecting\] the synapses of]{.mark} our
[\[Western\] brains]{.mark}.']{.underline} 123 [According to
Baudrillard, then, there are no longer any primitives and precisely for
that reason [they continue to haunt us]{.mark} powerfully.]{.underline}
Another philosopher of alterity, Jean-François Lyotard, drawing loosely
on the ethnographic work of André-Marcel d'Ans, mobilizes the cultural
difference of the Cashinahua, a small South American Indian tribe, to
interrogate Western universal or cosmopolitical thought. But, ever alert
to the dangers of ethnocentric projection, he also admits that his
description of Cashinahua difference may be 'simplistic' and part of a
tradition of Western exoticism. This autocritique of his own primitivism
does not, however, prevent him from regarding the Cashinahua example as
being 'essential' to any theoretical investigation into processes of
mythic or narrative legitimation that occur in modern forms of
totalitarianism. 124 Again [[we see a disavowal of the primitive
instance followed by its reinscription as an example of alterity
essential to exposing the totalitarian terror present in the
metanarratives]{.mark} of legitimation [that constitute the modern
West.]{.mark}]{.underline} Thus, [[in]{.underline}
[Baudrillard's]{.underline}]{.mark} and Lyotard's [[work we can trace a
neo-primitivist logic in which the primitive disappears]{.mark} as a
presence [to serve as an irreducible idea.]{.mark}]{.underline} Alterity
is also the name that Marianna Torgovnick uses to question Western
primitivism's ethnocentric projection of its fears and desires onto
primitive others. To Torgovnick, [[primitivism]{.mark} [reveals more
about the West than about the primitive whose alterity continues to
elude and challenge Western views]{.mark} of the self and the world.
[The primitive]{.mark} of Western primitivism therefore]{.underline}
[does not exist or, rather, [exists only as the projection of Western
fantasy]{.mark}.]{.underline} But if the fantasized, projected primitive
does not exist, the argument for an authentic primitive alternative to
modern Western thought is promoted in Torgovnick's work. She argues, for
example, that in the oceanic experience, which Freud considered to be
regressive and 'pre-Oedipal,' we have a primitive alternative to the
modern Western separation of the self from the world. Our fascination
with primitive life is thus an expression of the desire to undergo this
oceanic experience in which the autonomous self is voided and merged
with the entire sentient universe. 125 But, Torgovnick adds, this desire
is to be found not only in primitive societies. It is a desire also
present in certain religious forms and practices of the West. But this
desire is more often repressed, 'hounded out of institutionalized
religions,' and 'projected abroad in a complicated process by which an
aspect of the self was displaced onto the Other.' 126 Even as Torgovnick
incisively critiques Western primitivism's ethnocentric construction of
an exotic Other, she also asserts that 'what has been sought elsewhere
may yet be found in the folds and creases of the West's own neglected
traditions.' 127 In short[, the West's primitive Other disappears to
become the Other within the Western self. Primitive alterity is to be
sought not outside but inside the West itself.]{.underline} In
Torgovnick's version of a primitivism without primitives, primitive
others -- geographically, temporally, or culturally separated from us
are no longer needed because the so-called primitive quest for oceanic
ecstasy is to be found as much in the West as elsewhere. We no longer
need to go in search of primitives because they have been generalized or
universalized to the point where we can now say, 'primitives are us.'

#### Neo-primitivism ends up reinscribing the impacts of traditional primitivism as a grab bag of everything opposed to the modern west. 

**Li 06** (Victor, an award-winning multimedia journalist based in
Chicago, "*The Neo-primitivist Turn: Critical Reflections on Alterity,
Culture, and Modernity*," Preface, (2006), 6/27/22 - FI)

[Knowing as we do today that there have never existed peoples untouched
by history, why do we continue to believe that such groups of people,
by-passed by modern history, still exist?]{.underline} Why do we still
believe in the idea of the primitive when the term 'primitive' itself
has been increasingly withdrawn from circulation? Why still harp on the
primitive when we have been made aware that primitive society was an
invention of the modern West? These questions insistently frame the
example that follows. [[In]{.mark} the summer of [2003]{.mark}, [the
Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail featured]{.mark} in its book
review section [a photograph of 'an Aboriginal group in Australia \...
doing a traditional dance]{.mark}. [Leaves]{.mark} are [attached to
their ankles and emu plumes adorn their
headdresses]{.mark}.']{.underline} Exoticism visually established, a
brief entry under the photograph summarized the contents of the book
under review: 'As the world becomes increasingly globalized and as
McDonald's \[ sic \] sprouts on seemingly every corner, there are still
small pockets where individual cultures and ethnic groups survive. In
Living Tribes , Colin Prior gives a spectacular photographic record of
fifteen such peoples, from the Inuit to the Padaung of Thailand to the
Turkana of the Kenyan desert.' 1 [We will no doubt notice, especially in
these politically enlightened times, that [the word 'primitive' does not
appear in the description. Instead, acceptable terms like 'individual
cultures,' 'ethnic groups,' or 'living tribes' are
used.]{.mark}]{.underline} But even though the denigration implied by
evolutionary ranking is lifted when the word 'primitive' is studiously
avoided, it is less easy to avoid the suspicion that 'individual
cultures' or 'ethnic groups' may just be euphemisms inasmuch as they are
still employed as concepts opposed, as 'primitive' once was, to a
globalizing modernity. In other words, [terminological replacements for
'primitive' remain mere euphemisms if they continue to function
conceptually and rhetorically as endangered antitheses to the modern
West.]{.underline} To be sure, unlike 'primitive,' which is burdened by
a history of derogation, the [[new terms are]{.mark} [greeted positively
as]{.mark} expressions of [cultural resistance against]{.mark} the
threat of a [homogenizing]{.mark} modernity,]{.underline} the coming of
a monocultural McWorld. But the avoidance of the word 'primitive,' far
from signifying a complete rejection of primitivism, represents instead
primitivism's transmutation into the liberal creed of multiculturalism,
the preservation of cultural diversity in the age of globalization.
[Politically acceptable [terms like 'individual culture' and 'ethnic
group' may appear to oppose evolutionary narratives of primitive
inferiority, but they still fall into the 'savage slot' that primitivism
has always reserved for the Other of Euro-American
modernity.]{.mark}]{.underline} 2 We should also note that the
'primitive,' as a chronopolitical concept, is related to terms such as
the 'premodern,' the 'archaic,' and 'traditional' or 'tribal' societies.
These terms may have different temporal inflections than 'primitive,'
but they are often used as equivalents of the latter, especially in
their perceived common opposition to the concept of modernity. [[Like
Orientalism, primitivism functions as a grab-bag]{.mark} concept [into
which everything that is seen as opposed to the modern West is
gathered.]{.mark}]{.underline} As such, any study of primitivism (and
mine is no different) must acknowledge that the term 'primitive' lacks
singular definition and possesses protean, multiple identities. The
'primitive' is not an ontological entity; it is a relational concept
that expresses various 'modern' needs. The story of the 'savage slot'
and its related manifestations is well known and has been critically
analysed in such notable works as Johannes Fabian's Time and the Other ,
Adam Kuper's The Invention of Primitive Society , Bernard McGrane's
Beyond Anthropology , Marianna Torgovnick's Gone Primitive , Micaela di
Leonardo's Exotics at Home , Shelly Errington's The Death of Authentic
Primitive Art and Other Tales of Progress , Elazar Barkan and Ronald
Bush's collection Prehistories of the Future , Helen Carr's Inventing
the American Primitive , Sieglinde Lemke's Primitivist Modernism , Peter
Fitzpatrick's The Mythology of Modern Law , and Nicholas Thomas's
Colonialism's Culture . 3 A new perspective can, nonetheless, be
introduced to complicate this familiar story. Our awareness of the
chronopolitics and geopolitics of primitivism, an awareness we owe in
large part to the studies mentioned above, has not led to the
disappearance of primitivism but to its deeper imbrication in
contemporary theoretical discourses that appear to be anti-primitivist
and politically progressive. 4 This book seeks to understand why
primitivism keeps reappearing even after it has been uncovered as a
myth, a projection, or a construction necessary for establishing the
modernity of the West. It examines the ways in which a deconstructed
[[primitivism is replaced by 'neo-primitivism.']{.mark}]{.underline} By
'neo-primitivism' I mean the [conceptual move [through which the
rejection of primitivism allows it to reappear in]{.mark} new, [more
acceptable forms]{.mark}. Neo-primitivism is a contemporary version of
primitivism in which the critical repudiation of earlier primitivist
discourses paradoxically enables their re-introduction, under different
names and configurations to be sure, as cultural, political, ethical,
and aesthetic alternatives to Western modernity. [Neo-primitivist
discourses]{.mark}]{.underline}, as we will see, ignore or [[forget
their own]{.mark} repeated warnings against the [pitfalls]{.mark} of
earlier forms of primitivism, [thereby reproducing the very same
problems they have warned us against]{.mark}. Neo-primitivism can thus
be characterized as [an antiprimitivist primitivism that simultaneously
disavows and reinscribes the primitive.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Neo-primitivism has become an attractive theoretical option precisely at
a time when 'primitives,' defined as belonging to authentic, primordial
cultures yet untouched or uncontaminated by modernity, can no longer be
called upon to act as pure forms of otherness. Nevertheless, the
'primitive,' as the ultimate sign of alterity, still seems to serve a
useful theoretical function, though it is now conceptualized as a
regulative ideal rather than as an actuality[. Neo-primitivism can thus
be seen as a primitivism without primitives insofar as it forwards a
concept of the primitive so pure that no empirical referent or actual
primitive can contradict or refute it.]{.underline} [[Though
neo-primitivism questions the use of terms like 'primitive']{.mark} and
'primitivism,' [it continues to exhibit a deep primitivist logic that
lurks in displaced but related concepts like ']{.mark}alterity,'
['culture,' and,]{.mark} surprisingly[,
'modernity.']{.mark}]{.underline}

action]{.mark}]{.underline}. 142¶ Though Sartre does not explicitly rely
on Nietzsche in formulating his philosophical response to Bataille\'s
mystical raptures, Sartre does pressuppose a certain reading of
Nietzsche, his \"Great predecessor\" 143 - for Nietzsche emblematizes
what Sartre refers to as authenticity, the antithesis of \"bad faith.\"
Drawing from the German philosopher\'s emphasis on free will and
overcoming, Sartre formulates his brand of existentialist philosophy
around [a humanistic vision]{.underline} in which choice (the free act
of the will) [allows a person to live authentically -]{.underline} [that
is,]{.underline} [with an eye to future possibilities]{.underline}.
Nietzsche\'s philosophy becomes a \"call for man to choose his own life,
to take responsibility for it.\" 144 According to Sartre, [[existence is
absurd unless humans engage in projects]{.mark} through which they
project themselves into the future]{.underline}. [It is this telically
oriented life that Bataille seeks to challenge]{.underline}. 145

#### Bataille's aesthetics of violence culminates in fascism

**Wolin 06** (Richard, Distinguished Professor of History at the City
University of New York Graduate Center, "Left Fascism: Georges Bataille
and the German Ideology"Constellations vol. 2 issue 3, pp. 397-428)

[It seems that [the admiration of fascist methods]{.mark}]{.underline} -
primarily with respect to¶ the ethos of unbridled transgression that was
so prominent in the fascist¶ regimes' [[embrace of an aesthetics of
violence - evinced in Bataille's essays]{.underline}]{.mark}¶ of the
1930s had come to the fore in a way that proved profoundly¶ embarrassing
to Breton and those allied with him. In [Bataille's view, the¶ fascist
revolutions]{.underline} in Italy and Germany [were alone successful in
challenging¶ the existence of the democratic spirit. They alone had
replaced the decrepit¶ value-system of bourgeois society with a new
collective mythology - a¶ restoration of myth that was so avidly desired
by the belief-starved masses.¶]{.underline} This telltale flirtation
with a "left fascism" - an avowed endorsement of¶ fascist methods for
left-wing political ends -was apparent from the group's¶ inaugural
manifesto of October 1935, "Contre-Attaque: Union de lutte des¶
intellectuals rkvolutionnaire." Here, Bataille's views played the major¶
formative role. To wit, a [sanguinary fascination with revolutionary
violence¶ occupied a distinct position of prominence]{.underline}: one
of the group's resolutions¶ emphasized that in order to insure public
safety ("le salut publique") an¶ "uncompromising dictatorship of the
armed people" was required. Europe's¶ political destiny would be
determined by "the creation of a vast network of¶ disciplined and
fanatical forces capable of exercising one day a merciless¶
dictatorship." And in conclusion, the admiration for fascist 'methods
was¶ explicitly invoked: "The time has come for all of us to behave like
masters¶ and to physically destroy the slaves of capitalism . . . we
intend to make use¶ of the weapons created by fascism, which has known
how to make use of the¶ Fundamental human aspiration for affective
exaltation and fanaticism. "75¶ [The stress on revolutionary violence,
on emulating an ethos of mastership,¶ [The celebration of "affective
exaltation and fanaticism," of the emotional¶ side of]{.mark} mass
politics that contemporary [fascism]{.mark} had been able to exploit so¶
well - all [represent key aspects of]{.mark} the ideology of [left
fascism]{.mark} as [propagated¶ by Bataille]{.mark}]{.underline} at this
time. As Allan [Stoekl has remarked: "Effervescence, the¶ subversive
violence of the masses, the baseness of their refusal to enter into¶
boring discussions - [all these things, then, without a clear and
correct]{.mark}]{.underline} (even¶ of boring) [[theory behind them,
could easily be reversed into fascism]{.underline}]{.mark}, as¶ Bataille
quickly became aware."76 In the context at hand it is of more than¶
passing interest to note that the notion of a "revolt of the masters"¶
("Herren-Aufstand") was one of the key ideas of Ernst Jiinger's
prophetic,¶ conservative revolutionary classic, Der Arbeiter (1932) .77

#### Bataille doesn't apply to modern capitalism, which is already based on excessive consumption and desire.

**Goux et al 90** (Jean-Joseph, the Lawrence Favrot professor of French
and chair of French studies at Rice University, Kathryn Ascheim, PhD and
editor of *Nature Biotech*, Rhonda Garelick, taught at Yale, University
of Colorado at Boulder, and Columbia, critic of literature and politics,

Capitalism," Yale French Studies No. 78 On Bataille, pp. 206-224)

[Where do we situate Bataille's claim?]{.underline} What happens to the
demand of the sacred in capitalist society? [How do we reconcile the
affirmation that capitalism represents an unprecedented break with all
archaic]{.underline} \[precapitalist\] forms [of
expenditure]{.underline} and the postulate of the necessary universality
of spending as pure loss? [This is the difficulty Bataille wants to
maintain]{.underline} as a general anthropological principle the
necessity of unproductive expenditure while simultaneously upholding the
historic singularity of capitalism with regard to this expenditure.
Bourgeois society corresponds to a "general atrophy of former sumptuary
processes" (41). An anomaly whereby loss is not absent (which would
contradict the general principle) but virtually unreadable: "Today, the
great and free social forms of unproductive expenditure have
disappeared. Nevertheless, we should not conclude from this that the
very principle of expenditure is no longer situated at the end of
economic activity" (37). So what happens to ostentatious expenditure in
capitalism? And [can we really believe,]{.underline} furthermore, [that
the even more radical desacralization effected by communism could become
a libertarian affirmation of sovereignty]{.underline} -- the feast of
self-consciousness, without divinities and myths? Everything suggests
that [Bataille was unable to articulate the mystical tension toward
sovereign self-consciousness]{.underline} "without form and mode," "pure
expenditure" (224) with a utopia of social life that would make it
possible, nor to explain in a *developed* capitalist society the
consumption of the surplus beyond its reinvestment in production. Now it
is quite clear that [today's capitalism has come a long way from the
Calvinist ethic that presided at its beginning. The values of thrift,
sobriety, and asceticism no longer have the place that they
held]{.underline} when Balzac could caricature the dominant bourgeois
mentality with the characters of pére Grandet or the usurer
Gobseck[.]{.underline} It is doubtful that the spirit of capitalism,
which according to Weber is expressed with an almost classical purity in
Benjamin Franklin's principles \["he who kills a five shilling coin
assassinates all that it could have produced: entire stacks of sterling
pounds"\] \[cited by Bataille, 163\], could today be considered the
spirit of the times. Undoubtedly[, the pace at which all residual sacred
elements inherited from feudalism are eliminated has quickened. but
hasn't contemporary society undergone a transformation of the ethic of
consumption, desire, and pleasure that renders the
classical]{.underline} \[Weberian\] [analyses]{.underline} of the spirit
of capitalism \[to which Bataille subscribes\] [inadequate?]{.underline}
If the great opposition between the sacred and the profane no longer
structures social life, if communal, sacrificial, and glorious
expenditure has been replaced by private expenditure, it is no less true
that advanced capitalism seems to exceed the principle of restricted
economy and utility that presided at its beginning. No society has
"wasted" as much as contemporary capitalism. What is the form of this
waste, of this excess?

#### Voting for them is a double turn

Paul **Mann 99**, Literature prof @ Pomona, **1999**, Masocriticism, p.

I would like at one and the same time to affirm this model and to
dismiss it as the most desperate alibi of all. For "[sacrificial
consumption" **can never become an explicit critical
motive**]{.underline}.13 [At the moment it presents itself as a proper
element of some critical method, it degenerates into
**another**]{.underline} useful trope, another **[bit of intellectual
currency]{.underline}**, [**another paper-thin abyss, another proxy
transgression;** and the force of transgression moves elsewhere,
**beneath a blinder spot in the critical eye**]{.underline}.'4 Questions
of motive or understanding, [the fact that one might be self-critical
or]{.underline} at least [aware]{.underline} of recuperation, [are
immaterial]{.underline}: [what is at stake here is]{.underline} not
self-consciousness but [economics]{.underline}, material relations of
appropriation and exclusion, assimilation and positive loss. [Whatever
transgression occurs in]{.underline} writing on [Bataille does so only
through the stupid recuperation and hence evacuation of the
whole]{.underline} rhetoric and dream of [transgression]{.underline},
only insofar as the false profundity of philosophy or theory evacuates
the false profundities it apes. [To justify this]{.underline} as the
sublime loss of loss [is merely to indulge a paradoxical figure.
**Excess is not a project but a by-product of any
discourse**]{.underline}; [the interest of Bataillean discourse lies
chiefly in the compulsive and symptomatic way it **plays with its
feces**]{.underline}. [The spectacle of **critics making fools of
themselves** does not reveal the sovereign truth of death]{.underline}:
[it is only masocritical humiliation, a pathological attempt to disavow
the specter of death]{.underline}. As for the present essay, it makes no
claims to any redeeming sacrifice. Far from presenting you with a truer
Bataille, far from speaking in his voice more clearly than his other
readers, this essay pleads guilty to the indictment against every
appropriation. [Until philosophy and theory squeal like a pig before
Bataille's work]{.underline}, as he claims to have done before Dali's
canvases, [there will be no knowledge of Bataille]{.underline}. In the
end, one might have to take an even stricter view: [there is no
discourse of transgression]{.underline}, either on or [by Bataille.
**None at all**]{.underline}. It would be necessary to write a
'Postscript to Transgression" were it not for the fact that Foucault
already wrote it in his 'Preface," were it not for the fact that
Bataille himself wrote it the moment before he first picked up his pen.
[It makes no difference whether one]{.underline} betrays Bataille,
because one is hip to heterology or does it by accident, whether one
[lip syncs Bataille's rhetoric or drones on in the most tedious
exposition.]{.underline} All of these satellite texts are not
heliotropic in relation to the solar anus of Bataille's writing, or the
executioners he hoped (really?) would meet him in the Bois de Boulogne,
or dépensives in spite of themselves. It would be sentimental to assign
them such privileges. [They merely fail to fail. They are symptoms of a
discourse in which **everyone is happily transgressing everyone else and
nothing ever happens,** traces of a certain narcissistic pathos that
never achieves the magnificent loss Bataille]{.underline}'s text
[conveniently claims to desire, **and under whose cover it can continue
to account for itself,** hoarding its precious debits in a masocriticism
**that is anything but sovereign**]{.underline} **[and gloriously
indifferent]{.underline}**. [What is given to us]{.underline}, what is
ruinously and profitably exchanged, [is a lie]{.underline}. Heterology
gives the lie to meaning and discourse gives the lie to transgression,
in a potlatch that reveals both in their most essential and constitutive
relation. Nothing is gained by this communication except profit-taking
from lies. [We must indict Bataille as the alibi that allows all of this
writing to go on and on, pretending it is the nothing it is not, and
then turn away from Bataille as from a sun long since gone nova, in
order to witness the slow freezing to death of every
satellite]{.underline} text. The sacrificial consumption of [Bataille
has played itself out; the rotten carcass has been
consumed]{.underline}: no more alibis. What is at stake is no longer
ecstatic sexuality or violent upheavals or bloody sacrifices under the
unblinking eye of the sun; nor was it ever, from the very beginning of
Bataille's career. These are merely figures in the melodramatic theater
of what is after all a "soft expenditure" (Hollier 1989, xv), a much
more modest death, a death much closer to home. [It has never been more
than a question of the death of theory]{.underline} and of theory itself
as death. Of theory-death. A double fatality.
