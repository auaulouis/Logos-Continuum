#### The cooption of femnism under anti cap movements renforce the sexism in these spaces just pushes women out of the space, the left doesn't care about femnism no matter how much they say they do 

**[Dibben 21]{.underline}** (Dibben, Kimmy. "Sexism in the Campus Left."
Honi Soit, Honisoit, 17 Aug. 2021,
http://honisoit.com/2021/08/sexism-in-the-campus-left/.)

As proven in multiple high-profile cases in Federal and State Parliament
this year, sexual violence and sexism are rife in politics. This is not
limited to right-wing political organisations, as was shown in the
Greens case in 2018. Nor is it limited to political parties[. We need
not look further than our very own campus to recognise that under the
progressive veneer of [left-wing activist organisations are structural
issues of sexism, misogyny, gendered labour and
abuse]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is not one such organisation on USyd's
campus that is free of this. [Imperialist, sexist, racist and classist
structures are replicated in spaces where we organise against them, and
reconstitute themselves endlessly in individual interactions by
default.]{.underline}

[Misogyny runs perniciously throughout the]{.underline} campus
[left]{.underline}. [One woman who has been isolated and socially
expelled by such a culture, writes that misogyny in the left manifests
as "everything from unequal distributions of labour to the full blown
espousing of Incel ideological world views.]{.underline} [It became
clear that even multi-year membership within an ostensibly progressive
faction on campus could fail to meaningfully circumvent a lifetime of
learned sexism as well as classism, an inherent and tragic outcome of
elite private boys school education]{.underline}."

[[Leftist men]{.mark} of higher social capital have [used]{.mark} such
[advantage]{.mark} [to get away with everything from publicly belittling
and casting doubt against female activists'
abilities]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [to sexual coercion preyed upon
younger, less experienced women]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Known]{.mark}
rapists and [abusers]{.mark} are [routinely]{.mark} [invited]{.mark} to
parties and [social events]{.mark}, their [victims the ones left off the
invite list]{.mark} while other members still invited remain silent and
complicit.]{.underline} [Anonymous contributors recount bystanders who
follow abusers to parties to 'keep an eye on them', afraid of their
behaviour towards women in private, all the while bolstering their
character in public.]{.underline}

[[One reason why abusive behavior]{.mark}, including sexual violence, is
[ubiquitous]{.mark} amongst the campus left is the [desperate desire of
these groups to protect their external reputation]{.mark}.]{.underline}
With groups jockeying for support in elections and factionally-driven
campaigns alike, what emerges within the group is a culture of
unaddressed conflict, 'justified' as to keep the faction united. [Even
more galling is the insinuation that the '[negative peace' created is in
service of the greater good of activism]{.mark}, rather than to protect
the reputation of a faction and its most prominent figureheads. The
glamourising and self-important lens through which each group sees
itself makes [it easy for the safety and respect of activist women and
people of colour to be overlooke]{.mark}d.]{.underline} [The cycles of
silence created force such people to face the difficult decision of
ignoring their own grievances and remaining in a space that is hostile
to them, or leaving their own faction, leaving them without personal and
political support, and in most cases, pushing them out of
activity]{.underline}. [The [uneasy silence]{.mark} [around abusive
behaviour]{.mark} have [caused]{.mark} dozens of [women to]{.mark}
[ignore their own grievances, disengage, or leave
altogether]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[I spoke to one survivor whom had chosen leaving
altogether:]{.underline}

"[Despite there being a general knowledge amongst our peers of the hurt
that my ex had caused, there seemed to be no precedent to address it, at
least from my perspective. Everywhere I turned, I saw the people I was
looking up to, seemingly complicit in his behaviour, which only seemed
to be continuing on its steady trajectory.]{.underline}

I [was aware of the fact that there were grievance processes in place to
address issues such as these. However, no matter how much I longed to
feel as if I could call the space my own, it had gotten to the point
where I did not feel as if there could be any possible outcome to the
accountability process that would make this my reality. Too much time
had passed, too much more had happened, I felt that I had no right to
still be hurting, no right to disrupt the bonds and allyships that had
formed long before I entered the scene. I believed then that I was being
shown that it was not the right place for me if I could not move past
this history. I decided to leave the space.]{.underline}

[[There is something so deeply rotten about this culture within the
left. It is not a new story, for activist spaces -- supposedly 'safe'
spaces -- to be the very ones which turn a blind eye to the pain being
inflicted by their own members]{.underline}, [to the misogynistic
manipulation, abuse, and sexual violence that runs deep within its
core]{.underline}]{.mark}[. [The cracks have always been there in the
facade -- it's past time that we gutted this rotten culture, and lay a
new foundation of genuine accountability, and radical healing for
survivors."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[It is no coincidence that there is both a]{.underline} [[lack of
leftist men at feminist rallies and a structural issue of sexism in
leftist organising. I can count on one hand the number of male comrades
that turn up to consent workshops, rallies against sexual violence on
campus]{.mark}, or other WoCo events.]{.underline} [[Men don't run
grievance processes]{.mark}, [men don't check in on struggling comrades,
men don't step in when other men make sexist
remarks.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This is un-glamorous, unseen, difficult
work done largely by women and non-binary people]{.mark}; not always
because we want to, but because it otherwise won't be done at
all.]{.underline} When men do take this work on, it is after our own
pleading and head-kicking. In these rare instances it is lauded as
exceptional and a reflection of good character, though not when women or
non-binary people do it.

[[Men do not show up in the streets, and they do not show up
interpersonally]{.underline}.]{.mark} [The disparity between praxis and
one's so-called politics is most obvious when it comes to men in the
left not proving the anti-sexism they claim to believe in]{.underline}.
[It takes constant and active self-reflection to unlearn ingrained
sexist behaviour -- yes, even from leftists. Anti-sexism is not just a
political identity, but a continuous call to action]{.underline}. [These
left-wing spaces can hardly claim such a title if the basic tenets of
feminism are ignored.]{.underline}

[[Feminist organising]{.underline}]{.mark} on campus [[is not
respected]{.underline}]{.mark}, [nor are the Women's Officers who lead
it. Our [specialised skills and knowledge in]{.mark} the [intricacies of
trauma, gendered violence, and feminist activism holds little value in
the left]{.mark}]{.underline}. This has to change. [Our specific
knowledge and experiences are irreplaceable. Our work has spanned
decades and positively impacted the lives of thousands of students.
However, factional support has never been extended to women's officers
the way it has to many other major SRC positions]{.underline}. This is
not unique to my term, but a trend that Women's Officers before me can
attest to.

[What more do we need to do to gain respect? No other group or person on
campus is criticised from the right and management quite like the
Women's Officers. Women's Officers over the years have received
countless disclosures of sexual violence, been doxxed by right-wing
extremists, spat on and swung at by Nazis, threatened with violence and
death, gone through many misconduct processes, suspended and expelled
from campus, and rolled from their position by Liberals]{.underline}
(only to continue to convene WoCo unpaid all year). [This would be hard
enough but the difficulty and isolation of this position is magnified by
the attitude of the Left]{.underline}. Looking at recent history alone,
Women's Officers have been publicly belittled for making political
critiques, [have had their anti-sexual violence work deemed 'irrelevant'
to 'more important' campaigns, and been met consistently with apathy
when asking for help combatting direct far-right violence. This position
is incredibly difficult and isolating, and needs more support from the
comrades around us.]{.underline}

Many have contributed directly to this article, all remaining anonymous
for their own wellbeing. However, I have truly compiled this article
from months and years of more conversations than I can count, over many
dinner tables, at the back of bars, after WoCo meetings, in hushed
tones, in the raised voice of frustration, and through teary eyes. These
are not just my encounters, but those of so many of us. I thank every
person brave enough to share these experiences.

[I believe in mass organising of the student left which prioritises
feminist liberation is possible, if only the feminists leading it are
respected and supported like they deserve]{.underline}. This week, both
Women's Officers will leave our faction due to structural sexism, just
as the Education Officer, Maddie Clark, left hers for the same reason
only months ago. I h[ope this article does not spur gossip, but sparks
deep reflection amongst the campus left. I hope my comrades look around
and reckon with the behaviour of their male comrades, notice the lack of
female comrades --- particularly women of colour and working class women
--- and ask themselves how their very own behaviour is impeding, or even
opposing, the liberatory work we aim to do. Because without
accountability, harm will only continue to shatter community, and
"without community there is no liberation".]{.underline}

### AI Link

#### The idea that AI is gender neutral is complete BS---as long as the programmers are biased, so too is their creation

**Roff 16** (Heather, Gendering a Warbot, International Feminist Journal
of Politics, 18:1, 1-18, DOI: 10.1080/14616742.2015.1094246)

The base knowledge provided and the process by which it is accessed is
key. What "facts" or pieces of information go into the database will
affect the actions of the machine. If a data point or "piece" is not
present, there is no opportunity for it to get there. [An AI might be
able to rearrange existing bits of information to combine them into new
insights, but it will never generate something outside of its existing
set of information structures.]{.underline} There is a gatekeeping
function present in the construction of all symbolic representations. As
Adam (1998) notes, ["A formal system, in other words a computer system,
is a political choice to maintain existing power
structures"]{.underline} (108).16 To bring this back to gendered
warbots, if programmers decide that "child" as an object or
representation can never be paired with "combatant," then the machine
will not be capable of identifying child soldiers. Moreover, what
constitutes "child" will have to be represented in some way[. The
process by which such "knowledge" is represented is thus
crucial.]{.underline} As Adam (1998) explains, [the problem about
deciding "what sort of objects there are in the world" becomes another
problem about knowledge about "facts," and how a knowledge base about
"facts" is recreated within a system of purely propositional
knowledge"]{.underline} (39).17 [The purely propositional knowledge
approach is open to all of the feminist critiques from feminist
epistemology, in particular, that there is some sort of Truth about
which the facts must correspond and that knowledge derived from skills
(such as a "knowing how") is not real knowledge]{.underline} (Adam 1998,
114). Warfighting is as much an art as it is a science, and so
prohibiting this kind of embodied or practical knowledge would appear to
undermine the ability of a warbot to fight effectively. The most
pressing problem for symbolic systems, however, comes from the direction
of analogical reasoning. [Faced with the certainty that warbots will
encounter complex situations, which they cannot have prior knowledge of,
they will require some mechanism to abstract the situation to one about
which they do have some higher order representation. This is done by way
of analogy. A program will have to break down the situation into smaller
objects that it can represent, and then it will search its database for
something that is analogous where the concepts are equivalent or
appropriate. To find such an abstract analogy, the AI uses
stereotypes]{.underline} (Adam 1998, 39).18 Programmers may not readily
admit to this, claiming that "the important thing is to break the
overall experience reflected in the memory into composable regularities"
(Storrs Hall 2007, 221). "Composable regularities" might be that all
hills are convex physical structures, but [they might also be that "all
women speak with a high voice" or "all combatants are men between 18 and
35." Reasoning by analogy is a heuristic that humans employ when they
are being cognitive misers and is not appropriate for complex situations
requiring critical thought]{.underline}.19 This brings us full circle to
the problem of which objects and concepts get represented in the
dataset. [If the programmers, who are predominantly white, male,
upper-middle class and academic, equip an AI with these perspectives,
then it is not difficult to see how gendered constructions will
reproduce themselves]{.underline} (AAUW 2015). [A particular masculinity
might be reproduced, or a particular view of femininity may not be
modeled at all]{.underline} (Adam 1998, 23). [In either case, the AI is
clearly not "gender neutral."]{.underline}

### Biotech Link

#### The language of bio science is entrenched in masculine ideals and norms- absent the alternative the aff just recreates harmful masculinity. 

Connell 05, (RW Connell and James W. Messerschmidt, Hegemonic
Masculinities, RW Connell was formerly a professor at the University of
Sydney and an Australian sociologist)GP

But the appeal to science plunges us into circularity. For it has been
shown, in convincing historical detail, that natural [science itself has
a gendered character]{.underline}. [Western science and technology are
culturally masculinized]{.underline}. This is not a question of
personnel, though it is a fact that the great majority of scientists and
technologists are men[. The guiding metaphors. of scientific research,
the impersonality of its discourse, the structures of power and
communication in science, the reproduction of its internal culture, all
stem from the social position of dominant men in a gendered
world]{.underline}. [The dominance of science in discussions of
masculinity thus reflects the position of masculinity]{.underline} (or
specific masculinities[) in the social relations of
gender.]{.underline}7 In that case, what can be expected from a science
of masculinity, being a form of knowledge created by the very power it
claims to study? Any such knowledge will be as ethically compromised as
a science of race created by imperialists, or a science of capitalism
produced by capitalists[. There are, indeed, forms of scientific talk
about masculinity that have capitulated to the dominant interests in
much the same way as scientific racism and neoconservative
economics.]{.underline}

#### Biotechnology reinforces imperial patriarchy across the globe 

Shiva 92, (V Shiva, 1992, *Women, Ecology, and Health: Rebuilding
Connections: Introduction*, published in the National Library of
Medicine, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12286886/)GP

[ Indigenous seeds, called landraces, were considered valueless, like
indigenous peoples before them]{.underline}. Value was added to seeds
only after an investment of time and money. [The economic impact of this
artificial value assigned to a gift of nature will be seen in Third
World countries as plant breeders demand \"rights\" under new utility
patents]{.underline}. The plant breeders, who are attempting to
substitute local plant diversity with patented seeds throughout the
world, go so far as to want laws to prevent farmers from using seeds
gleaned from patented plants they have cultivated. [Biotechnology is now
treating human reproduction in the same proprietary way. Childbirth has
been mechanized,]{.underline} and knowledge and skills are considered to
be lodged with physicians, not with mothers. [By transforming pregnancy
into a medical disease, professional management, once confined to
abnormal cases, is now considered necessary in every case. In cases of
\"abnormal\" infertility, physicians believe they \"create\" babies,
using the ~~woman\'s~~ body as so much raw material.]{.underline} The
absurdity of this notion of man as creator can be seen by the patent
application for the gene sequence coding for the hormone relaxin, which
is produced in ~~female~~ ovaries but is being treated as an
\"invention\" which can be owned. [This attempt on the part of man to
totally engineer the world, including the basic regenerative functions
of the seed and ~~women\'s~~ bodies, is brought into question by the
current crisis in health and ecology]{.underline}.

### Bioweapons Link

#### Discourse and fear of bioweaponry is gendered feminine- MDC's utilize discourse and banning of biological warfare to justify feminizing and repressing LDCs

Cecire 09, (Ruth Cecire, Feminist Studies, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Spring 2009),
pp. 41-65, Feminist Studies, Inc.,
<http://www.jstor.org/stable/40607923>) GP

Gender, in addition to the practical concerns already discussed, appears
to offer auseful prism through which to contemplate these issues. [The
feminine/masculine divide is]{.underline} [a]{.underline} (or perhaps
\"the[\") critical hermeneutic through which each society constructs
experience, assigns meaning, and asserts its basic values]{.underline}.
Bridging the essentialist/constructionist rift, I would argue that this
divide is informed by a conflation of biological difference and cultural
representation. It is my contention that [bioweapons have been disdained
and ostensibly banned, at least in part, because they are largely
gendered female and, hence, do not serve the fantasies and ends of the
patriarchal war system]{.underline}; [their semi-androgynous amalgam of
science and disease fuels and substantiates extant culture and gender
wars]{.underline}. As instruments of terror for the aforementioned
\"disenfranchised\" nations and groups, [they connote the mythical
\"furies\" of \"disempowered\" female rage]{.underline}. That is not to
say that bioweapons will never be employed by First World powers but,
rather, that gendered perceptions shape their geopolitical status and
deter potential use. Evidencing what Barbara Ehrenreich and Arlie
Russell Hochschild refer to as the \"metaphorically gendered
relationship between rich and poor countries,\"36 [First World males are
intent on safeguarding their advantage by denying their Third
World]{.underline} (disempowered) [counterparts access to weaponry that
would equalize the destructive playing field.]{.underline} Lastly,
inasmuch as each weapon system conveys a certain status, banning a class
of weapons, declaring them outlaw armaments, functions to further demean
potential users.

### Climate Technics Link/Case turn

#### The K turns the aff -- domination and technocracy embed the cycle of environmental destruction into politics

**[Bluhdom 09, \[]{.underline}**Ingolfur Blühdorn¶ is Associate
Professor in Politics / Political Sociology at the Department of
European Studies at the University of Bath Locked into the politics of
unsustainability
<http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2009-10-30-bluhdorn-en.html>, 2009\]
Mr.Mr.

One reason is that in functionally differentiated and rapidly
internationalising societies, the existing political institutions lack
the structural ability to formulate and implement coordinated and
effective policy approaches. Yet there is more to it than this. In order
to see the arguably most powerful obstacle to major ecological progress,
we need to focus on the values and paradigms governing national as well
as international environmental policy-making. ¶ Since the mid-1980s,
environmental politics has incrementally come to be dominated by a
policy paradigm that is inherently incapable of organising the category
of change that the IPCC targets necessitate. This is the paradigm of
sustainability, ecological modernisation and, in its most recent
appearances, \"ecological industrial politics\" and the \"Green New
Deal\".\[1\] For all the good they have done in terms of turning
environmentalism into a \"new ideological masterframe\" and a
\"non-controversial collective concern\",\[2\] the concept of
sustainability as well as the strategy of ecological modernisation have
proved unable to deliver the \"break with traditional models of economic
development\"\[3\] which are now widely recognised as indispensable for
the effective mitigation of climate change. This is even more applicable
to the latest addition to the lexicon of green-speak, the Green New
Deal. ¶ Sustainability is interpreted by national governments as well as
transnational bodies such as the EU first and foremost as sustained
economic growth and competitiveness securing the continuation of
established lifestyles and patterns of societal development. Its
fundamental weakness is that as a purely formal concept (do not use up
more resources than can be reproduced) it does not contain any inherent
specification of what is to be counted as a resource (do polar bears
count or not?), at which level an equilibrium between use and
reproduction is to be achieved (before or after the destruction of
Indonesian rain forests?) and which political values or principles are
to be implemented in the envisaged society (authoritarian or democratic;
decentralised or centralised; egalitarian or polarised).\[4\] ¶
[[Ecological modernisation]{.underline}]{.mark} (EM), in turn, [[is a
market and technology-oriented policy strategy fraught with inherent
limitations. For key environmental problems (e.g. habitat destruction,
soil erosion, bio-diversity loss), marketable technological fixes are
simply not available]{.underline}]{.mark}; environmental efficiency
gains are persistently over-compensated by rebound effects and ongoing
processes of growth; and all ecological modernisation depends on targets
that are circumscribed by the ability to generate political legitimation
and public support. Perhaps most importantly, though, [[EM ultimately
just renews and extends the logic of growth and consumption which
political ecologists]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as the much more
moderate UN Brundtland Report\[5\] once [[identified as the underlying
cause of industrial society\'s unsustainability.]{.underline}]{.mark} ¶
More explicitly even than EM approaches, [[the new ecological industrial
politics]{.underline}]{.mark} and the Green New Deal
[[aim]{.underline}]{.mark} first and foremost [[to spur technological
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}, increase consumer demand, [[create new
jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}, open up new export markets,
[[enhance]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[international
competitiveness]{.underline}]{.mark} of national economies [[and so
forth.]{.underline}]{.mark} In other words, [[they
reframe]{.underline}]{.mark} global warming and [[the environmental
crisis as]{.underline}]{.mark} an opportunity, [[a tool, for a new round
of innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} and growth. They are supposed to
provide a double, or even triple, dividend (economic, environmental,
social), yet they entirely reverse the relation between means and ends
that had once been envisaged by those proposing the use of economic or
market based instruments for the achievement of ecological goals. In
practice they are primarily an attempt to prolong the life expectancy of
what is known to be unsustainable. Even Europe\'s leading Green Party,
the once fairly radical German Greens, have fully embraced this
rhetoric.

### COVID Link

#### Identifying COVID 19 as a security threat reinforce and recreate hierarchal gendered identities in order to enforce its securitization

discursive politics of the COVID-19 pandemic," European Journal of

It is already all too apparent around the world that COVID-19 is
dangerous. In the modern history of natural disasters, this virus will
have few rivals[. States continue to wrestle with how best to respond to
the COVID-19 pandemic, but its securitisation is already
universal]{.underline}.1 [The mechanisms of securitisation are socially
and culturally specific.]{.underline} Simply put, all states securitise
COVID-19 but each state does so in a unique way. [[By identifying the
pandemic as an existential security threat]{.mark}, national
[decision-makers]{.mark} respond to it from both operational and
normative perspectives. In doing so, they [actualise]{.mark} and perform
[some national identities]{.mark}, [while excluding or silencing
others.]{.mark}]{.underline} We scrutinise this process by drawing on
the cases of the United States and Russia. Experiences of these two
states matter because they both play an active role in the evolving
global discursive politics of the COVID-19 pandemic and consistently
appear among the top ten most affected countries. Moreover, [there is a
divergence between the resurgence of the Cold War-style geopolitical
confrontation between the West and Russia and the diplomatic 'bromance'
between the US President Donald [Trump and]{.mark} Russia's President
Vladimir [Putin.]{.mark}2 These two politicians [present themselves as
alpha males]{.mark} promising to make their nations 'great
again'.]{.underline} As Sarah Ashwin and Jennifer Utrata point out[,
both of them attract immense international attention, [and]{.mark} hence
'[these hypermasculine performances]{.mark} are not merely national in
scope, but [shape other places in our globalized
world'.]{.mark}]{.underline} 3 Building our analysis on feminist
methodologies,4 we examine how [[Trump and Putin instrumentalise
hierarchical gendered identities to enforce the securitisation of
COVID]{.mark}-19.]{.underline} Our analysis shows that both [[Trump and
Putin draw]{.mark} heavily [on]{.mark} [projections of gendered power to
maximise]{.mark} the effect of [their securitisation]{.mark} moves [and
mobilise]{.mark} diverse [gendered narratives, imageries, and
practices]{.mark} to construct the meaning of the threat. [These
performances]{.mark} of securitisation [set standards of appropriateness
and legitimise certain kinds of foreign policy]{.mark} responses to the
pandemic [while silencing others or presenting them as
ineffective]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this sense, we contribute to the
discussion of COVID-19 politics by exploring [[gendered discursive
practices]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[enable the move from 'normal'
politics to the domain of emergency and exception
or]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Andreas Kalyvas puts it, to [[the 'politics
of the extraordinary']{.underline}.]{.mark} 5 This areticle is organised
into three sections. The first section outlines our approach to
securitisation and the methodology of our study. The following two
sections examine the dynamics of securitising COVID-19 in the United
States and Russia, indicating differences and similarities in their
discursive strategies. The conclusions raise and bring to the fore
questions not only regarding political responses to the COVID-19
pandemic but also concerning the nature and outcomes of the
securitisation process.

#### The Securitization of COVID-19 is emblematic of National Leaders' desires to secure their nation's place as the masculine hegemon and their place as its ruler, reconstructing narratives of toxic masculine power and weak feminine subordinates

[Securitisation is 'a set of interrelated practices and the processes of
their production, diffusion, and reception/translation that bring
threats into being']{.underline}. 6 [The concept of securitisation opens
up a way to denaturalise the framing of certain events, issues, things,
or people as posing existential threats to states and
societies]{.underline}.7 Many scholars also use it to call into question
the givenness of the differential categories of 'security' and
'insecurity'. 8 [Scholars who examine the politics of diseases, however,
often deal with threats that are not talked into being. For example,
[using the case of HIV/AIDS]{.mark}]{.underline}, Colin McInnes and
Simon Rushton argue9 that [[to question the 'reality' of the threat
posed by a disease is 'both morally indefensible and empirically
absurd']{.underline}]{.mark}. Similarly, the danger that COVID-19
presents is all too real. More than two million people are known to have
died from COVID-19 as of January 2021. A year has passed since the virus
was discovered, yet hospitals are still buckling under a torrent of
COVID-19 patients and the routines of daily life remain interrupted for
billions worldwide. Importantly, COVID-19 is an endemic that will stay
with us for some time. In this context**[, the concept of
s[ecuritisation is used not to question the threat that COVID]{.mark}-19
[poses]{.mark} for the survival and wellbeing of people around the world
[but to elucidate how political actors reconstruct understandings of
COVID]{.mark}-19 [via securitising moves]{.mark} and what different
pathways of response become appropriate as a result of these
moves]{.underline}**. Consequently[, we treat securitisation as 'a
sustained strategic practice aimed at convincing a target audience to
accept, based on what it knows about the world, the claim that a
specific development ... is threatening enough to deserve an immediate
policy to alleviate it]{.underline}'. 10 Adopting Thierry Balzacq's
approach,11 we do not problematise the fact of securitisation but
critically examine how and with what effect discursive politics of
securitisation works. Specifically, we are interested in how [[state
actors that dominate]{.mark} discursive [politics of
(in)security]{.mark} performatively [build upon]{.mark} established and
context-specific [gendered identities]{.mark} in the process of
securitisation. [The]{.mark} very [notion of national security is
gendered]{.mark} inasmuch as [it is grounded in the gendered]{.mark}
nature of the [state and state practices]{.mark}.]{.underline}12 [This
entails that [power operates via the]{.mark} (discursive) [construction
and reconstruction of hierarchical]{.mark} hybrid [gendered
identities]{.mark} [with the intent to enforce]{.mark} certain [security
interests on domestic and international levels]{.mark}.]{.underline} As
Charlotte Hooper emphasises, ['it is a commonplace observation that
[international relations reflect]{.mark} a world of [men]{.mark} in
[that]{.mark} they [influence international affairs through]{.mark}
their physical capacities, through ([masculinist) practices]{.mark} at
the institutional level, [and]{.mark} through the [symbolic links
between masculinity and power']{.mark}.]{.underline} 13 Consequently,
Hooper argues that [[masculinity is hegemonic]{.mark}, meaning that
specific forms of masculinity dominate over all other gendered
identities, including other masculinities. These]{.underline} relatively
stable [[hegemonic]{.mark} configurations of [gender practices
exemplify]{.mark} '[the]{.mark} currently [accepted answer to]{.mark}
the problem of [the legitimacy of patriarchy]{.mark}, [which
guarantees]{.mark}]{.underline} (or is taken to guarantee) [[the
dominant position of men and the subordination of
women']{.underline}]{.mark}. 14 Following this logic, [[hegemonic
masculinity is]{.mark} [instrumental in]{.mark} constructing threat and
danger as well as performing [security]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Hegemonic
masculinity takes on many forms depending on different social,
political, and economic settings.]{.underline} In this sense, it is
dynamic and context-specific. [[Each state's potential to claim the
status of the masculine hegemon]{.mark} in the international arena
[depends on its]{.mark} performance among other states and its [ability
to repel threats both domestically and internationally.]{.mark}
[National leaders actualise and perform hegemonic masculinities to
convince audiences]{.mark} at home and abroad [that they are able to
combat a threat.]{.mark} Masculinised imageries allow national leaders
to present security as a result of their rule, [making that rule
legitimate]{.mark}]{.underline}. In effect, performing [a state's
hegemonic masculinity ties directly to its leader's ability to
securitise a threat]{.underline}. Importantly, [[the process of
securitising not only represents but also is reproductive of hegemonic
masculinity of the state.]{.mark}]{.underline} National leaders
rearticulate it through the narratives and imageries evoked in their
securitising moves. Drawing on this theoretical framework, we examine
how [[national leaders in the United States and Russia reconstitute
hegemonic masculinities within the 'threat-defence' logic of responses
to the COVID-19 outbreak]{.underline}]{.mark}. Our sample includes
statements on COVID-19 made by Trump and Putin from the early onset of
the current global public health crisis to 30 April 2020. This time
frame covers an important period in the discursive formation of the
COVID-19 outbreak in both the United States and Russia as a matter of
national security. It allows us to examine securitisation in the making
rather than focus on the audience's acceptance of securitising moves. In
other words, the chosen time frame restricts our analysis to the very
first performative attempts at securitising the pandemic.

#### Trump used COVID to secure the US's masculinity by portraying it as the strong, masculine hegemon ready to defend both its own weak, and destroy the weakness around it to prevent "contamination"

In a paralleled vein to feminist discussions of 9/11, COVID-19 produces
what Bonnie Mann calls the 'unmanning' of America.18 Mann details how
sovereignty is a 'style of national masculinity' with any violation of a
nation's borders resulting in its figurative demasculinisation.19
Accordingly, [the pandemic challenges the American doctrines of absolute
sovereignty, invulnerability, and global hegemony]{.underline}. To
counter this threat[, [Trump reframes it not as a public health dilemma
but as a threat to the nation's security and hegemonic
masculinity]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this setting, [[COVID-19 presents a
direct threat to the national body that is innately
gendered]{.mark}.]{.underline} On 4 February Trump securitises
COVID-19.20 However, in January and February, Trump struggles with fully
committing to the securitising move and vacillates between securitising
and desecuritising the spread of COVID-19. At first, Trump frames the
virus only as a 'potential threat' contained in China.21 Simultaneously,
he assures his audience that '\[o\]ur country is prepared for any
circumstances' and that 'there's no reason to panic at all' as the
possibility of exposure and mortality to the American nation
'remain\[s\] low'. 22 It is not until 13 March that Trump constructs
COVID-19 as an existential crisis and 'national emergency', one that not
only threatens the nation's health but also has the power to obstruct
its sovereignty and security.23 As specified by Trump, one of the
existential challenges of the pandemic is that the United States will
face the 'public health consequences of a mass uncontrolled cross-border
movement'. 24 Starting from the presidential campaign in 2015, Trump
persistently pushes migration out of the domain of 'normal politics'. As
the pandemic unfolds, he builds upon the image of the othered and
villainised migrant to redefine COVID-19 not only as a health hazard but
also as a security threat that can compromise the nation's sovereignty.
Trump personifies these fears in undocumented migrants who potentially
carry COVID-19. This extra discursive layer highlights how the perceived
threat to America's sovereignty elevates the virus from a public health
dilemma to a national security crisis through the processes of Othering.
For example, he emphasises that they threaten to create a perfect storm
that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants, and to
the public at large. Left unchecked, this would cripple our immigration
system, overwhelm our healthcare system, and severely damage our
national security.25 As a response, Trump affirmatively declares that
'we're not going to let that happen'. 26 Sara Ahmed explains such a
discursive reconstruction as an attempt to monopolise and 'eliminate the
source of fear' -- a move by the state to control the uncontrollable
through asserting selfdetermination and containment.27 In other words[,
[Trump portrays the United States as]{.mark} no longer fearful but as [a
nation that is mobilised to repel the dangerous
Other.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This]{.mark} construction also [frames
Trump]{.mark} and his administration [as the protectors of the
nation]{.mark} ('we') from the existential threat ('they') [by]{.mark}
concurrently [securitising]{.mark} and desecuritising
[COVID-19]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Trump's narrative]{.mark} does not
alleviate the threat of the pandemic but, counterintuitively[, dispels
notions of fear and security to]{.mark} discursively [embolden his
masculine command over the nation.]{.mark}]{.underline} COVID-19 is not
only embodied by the undocumented migrant but is also personified
through a multiplicity of Others[. [To shift the blame for]{.mark} the
harms of the [COVID-19]{.mark} outbreak, [Trump fixates on China]{.mark}
and racialises the pandemic as a 'Chinese' threat.]{.underline} Since 21
January, Trump obsessively emphasises that COVID-19 'comes from China'
and should be regarded as the 'Chinese virus' or 'Wuhan virus'. 28
Restricting international travel from China to the United States, Trump
labels his executive order the 'China ban', stating that 'China, you
can't come in. I'm sorry.' 29 [[While the United States evades an attack
from the virus]{.mark} by shutting its borders and taking strong
actions, [China is presented as weak and incapable.]{.mark} According to
Trump, the COVID-19 outbreak 'could have been stopped in China, before
it started, and it wasn't' and now 'the whole world is suffering because
of it'.]{.underline} 30 [[China is portrayed as a soft nation]{.mark}
because of its permeable borders, passivity, and ineffective leadership.
[The feminine softness makes it not only vulnerable but also
dangerous]{.mark}. [By differentiating]{.mark} and separating [the
nation from the pandemicstricken Others, Trump does not allow the
insecurity of COVID-19 to feminise the United States and]{.mark}, in
turn, [(re)secures America's masculinity]{.mark}. By framing COVID-19 as
a destabilising force to the United States' masculinity, [Trump
mobilises the nation]{.mark} [around]{.mark} three gendered narratives
to perform and actualise American hegemony[: the gendered construction
of the national 'we']{.mark}, [militarisation, and displays of the
United States' economic omnipotence]{.mark}.]{.underline} These three
discursive formations function as applicators to deconstruct how the
nation is mobilised to repel the threat. Building on this logic,
[[Trump's performances]{.mark} of certain hegemonic traits [demonstrate
how gender practices become a securitising tool utilised by national
leaders in times of crisis.]{.mark} [The]{.mark} performative
[values]{.mark} that [the American state believes its citizens personify
are embedded in these gender practices]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Trump's
words, Americans are those who 'do not despair'. 31 He argues that 'we
do not give in to fear' and 'we pull together, we persevere, and we
overcome, and we win'. 32 Americans 'sacrifice together', 33 but, as
Ahmed puts it, [[the nation is presented as winning by 'refusing to
transform its vulnerability and wounds ... into an affective response of
fear']{.mark}.]{.underline} 34 [[A response that is premised on
exemplifying the masculine characteristics of 'valour', aggression, and
determination in times of combat.]{.mark} [These characteristics frame
the nation as]{.mark} being [militarised and in]{.mark} a perpetual
state of [conflict that will not dissipate]{.mark} until the threat has
been vanquished: As our citizens persevere through this present
challenge, we're renewing American unity and we're replenishing American
will and we are witnessing new American valor each and every
day.]{.underline} We see it every day. [The daring and determination of
our people in this crisis reminds us that no matter how hard it gets, no
matter what obstacles we must overcome, Americans will keep on fighting
to victory and we will secure the glorious future that our citizens so
richly deserve, especially after going through this nightmare, this evil
beast.]{.underline}35 Here, Trump constructs the notion of an 'internal
strength' that the American populace epitomises -- one that transforms
the emotions of fear and insecurity into the imagery of mobilisation and
collective triumph.36 [In this framework, [the nation escapes potential
feminisation by acting as a wilful subject and taking command of the
pandemic.]{.mark}]{.underline} To further denote a sense of control and
agency[, Trump uses active verbs to place the United States not as a
passive, feminised observer but as an active, masculine
participant.]{.underline} By positioning the United States as one that
is 'renewing', 'replenishing', and 'witnessing', Trump construes the
nation as actively mobilising and hence, enacting its masculinity
against COVID-19. [To perform the state's hegemonic masculinity, [Trump
also militarises the society. Drawing upon established gendered
identities, the Trump administration evokes a series of securitising
moves to militarise COVID-19]{.mark}]{.underline}.37 As early as 15
March, [Trump argues that the United States 'deployed over a thousand
officers in support of the coronavirus missions', [reframing the
pandemic not as an emergency managed by health professionals but one
controlled by the military that will 'defend our homeland during this
crisis']{.mark}.]{.underline} 38 In this framework, the nation's
military capabilities are constructed as a source of security, a
physical reassertion of its masculinised control and dominance. Here,
Trump touts the desirability of the military, stating that \[o\]ur great
military is operating at 100 per cent during this crisis and thousands
of troops are deployed alongside of civilians in the COVID hotspots, as
you know. You see them all over. I spoke -- when I spoke with Governor
Cuomo, and when I spoke to Gavin Newsom, and many of the other
governors, they wanted to know if we could have some military help with
the medical, and we -- we gave it to them.39 This quote presents the
military as the masculinist protector of the nation with Governors
jockeying for its aid while simultaneously framing it as a pervasive and
saturating force who is 'all over'. [The military's spreading
encroachment across all vectors of society assures Trump's audience of
the United States' ever-growing control over the virus, and in turn,
paints the military as the reason for the nation's success.]{.underline}
As a result, Trump hails his response to the pandemic as 'a tremendous
victory', 'thanks to our all-out military operation and the
extraordinary devotion of our people' as 'we believe we will experience
far fewer deaths than even the optimistic projection'. 40 In tandem with
the physical deployment of the military, [Trump's rhetoric is imbued
with militarised references. Trump constructs the pandemic as a
figurative battlefield,]{.underline} one that parallels 'a World War, or
a World War One or Two or something' as it is 'a war all unto itself'.
41 To align with this imagery, military hospitals are deployed to New
York and Los Angeles, ['frontline workers' are reconceptualised as
heroic, selfless soldiers falling in the line of duty, and even ordinary
citizens are viewed as making their patriotic contribution to the nation
by 'fighting this battle from home']{.underline}. 42 Not only does Trump
construct the pandemic as an 'all-out war' but he places himself at the
centre of society's militarisation: 'I'm a wartime president. This is a
war. This is a war. A different kind of war that we've ever had.' 43
Here, [Trump figuratively takes control of all militarised activities
intended to protect the population by using the personal pronoun 'I'. As
an extension of this militarised paternalism, Trump's reluctance to
count the casualties of this 'war' creates ambiguity and disillusionment
that alters]{.underline} what Christine Sylvester calls [the
'perceptions of American war capabilities']{.underline}. 44 Following
this logic, Trump often refuses to broadcast the statistics of American
mortality and case rates. However, when discussing these statistics
discreetly, multiple members of Trump's team utilise dehumanising
tactics by referring to those who passed away from COVID-19 as having
'expired' -- a term that more frequently refers to food past its due
date rather than the loss of a citizen.45 [T[rump]{.mark} also
[deploys]{.mark} these discursive [tactics to create a façade of
militarised success]{.mark} that is further [bolstered by]{.mark}
notions of [paternalistic protection as well]{.mark} [as
hegemonic]{.mark} and charismatic [leadership]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
instance, when prompted by reporters in multiple press briefings to
discuss the number of cases, Trump belligerently dismisses their
questions as 'nasty', 'really bad reporting', and 'sensationalism'. 46
These discursive tactics expose Trump's lack of transparency as an
effort to give the American people a renewed sense of 'hope' and
safeguard them from the brutal truth of 'war'. 47 [Once again, such
militarised responses to the pandemic place Trump not only within the
centrefold of controlling America's military activities but also in the
role of hegemonic protector.]{.underline} While Trump's role as the
nation's protector rests upon his position as the Commander in Chief,
his legitimation strategy also relies heavily on the United States'
economic capacity. Unlike his two predecessors[, [Trump's reign has
conjured a blatant reframing of previously exemplified American
masculine norms]{.mark}.]{.underline} From George W. Bush's indelible
hyper-sexualised bravado48 to Barack Obama's familial paternalism,49
Trump's form of physical masculinity leaves much to be desired. As a
result, the construction of Trump's masculinity and, in the consortium,
his legitimacy revolves not around his prominent physical
characteristics but instead around his success as an entrepreneur.50 On
multiple occasions, Trump draws on his economic success over the three
years as president to demonstrate his capacity to rule. He states that
'nobody has ever done anything like what we were able to do' 51 and
forcefully appropriates this achievement: I think you're going to have a
recovery. Look, I built -- they were just telling me inside, and it's
fact -- I built the greatest economy -- with the help of 325 million
people, I built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And
one day, because of something that should have never been allowed to
happen, we had to close our country, we had to close our economy.52 Such
assertions portray Trump not only as a legitimate and successful leader
of the United States but, more importantly, as the one responsible for
maintaining its position as the economic powerhouse and global hegemon.
As the latter quote exemplifies, Trump excessively utilises the first
personal pronoun ('I'), which allows him to embody the success of the
nation. As the American economy slipped into one of the worst downturns
since the Great Depression, Trump claims that 'I had to turn it off in
order to get to a point where we are today.' 53 While claiming
responsibility for the economic safety of the nation, Trump also assures
his audience that Americans will 'help countries around the world as
well' because 'the whole world is watching' them.54 The narrative of
Trump's leadership par excellence produces an image of the United States
as the supreme leader in the fight against COVID-19, whereas other
countries 'aren't highly sophisticated' and represent failures.55 For
example, Trump contrasts the United States' rate of COVID-19 testing
with that of other countries: We are way ahead on testing. We are the
best in the world on testing. We've tested much more than anybody else,
times two -- or every country combined. We've tested more than every
country combined. ... The quality of our tests is the best and the
number is the best.56 These multiple superlatives and assertions that
the United States is 'first' on one or another measure enable Trump to
reinforce a masculine fiction of conquest and triumph. In this
framework, the pandemic becomes a platform for the United States to
demonstrate and maintain its innovative capacity and supremacy.
Similarly, other top-level members of Trump's administration extend the
narrative of American omnipotence. As a case in point, Mike Pompeo
reminds the media that 'a lot of countries are asking us for assistance
and a lot of countries have received assistance', assuring that the
United States has 'of course, done the right thing'. 57 However, he
instantly highlights that the United States will be 'an enormous force
for good' in other countries and regions only after it provides for
itself: We've made sure we had the resources for our own people, but as
the American greatness -- as American power and American commercial
prosperity continues to grow, we're building out -- we're getting not
only ventilators but all of the equipment that the world will need.58
[While [Trump and Pompeo]{.mark} make it clear that the United States
will take care of itself first, they continue to [represent the nation
as the world's saviour and protector of the weak]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This notion is explicitly rhetorical. Although both figures elevate
COVID-19 to a 'global threat', 59 it is clear that the United States is
isolated[. Rather than binding together as a universal front and leading
the world to victory, T[rump and his]{.mark} most prominent
[team]{.mark} members continually [denounce the work of]{.mark} both
other [nations and international organisations, portraying the United
States as individually successful in comparison.]{.mark} In turn, [the
fight against COVID-19 is framed not as a fight for global immunity and
humankind but as a competition over who is going to defeat the threat
first.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The dichotomy of gendered discourses used by Trump and Putin in their attempt to securitize COVID-19 normalize harmful gender stereotypes and roles, and normalize using toxic masculinity in response to a crisis

**Kuteleva and Clifford 2021** (Anna Kuteleva is a postdoctoral research
fellow at the School of International Regional Studies at the National
Research University Higher School of Economics (Russia). Anna holds a
PhD in Political Science from the University of Alberta (Canada). Sarah
J. Clifford is an MSc student in Political Science at the University of
Copenhagen (Denmark). Her Master's project explores the intersections of
American militarised masculinities, identity politics, and education
policies. Clifford studied Political Science and worked as a Research
Assistant for the China Institute and the Faculty of Education at the

discursive politics of the COVID-19 pandemic," European Journal of
International Security (2021), 6, 301--317 doi:10.1017/eis.2021.5)

[The masculinity performed by Trump and Putin is toxic]{.underline},
inasmuch as [it (re)produces and nourishes state-inspired nationalism
and white supremacy.]{.underline} On the domestic level[, their gendered
securitisation discourses atomise American and Russian citizens,
imposing on them subjugating features of a homogenous national 'we' and
creating new exclusionary boundaries along the lines of race and
ethnicity.]{.underline} As a case in point, [Trump employs hegemonic
discourses to reconceptualise the United States as a white, masculine
entity]{.underline}. In stark terms, [Trump's gendering of the nation
constructs fictionalised divisions between who belongs to the 'we' and
who is framed as the excluded Other]{.underline}. [These discourses not
only formulate the pandemic as a health crisis but also elevate it to
that of a racialised security threat, capable of compromising the purity
of the United States.]{.underline} As for the Russian case, [the brand
of hegemonic masculinity reproduced by Putin normalises the
racialisation of Russian nationalism and further anchors Russianness in
its ethnic and religious terms. Moreover, Putin fosters paternalistic
domination over women by rendering them as passive victims of the
pandemic to be protected and guided.]{.underline} Both Trump and Putin
elevate the COVID-19 outbreak to a global threat. However, [while Trump
turns his response to the pandemic into a competition that the United
States is destined to win, Putin focuses on cooperation under collective
responsibility.]{.underline} Trump wants the United States to get ahead
of other countries. Putin claims that Russia will learn from other
countries and analyse their experience carefully while setting an
example of the proper ethical conduct for the rest of the world. [As
much as these two narratives are at odds with each other, they both
create multiple dichotomies where Others are represented as subordinated
to the national Self and thus are either feminine or hyper-masculine. In
the case of feminisation, Others are presented as passive, weak, and
poorly organised. Hyper-masculine Others are aggressive, irrational,
egotistical, and competitive. Both are portrayed as dangerous and
threatening to the international community at large. These tight
hierarchical dichotomies normalise and fuel the great power
confrontation and prevent the international community from engaging in a
constructive dialogue and synergetic planning to respond to the
pandemic. In both cases, political leaders enacted hierarchical gendered
identities in the securitisation of COVID-19, sustaining their national
manhoods and bolstering their legitimation strategy]{.underline}. A year
down the road, it is evident that [Trump's and Putin's illusionary
projections of the 'guardian of the nation' did not translate into
effective policy responses that alleviated the threat of
COVID-19.]{.underline} Both the United States and Russia are among the
top ten most affected countries by COVID-19 worldwide.96 For the United
States, 2020 was the deadliest year in its history, with deaths
associated with COVID-19 reaching 473,000.97 Russia officially recorded
more than 358,000 excess deaths between April and December 2020,98 with
almost 100 per cent of these deaths in some regions attributed to
COVID-19.99 These numbers demonstrate that both [Trump and Putin failed
many of their citizens, letting the deadly virus run wild.]{.underline}
However, bringing to the fore Trump's and Putin's convergent
securitising discourses, we do not target the failure of their
securitising moves. Rather, we [problematise Trump and Putin's
deployment of masculinity as a tool in securitisation that led both
leaders to dangerously exert hegemonic masculinity in times of
uncertainty. In the United States, Trump dispelled contrasting emotions
of fear and security to quell the pandemic's threat to American
sovereignty, invulnerability, and global dominance, while concurrently
cementing his position as the nation's protector. In Russia, Putin drew
on the idealised heteronormative concept of the nuclear family to frame
himself as the nation's patriarch and legitimise his authoritarian
regime. As such, the process of securitising is not uniform but instead
socially and culturally specific. We do not argue that a resurgence of
hegemonic masculinity is intrinsic to securitisation or that
securitisation is simply a ploy used by all national leaders during a
crisis to reassert their nation's sovereignty.]{.underline} Yet, our
findings show that both Trump and Putin -- two very notable and
influential politicians in the international arena, to say the least --
virtually turn masculinity into the means of securitising COVID-19.
Overall, [studies]{.underline} as the one we present [here demonstrate
how implicit and explicit references to masculinity in the process of
securitisation confirm it as the political norm and thus naturalise the
systemic effects of toxic gendered practices]{.underline} that permeate
both Trump's and Putin's quests for power.

### Cyberwar/cyberterror Link

#### Representations of cyberwar actively work to justify violent Otherizing lashouts via unnecessary fearmongering based on false data

Mr.Mr.

The White House likes a bit of threat. In his State of the Union
address, Barack [Obama wanted to nudge Congress]{.underline} yet again
[into passing meaningful legislation]{.underline}. The president
emphasized that America\'s enemies are \"seeking the ability to sabotage
our power grid, our financial institutions, and our air traffic control
systems.\" After two failed attempts to pass a cybersecurity act in the
past two years, he added swiftly: \"We cannot look back years from now
and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our
security and our economy.\" Fair enough. A bit of [threat to prompt
needed action is one thing. [Fear-mongering is]{.mark} something else:
[counterproductive]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet too many a participant in
the cybersecurity debate reckons that puffery pays off. The Pentagon, no
doubt, is the master of razzmatazz. Leon [[Panetta set the tone by
warning]{.mark} again and again [of]{.mark} an impending \"[cyber Pearl
Harbor]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" Just before he left the Pentagon, [the
Defense Science Board]{.underline} delivered a remarkable report,
Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat. The paper
[seemed obsessed with making yet more drastic historical
comparisons]{.underline}: \"The cyber threat is serious,\" the task
force wrote, \"with potential consequences similar to the nuclear threat
of the Cold War.\" The manifestations of an all-out nuclear war would be
different from cyberattack, the Pentagon scientists helpfully
acknowledged. But then they added, gravely, that \"in the end, the
existential impact on the United States is the same.\" A reminder is in
order: [[The world has yet to witness a single casualty,]{.mark} let
alone fatality, [as a result of a computer attack]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Such statements are a plain insult to survivors of Hiroshima. Some
sections of the Pentagon document offer such eye-wateringly shoddy
analysis that they would not have passed as an MA dissertation in a
self-respecting political science department. But in the current debate
it seemed to make sense. After all [a bit of [fear helps to
claim]{.mark} \-- or keep \-- scarce [resources when austerity]{.mark}
and cutting [seems out-of-control]{.mark}]{.underline}. The report
recommended allocating the stout sum of \$2.5 billion for its top two
priorities alone, protecting nuclear weapons against cyberattacks and
determining the mix of weapons necessary to punish all-out
cyber-aggressors. Then there are [[private]{.mark} computer security
[companies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such firms, naturally, [[are keen to
pocket]{.mark} some of the [government]{.mark}\'s [money]{.mark}
[earmarked for cybersecurity]{.mark}. And [hype is the means to that
end]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Mandiant\'s much-noted report linking
a coordinated and coherent campaign of espionage attacks dubbed Advanced
Persistent Threat 1, or \"APT1,\" to a unit of the Chinese military is a
case in point: [The firm offered far more details on attributing attacks
to the Chinese than the intelligence community has ever
done]{.underline}, and the company should be commended for making the
report public. But instead of using cocky and over-confident language,
Mandiant\'s analysts should have used Words of Estimative Probability,
as professional intelligence analysts would have done. An example is the
report\'s conclusion, which describes APT1\'s work: \"Although they
control systems in dozens of countries, their attacks originate from
four large networks in Shanghai \-- two of which are allocated directly
to the Pudong New Area,\" the report found. Unit 61398 of the People\'s
Liberation Army is also in Pudong. Therefore, Mandiant\'s computer
security specialists concluded, the two were identical: \"Given the
mission, resourcing, and location of PLA Unit 61398, we conclude that
PLA Unit 61398 is APT1.\" But the report conspicuously does not mention
that Pudong is not a small neighborhood (\"right outside of Unit
61398\'s gates\") but in fact a vast city landscape twice the size of
Chicago. [[Mandiant\'s report was useful]{.mark} and many attacks indeed
originate in China. [But the company should have been]{.mark} more
[careful in its overall assessment]{.mark} of the available
evidence]{.underline}, as the computer security expert Jeffrey Carr and
others have pointed out. The firm made it too easy for Beijing to
dismiss the report. My class in cybersecurity at King\'s College London
started poking holes into the report after 15 minutes of red-teaming it
\-- the New York Times didn\'t. Which leads to the next point: [[The
media want to sell]{.mark} copy [through threat
inflation]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"In Cyberspace, New Cold War,\" the
headline writers at the Times intoned in late February. \"The U.S. is
not ready for a cyberwar,\" shrieked the Washington Post earlier this
week. [[Instead of calling out the]{.mark} above-mentioned [Pentagon
report, the paper]{.mark} actually [published]{.mark} two [supportive
articles]{.mark} on it and pointed out that a major offensive cyber
capability now seemed essential]{.underline} \"in a world awash in
cyber-espionage, theft and disruption.\" The Post should have reminded
its readers that [[the only]{.mark} military-style [cyberattack that
has]{.mark} actually [created]{.mark} physical
[damage]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- Stuxnet \-- [[was]{.mark} actually
[executed by the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates government]{.underline}.
The Times, likewise, should have asked tough questions and pointed to
some of the evidential problems in the Mandiant report; instead, it
published what appeared like an elegant press release for the firm. On
issues of cybersecurity, [the nation\'s fiercest watchdogs too often
look like hand-tame puppies eager to lap up stories from private
firms]{.underline} as well as anonymous sources in the security
establishment.

Narratives of crisis often invoke the specter of existential, physical
threats to the body of the nation such as terrorist threats (Huysmans
and Buonfino
[2008](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19460171.2013.862504#CIT0040));
it is in this physical sense of security that Bigo
([2002](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19460171.2013.862504#CIT0007),
p. 63) notes that human migration is 'increasingly interpreted as a
security problem'. Importantly, however, [[the production of
unease]{.mark} also [draws on]{.mark} everyday and (especially) economic
[challenges in a]{.mark} competitive [global
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Indeed, key [aspects of]{.mark}
contemporary [economic life]{.mark} (tax and welfare regimes,
productivity and innovation, and employment law, for instance)
[are]{.mark} increasingly [interpreted as problems of national
security.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the realm of immigration policy, for
instance, national security no longer simply requires keeping out the
dangerous, the poor and the sick. Rather, national security is also
achieved by actively attracting and retaining desired, 'talented'
migrants. Hence the contention of the Singaporean Prime Minister (cited
in Ong
[2006](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19460171.2013.862504#CIT0056),
p. 188) that the successful attraction of 'foreign talent will be a
matter of life and death' for the nation, where he clearly had in mind
not the physical security but the continued economic viability of the
nation. As Ong
([2006](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19460171.2013.862504#CIT0056),
p. 5) suggests, the state of exception occasioned by neoliberalism 'can
be deployed to include as well as to exclude' (emphasis mine).¶ Economic
viability within a global economy is thus increasingly constructed as a
matter of national security problem. As Agamben
([2005](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19460171.2013.862504#CIT0002),
p. 13) notes, while the idea of the state of emergency was normalized
during World War I, after the war, '[[military emergency ... ceded its
place to economic emergency']{.underline}]{.mark}. The key discursive
move in constructing economic viability as an issue of national security
is the application of the metaphor of war to economic challenges.
Agamben
([2005](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19460171.2013.862504#CIT0002))
cites Franklin D. Roosevelt's response to the Great Depression ('I shall
ask the Congress ... for broad Executive power to wage war against the
emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in
fact invaded by a foreign foe' (p. 22)) to ground his claim that 'the
metaphor of war \[became\] an integral part of the presidential
political vocabulary' (p. 21). The metaphor of [[war is deployed within
a narrative of]{.mark} constant [crisis in which national economies are
engaged in an unending]{.mark} global [contest for resources]{.mark},
trade access [and investment]{.mark}]{.underline}. As we shall see, the
challenges of neoliberal globalization are not constructed primarily as
crises of environmental degradation or political sovereignty, but --
overwhelmingly -- as a pervasive crisis of economic competitiveness.¶
The state-at-war metaphor is one of the main ways in which an
economically based 'shared purpose' is naturalized and used to suppress
alternative conceptions (Skilling
[2011](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19460171.2013.862504#CIT0047),
p. 78). It is during times of war that the state can most easily call
for an almost endless degree of loyalty and sacrifice in the name of a
clearly defined shared objective. It is during times of war that it
becomes most acceptable to ask what citizens can do for their country,
and to recognize and reward them on that basis. And, [[in a context of
permanent crisis, the criteria of individual contribution to national
viability can be used to justify massive
inequalities]{.underline}]{.mark} of outcome.¶ Neoliberalism, then, can
be understood as a mode of 'governing through freedom' that institutes
the danger and uncertainty that lies at the far side of that freedom.
And within a neoliberal global economy, the external environment is
constructed as a fluid and potentially hostile realm of opportunity and
challenge. [[The pursuit of]{.mark} global [economic
competitiveness]{.mark}, in turn, [is justified as the]{.mark} urgently
necessary [response to that]{.mark} danger and [uncertainty]{.mark}: as
the salve for unease]{.underline}. It is thus essential to its
legitimacy that the state is seen as offering a credible and coordinated
response to that challenging environment. Far from eroding state power,
neoliberalism provides the conditions that enhance the status and
legitimacy of the state (and other actors) as the producer and
implementer of strategy (see Thrift
[2000](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19460171.2013.862504#CIT0014),
p. 95), even if that strategy stipulates a decreased scope of direct
governmental action or control. As Kim McKee
([2009](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19460171.2013.862504#CIT0040),
p. 469) notes, 'less direct government in society does not necessarily
entail less governing.' In neoliberalism's recasting of politics as a
'problematizing activity' and its 'transforming \[of\] situations of
uncertainty into calculative strategies' (Ong
[2006](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19460171.2013.862504#CIT0056),
p. 178), a dialectic emerges between problems and strategies. Problems
call forth a 'necessary' strategic response; strategy produces
correlative problems. [[The practice]{.underline}]{.mark} of strategy
[[validates]{.mark} and empowers [those experts able to
formulate,]{.mark} implement and assess the technical [solutions that
the discourses of crisis,]{.mark} risk, unease and (in)security
[require.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Environment Link

#### **Securitizing the environment via the aff's Western scientific discourse ignores structural issues in the environment -- masculine domination over nature is the root cause, which makes the kritik prerequisite.**

**[Breidlid 13]{.underline}** \[Anders, Professor, Master programme in
Multicultural and International Education, Oslo University College,
"Education, Indigenous Knowledge, and Development in the Global South",
p. 23-25\]Mr.Mr.

Philipp Pattberg (2007) discusses [[the ideology of domination over
nature]{.mark} that is still with us today]{.underline}, how it is
"\|d\]eeply rooted in our every-day beliefs, actions, reflections and
hopes, it lies at the center of any attempt to transform the world into
a more loveable, friendlier, lighter and safer place" (p. 7). By
discussing what he terms the enslavement of nature and the enslavement
of humans by other humans, he concludes that this [[has led to a global
state which is not sustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Exploring its
historical trajectory, the ideology of domination over the natural
environment took hold, according to Pattberg, "in the context of . . .
the decline of Christianity as a total explanatory structure for human
existence, the scientific turn of Cartesianism and the rise of
capitalism to a self-replicating structure of rational choice" (p. 8).
Lynn White (1974) suggests that the ecological crisis is due to the
orthodox Christian legacy, especially its Western branch, stating,
"Christian- ity, in absolute contrast to ancient paganism and Asia's
religions (except, perhaps Zorastrianism), not only established a
dualism of man and nature but also insisted that it is Cod's will that
man exploit nature for his proper ends" (p. 4). Moreover, White proposes
that "(o\]ur science and technology have grown out of Christian
attitudes towards man's relation to nature which are almost universally
held, not only by Christians and neo-Chris- tians but also by those who
fondly regard themselves as post-Christians" (p. 5). Interestingly,
White suggests a return to unorthodox Christianity spearheaded by St.
Francis, an idea I will return to later in this book. Max Weber's
thesis, 7he Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism (1905/2001),
is based on the assumption that there is a close relationship between
Protestantism and capitalism, that capitalism's basis is (what was
interpreted as) the Christian work ethic, particularly in Calvinism.
[[The idea is]{.mark} that [domination over nature]{.mark} through hard
work and frugality [will be rewarded by God. There is]{.mark} therefore
[a]{.mark}n important [epistemological dimension]{.mark} to this
crisis]{.underline}. As Kincheloe and Steinberg (2008) put it, "Some
indigenous educators and philosophers put it succinctly: We want to use
indigenous knowledge to counter Western's science destruction of the
Earth. Indigenous knowledge can facilitate the 21st century project
because of its tendency to focus on relationships of human beings to
both one another and to their eco-system" (pp. 136-137). The exclusion
of alternative epistemologies and the privileging of rational science
have meant the demise of ecological sustainability while the
epitomization of scientific truth and rationality has excluded values
that transcend the so-called rationality dogma of the West. [This denial
of epistemological diversity and the privileging of European epistemic
mono-culture is still hegemonic and perceived as a sign of development
and modernity.]{.underline} Ideological Pathology There is a naive
belief among modernization theoreticians that since ecological problems
are a result of the economic activities of modernization, further
economic activities should cure these environmental problems. [[Due to
the finiteness of the earth's resources]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
vicious circle of repair- ing the consequences of progress with [further
[progress is not sustainable]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ronald Wright (2004)
argues that the 20lh century was a period where unlimited growth in
terms of population, consumption, and technology exploited the natural
systems in an unsustainable way. Wright calls these activities of
ecological unsustainability the very worst kind of "ideologi- cal
pathology." While colonialism and the capitalist world system have been
beset with territorial, political, and economic conquest, Western
science is based on the same idea of conquest, that is, not respecting
the earth's ecological limits. Moreover, in line with worid-systems
analysis, there is an ecologi- cal unequal exchange here, as the core's
exploitation and utilization of the world's resources is matched in the
periphery with the burden of negative ecological costs imposed by the
core. [As has been discussed above, the issue of [Western
science]{.mark} and knowledge production [is]{.mark} existentially
[important because the Eurocentric]{.mark} epistemology of knowing
[(mastering)]{.mark} and dominating the world [is]{.mark}]{.underline},
despite its mer- its, [dramatically [problematic in a world
where]{.mark} the majority of [the]{.mark} world's [population]{.mark}
not only [suffers from hunger]{.mark} and malnutrition, illiteracy, and
lack of work, [but where the]{.mark} hegemonic [epistemology upsets the
relationship between \[people\] ]{.mark}]{.underline}man [[and nature as
it seeks to possess the earth]{.mark} in the same way as a master
exploits his slave.]{.underline} The ecological challenges are closely
intertwined with the current economic challenges in the West, and it is
difficult to ignore that the aggressive ideology of exploitation and the
maximizing of profits, which are so central to European hegemonic
epistemology, is detrimental to the efforts to save the planet from
ecological disaster. Vivas (2011) is right when contending that the
difference between the present economic crisis and those of the 1970s
and 1929 is "its ecological aspect. Indeed, we cannot analyze the global
ecological crisis separately from the crisis in which we are immersed or
the critique of the economic model that has led us into it." Even if we
do not agree that the crisis is due to capitalism's inherent
contradictions, the global economic crisis has long been there; the eco-
nomic crises in Greece, Italy, and Spain are miniscule compared to the
permanent crises in the South, where millions go hungry to bed every day
and live on a dollar per day despite heavy interventions from the aid
com- munities in the West/North. Even though economic hegemony is
shifting to Asia (China and India) and Latin America (Brazil), there is
no reason to believe that the hegemonic discourse of resource
exploitation and profit maximization will change. On the contrary,
[[China's]{.mark} economic [growth is based on the same Eurocentric
discourse, and]{.mark} the [ecological challenges in China
are]{.mark}]{.underline}, as a consequence, [[enormous]{.mark}, not only
for China, but [for the world]{.mark} as a whole[. Its]{.mark} emission
of [g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}ases [is the
highest]{.mark}]{.underline} (in volume) in the world. There is a
shortage and pollution of water. Annual desertification of land amounts
to an area of about 13000 sq km (the size of Connecticut), and economic
growth and rapid development mean "increasing urbanization, consumerism,
and pol- lution'\' (Council on Foreign Relations, 2011). The failures of
past climate summits in Copenhagen (December 2009), Cancun (December
2010), and Durban (December 2011) show the inertia of the governments in
wealthy countries. Actually, there is no global leader- ship to fend off
the ecological crisis, simply because the leaders of wealthy countries
are entrenched in an economic system that prioritizes non-sus- tainable
development. [[There seems to be no willingness]{.mark} or ability [to
find a solution]{.mark}]{.underline} that requires a comprehensive
social and economic transforma- tion, such as the necessity to decrease
consumption levels in the North (given that similar consumption levels
across the globe would require sev- eral planets). Here [there is no
difference between Communist China (a capi- talist in economic matters)
and the US]{.underline}. This is one important reason why "the critique
of the epistemic foundations of Western academic discourse has triggered
and nourished discussions on the possibilities of construction of an
alternative to capitalism" (Santos et a!., 2008, p. xxxiv). It was the
universalist claims of Europe's hegemonic epistemology (as discussed
earlier in the chapter) that was employed to justify Europe's "civi-
lizing mission," which is still hegemonic globally. As Griffiths and
Knezevic (2009) state: This scientific universalism, the most recent
manifestation of European universal ism, asserts objectivity across all
phenomena and time . . . Such claims of universalism, or assertions of
universal truths, function as meta-narratives that encapsulate the
ideology of those groups with power in the world-system . . . (pp.
67-68).

### Facial Recognition Link

#### AI is used as an apparatus of domination due to data that will always construct power relations via rendering women and minorities invisible because its data is not representative of the entire population

**Aradau and Bunz 2022** (Claudia Aradau, Professor of International
Politics at King's College London and a member of the editorial

[[The critique of power addresses AI as an apparatus of
domination]{.mark} and traces the technology through the production of
data]{.underline} -- data collected by corporations thriving in
so-called 'platform capitalism' as well as by the state and its
repressive agencies[[. Power]{.mark} emerges in multiple forms,
[from]{.mark} the historicity of [data]{.mark}, its [extraction]{.mark}
by corporations and the state, its [valorisation and]{.mark} the
[effects of surveillance and oppression it creates]{.mark}]{.underline}.
What statisticians and computer scientists refer to as [[bias is created
by]{.mark} training [data reflecting]{.mark} historical or social
[inequities]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[When gathering]{.mark} training
[data]{.mark}, specific groups -- such as [people of colour, minorities
or women]{.mark} -- [are]{.mark} often [underrepresented]{.mark}.
[They]{.mark} might [have been overlooked in]{.mark} the process of
[data sampling or]{.mark} during the [testing of the AI]{.mark}
technology. [This]{.mark} 'prototypical whiteness' that renders
racialised subjects invisible [is entwined with surveillance
technologies that render them hypervisible]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
Simone Browne has shown.15 For example, a dataset called'Faces in the
Wild', which had long been considered as a benchmark for testing facial
recognition software, now comes with the warning that its [[data is not
representative -- 70% of the faces are male and 80%
white]{.underline}]{.mark}, as digital activist Joy Buolamwini found
out.16 [[And even if values representing race, gender, sexual
orientation or class are removed, AI models,]{.mark} always looking for
patterns, [turn to proxy discrimination using statistical correlations
of postcodes, education or particular expressions to
discriminate]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Wendy Chun pointed out in her
study Discriminating Data: 'These "errors" often come from "ignoring"
race -- that is, wrongly assuming that race-free equals racism-free'.17

### "Great Powers" Link

#### Traditional IR sees small states and those on the margins as irrelevant, prioritizing "great powers" over and silencing violence against women and other minorities.

**[Sjoberg 2013]{.underline}** (Laura Sjoberg, Professor of Political
Science at U Florida. *Gendering Global Conflict: Toward a Feminist
Theory of War* (Print Book)) CL

- This card has a bunch of stuff in it and it can be recut to make any
  of those args

[In addition to having a narrow conception of what states' relationships
are, the [literature on dyadic causes of war often focuses on a narrow
subset of states that have relationships]{.mark}. While much of the
quantitative work on dyadic causes of war includes either all dyads or
all politically relevant dyads,20 [many of the case studies look at
great powers, and most of them do not dig significantly deeper than
the]{.mark} (assumed rational, unitary) [governments of those great
states]{.mark}]{.underline}. By contrast, feminist analyses have come to
see individual welfare rather than great power stability or even how
governments interact as a central factor in global politics. The
security of the least powerful women in the least powerful states in the
world is not only a key security issue for feminists but also a key unit
of analysis, given that many feminists see the margins as a crucial and
inseparable part of local, global, and international politics. Feminist
research shows how [[those at the political margins can be made insecure
even while states are being made more secure. Women's bodies have been
considered the means to an end in debates over the U.S. security force
in South Korea, the prevalence of and possible solutions to AIDS, and
debates about refugee camp composition and makeup]{.mark}, to name a
few, at the state and system level[.21 Research into women's lives in
war]{.mark} and conflict [has shown that they are often made insecure
when military operations cut off households' access to food, water, or
electricity; when soldiers rape them; when crime and "domestic" violence
increases as a result of war; and when]{.mark} severe [economic
deprivation leaves them vulnerable to disease.]{.mark}22 These threats
are often, both statistically and existentially, more vicious than the
threat of great power war.]{.underline}23 Feminist work has demonstrated
a link between what happens to women in wars and the gendered dynamics
of the making and fighting of wars.24 Because feminists often see
individual security as a central issue in global politics, their work
has critiqued the hierarchy that many liberal approaches to war(s)
identify and espouse in global politics. Feminists have recognized that
the least fortunate and the least free in global politics are often the
people whose needs are neglected by policy decision makers and policy
analysts.25 Additionally, "feminist scholars have repeatedly shown that
gender operates at various levels at which it intersects with class,
ethnicity, race, nationality, and sexuality to produce and reproduce an
intricate web of inequalities between and among men and women."26
Feminist theory, then, is critical of social and political hierarchy for
the pressure that it puts on the "bottom" of that hierarchy.27 [Many
dyadic theories of war, like many system-level theories of war, do not
share feminist theorists' interests in identifying, critiquing, and
deconstructing hierarchies in and among states.28 Instead, I argue that
[dyad-trait accounts of war value hierarchy by valuing the domestic
organization of states]{.mark} (and how that organization affects
peoples' lives) [as a means to the end of interstate peacefulness
without particular regard for how what happens inside the state affects
the people inside the state]{.mark}. Some "mainstream" [war theorists
concede that those left out of the planning of the international system
"consider the system to be unfair]{.mark}, corrupt, biased, skewed, and
dominated by hostile forces" [but]{.mark} often [do not give]{.mark}
significant [attention to the possibility that such a perception is
true]{.mark} and normatively problematic]{.underline}.29 Feminist work
has provided critiques both of the narrow definition of power (as
domination)30 and the narrow view of whose power and security matters in
these accounts. Arguing that it is possible to recognize through gender
lenses the normative value and empirical impact of lives on the margins
of international security, much feminist work looks for alternative ways
to analyze war. This is important because, as Fiona Robinson notes,
"those who care for others, and those who are most in need of care, are
among the world's most marginalized people."31 While [some characterize
small powers as irrelevant because they "pose no threat to the dominant
nation's leadership in the international system]{.underline},"32 many
feminist perspectives express concern that this view justifies political
and social oppression for the good of peace among great powers.
Likewise, while [some would ignore the concerns of the weak within
states, because they do not make decisions or change policies
directly]{.underline}, many feminist scholars have seen such a move as
not only empirically problematic but also discriminatory: A concept of
national security which gives priority to military threat rather than to
dangers in the economic and social sectors of society can be bought only
at the cost of poverty and misery and the violation of human rights---a
cost borne by all poor people but especially by women and future
generations.33 [As referenced above and discussed in more detail in
chapter 9, [wars tend to have a number of gendered and sex-differential
impacts in a number of areas]{.mark}, including direct material
destruction, the implications of infrastructural damage, interactions
with patriarchal militaries, the fallout of economic downturn, and the
problems associated with environmental destruction.[34 These harms are
often distributed disproportionately on the basis of not only sex but
also race and class to the margins of societies,35 and those people's
suffering is often ignored in dyadic and state-level war
theorizing]{.mark}.]{.underline} Feminist theorizing, on the other hand,
often looks for what happens at the margins.

### LAWs Link

#### An Artificial intelligence weapon is the gold standard for hegemonic masculinity---free of vulnerability

**Roff 16** (Heather, Gendering a Warbot, International Feminist Journal
of Politics, 18:1, 1-18, DOI: 10.1080/14616742.2015.1094246)

Jean Elshtain (1987) notes that [the narrative of men as "Just Warriors"
and women as "Beautiful Souls" does not "denote what men and women
really are in time of war, but function\[s\] instead to re-create and
secure women's location as noncombatants and men's \[location\] as
warriors" (4). Identifying this "trope" is one way to see the power of
gender hierarchies and to question and break down that power relation.
The masculine male as ideal solider, the feminine female as ideal
noncombatant (innocent, victim, powerless) is something we
should]{.underline}, and have more recently started to, [question in
practice.]{.underline}1 Indeed, with the United States repealing its
exclusion of women for direct combat roles (United States Department of
Defense 2013), one might hope that breaking down the gender hierarchies
is on the horizon. However, as one hand gives, another takes away. While
women are now de jure permitted to engage in combat roles, and thus all
roles in warfighting, [there is another movement afoot which threatens
this process of gender balancing and mainstreaming: the creation of
humanoid robotics.]{.underline} While some might view the creation of
autonomous robotic warfighters as emancipatory, potentially freeing the
military of gendered practices, I argue that this viewpoint is
incorrect. Rather[, the creation of humanoid robot fighters further
entrenches a hegemonic masculinity that subordinates all
humans]{.underline}. **[The humanoid robot fighter is the ideal of
masculinity in western culture, for it represents an "independent,
risk-taking, aggressive, heterosexual and rational "being free from any
weakness, particularly irrationality, frailty, emotion or
desires]{.underline}** (Barrett 2001, 79). The article traces three
potential avenues for the construction of gender in a "warbot," or
humanoid robot warfighter. First, I look to hardware, or the physical
constructions of humanoid robots. I utilize the United States Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge as current
evidence of these physical design choices (and potential trajectory for
future designs).2 Second, I look to the naming of these systems, as well
as their intended roles. I argue that [the way research teams currently
name and task these systems perpetuates and reifies gendered roles and
power hierarchies.]{.underline} I caution that [without a critical
examination on the part of researchers and engineers, the current
practice may lead to an accretion of gendered practices that threatens
inclusion and mainstreaming]{.underline}. Third and finally, I look to
the software of a potential humanoid robotic warfighter. Using feminist
critiques of the philosophy of science, epistemology, technology and
artificial intelligence (AI), I argue that [the AIs created will not
only emulate and/or co-opt the biases of their creators, but that the
creators will actually distill gender into hegemonic masculinities and
femininities for these machines.]{.underline} Taken together[,
these]{.underline} three gender vectors [will produce an **artificially
intelligent, artificially gendered, lethal autonomous humanoid robot**.
Instead of using technology to free us from gendered practices and
hierarchies, a\` la Haraway's (1990) conception of the post-human
cyborg, this machine will perpetuate domination and
subordination.]{.underline}

#### AI weapons are gendered to become an archetype for "warrior virtues" and embody hegemonic masculinity as it paints humanity as vulnerable, and thus feminine

**Roff 16** (Heather, Gendering a Warbot, International Feminist Journal
of Politics, 18:1, 1-18, DOI: 10.1080/14616742.2015.1094246)

Finally, and [the most likely reason for intended gendering of AI, the
purpose of gender is to reconstitute the gendered practices of the
sending state's military. As militarized masculinity is well known, the
construction of a masculinized robot would act as an archetype for other
human soldiers. The warbot would embody all of the "warrior virtues" and
would surpass all of its human compatriots because it would never
fatigue, require food, sleep or suffer from the trauma of
war.]{.underline}23 As Goldstein (2001) points out, [suppressing
emotions, shaming and refusing to acknowledge wartime trauma are
consistent practices across cultures to socialize men to war. A gendered
warbot would act asa norm generator, and militaries, instead of trying
to mold human soldiers to suppress their human tendencies by denying
their physical limits through training, shaming and abuse, can instead
create machines that embody all of these qualities.]{.underline} [The
humanoid robot fighter does not sleep, is "rational" in its
calculations, is aggressive and can fight in the most dangerous of
situations. It is]{.underline} Barrett's (2001) vision of [hegemonic
masculinity in military culture.]{.underline} The result is that [all
humans become subordinated as weak, incapable and emotional; that is,
feminized.]{.underline} One may object here and claim that all I have
shown is that [the creation of gendered humanoid robots perpetuates
militarized masculinity]{.underline}. In a way, this is certainly true.
Recall that Harding (2011) observes [the mutually dependent relationship
between the military and science/technology/engineering is
coconstituted. If the producers and consumers of the technology
co-constitute one another, then they will perpetuate already existing
gendered practices. Humans gender because they are
gendered.]{.underline} However, if I am correct, and [the
first-generation robots]{.underline} in the DRC [portend a future of
gendered autonomous warbots, then those machines will be
hypermasculinized AIs in oversexed bodies.]{.underline} **[Technology is
not going to free us from gendered practices and
hierarchies,]{.underline}** as Haraway (1990) suggests, **[but will
instead reify those very practices and power
relationships.]{.underline}** I have suggested here that [no human
warfighter will be capable of living up to the standard set by these
machines.]{.underline} To be sure, many of the "warrior virtues" are
idealized, and [human warriors often fall short of those standards.
Humans will always be subject to the realities of fatigue, limitations
of physical strength, hunger and emotion. Yet creating gendered
autonomous machines entails that those machines will always live up to
the ideal, and humans can never (and have never) met those
standards]{.underline}. "Virtues" will not be "excellences" any longer;
rather they will be the standard behavior for warbots. In turn[, **this
will solidify a version of hegemonic masculinity, and further
factionalize and subordinate all other masculinities and
femininities**]{.underline}**.** Thus I agree with Manjikan (2013) when
she worries that "autonomous technologies might actually prove harmful
to both genders" (12).

### NATO Link

#### Fear of feminization structures NATO with masculine ideals. 

Hebert 11, (Laura Hebert, Analyzing UN and NATO responses to Sexual
Misconduct in Peacekeeping Operations, published in *Making Gender,
Making war*. Laura Hebert is an associate professor of Diplomacy and
World Affairs at the Occidental College.) *GP*

[NATO's approach to gender mainstreaming]{.underline} is just as
[superficial]{.underline} as that of the UN. In the early 1960s, senior
female service officers from NATO countries began meeting to discuss how
women could be more effectively integrated and utilized in NATO forces.
Their efforts eventually led the Military Committee (MC), NATO's highest
military authority, to establish a consultative committee in 1976 with
the purpose of facilitating information sharing between NATO members on
the representation of female military personnel and issues affecting
women's ability to perform effectively in the armed forces (Garcia
1999). The Committee on Women in NATO Forces (CWINF) met formally only
once a year, for a maximum of five working days (NATO 2007b: 8).
Nonetheless, for twenty years it was the only body in the organization
directly addressing women's roles and status. In 1997, the MC agreed to
create the [Office on Women in NATO Forces (OWINF), run by two staff
members]{.underline}, in order to allow for greater continuity in NATO's
support for the integration of women (Garcia 1999). The establishment of
these bodies was the result of many years of hard work by women serving
in NATO's armed forces. The CWINF and the OWINF, however, focused not on
gender mainstreaming, but rather on the integration of women in NATO
forces through increasing the representation of female military
personnel, ensuring female military personnel enjoy the same personal
and professional opportunities as their male colleagues, and improving
the quality of life of female personnel.34 In May 2009, the MC made the
decision to replace the CWINF with the NATO Committee on Gender
Perspective, while the OWINF was renamed the NATO Office on Gender
Perspective. According to the MC, these changes were made to support the
organization's objective of integrating 'the gender perspective into all
aspects of NATO operations,' in line with Security Council Resolutions
1325 and 1820 (NATO 2009). The responsibilities of these bodies now
include facilitating information sharing on gender mainstreaming within
NATO, among NATO members, and between NATO and other relevant
international organizations and agencies; providing advice and support
on gender mainstreaming to the MC; and gathering information on the
progress of member states in implementing Security Council Resolutions
1325 and 1820 (NATO 2009). [The changes made,]{.underline} however,
appear to [have greater symbolic than practical
significance]{.underline}. Like the bodies they replaced, the NATO
Committee on Gender Perspectives meets once annually for a maximum of
five working days, while the NATO Office on Gender Perspectives is run
by only two staff members, one of whom is an administrative assistant
rather than a gender specialist. As with its anti-trafficking policy,
the limited dedicated support the NATO leadership has directed to these
gender mainstreaming bodies inevitably constrains their ability to have
a substantive impact on NATO policies, planning priorities, and
operations. From a feminist constructivist perspective, [there is
nothing surprising about the failure of the UN and NATO to go beyond a
surface approach to gender mainstreaming in the security
arena]{.underline}, even when these institutions (particularly the UN)
position themselves as women's rights standard-setters. Although
International Relations scholars have made clear that states are not
'black boxes' that are uniform across time and place, common markers
nonetheless distinguish states from other political entities, including
their ability to harness the resources to wage war and preserve peace
(Tilly 1990: 12). Prior to the mid-20th century, sovereign statehood was
guaranteed only for those states that possessed the capacity to defend
their sovereignty. Following World War II, however, sovereign statehood
was granted to states through international recognition, whether or not
they were fully capable in the modern sense (Jackson 1990). Since the
period of decolonization, rapid militarization has occurred throughout
the global South, attributable less to the practical urgency of state
survival and more to global environmental processes and pressures that
have come to define the symbols of legitimate statehood. [Militaries, as
described by Eyre and Suchman, 'no longer build modern nations, but
rather, the world political and social system builds modern
nation-states, which in turn build modern militaries and procure modern
weaponry']{.underline} (1996: 82[). Military systems have not remained
static. They have adapted to changing domestic and international
environmental pressures and circumstances, including the shifting nature
of security threats and technological developments that have altered
strategic calculations and recruitment needs. But what largely remains
unchanged is that military systems continue to function as 'muscular,'
virile, masculine symbols of state power, irrespective of women's
gradual integration into armed forces]{.underline} (Peterson 1992: 48
and 2010: 23-24). Thus[, for organizations such as the UN and NATO that
rely on member states for their military capacity, to take 135 gender
and gender mainstreaming into account is to threaten the military
institutions that have been constructed as emblematic of sovereign
statehood and substantive membership in the international society of
states]{.underline} -- a move inevitably resisted by their constituent
states. Even with the rise of robust Chapter VII missions, peacekeeping
continues to be characterized as a softer form of military power, with
contemporary operations mainly requiring soldiers to perform a peace
support rather than combat role. [Although peacekeeping forces may serve
a function distinct from national military systems, peacekeeping is
ultimately inseparable from traditional militaries]{.underline}. Given
the human and financial constraints facing most military systems,
creating and training peacekeeping forces detached from military
contingents serving national security interests is not a feasible option
(Dandeker and Gow 2004: 12). Even in countries where the threat of
inter-state war is remote, the priority is placed on preparing soldiers
for the potential of combat situations and then 'training down' in order
to 'cater to the needs of missions in which a more restrained use of
force is appropriate' (Sorenson and Wood 2005: 11). Nonetheless,
concerns persist among military leaders that the 'peacekeeping ethos'
will filter into national military systems and erode combat capabilities
(Boëne et al. 2004: 416[). The failure of political and military leaders
to take gender seriously in the security arena is thus neither the
result of accidental oversight or lack of appreciation of the complexity
of gender construction.]{.underline} Rather, [attempts to penetrate
military systems and culture in order to deepen the gender justice norm
and prevent gendered exploitation continue to be frustrated by the fear
of feminization --]{.underline} the fear at the heart of concerns that
the peacekeeping ethos will taint national military systems. To expose
the gender norms that inform (and are informed by) militarism is to
exacerbate the perceived threat participation in peacekeeping missions
poses to national military strength and preparedness. The norm of gender
justice has sufficiently penetrated the security arena such that it
can't be ignored or overtly rejected, thus the recognition by the UN and
NATO that their reputations and operational effectiveness are damaged by
allegations of sexual misconduct. It can, however, be co-opted through
the adoption of policies that invoke the appropriate language and give
the impression of substantive change but which instead blunt its
transformative potential[. As long as the fundamental association
between security threats, military capacity, and the masculine soldier
ideal persists, we can expect that gender mainstreaming will continue to
take the form of integrating women into already-defined masculine
structures and efforts to address peacekeeper sexual misconduct will
remain palliative rather than preventive.]{.underline}

### Nukes Link

#### Nuclear discourse is rooted in masculine language- the nuclear debate reinforces masculinity as an arms race becomes the masculinized concept of a "pissing contest"

Cohn reports that because of [the constant need to prove one\'s manhood,
a sexualized discourse]{.underline}, veritable verbal \"pissing
contests,\" [served to obscure any personal vulnerability or concern
about lives lost; to do so risked being ostracized and demeaned as
\"soft,\"]{.underline} a \"pussy,\" or for \"acting like a wimp,\"
[which is,]{.underline} in their eyes, [femalelike.]{.underline}
[Concern that Russians were essentially \"harder\" permeated strategic
discussions, while, at the same time, new entrants to the nuclear club
were said to have lost their virginity]{.underline}. [It is thus hardly
surprising to learn that when Edward Teller communicated news of the
first successfully detonated hydrogen bomb, his telegram exclaimed,
\"It\'s a boy.\"]{.underline} Extant customary weapons still reflect a
time-honored masculine iconography. [Like arrows and guns, conventional
and nuclear bombs evoke clearly discernible phallic
imagery;]{.underline} the power and immediacy of their impact connote a
masculine orgasmic event

[Nuclear weapons are, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the most dangerous
invention of mankind, and a fierce resistance to their proliferation
remains at the very crux of the international security
architecture.]{.underline} Nuclear weapons have also given rise to waves
of anti-nuclear activism since their very invention, particularly during
the Cold War years. [[One of the most significant debates
surrounding]{.mark} anti-nuclear activism and [the disarmament movement
contends itself with gender]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Nuclear
weapons]{.mark} are seen to [symbolise strength and]{.mark} the
[power]{.mark} of a particular state. [Nuclear weapons are]{.mark},
thus, [embedded in notions of masculinity and this]{.mark} perceived
[connection]{.mark} between masculinity and weapons of mass destruction
[serves as a hurdle to their abolishment]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
instance, the naming of the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
as 'Little boy' and 'Fat man' respectively opened the door for masculine
characteristics to be associated with nuclear proliferation.

[a prominent Indian politician remarked that the tests]{.mark} [were

[Media Coverage of NATO Bombings Throughout the 1990s, the American news
media represented the Balkans as a violent region rocked by ethnic
cleansing following the collapse of communist regimes at the end of the
Cold War.]{.underline} [Reports on concentration camps, torture, mass
murder, and expulsion of thousands from their homes reinforced a
narrative about the failure of democracies rather than the failure of
market economies to emerg]{.underline}e. Moreover, by mid-decade,
[reporters began to discuss the extraordinarily high levels of sexual
violence by Serbian and Yugoslav forces in this region, especially in
Bosnia]{.underline}. [Feminist analyses foreground the associations
between Serbian national- ism, rape warfare, and ethnic cleansing in
order to understand rape as a military and political tool]{.underline}
(Milic 1993; B. Allen 1996; Rejali 1998). Lynda Boose, for instance,
argues that the sexual sadism of Serbian brutality was crucial to this
\"orgy of nationalism\" (2002, 74). Statistics vary widely but
conservative estimates of women raped in Bosnia range from twenty
thousand to fifty thousand. (Boose 2002) [U.S. media attention turned to
Kosovo/a in the late 1990s as violence escalated against Albanian Muslim
populations. The moment of most intense interest in the region came
during the NATO bombings when the United States was directly involved in
the conflict through its military presence. NATO operations never
achieved the popular support of the Gulf War, coming as they did shortly
after the impeachment hearings of President Clinton.]{.underline}
Instead, the bomb- ings provoked intense debates about appropriate
methods of humanitarian intervention as well as exposed the problematic
nature of NATO\'s very existence after 1991.

Television, newspapers, and the major newsmagazines all provided
extensive coverage of the war. Even with the pervasiveness of
television, Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News continue to influence a wide
variety of Americans because \"nearly every high school, public and
academic library\" purchases them (Ulrich\'s Periodical Directory 2003).
Major media con- glomerates that own Time (Time-Warner) and Newsweek
(Washington Post, Inc.) - U.S. News is independently published - are
part of the powerful network of American and European news media that
control \"what much of the world reads, watches, and hears in its
foreign news \...\" (Shulman 1994, 108). Crucially, these newsmagazines
frame global economic, political, and social conflicts through racial
and gender categories that in turn justify the U.S. government\'s
encroaching and imperialist notions of globalization.

[The first two weeks of the bombings in April 1999 were a crucial period
during which the news magazines established narrative conventions for
reporting the bombings]{.underline}. [The first week\'s coverage
featured lengthy discussions of U.S. military and political strategies,
as well as articles on Milosevic as the locus of nationalist violence
and reports on ethnic cleansing. Photographs show U.S. military and
political leaders,]{.underline} Milosevic, maps of the region that
depict US/NATO strategies for attack, and some pictures of refugees.
Coverage in the second week focused more exten- [sively on the refugees
with numerous photographs of people walking along roads or railroad
tracks and in the camps, photographs of military and political leaders,
as well as more maps and pictures of U.S. soldiers. Articles continued
to focus primarily on U.S. and NATO policies and military strategies,
although reporters included more discussion of Albanian Kosovars\'
experiences of Serbian brutality.]{.underline}

Visual culture scholars are increasingly exploring the power of the
visual to shape and mediate knowledge beyond simplistic models of
propaganda or image manipulation (Liss 1998, xviii). Frequently
reproduced and revered photographs of war, like Robert Capa\'s \"Death
of a Loyalist Soldier\" (1936) or Nick Ut\'s \"Terror of War\" (the 1973
photograph of a young Vietnamese girl running naked from a Napalm
attack) are not those with the most detail but those with the greatest
symbolic value (Griffin 1999). As Liss writes[, \"At stake are the ways
in which photographs are set in motion, how they are employed to stand
in for wrenching, almost unrepresentable events]{.underline}\" (1998,
xii). This study provides detailed visual analyses of news photographs
in Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report to examine which
photographs \"stand in\" or represent the bombing campaign. Because of
publishing deadlines, weekly news- magazines function like a \"news
digest\" that recapitulates television and newspaper reports on events
of the previous week, using photographs as visual \"highlights\"
(Griffin and Lee 1995, 814). These visual highlights are less important
as factual reportage than they are for their symbolic function. I will
analyze the similarities in topics of coverage, narrative strategies,
and visual conventions, including some repetition of specific
photographs.7 This article, however, does not address the interpretive
audiences of these news reports, whose readings, of course, will always
be plural.8

All three magazines [promoted a narrative of American rescue of victims
in a dangerous and unstable region.]{.underline}9 An April 12 photograph
from US News, for instance, s[hows a white American soldier in full
combat gear in the extreme foreground. He frames the picture so that the
viewer looks with him into the background at several cars on a desolate
road. The viewer thus \"sees\" what the soldier is there to protect
(presumably these are civilian refugees although the people in the cars
remain unidentified). Above the photograph, the headline \"Can the
Cavalry Ride to the Rescue?\" aligns a racial ideal of hegemonic
masculinity with U.S. military efforts in this visual rescue narrative.
Although the question mark suggest ambiguity in the situation, the
exclusive focus in the article on the relative merits of different
military strategies raises questions about policy rather than social or
ethical concerns. This tag line, moreover, invokes American narratives
of the frontier, referencing the imperialist imaginary of the U.S.
cavalry protecting white settlers from dangerous Indians. Here, the
picture and the tag line connect whiteness and masculinity to the rescue
narrative through a mythic temporality in which social actors enact
historically defined roles (Fabian 1983).]{.underline}

The three newsmagazines reported on U.S. military and political leaders,
military technology and strategies, and the political debates over the
utility of air strikes. [Other NATO political leaders were rarely dis-
cussed, with only occasional references to the military capabilities of
the allied countries.10 Reporters paid little attention to the reasons
for the conflict, except to blame the violence on the nationalist
ambitions of Milosevic, whom one U.S. official referred to as the
\"tinhorn dictator of Serbia\" (Time April 5, 40).]{.underline} Like
discussions of Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War (Shohat 1994), the
U.S. news media focused almost exclusively on the national leader,
[turning this conflict into a personalized fight against the excessive
evils of nationalism]{.underline}. News reports described him as a
dictator, a thug, a communist party hack, and a man of no political
convictions except to stay in power. Feminist scholars have challenged
representations of the Balkan conflicts that focus solely on individual
leaders through documentation of the collective and localized dimensions
of ethnic/political violence. Mertus (1999a) and Boose (2002), for
instance, offer analyses of how the gender and sexual rhetorics of
Serbian national- ism played into and exacerbated local ethnic tensions
and conflicts.

[Instead of more complex historical analyses, news narratives typically
provide American viewers with an easily identified enemy, a narrative of
us/ them frequently structured on racial logics.]{.underline} This news
strategy is apparent once again in George W. Bush\'s \"war on
terrorism,\" which initially focused almost exclusively on Osama bin
Laden as the leader of Al Qaeda[. When the U.S. military failed to
capture him, the Bush administration then turned to Saddam Hussein.
Milosevic\'s European and white identities precluded the racial logic
that characterize representations of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
Rather, the media demonized the Serbian leader through references to
World War II, associating ethnic cleansing with the Holocaust and
Milosevic with Hitler.11 Drawing these parallels provides the symbolic
connection to a historical genocide that in turn locates the Serbian
leader, and by extension Serbia itself, as outside of civilized
nationhood. Individualizing this violence, furthermore, dehistori- cizes
the complexities of the situation (including European and U.S.
historical involvement in this conflict). As Fabian (1983) argues, this
symbolic association positions the other, in this case Milosevic, in a
past distinct from the temporal space of the viewer. In the second week,
for instance, all three magazines published the same photograph of a
long train filled to overflowing with refugees, many of whom are hanging
out of the windows. Extending across the entire frame of the composition
from the left foreground into the right background, the train
effectively blocks any view of the city behind. This keeps the gaze in
the foreground where hundreds of people stand on the train
platform.]{.underline}

Pictures like this one accentuate the cultural and geographical distance
from the United States to Kosovo/a. As other analysts of American news
practices have noted, the media typically represent distant places,
espe- cially outside of the West, as a \"world of trouble\" where
disasters, wars, and the breakdown of the social order occur (Morley
2000, 183). The train photograph explicitly historicizes the scene
through the visual allusion to the trains used by the Nazis to bring the
Jews to the death camps. Such references (and there are many in these
reports) render the scene familiar, and presumably sympathetic, to
Americans who have at least a popular understanding of the Holocaust.
Written texts further link ethnic cleansing to a historical narrative of
fascism and ethnic hatred through references to Neville Chamberlain and
Czechoslovakia. Using the historical specter of appeasement as a plea
for intervention, reporters quoted political leaders who spoke of the
possibility of violence spreading to the rest of Europe. Western
commentators supportive of the NATO air strikes often warned of the
dangers of appeasement as part of a larger appeal on behalf of human
rights. [The problem, however, is that \"this purely
humanitarian-ethical legitimization . . . depoliticizes the military
intervention\" (Zizek 2000, 57). I2 Specifically, the narrative of
\"humanitarian\" military intervention depoliticizes the racial
selectivity that determines such intervention. A racialized narrative is
evident in the photographs in which Albanian Muslims look white, like
the presumed reader, if a little backward. Critical commentators at the
time identified NATO\'s racial selectivity in contrast to the lack of
international military campaigns to stop the genocide in Rwanda, or
other sites of ethnic/political conflict such as Sierra Leone and
Palestine (Chomsky 1999; Haynes 1999).]{.underline}

Throughout the 1990s, American news media extensively reported on
genocidal acts of ethnic cleansing and other forms of oppression by
Serbian nationalists against ethnic populations in Bosnia, Kosovo, and
elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia. Beginning in 1998, Serbian and
Yugoslav forces began an increasingly escalated campaign against Alba-
nians in Kosovo. According to some critics, however, mass expulsions and
killings associated with ethnic cleansing did not occur until after the
bombings started on March 24. In the words of NATO Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley Clark, it was \"entirely predictable\" that Serbian
violence would escalate once the bombings started (Chomsky 1999, 37).
Critics have charged that NATO and the United States did not wait to
exhaust diplomatic and economic options, but instead retrospectively
used evidence of ethnic cleansing to justify the bombings (Chomsky 1999;
Haynes 1999). While humanitarian issues were of concern to many, NATO
prestige was also on the line. Since the end of the Cold War, to
reconfigure its legitimacy as an international institution.
Interventions in the Balkans were part of a larger effort by NATO to
extend its reach to a wider geopolitical arena than the original purpose
of the European Alliance. As British Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain explained, \"To walk away now would destroy NATO\'s
credibility\" (Chomsky 1999, 40).

[Arguments about humanitarian intervention also ignore the substantial
material interests at stake for NATO and the United States]{.underline}.
[These interests include investments by arms manufactures and Western
businesses, oil companies\' efforts to secure pipelines across the
Balkans, and the role of the IMF-World Bank in the region. In the late
1980s and 1990s, for in- stance, IMF-World Bank policies that demanded
austerity programs to secure debt repayment increased the economic
instabilities of the region. Moreover, as the former Yugoslavia broke
up, recognition or non-recogni- tion of states by Western countries had
a significant and unequal impact on their political economies. Pressure
on the Clinton administration also came from expatriate groups in the
United States as well as businesses advocating international policies
that increased their access to global markets (Haynes
1999).]{.underline}

Penezic argues that Western news depictions of nationalist conflict in
post-communist states reproduce a Cold War paradigm that blames ethnic
violence and the rise of economic disasters on the former communist
regimes and on nationalist overreactions. \"Whether or not this was true
for the Eastern Bloc, Yugoslavia\'s situation was not quite that simple.
The country has been decentered and federal, with multilingual
education, publishing, press, television, and so forth. While this
regulated and strictly controlled ethnic tolerance might not have been
enough to assuage nationalist hungers, reducing the causes of war to
nationalism only is, in my opinion, overly simplistic\" (Penezic 1995,
63). None of the news coverage of the NATO bombings discussed the
unstable economic and political conditions in the post-communist period,
especially the region\'s relationship to the West and to global economic
forces. Instead, all three magazines displayed a U.S. -centered analysis
that reproduced a familiar narrative of Western rescue of victims in a
dangerously unstable region. As Koshy points out, the American media
\"still remains primarily oriented to a national context and is thus
unable to generate a transnational frame- work of understanding adequate
to the complex problems of globaliza- tion\" (1999, 20).

[Rescue narratives emphasized the vulnerability of Kosovars and the
humanitarianism of military intervention. Crucially, the newsmagazines
characterized the Balkans as an agricultural area that still relies on
primi- tive farming techniques and a place of historic ethnic rivalries.
Pictures show people fleeing in primitive modes of transportation,
walking in single file on railroad tracks to avoid land mines or walking
in desolate landscapes.]{.underline} In Newsweek, for instance, an April
12 [photograph shows a man in the foreground pushing a wheelbarrow in
which sits an elderly woman wrapped in a headscarf, winter coat, and
blanket. Behind them another man also pushes an elderly person in a
wheelbarrow and two others walk along the road. This primitive mode of
transportation underscores the refugees\' vulnerable status while the
desolate landscape offers no clues to specific geographical, temporal,
or cultural locations. Old helpless women, cared for by men, all of whom
appear white, with limited re- sources (wheelbarrows) create a
sympathetic portrait. It also renders men solely within a subordinate
masculinity that depends on the protection of outside forces while women
are visualized as vulnerable and needy because of their age, race, and
gender. The exclusive gaze at peasants in a pre- modern setting, of
course, also erases the range of material resources and cultural
experiences of the Albanian Kosovars.13]{.underline}

[Physically locating the conflict in this nightmarish space, pictures
like this one and the one of the train station participate in creating
what Zizek refers to as the \"imagined cartography\" of the Balkans that
depicts this region as a \"terrain of ethnic horrors\" still fighting
centuries-old battles presumably in contrast to the advanced democratic
status of the West]{.underline} (Zizek 2000, 4-5). [While this perhaps
raises the question of what is the West, it also resecures a cultural
map that defines Europe as the countries of Western Europe while the
Balkans remain somewhere on the fringes of civilization]{.underline}.
These images also play into Cold War narratives that visualize socialism
as a failure of modernity. Such narratives deny how transnational
dependencies and determinations shape the region\'s economy. Hyper-
inflation, austerity measures, and other economic constraints since the
collapse of communist regimes in the region have intensified social and
political unrest. Escalating debt increasingly weakened the region\'s
economies, led to worker protests, and fostered the prestige of
nationalist solutions by Milosevic and his supporters (Haynes 1999).
Yet, news media ignored or minimized local, regional, and transnational
factors that have shaped ethnic conflict in the Balkans in favor of
representations of NATO heroics.

[The lack of references to Albanian politics ignores the complicated and
hybrid nature of Albanian identities and political
activisms.]{.underline} [Moreover, it promotes American national
interests at the expense of local and regional factors. The only
coverage of Albanian responses to Serbian violence was reports on the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a small militant group. None of the
magazines, for instance, discussed the nonviolent agenda of the Albanian
intellectual and political leader Ibrahim Rugov]{.underline}a (Chomsky
1999; Mertus 1999a, 6). [Photographs instead featured male soldiers of
the KLA in combat uniforms, yet there are no signs of actual combat.14
Compared with detailed discussions of American military equipment,
strategy, and personnel, reports on the KLA emphasized the lack of
equipment, training, and even incompetence of these fighters. This
contrast further eliminates political alternatives to the spectacle of
victim- ization]{.underline}. Zizek argues [that NATO intervened to
protect Kosovar victims while making sure they would remain
victims]{.underline}; [that is, no international support backed the
Albanians to become full political agents, or to sustain an armed
resistance]{.underline}. [He describes this as the \"paradox of
victimization: the Other to be protected is good in so Jar as it remains
a victim\"]{.underline} (2000, 59, 60). [News coverage of victims
waiting to be rescued erases U.S. and European nations\' complicity in
the economic and political instabilities in the region]{.underline}.
[Petras further argues that innocent victimization also ignores the
violence perpetrated by the KLA. He writes that the \"triumphal returns
and euphoric rhetoric of the NATO leaders covers up the brutal reality
of massive ethnic cleansing, systematic assassinations, pillage and
destruc- tion of churches, houses, farms, and businesses by NATO-backed
Alba- nian KLA terrorists and their paramilitary supporters\" (1999,
13).]{.underline}

As important as it is to publicize the horrors of war and ethnic cleans-
ing, [these photographs elide any representations of the subjectivity
and agency of the Albanians. Cameras do not depict the diversity of
experiences and cultures in Kosovo/a (]{.underline}Mertus 1999a). [No
pictures show people working in an urban setting or creating a makeshift
home or treating the injured.15 Nor do readers encounter photographs of
Albanian doctors, social workers, community leaders, etc. Instead,
photographs depict fearful and/or exhausted refugees]{.underline}.16 In
a half-page picture featured in U.S. News on April 12, for instance, the
photographer used a high angle shot of a group of refugees. The high
angle makes the crowd appear very large as people spread out to the very
edges of the background. In the center foreground, a woman holds out her
hands in a supplicant pose with the , \"[Pleading. A woman from Kosovo
asks Macedonian police officers to let her cross the border. Thousands
waited without food or water.\" As the focal point of the composition,
the female supplicant stands as the representative of the \"waiting\"
group. Women such as the suppli- cant become, in Zizek\'s words, the
\"ideal subject-victim in aid\" (2000, 57- 58) who do not struggle for
their own survival or fight back but remain the feminized object of the
Western gaze.]{.underline}

[These pictures provide the visual alibi for U.S. and NATO intervention
by establishing a national narrative about U.S. power and political good
in contrast to Milosevic and his Serbian forces. The racial logic is
here reinforced because few signs recognizable to Western viewers would
identify the refugees as Muslim. Racial and religious differences are
elided in this portrayal of Albanians as allies.]{.underline} [Instead,
gender is foregrounded through prominently featured photographs of
mothers with small chil- dren, namely on two magazine covers and as the
opening two-page spread in all three magazines the second week.
Collapsing the body with experi- ence and identity, photojournalism
relies on the bodies of mothers and babies to function as metonyms for
the Kosovo/a crisis.]{.underline} [Recent feminist scholarship on
embodiment has explored with great insight how identity, especially
sexual, gender, and racial identities are produced and repro- duced
through visible bodies]{.underline}.17 [In the news coverage of the NATO
bomb- ings, the visual embodiment of white motherhood, however, does not
so much produce knowledge or understanding of trauma as it turns
subjects into spectacles of suffering.]{.underline}

[As metonyms for victimization, photographs of women and children
collapse motherhood with the home (Morley 2000, 65) and in so doing
become the visible symbol of what is being threatened and what needs to
be saved.]{.underline} [For instance, a tightly framed photograph in
U.S. News from April 12 shows a group of refugees enclosed in an space
that appears to be surrounded by barbed wire (the caption explains that
the wire is part of the back of a truck) (fig. 2). In the center of the
composition, a woman throws her head back in anguish while a child next
to her stares soberly at the camera. This highly emotional expression of
innocence and vulnerability establishes the face of suffering for the
viewer]{.underline}. In such pictures, sub- jectivities are elided as
visible bodies rearticulate racialized gender ideals of domesticity
familiar to American audiences (Williams 1994). Despite late
twentieth-century social developments that include post-communism,
globalization, and new technologies, idealized domesticity continues to
{{Fig.2 ommited}} Fig. 2. Photograph by Santiago Lyon. Courtesy of
AP/Wide World Photos. have enormous ideological resonance (Morley 2000,
56). Since the Cold War period, [the American media have aligned an
ideal of the white middle class family with national interests and
desires (Kozol 1994). These pictures of refugees from Kosovo/a reveal
the powerful place that the racialized mother-child ideal continues to
hold in the U.S. cognitive grid. Whiteness, furthermore, contains the
otherness of Albanian Kosovars who, like this anguished Albanian mother,
lack racial, ethnic or religious markers of difference. If class,
racial, gender, and heteronormative ideals shape the cultural alignment
of family and nation, what happens when domesticity, that powerful sign
of stability and tradition, is figured as the sign of social disorder or
breakdown?]{.underline}

[Media portrayals of the ideal family typically establish boundaries of
identity that exclude all those who do not fit these racial, sexual, and
class categorizations.]{.underline} Morley, however, compellingly argues
that not all representations of domesticity are so intentionally
exclusive. Instead, he writes, \"it is not the presence of otherness per
se which is problematic but only that of undomesticated otherness,\"
pointing out examples of the incorpo- ration of Others, or what he
calls, \"domesticating alterity\" (2000, 223). In other words, [the
logics of racialization are often dependent upon incorpo- rating
otherness within \"the relation of domination\" (Taguieff 2001, 121).
News photographs of Kosovar refugees foreground racialized gender ideals
of domesticity in this moment of profound crisis and social disor- der.
Narratives about conflicts in the Balkans have historically been mapped
onto ethnic rivalries and hostilities that stereotype populations as
violent and backward.]{.underline} During the Cold War, for instance,
the American media typically collapsed ethnicity and communism in
characterizations of Albania as one of the most repressive communist
regimes. In contrast, news coverage of refugees in 1999 turned the
camera\'s gaze to mothers and children to figure Albanians as the
innocent victims of Serbian aggression. Ideals of domesticity that
feature attractive, white looking, mothers elide differences to
establish instead the moral position of the refugees.

[The cover photograph in U.S. News for April 12 exemplifies the process
of domesticating alterity. Above the headline, \"Balkan Hell,\" three
figures in the center of the composition look out at the camera. With a
somber but calm gaze, a young attractive woman holds a small child while
an older son leans against her. Although the caption does not identify
her religious affiliation, the coverage repeatedly characterized the
violence in Kosovo/a as an ethnic conflict between Serbian Christians
and Albanian Muslims. That this woman is not specifically identified as
a Muslim reinforces the process of incorporation within an American
ideal of domesticity. Even more than other mother and child images, this
photograph evokes the Western Christian art historical tradition of the
Madonna and child flanked by one or more saints. In the extreme
foreground a woman with her head covered in a white cloth moves toward
the picture plane. Her forward posture suggests movement outside of the
camera\'s frame and into the viewer\'s space. The triangular position of
the main figure group creates a stability that counterbalances the
dynamic movement of this foreground figure. The compositional and
iconographic stability signified by this Madonna and children, as Morley
suggests, domesticates the refugees\' alterity. This process occurs
through foregrounding heteronormativity, albeit normativity at risk.
During the Balkans wars, reporters often told of Serbian detention and
killings of fathers and husbands. To see the family without the male
figure underscores the social crisis and reinforces the call to rescue
the mothers and children. Even as this woman is incorporated within an
American cognitive ideal of domesticity, however, she remains other in
her (unlabeled) ethnicity and in her state of crisis. She is thus both
like and unlike the viewer. Looking at how photographs mobilize domes-
ticity reveals the ways in which narratives of war incorporate alterity
as part of justifications for military intervention.]{.underline}

In the newsmagazines, scenes of destroyed houses, rather than pictures
of military battles, further configure the Albanians visually within the
private sphere. In American hegemonic culture, the private sphere
signifies the privileges of privacy, intimacy, and protection from the
external world. On April 5, both Time and Newsweek featured a photograph
of a Serbian army tank in front of a destroyed house with signs of still
smoldering fires. A Serbian soldier holding a rifle, caught mid-stride
in profile, looks defiantly at the camera. Masculinity and militarism
foreground the threat to private life and to the vulnerable bodies of
the Albanians. The accompa- nying report discusses the invasion of
private homes by paramilitary forces where people were either tortured
or removed from families and then tortured. Domesticity, as the sign of
what is at risk, and hence as the justification for intervention,
locates the Albanians within terms recogniz- able to American audiences.

In [a region such as Kosovo/a, many reasons compel photojournalists to
report on the violence that persists there despite juridical and
humanitar- ian interventions by international agencies like the UN or
military interven- tions like the NATO air strike]{.underline}s. [In
domesticating alterity, however, Ameri- can news coverage of Kosovo/a
relied on conventions of photojournalism]{.underline}, [in particular
the figure of vulnerable white maternity, to depict the human casualties
of violence in the Balkans. News coverage that represents Albanians only
as victims ignores their struggles and experiences while promoting
narratives of Western benevolent support for needy and inno- cent
refugees]{.underline}. Representations of crises outside the United
States, as in this case, are typically mediated through the lens of
national concerns, such as security or economic interests. As Koshy
writes, \"On human rights issues, in particular, the statist perspective
obscures and distorts the perception of the problem and the construction
of the solution . . .\" (1999, 21). Thus, what is at stake in media
coverage is the relationship between how social crises are represented
and how they are managed within a transnational context.

Given this critique of photojournalism, how can photographers main- tain
the moral imperative of political visibility? The challenge of reportage
in this case is made particular acute by the problematics of
representing trauma. How can photographers visualize trauma without
inevitably turning people into spectacles? If photographers attempt to
avoid the spectacle of embodied suffering, what happens if we do not
have an embodied victim to pity?

#### The environment, like femininity, is coded vulnerable and exploitable by the dominant man, which is the root cause of environmental destruction

**Cuomo 16** (Chris, "Sexual Politics in Environmental Ethics: Impacts,
Causes, Alternatives," The Oxford Handbook of Environmental Ethics.
Edited by Stephen M Gardiner and Allen Thompson)

[What matters in bringing attention to such linked harms is that real
harms to bodies---biological bodies, psyches, social bodies/species,
pseudo-bodies (eco-regions), and Earthly bodies (bodies of water or
air)---are multiplied, exacerbated, and intensified through the
collaborative synergies of multiple systems of oppression.]{.underline}
Identifying linked harms points to the need for ethics and politics that
can address those interwoven systems, and integrate considerations of
social justice and environmental ethics at all levels. [Regarding sex
and gender, which are always interwoven with other factors, the "second
class" yet simultaneously exhalted nature of feminity]{.underline} and
what is associated with female biological reproductivity [is a
fundamental feature shaping ideas and relationships in sexist and
nature-harming cultures, as is the identification of masculinity and
superiority with domination and the absence of
vulnerability.]{.underline} A second theme in work focused on matters of
[sex and gender in environmental ethics is the investigation of the
conceptual presuppositions and frameworks, and hence the subtle values,
that inform and enable systems of oppression.]{.underline} Philosophers
and critical historicans have argued that [environmentally destructive
and dismissive value systems reflect meanings and symbolic systems built
on identities and conceptions of nature and nonhuman animals that create
and maintain a general logics of domination]{.underline} (Merchant,
1982; Warren, 1990; Allen, 1992). A guiding theory has been that [nature
and subordinated groups are symbolically associated on the debased side
of western culture's foundational hierarchies]{.underline}. Rather than
being essentialist in an Aristotelian sense, [this analysis emphasizes
the historical material and symbolic associations between women and
nature, and tracks evident patterns in who bears the brunt of the
violence. To say that women and nature have been powerfully linked in
western culture, and that those association have enabled sexist, racist,
colonizing intersecting oppressions and social dominations, is not to
imply that all femaleness is identified with only one cultural
stereotype of what or how nature is, or that all women suffer the same
or similar domination.]{.underline} Different women are symbolically
identified with different aspects or fantasies of nature and
anti-nature, and those associations have distinct repercussions in
exploitative social systems, such as being revered as a natural beauty
or being treated as a beast of burden. And naturalness is a pliable
designation, for masculinities can be associated with certain ideas
about nature and naturalness (physical strength, wildness), and
femininity is also often characterized as a domesticating cultural
force, or an enemy of nature. [What matters for politics and ethics is
not merely that nature and femininity are reductively associated with
each other, but also that the effects of the association are
debilitating and distorting for both. Pernicious cultural and symbolic
connections between women and nature as reproductive, submissive, and
decorative create and maintain divisions of labor that put women in
closer proximity to the material world and symbolically associate
femininity with subjectable naturalness, which can or even ought to be
molded to man's needs or whims.]{.underline} Projected [associations
between "women and nature" and the like propagate subordination and the
potential for victimization, for example by compulsively relegating
females to the work of caring for others. Hierarchical characterizations
of male/female, nature/culture, primitive/civilized are interwoven
systems of exploitation that shape and inform environmental
relationships at every scale.]{.underline} Understanding sex and gender
critically in relation to environmental ethics, and deconstructing the
roles certain conceptions of nature play in propagating social
oppression, complicates one-dimensional ideas about the nature of
environmental problems, and points toward fruitful areas for ethical
development and exploration.

### Militarism/Heg impact

#### Militarism creates endless gender-based violence and sustains masculinity in decision making---war makes women invisible and are constrained by sexual violence

at the University of Texas at Austin, "The Gendered New World Order:
Militarism, Development, and the Environment", 1997,

**[We cannot understand the]{.mark} [new]{.mark} world [order without
examining gender and militarism]{.mark}**. Yet [women's]{.mark}
[invisibility in military affairs and policymaking reflects]{.mark}
taken-for-granted [international]{.mark} assumptions about the
[maleness]{.mark} of war. Even though they are more likely than men to
become war's casualties or refugees, [women have]{.mark} little or [no
say in making military or security decisions.]{.mark}

**[War and militarism become increasingly dangerous with]{.mark}** the
advent of **[new technologies]{.mark}**. The past century has witnessed
the killing of about [104 million people in wars]{.mark}--- more than
three quarters of all war dead recorded since the year 1500 (Hauchler
and Kennedy 1994:183). Most people killed in war are civilians. But
while 50 percent of the casualties in World War II were civilians, in
the 1980s this figure rose to 80 percent, and by 1990 it was a
staggering 90 percent. [Women and children constitute the vast majority
of these civilian war casualties.]{.mark}

**[Women are also most likely to be uprooted by war]{.mark}**; more than
four-fifths of war refugees are women and young girls, who often
experience additional violence during their flight. By the end of 1992
there were more than 46 million people who had lost their homes: about
36 million of these were women and girls. In Africa there were more than
23.6 external and internal refugees; more than 12.6 people fled their
homes in the Middle East and in South and Central Asia. There are two
million displaced persons in Latin America, and about 6 million refugees
in Europe. About 2 million people fled the former Yugoslavia (Hauchler
and Kennedy 1994:185). [While stationed in camps]{.mark} and refugee
settlements, as well as in their new societies f residence, **[women and
girls suffer sexual abuse, abduction, and forced prostitution]{.mark}**.
During World War II the Japanese set up [brothels i]{.mark}n East and
Southern Asia, forcing between 100,000 and 200,000 women into
prostitution. In the former Yugoslavia, thousands of Muslim women have
been [forced into camps and raped]{.mark} by Serbian soldiers. Muslim
and Croat soldiers have also committed mass rapes.

[The continuing **invisibility of women** in war manifests
itself]{.mark}, for example, [in the fact that the widespread use of
wartime rape is still not recognized as a war crime]{.mark} by
international agencies. Violence is routinely used to control womens
sexuality and reproduction. Soviet soldiers raped approximately two
million women in eastern Germany in 1945, and in 1971 Pakistani soldiers
raped more than 200,000 Bengali women in the Bangladesh war o f
independence. One estimate suggests that during the war against Kuwait,
Iraqi troops raped as many as 3,200 women between August 1990 and
February 1991 (Enloe 1994:186). Most recently, in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
**[rape has been used as a weapon]{.mark}** for ethnic cleansing, which
uses attacks on women to humiliate another ethnic group and [**to
inflict genocide**.]{.mark}

## AT: Perm

#### The perm is just the affs attempting to normalize the precarious that the liberal state has pushed to the margins, just like neoliberalism

**[Lorey et al 15]{.underline}**(Lorey, Isabell, et al. , Lorey is a
Queer Studies Professor at the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne, works
for transversal texts, the publication platform of the European
Institute for Progressive Cultural Policies. , "Biopolitical
Governmentality ." State of Insecurity: Government of the Precarious,
Verso, London, 2015, pp. 36--39.) //RB

[Within the framework of its welfare-state paradigm of protection,
liberal governmentality was based on multiple forms of precarity as
inequality through othering: on the one hand, on the unpaid labour of
women in the reproduction area of the private sphere; on the other hand,
on the precarity of all those excluded from the nation-state compromise
between capital and labour - whether as abnormal, foreign or poor - as
well as those living under extreme conditions of exploitation in the
colonies.]{.underline}31 [All those who did not meet the norm and
normalization of the free, sovereign-bourgeois, white subject, along
with his concomitant property relations, and all those who threatened
this norm, were precarized]{.underline}. [Western modernity, along with
its conceptions of sovereignty and biopolitics, is unthinkable without a
'political culturc of danger',34 without the permanent endangerment of
the normal, without imaginary invasions of constant, everyday threats
such as illness, filth, sexuality, criminality or the fear of 'racial'
impurity, which must be immunized against in various
ways.]{.underline}35 The presumed paradox of biopolitical
governmentality is evident here in a further aspect: this mode of
governing makes it possible, as Cornelia Ott has aptly phrased it, 'for
human beings to learn to consider themselves as unique "subjects", while
uniting them at the same time as an amorphous, standardized "population
mass" . .. The reverse side of the "right to life" here is always the
exclusion or destruction of life.'36

[The liberal mode of governing produces precarities as economic, social
and legal relations of inequality through systematic categorizations and
hierarchizations according to 'body' and 'culture]{.underline}'[. In
this sense I use precarity as a structural category of ordering
segmented relations of violence and inequality. This dimension of
structural inequality, however, is missing in Foucault's conception of
governmentality.-]{.underline}37

[Helped by a hierarchizing and discriminating culture of danger, the
contradictions of liberal political economy are reinforced in the
interplay between freedom and security, self-empowerment and
compulsion]{.underline}. As an [immanent contradiction of liberal govern
mentality, precarized deviance has repeatedly distorted and disturbed
the stabilizing dynamics between freedom and security and has frequently
triggered collective counter-behaviour and struggles.]{.underline}

From the nineteenth century on, hegemonic economic modes of
subjectivation and self-government were not practised in
liberal-capitalist societies independently from [social protection
techniques and institutions]{.underline}. The [latter were intended to
reduce social insecurity]{.underline} and keep the risk of unemployment,
illness, accident and social exclusion calculable for an increasing
number of the national population.™ [At the same time, the institutions
of the welfare state did not primarily serve the protection and ecurity
of the workers, but rather supported economically productive
self-government techniques among obedient and cautious
citizens]{.underline},3[\* who ensured themselves and precarized others
simultaneously. This governmental dynamic involves attempts to control
the precariousncss shared among all by stria ting and positioning
dangerous 'others' as the precarious ones at the 'margins'.]{.underline}

I[n neoliberalism the function of the precarious is now shifted to the
middle of society and normalized]{.underline}. [This means that the
function of bourgeois freedom can now also be transformed: away from
dissociation from precarious others and towards a subjectivizing
function in normalized precarization. Whereas the precarity of the
marginalized retains its threatening and dangerous potential,
precarization is transformed in neolibcralism into a normalized
political-economic instrument.]{.underline}

[[Feminisation]{.mark} as [Devalorisation ir scholarship]{.mark},
amongst other scholarship, has always [valued masculine traits above
feminine]{.mark} [ones]{.mark}: [rationality of capability]{.mark} [over
weakness]{.mark} (as well as the rationality of attitude over one
informed by emotion); [sovereignty over
cooperation/dependency]{.mark}]{.underline}.86 Therefore, [the
[discourse]{.mark} [of progress]{.mark} and good governance is not only
[Western-centric but inherently masculinist as
well]{.mark}.]{.underline} [To demonstrate this I will unpack the
feminist understanding of 'feminisation'.]{.underline} [It [is not
enough to think that simply by 'including' women in policies, solutions,
or measurements means that progress is being
made]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [This is the assumption that
Chakrabarty pointed out as a [hypocritical fallacy]{.mark}.
[Instead]{.mark}, a [deeper grasp of what gender is]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[how]{.mark} [it operates as a structure must be understood.]{.mark} The
[declinist literature]{.mark} is not manipulating women's positions but
it is [replicating gender dynamics]{.mark} when it [fails to pay
attention to]{.mark} [certain violence]{.mark}, like structural
violence, sexual and gender-based violence,]{.underline} [and violence
against sexual minorities]{.underline}. Ann Tickner begins her seminal
text on gender and international relations by working through a critique
of how Morgenthau transposes the rational man onto the state. [This has
given mainstream ir scholars the presumption that states are (or ought
to aspire to being) rational, sovereign actors]{.underline}.87 [Yet, as
Tickner points out, [rationality and sovereignty are masculine
attributes.]{.mark}]{.underline}88 In a [[logocentrism, such as the one
that exists in the masculinity-femininity binary, one side is always
valued over another]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Particular masculinities are
valorised--- rational, wealthy, white, heteronormative ones;89 most if
not all femininities are devalorised.]{.underline}]{.mark}

. [The bias towards masculinity is what V. Spike Peterson refers to as
feminisation]{.underline}.90 [Peterson clarifies that [Gender is not
simply an empirical category that refers to embodied men and women and
their material activities but also a systematically analytical category
that refers to constructions of \[privileged\] masculinity and
\[devalorised\] femininity and their ideological
effect]{.mark}s]{.underline} (emphasis true to text).91

She continues by adding that 'the privilege and power attributed
masculine qualities depends on the devalorisation of feminised
qualities' (emphasis true to text).92 [The creation of gendered
hierarchies depend on the 'natural\[isation\], depolitical\[isation\],
legitim\[ated\]...denigration of the feminine, and it is the
feminisation of "others" that link multiple oppressions']{.underline}.93
It is not that the declinist literature intends to oppress---this is
more than likely the opposite of what is desired---but that due to its
devalorisation of particular violences, this is an unexpected outcome.

[[Gender analysis can be used to undo feminisation]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Gender analysis, or utilising a gender lens, means paying attention to
what is socially constructed as masculine or feminine. Gender, like race
or class, determines what is prioritised.94 This analysis acknowledges
that gender shapes more than people, it shapes organizations,
institutions, and states]{.underline}.95 [Some feminists see this as an
apparatus, a la Althusser,96 and others see this a laddering of sorts,
where competing masculinities vie for the hegemonic
position.97]{.underline}

Deprioritised Violences\
[The critique of the implementation of 'feminisation' in unscr 1325 and
development policies is illustrative here. Inst[ead of fundamentally
changing how the structural gender inequalities, these]{.mark} policies
[reified them]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These policies fundamentally
misunderstood what feminists believe gender to be]{.underline}. [[They
see gender as women,]{.mark} as an [operational variable instead of as
the aforementioned way of ordering people, organisations, and
international hierarchies]{.mark}]{.underline}. My fear is that a
[declinist understanding of 'feminisation' mirrors feminism's
'feminisation'. It does so, in the first instance, by minimising, if not
deprioritising, violences that are not combat-related. In the second
instance, by [conflating gender with women and prioritising women's
rights]{.mark}, it [fails]{.mark} to [make actual]{.mark}
[change]{.mark} by challenging the very structures that subordinate
women and other marginalised peoples. By only seeing gender as 'women'
it fails to see gender as a hierarchical structure that organises
international relations98 (both in what is studied and how it is
studied).]{.underline}

When declinist scholarship prioritises the statistical measurement of
certain types of violence, particularly combatant death versus
non-combatant death, it then fails to see other forms. Specifically,
John Gray criticises the declinist thesis for failing to recognise the
deaths that happen under dictatorships or due to structural violence.99
Equally, Jacqui True discusses how the declinist literature fails to
account for and take seriously sexual and genderbased violence.100 This
paper is concerned with how it deals with the rights and empowerment of
marginalised people whose identity lies outside of the gender binary
that declinist's modern Western focus cannot account for.

Feminisation in declinist scholarship is defined by rights, empowerment,
and legal, if not social, recognition of these. Feminisation in feminist
literature is about the deprioritisation of what is seen as the
feminine. Feminisation in declinist literature thankfully takes
individual security seriously, something feminist ir has championed for
decades. [Yet, it only pays attention, seemingly, to certain people's
rights, mainly women in the conflation of women and gender]{.underline}.
This has led to an ignorance of the issues outlined above. Yet, if we
take Hudson's argument in Sex and World Peace or Pinker's 'rights
revolution' argument seriously, it is not just legal rights that matter,
but the personal security of marginalised individuals. [Since gender and
gender identity is not a binary but a fluid and multifaceted spectrum,
just looking at women as an indicator of changing norms or progress does
not work. It is not just that declinist feminisation scholars omit
homosexuality (because Pinker includes homosexuality within his rights
chapter), but [that the rise of women]{.mark} [cannot be a stand in for
gender progress. It has to be the rise of all people that 'fail' to live
up to the hetero-masculine norms.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Among the many insecurities and violences we should then be very alarmed
at includes the ongoing and quite likely rise of violence against the
lgbtq and hiv-affected community in the us, Russia, and elsewhere.101
Even if lgbtqi rights are more secure, particularly in the West, they
are still tenuous. Furthermore, rights, like the legal right to
marriage, says little about social acceptance and being free from mental
and physical harm. In order to illustrate the difference between secured
rights and individual insecurity, the yearly publication of 'The
Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Map of World Laws 2015' by the ilga is
useful.102 The map colour codes each states based upon the strength or
weaknesses of their laws recognizing gay rights. 'Recognition' is shaded
in green---the darkest (highest) green indicates the right to marry or
full recognition of same-sex unions. 'Persecution' is shaded in a
red-scale that fades to yellow. Additional symbols are added to various
countries: an exclamation mark in a triangle indicates 'anti-propaganda
laws'; a question mark in a triangle indicates unenforced death
penalties; and a shield indicates laws that prohibit discrimination.
Finally, a pale citrine colour is used to denote countries without
specific legislation. Dark green states, those that recognize marriage
or the equivalent, include all of North America, Uruguay, Argentina,
Europe, Iceland, and South Africa. Yellow countries with
anti-propaganda, or homophobic or homonegative propaganda towards
non-binary people that encourages discrimination, but without other
legislation persecuting on the basis of sexual orientation is imited to
Russia and Lithuania. Algeria and Nigeria are a pale red but with a
warning of anti-propaganda laws. India, Tanzania, and Guyana are a
mid-tone red as they have laws that could mean imprisonment from 14
years to life for homosexual behaviour. The dark red states include
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, and
Mauritania. Afghanistan and Pakistan have a non-implemented death
penalty whereas Iran's death penalty is carried out by non-state actors.
Therefore, rights for the lgbtqi community are globally unsettled, but
the main focus on 'rights' and particularly the securing of the right to
marry are, in some ways, red herrings as the rights mask the continued
violence against lgbtqi folk.

#### Policy cannot solve because policy changes misunderstand gender = women

[Feminisation as Devalorisation ir scholarship, amongst other
scholarship, has always valued masculine traits above feminine ones:
rationality of capability over weakness (as well as the rationality of
attitude over one informed by emotion); sovereignty over
cooperation/dependency]{.underline}.86 Therefore, [the discourse of
progress and good governance is not only Western-centric but inherently
masculinist as well.]{.underline} [To demonstrate this I will unpack the
feminist understanding of 'feminisation'.]{.underline} [[It is not
enough to think that simply by 'including' women in policies, solutions,
or measurements means that progress is being made]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[This is the assumption that Chakrabarty pointed out as a hypocritical
fallacy. [Instead, a deeper grasp of what gender is and how it operates
as a structure must be understood]{.mark}. The [declinist
literature]{.mark} is not manipulating women's positions but it is
[replicating gender dynamics]{.mark} when it fails to pay attention to
certain violence, like structural violence, sexual and gender-based
violence,]{.underline} [and violence against sexual
minorities]{.underline}. Ann Tickner begins her seminal text on gender
and international relations by working through a critique of how
Morgenthau transposes the rational man onto the state. [This has given
[mainstream ir]{.mark} scholars the [presumption]{.mark} that states are
(or ought to aspire to being) rational, sovereign actors]{.underline}.87
[Yet, as Tickner points out, rationality and sovereignty are masculine
attributes.]{.underline}88 In a [[logocentrism, such as the one that
exists in the masculinity-femininity binary, one side is always valued
over another]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Particular masculinities are
valorised--- rational, wealthy, white, heteronormative ones;89 most if
not all femininities are devalorised.]{.underline}

. [The bias towards masculinity is what V. Spike Peterson refers to as
feminisation]{.underline}.90 [Peterson clarifies that Gender is not
simply an empirical category that refers to embodied men and women and
their material activities but also a systematically analytical category
that refers to constructions of \[privileged\] masculinity and
\[devalorised\] femininity and their ideological effects]{.underline}
(emphasis true to text).91

She continues by adding that 'the privilege and power attributed
masculine qualities depends on the devalorisation of feminised
qualities' (emphasis true to text).92 [The creation of gendered
hierarchies depend on the 'natural\[isation\], depolitical\[isation\],
legitim\[ated\]...denigration of the feminine, and it is the
feminisation of "others" that link multiple oppressions']{.underline}.93
It is not that the declinist literature intends to oppress---this is
more than likely the opposite of what is desired---but that due to its
devalorisation of particular violences, this is an unexpected outcome.

[Gender analysis can be used to undo feminisation]{.underline}. [Gender
analysis, or utilising a gender lens, means paying attention to what is
socially constructed as masculine or feminine. Gender, like race or
class, determines what is prioritised.94 This analysis acknowledges that
gender shapes more than people, it shapes organizations, institutions,
and states]{.underline}.95 [Some feminists see this as an apparatus, a
la Althusser,96 and others see this a laddering of sorts, where
competing masculinities vie for the hegemonic position.97]{.underline}

Deprioritised Violences\
[The critique of the implementation of 'feminisation' in unscr 1325 and
development policies is illustrative here. [Instead of fundamentally
changing how the structural gender inequalities, these policies reified
them]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [These policies fundamentally misunderstood
what feminists believe gender to be]{.underline}. [They see gender as
women, as an operational variable instead of as the aforementioned way
of ordering people, organisations, and international
hierarchies]{.underline}]{.mark}. My fear is that a [declinist
understanding of '[feminisation' mirrors feminism's
'feminisation'.]{.mark} It does so, in the first instance, by
[minimising, if not deprioritising, violences]{.mark} that are not
combat-related. In the second instance, by [conflating gender with women
and prioritising women's rights, it fails to make actual change by
challenging the very structures that subordinate women and other
marginalised peoples. By only seeing gender as 'women' it fails to see
gender as a hierarchical structure that organises i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations98 (both in what is studied and how it is
studied).]{.underline}

When declinist scholarship prioritises the statistical measurement of
certain types of violence, particularly combatant death versus
non-combatant death, it then fails to see other forms. Specifically,
John Gray criticises the declinist thesis for failing to recognise the
deaths that happen under dictatorships or due to structural violence.99
Equally, Jacqui True discusses how the declinist literature fails to
account for and take seriously sexual and genderbased violence.100 This
paper is concerned with how it deals with the rights and empowerment of
marginalised people whose identity lies outside of the gender binary
that declinist's modern Western focus cannot account for.

F[eminisation in declinist scholarship is defined by rights,
empowerment, and legal, if not social, recognition of these.
Feminisation in feminist literature is about the deprioritisation of
what is seen as the feminine. Feminisation in declinist literature
thankfully takes individual security seriously, something feminist ir
has championed for decades]{.underline}. [Yet, it only pays attention,
seemingly, to certain people's rights, mainly women in the conflation of
women and gender]{.underline}. This has led to an ignorance of the
issues outlined above. Yet, if we take Hudson's argument in Sex and
World Peace or Pinker's 'rights revolution' argument seriously, it is
not just legal rights that matter, but the personal security of
marginalised individuals. [Since gender and gender identity is not a
binary but a fluid and multifaceted spectrum, just looking at women as
an indicator of changing norms or progress does not work. It is not just
that declinist feminisation scholars omit homosexuality (because Pinker
includes homosexuality within his rights chapter), but that the rise of
women cannot be a stand in for gender progress. It has to be the rise of
all people that 'fail' to live up to the hetero-masculine
norms.]{.underline}

Among the many insecurities and violences we should then be very alarmed
at includes the ongoing and quite likely rise of violence against the
lgbtq and hiv-affected community in the us, Russia, and elsewhere.101
Even if lgbtqi rights are more secure, particularly in the West, they
are still tenuous. Furthermore, rights, like the legal right to
marriage, says little about social acceptance and being free from mental
and physical harm. In order to illustrate the difference between secured
rights and individual insecurity, the yearly publication of 'The
Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Map of World Laws 2015' by the ilga is
useful.102 The map colour codes each states based upon the strength or
weaknesses of their laws recognizing gay rights. 'Recognition' is shaded
in green---the darkest (highest) green indicates the right to marry or
full recognition of same-sex unions. 'Persecution' is shaded in a
red-scale that fades to yellow. Additional symbols are added to various
countries: an exclamation mark in a triangle indicates 'anti-propaganda
laws'; a question mark in a triangle indicates unenforced death
penalties; and a shield indicates laws that prohibit discrimination.
Finally, a pale citrine colour is used to denote countries without
specific legislation. Dark green states, those that recognize marriage
or the equivalent, include all of North America, Uruguay, Argentina,
Europe, Iceland, and South Africa. Yellow countries with
anti-propaganda, or homophobic or homonegative propaganda towards
non-binary people that encourages discrimination, but without other
legislation persecuting on the basis of sexual orientation is imited to
Russia and Lithuania. Algeria and Nigeria are a pale red but with a
warning of anti-propaganda laws. India, Tanzania, and Guyana are a
mid-tone red as they have laws that could mean imprisonment from 14
years to life for homosexual behaviour. The dark red states include
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, and
Mauritania. Afghanistan and Pakistan have a non-implemented death
penalty whereas Iran's death penalty is carried out by non-state actors.
Therefore, rights for the lgbtqi community are globally unsettled, but
the main focus on 'rights' and particularly the securing of the right to
marry are, in some ways, red herrings as the rights mask the continued
violence against lgbtqi folk.

## Framework

### C/I -- Fem Action Research

#### The counter-interp is to center feminist action research- FAR 

Reid 04, (Colleen Reid, Simon Fraser University, "Advancing Women's
Social Justice Agendas: A Feminist Action Research Framework", published
in IIQM) GP

Participatory research and contemporary feminism share a number of major
underlying features centering on the analysis of political economy and
praxis (Maguire, 1993[). The notion of praxis challenges the
theory-practice relationship and raises problems associated with
value-free science]{.underline}. The term "praxis" originates from the
Greek word prasso meaning "doing" and "acting," in contrast with the
theoretical designs of epistemology; theoria 3 (Audi, 1995). Lal (1996)
refers to pedagogical praxis the erasing of the boundaries between
theory, methodology, and practice, and between field and home (Lal,
1996). Other researchers define praxis as a dialectical process of
collective reflection and action (Israel et al., 1994; Kirby & McKenna,
1989), the joining of theory and action so that each is informed by and
changes through its relation with the other (Ristock & Pennell, 1996),
and the integration of knowing and doing (Kirby & McKenna, 1989). For
praxis to be possible, theory must not only illuminate the lived
experience of social groups, it must also be illuminated by their
struggles (Lather, 1991). [Theory is thought of as experience-based
(Park, 2001), and reflection itself is embedded in praxis, not separate
from it]{.underline}. Action upon reality and analyses of that learning
may change awareness of the nature of problems and the sources of
oppression (Gaventa & Cornwall, 2001). [The processes of uncovering
marginalized knowledges, giving priority to these knowledges, and
enabling the collaborative development of action strategies are
simultaneously theoretical and methodological. Woven within and between
each of the following characteristics of a FAR framework is the notion
of praxis theory]{.underline}, methods, and practice in dynamic
interplay. A Feminist Action Research framework FAR guidingPrinciples
[Through integrating participatory research with feminist theory and
research, the following guiding principles for FAR emerged: inclusion,
participation, action, social change, and researcher
reflexivity]{.underline}. Inclusion The first principle of feminist
action research is inclusion. To include is to cause to be a part of
something, to consider with, or to put into a group (Morris, 1982).
Feminist action researchers contend that no social practices or
activities should be excluded as improper subjects for public
discussion, expression, or collective choice; no one should be forced
into privacy (Young, 1990). [Gender and women‟s daily experiences are
central in the construction of theoretical frameworks]{.underline} and
feminist action research methods. [Women‟s experiences are central in
several ways in understanding patriarchy as a system of domination and
oppression]{.underline}, in identifying key issues and questions in all
phases of the research process including action and evaluation, and in
giving explicit attention to how women and men as groups benefit from
the project.4 [Feminist action researchers expose the inadequacy of
androcentric research and its partial, inaccurate, and incomplete
representation of human experience when women are muted]{.underline}
(Maguire, 2001). By beginning with the experiences and research needs of
women who have traditionally been silenced, the process of knowledge
production is transformed and the ideological power base is challenged
(Kirby & McKenna, 1989). Feminist action researchers seek to connect the
articulated, contextualized personal with the often hidden or invisible
structural and social institutions that define and shape our lives.
Feminist action researchers attempt to make possible the development of
strategies and programs based on real life experience rather than
theories or assumptions, providing an analysis of issues based on a
description of how women actually experience those issues (Barnsley &
Ellis, 1992). Participation Inclusion is a precursor to the second
principle of feminist action research participation[. To participate is
"to take part, join, or share with others"]{.underline} (Morris, 1982).
Feminist action researchers are committed to making women‟s voices more
audible and facilitating women‟s empowerment through "ordinary talk"
(Maguire, 2001).

### Discussing precarity good

#### Precarity needs to explored in the debate space to search for common notions and go against the logic of security

[The Precarias']{.underline} [derive inscribes]{.underline} [itself in
the tradition of '[militant research']{.mark}]{.underline}, [[generating
'minor knowledge forms']{.mark} for the purpose of self-organization.
This practice refers back to the idea of co-research associated with the
Italian workers' movement of the 1970s, as well as to practices of
consciousness-raising deriving from second-wave feminism]{.underline}.4
[Starting from their own precarized existences, in their encounters and
affections with other precarious they seek to break through the
isolation and individualization of post-Fordist living and working
conditions]{.underline}.5 [They traverse not only places of work,
residence, shopping and meeting, places of sexuality and of transport,
but also the different modes of subjectivation involved]{.underline}.
[The [Precarias a la deriva start]{.mark},]{.underline} first of all[,
[from their own different experiences of precarity and precarization, in
order to enable a common orientation with others in the
derives]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This [orientation is not directed to a
goal]{.mark}, but emerges in practice]{.underline}. [In the [derive they
pass through social spaces and explore the conditions of precarized
everyday life]{.mark}, in order to find out, firs[t of all, what a
common struggle against precarity and precarization might
mean]{.mark}]{.underline}.6 [As [they start from the presupposition that
the precarious goes far beyond the realm of work and covers the whole of
existence, there is no search for a common identity that would conjoin
everyone into a unity. Instead, the Precarias are interested in
inventing 'common notions]{.mark}' in Spinoza's sense]{.underline}.7
Such [notions are formed by way of the affective connections of
bodies]{.underline}, [through what they have in common in their mutual
affections.]{.underline} [[Common notions arise]{.mark} [through]{.mark}
actualizing that 'which is common to and a property of the human body
and such other bodies as are wont to affect the human body\\s [Developed
in encounters with others, in exchanges with them]{.mark}, both the
multiplicity and the singularities of existence manifest themselves in
common notions.]{.underline}

Similarly to Butler, the [[Precarias also argue against traditions of
thinking that refuse our fundamental social relationality, warn against
infection by others, maintain a logic of individualism and
security]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and [thus perceive precarization solely
as a threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They contrast this kind of social and
political logic with a 'logic of care'/ situating the term
'reproduction' and the multiplicity of care activities associated with
it in the context of post-Fordist production conditions]{.underline},
[and taking into consideration the new forms of communicative knowledge
and affect work]{.underline}. In their militant research the Precarias
focus not only on housework, nursing, child-raising and education, but
also on work in call centres and sex work.10 [Enhancing the status of
these care activities enables alternative political responses to current
problems]{.underline}, which the interminable reformulations of the
logic of threat and security are not capable of providing. Contrary to
the tradition of the political of a 'care community', a cuidadania.\'11

### K2 politics

#### FW - Realism's relationship to gender is problematic and a feminist analysis is crucial to understand conflict

**[Sjoberg 2013]{.underline}** (Laura Sjoberg, Professor of Political
Science at U Florida. *Gendering Global Conflict: Toward a Feminist
Theory of War* (Print Book)) CL

- This card is basically just a better version of the previous one but
  I'm gonna keep the old one there in case anyone wants it

This is not to say that mainstream war studies has never paid any
attention to gender, or that gender has been completely absent from
critical theorists' work on war and conflict. It is, instead, to make
two distinct (and hopefully more modest) claims. [The first is that, to
the extent that [gender]{.mark} has been taken up in war theorizing, it
[remains peripheral and has not become a central part of research
programs outside feminist security studies considering]{.mark} the
nature, constitution, causes, and consequences of [war]{.mark}(s).326
The second is that, to the extent that mainstream studies of war have
considered gender, they have actually been largely talking about a
partial and limited idea of gender that involves women as a biological
sex being imbued with characteristics gendered feminine for the purpose
of analyzing war.]{.underline}327 This second claim will be discussed in
more detail in chapter 2, when I lay out this book's feminist approaches
to studying war ontologically, epistemologically, and methodologically.
For now, it is the first claim---[that [gender theorizing remains absent
from]{.mark} (and when not absent from, marginal to) both
[mainstream]{.mark} and critical [war
theorizing]{.mark}]{.underline}---that lays the foundation for this
book's work. In the remainder of the text, I seek to analyze and
problematize "genderless" war studies. In calling war studies
genderless, I am not implying that it is somehow gender neutral or
without gender implications. Quite the opposite, [I am arguing that [it
is impossible to think about war well without gender analysis
and]{.mark} that [doing so obscures the]{.mark} empirical operation of
and normative [consequences of gender in the nature, causes,
performances of, and consequences of war]{.mark}(s). [Gender is
necessary]{.mark}, conceptually, [to understanding the nature of
war]{.mark}(s); empirically, to [understanding wars' causes and
consequences]{.mark}; ethically, [to understanding its implications;
and]{.mark} prescriptively, [to understanding how to stop
wars.]{.mark}]{.underline} Gender does "analytical and normative work"
and serves as a "resource for thought" in almost every aspect of how we
fight wars and how we read them.328 War, wars, and the study of both are
fundamentally (if not unalterably) gendered and, therefore, feminist
theorizing about war is not only a part of, but a crucial piece of, the
war puzzle.329 Feminist theory "raises the question of what kind of
politics and theory would be possible without the work accomplished by
gendered logics" in war theorizing.330 [Also, when I call [war
studies]{.mark} genderless, I am not arguing that the work I outlined in
this chapter does not have a [relationship with gender
theorizing]{.mark}---I am arguing that its relationship is (normatively
and empirically) [negative, problematic, and
untenable]{.mark}.]{.underline} These relationships between gender
theorizing and security or war studies have variously been called
"impossible,"331 "awkward,"332 "uneasy"333 "limited,"334 and akin to
"exile."335 While (many in) IR generally and security studies
specifically have conceded that feminist scholarship may exist at the
margins, [gender analysis "does not simply 'add' gender to an unchanged
object of study, but... force\[s\] a more radical rethinking of what
properly constitutes I/international R/relations to begin with,
transforming the boundaries and conceptual basis."]{.underline}336 This
work starts with the feminist analysis of and deconstruction of war
theorizing. It requires showing the gendered nature of that theorizing,
of the meaning, causes, and consequences of war(s) at each level of
analysis.

# Fem IR Supplement -- AFF

### Alt fails---Ivory Tower

#### The oxymoronic act of reading their K in the debate space dooms the alt.

**[Stern and Towns 22]{.underline}**, \[Maria Stern, Ann E. Towns,
"Feminist IR in Europe: Knowledge Production in Academic Institutions,"
<https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-91999-3>, 2022\] Mr.Mr.

[[Scholars' geographical locations matter]{.mark} for a number of
reasons to do with the politics of knowledge (some of which are
discussed above), and they also matter [because they can shape the types
of research that is possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[While in some
locations]{.mark} (e.g. in Hungary) [it may be impossible to conduct
feminist research in an academic institution at all]{.mark}, [practical
issues in other locations---such as the priorities and methodological
biases of funding bodies, the relative permissiveness of risk assessment
regimes, and the possibility of getting research access into military
institutions---all shape what types of feminist research are
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. This likely plays out in different ways
across Europe, but I offer a couple of examples from the UK here
because, given that most scholars are located in the UK, this likely has
the most significant impact on the field as a whole. The most immediate
point here is that the concentration of scholars in the UK leads to an
disproportionate focus in the literature on the UK military, but there
are also more subtle factors at play. Many UK institutions have cautious
travel risk assessment policies that somewhat simplistically (and
influenced by a colonial mindset) divide the world into 'low risk' and
'high risk,' or even 'hostile' locations. Anecdotally, this may result
in researchers being denied permission to carry out fieldwork in certain
locations in a way that would not happen, for example, in Sweden, where
universities do not seem to follow restrictive travel risk assessment
regimes. Similarly, the quantity of scholarship that does exist on the
British military perhaps masks the often difficult processes required to
gain approval to conduct research with members of the institution
itself, which particularly constrain research that is interpretive,
critical, and/or feminist. [[The]{.mark} power and [biases of military
gatekeepers]{.mark} in the British context [have doubtless prevented
and]{.mark}/or [reshaped feminist research that would otherwise have
been conducted]{.mark}]{.underline} (Basham and Catignani 2021). It is
not possible, of course, to conduct a review of literature not published
and research 2 DISPARITIES AND DIVERSIFICATION ... 25 not carried out.
[However, the point I want to make here is that [it is not only
intellectual interest that drives how feminist scholars]{.mark} in
Europe [select the focus of their research]{.mark}, [it is also
political economic realities and the constraints of]{.mark} requiring
various forms of [institutional permission]{.mark}. [These]{.mark}
[realities shape the body of feminist literature on]{.mark} war and
[militarism that is produced across Europe in powerful,]{.mark} if

### Turn---Gendered politics check bioweapons

#### Gender politics deter use of bioweapons -- patriarchal militaries don't want to use "feminine" weapons.

**[Cecire 9]{.underline}**, \[Ruth Cecire, "Bioweapons: Postmodern
Ruminations on a Premodern Modality,"

[The feminine/masculine divide is a (or perhaps \"the\") critical
hermeneutic through which each society constructs experience, assigns
meaning, and asserts its basic values.]{.underline} Bridging the
essentialist/constructionist rift, I would argue that this divide is
informed by a conflation of biological difference and cultural
representation. [It is my contention that **[bioweapons have
been]{.mark} disdained and [ostensibly banned]{.mark}, at least in part,
[because they are]{.mark} largely [gendered female]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}, hence, [do not serve the fantasies]{.mark} and ends [of
the patriarchal war system]{.mark}; their semi-androgynous amalgam of
science and disease fuels and substantiates extant culture and gender
wars. As instruments of terror for the aforementioned
\"disenfranchised\" nations and groups, [they connote the mythical
\"furies\" of \"disempowered\" female rage.]{.mark} [That is not to say
that bioweapons will never be employed]{.mark} by First World powers
[but]{.mark}, [rather]{.mark}, that [gendered perceptions shape their
geopolitical status and deter potential use.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### A2 Hypermasculine Warmaking (Sjoberg)

#### The hypermasculine war-making thesis lacks predictive and explanatory power. Sjoberg also engages with the "mainstream" in her analysis, which proves that traditional IR is both unavoidable and necessary in feminist theorizing -- the perm! Plus, she excludes non-binary people from the discussion of gender IR theory.

**[Prugl 14]{.underline}** \[Elisabeth Prügl is Professor of
International Relations/ Political Science at the Graduate Institute of
International and Development Studies, Geneva, Perspectives on Politics
, Volume 12 , Issue 1 , March 2014 , pp. 176 - 177 DOI:
<https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713003460>\] Mr.Mr.

I am sympathetic to Sjoberg's agenda. [Like her, I believe that [there
is no credible way for fem]{.mark}inist [IR to develop knowledge on war
without engaging nonfeminist literatures]{.mark} on the topic. [We may
want to disavow the mainstream, but it does not allow itself to be
ignored]{.mark} and invariably pops up in our topics,]{.underline}
framings, and contestations. Because there is no pure feminist location
outside previously existing knowledge, the long-standing debate among IR
feminists over whether one should engage with the mainstream or not is
beside the point. The question should be instead: What are the terms of
engagement and who gets the home field advantage? And on this point [I
become uneasy with [Sjoberg's]{.mark} method; her [dialogical approach
does not sufficiently recognize the power relations that underlie her
engagement with war studies]{.mark}. The author gives the home field
advantage to the other team: [She seeks an engagement on a playing
field]{.mark} mapped by levels of analysis and structuralism, in a game
fo[llowing the rules of positivism and rationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}.
But she is ambivalent about this. In the course of her dialogue, she
sometimes plays by the rules but more often than not seeks to change
them---a dialogue with feminism cannot be con- fined to positivism and
rationalism. Not an easy way to win! [[Her decision to proceed from
mainstream rather than feminist literature compounds the
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}. Both the mainstream ("studies of war") and
the margin ("feminisms") are introduced as diverse. [Yet whereas the
former is invited to play with well-coordinated teams and mature
theories (structural realism, decision-making theories, dyadic theories,
domestic politics approaches), the latter is presented as an assortment
of seemingly disjointed ideas that are deployed on individual missions
to rattle the mainstream.]{.underline} [Feminisms do not seem to be
amenable to team formation; feminisms apparently are good only for
critique]{.underline}. Sjoberg is in good company with this approach:
Poststructuralist feminists in IR are similarly wary of categorizing
thought. [But [the approach]{.mark} systematically [prevents]{.mark} a
[serious engagement between existing bodies of feminist war
theorizing]{.mark}, [hiding the complexity of fem]{.mark}inist
contributions [to an understanding of war]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
example, Betty Reardon, Valerie Hudson and her co-authors, Cynthia
Cockburn, Dubravka Zarkov, and many others have put forward
significantly different theories on war and gender that could be
discussed against one another. Sjoberg cites them all, but does not
start from this literature. She forgoes an opportunity to valorize it by
weighing its merits and developing it, including with tools eclectically
drawn from war studies. Instead, she recreates the role of the feminist
underdog barking bits of critique at the mainstream and admonishing it
that it should be doing better. Alternatively, it seems to me, there are
spaces between the mainstream and the margins that could have been more
hospitable points of departure. They pop up in the book in the persons
of women who do not fit: Lene Hansen, presumably a member of the
Copenhagen School but also its feminist critic; Mary Caprioli,
identified as a liberal peace theorist but also its feminist critic. By
playing on more than one team, do these scholars, and their work, not
offer an engagement on a more equal playing field? And could not have
critical security studies, constructivism, and poststructuralism
provided a setting for dialogue in which rules of engagement are more
welcoming to feminist ideas? Indeed, feminists have contributed to these
approaches. The book unfortunately dispenses with them in a few short
pages. One of the dangers of unmooring feminism from itself and from
other critical approaches is that its insights become molded so as to be
all things to all approaches. In the process, [its core propositions get
flattened so they can adjust to other theoretical axioms. This is the
case here with regard to gender,]{.underline} arguably feminism's core
analytical concept. [Sjoberg develops a "realist feminism," proposing
that gender hierarchy is a structural feature of the international
system]{.underline} and a permissive cause of war, in addition to or
substituting for anarchy (p. 98). In this approach, gender becomes
"genders" (pp. 76 ff), that is, the categories women and men, and gender
hierarchy an organizational attribute of states. [[What is lost is
gender as a relational concept and as an analytical category, the usages
preferred by many feminists]{.underline}]{.mark}. Casting aside feminist
debates about the sense and nonsense of structuralist theories of
patriarchy, [[Sjoberg resurrects]{.mark} them under the mantle of
[gendering neorealism]{.mark}.]{.underline} In her dialogue between
unequals, gender yields to the theoretical axioms of the mainstream.
[Another casualty of this dialogue between unequals is the explanatory
status of masculinity, which has become somewhat contested in feminist
IR. In Sjoberg's hands, hegemonic masculinity freezes into a predictive
variable]{.underline}. [She hypothesizes that "the more competitive a
state's hegemonic masculinity, the more likely that state is to make
war.]{.underline} . . . States with elements of hypermasculinity in the
nationalist discourse would be expected to be more aggressive" (p. 100).
[We are left to guess why masculinities always seem to be (more or less)
competitive, what hypermasculinity consists of, and how its
characteristics can be known in advance]{.underline}. Despite the
feminist truism that gender (and thus masculinity) is a social
construct, pro- fessed also by Sjoberg, [[she seems]{.mark} [to imply
that]{.mark} too much masculinity somehow brings about war. That is,
[masculinities always seem to be already tainted with militarism]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} aggression, suggesting [some masculine core that no amount
of social construction can overcome]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps it is
overdrawn to assign responsibility for this confusion to a dialogue
between unequals in which gender is reformu- lated to fit positivist
epistemologies; however, [a targeted engagement with feminist
literatures on militarist masculinities might have prevented this
mistake.]{.underline}

The now substantial literature on the topic describes feminist research
as "passionate, scrappy, energizing" (Garko 1999, 167) and also as
contradictory, controversial, revolutionary, dynamic, problematic,
oxymoronic, explosive, and filled with creative tension. Deborah L.
Tolman and Laura A. Szalacha refer to "epistemological unrest" (1999,
10). Michelle Fine and Susan Gordon describe feminist psychology as an
inherent contradiction, pointing out that psychological laboratory
studies, with their isolation, sterility, and lack of relationships, are
designed to "drive women mad" (1992, 11). Elizabeth Merrick (1999)
describes her complex feminist reanalysis of data on teen pregnancy as
"like chewing gravel." There is agreement in the literature that
[traditional methods need feminist-inspired interruption]{.underline}
(Harding 1987). Indeed, Ellen [Scott and]{.underline} Bindi
[Shah]{.underline} (1993, 99) [cite]{.underline} Beatriz
[Pesquera]{.underline} as [[wondering]{.underline} [if "we can develop
empowering methodologies]{.underline} [without examining the whole
process]{.underline}]{.mark} [of academic production]{.underline}
[within the university]{.underline}." Certainly we have accomplished one
goal of this article, that is, to capture the contradictory, emergent,
and potentially revolutionary nature of feminist research as it is
practiced. Backstage, inside-story accounts of research in progress have
been contributing to improving methodologies at least since Julius A.
Roth's "Hired Hands Research" (1966). Feminist research is especially
known for its reflectivity. It is not surprising, then, that there is a
substantial literature of case studies of feminist research projects.16
Indeed, there is so much that Jane Ussher (1999) asks if feminist
researchers are obsessed with methods. A second purpose of this article
is to contribute to this literature. [[Our focus is]{.underline}]{.mark}
specifically [on]{.underline} [[feminist]{.mark}
[empiricism]{.mark}]{.underline}, something described in the literature
as in transition and controversial even (or primarily) among feminists.
See, for example, Sandra Harding's (1993) detailed comparison between
the feminist standpoint, on the one hand, and prefeminist and
spontaneous feminist empiricist epistemologies, on the other; Richmond
Campbell's (1994) model of internal feminist empiricism; Helen Longino's
(1993) philosophical model of contextual empiricism; and Lynn Hankinson
Nelson's (1990, 1993) naturalized empiricism. Thus, [juxtaposing our
reflective thoughts on feminist empirical work with writings by
theorists and philosophers on the topic should be
informative]{.underline}. Not surprisingly, we do not exactly fit any
one description of feminist empiricism---not completely and not yet
anyway. Certainly we recognize what Harding (1993) calls spontaneous
feminist empiricism in the earliest stages of this project. But our
thinking quickly became unstable, transitioning across different
feminist approaches.17 [To contribute to current discussion and debate
around feminist empiricism,]{.underline} how it is practiced, and how it
is transitioning, [we present a few close-to-the-ground conclusions
based on this particular research experience]{.underline}. As stated
earlier, [we recognized]{.underline}, perhaps agonizingly, that [our
[feminist thinking had outpaced]{.mark} [available]{.mark} methods and
[strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}. This was most obvious in efforts to
measure feminist consciousness when we realized that it was impossible
to capture conceptual complexities and refinements in a few or even a
series of survey questions. We also realized that to generate useful
data and capture the thinking of our respondents, we had to abandon our
own constructs and temporarily adopt our respondents' points of view. We
saw the same pattern---that our feminist thinking had outpaced our
empiricist approach---with respect to understanding salary differences
between male and female faculty. We began with an effort to explain
(away) via regression analyses the gendered gap in salaries at this
university[. We ended with critical questions about the larger social
structure and culture]{.underline}---questions that are unanswerable
within regression-mode thinking. The questions that emerge when one
attempts a deeper---behind the numbers---understanding of this pattern
relate to the division of labor by sex. That is, answers to questions
about salary differences are found in patterns of sex segregation by
academic discipline and likely by associated patterns of work
distribution (research, teaching, and service) across and within
disciplines. These in turn are patterns that reflect the larger societal
division of labor by sex. It is interesting that these kinds of
substantive questions begin to approach those that constitute starting
points for feminist standpoint theory. We cite, for example, Harding's
description of Dorothy Smith's questions about women's work that are
generated by a strategy of grounding knowledge in women's everyday
experience: "She \[Smith\] points out that if we start thinking from
women's lives, we (anyone) can see that women are assigned the work that
men do not want to do for themselves" (Harding 1993, 53). We come to a
similar conclusion---that [our feminist work developed similarities to
standpoint and postmodern]{.underline} approaches---from our experience
of dual vision. That is, as we shifted between views of the university
from central and from marginal social locations, from both the inside
and the underside, we experienced firsthand the multivocal and complex
nature of the realities we were studying. In other words, [this process
erased, eroded, and undermined any semblance of the monologic voice that
usually underlies and characterizes prefeminist empiricism]{.underline}
[and much of feminist empiricism]{.underline}. Does it matter what we
call our practice of feminist research? [Does it matter whether what we
have described is contextual]{.underline} (Longino 1993),
[spontaneous]{.underline} (Harding 1993), [positivist]{.underline},
[internal]{.underline} (Campbell 1994), [or]{.underline}
[naturalized]{.underline} feminist empiricism (Nelson 1990, 1993)? It
does insofar as feminist empiricism is still emerging and this work can
be seen as part of the transition toward delineating an effective,
successful, and transforming version of feminist research. [[As a
feminist project]{.mark} whose researchers are cognizant of the variety
of feminist alternatives]{.underline}, [[it has descriptive and]{.mark}
thus [epistemological value]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [As
a]{.underline}]{.mark}[n actual [project against which]{.mark} primarily
[theoretical work can be compared, its value is in]{.mark} its [very
doing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why confessions? [[This]{.mark} account
[feels]{.mark} [confessional]{.mark}]{.underline} [[i]{.mark}n the sense
that [alternatives]{.mark} to feminist
empiricism]{.underline}---[standpoint and postmodern
feminism]{.underline}---[[seem more cutting edge because they are more
deliberately critical]{.mark} of]{.underline} [traditional ways of
producing knowledge]{.underline}. [We felt apologetic for continually
falling back on known empiricist strategies when we were thinking more
radically and aware of being constrained methodologically. [This
is]{.mark} an [odd]{.mark} stance to take]{.underline}, though, [[since
feminist empiricism has been revolutionary]{.underline} [in its
contribution to women's]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[liberation]{.underline}]{.mark}, and, as Francesca Cancian (1996) and
Longino (1993) point out, [[despite]{.mark} much [writing about]{.mark}
creating [innovative]{.mark} [methods]{.mark}]{.underline}, [most
[feminist work revises mainstream methodologie]{.mark}s]{.underline}.
(An oft-repeated theme in the literature is that [[feminism is not in
the methods]{.mark} per se [but in their use]{.mark}]{.underline}.)
[Postmodern thinking]{.underline} in particular is often more
exhilarating and challenging theoretically, yet insofar as it [[rejects
grand theory]{.underline}]{.mark}, [large-scale models, and]{.underline}
indeed any kind of [generalization]{.underline}, it [[poses]{.mark}
almost [irresolvable empirical challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our
theme that [feminist empiricism is outgrowing its traditional methods is
worth pursuing through further analysis of specific research projects
such as the one we describe]{.underline}. For now, we continue to
stretch and expand the research paradigm with which we began.

### Perm

#### Perm do both - IR is [not over-determined by gender]{.underline} -- their scholarship creates [new biases]{.underline} without disrupting masculinity -- we'll win [even under their framework]{.underline}

Methodology: A Critical Analysis", International Studies Review, 42(1),

Mr.Mr.

The derision with which many conventional feminists view feminist
quantitative studies persists to the detriment of both feminist and
other types of IR scholarship. As Jan Jindy Pettman (2002) has argued,
however, no single feminist position exists in international relations.
One of the most common feminist critiques of feminist quantitative
research is that scholars cannot simply \"add gender and stir\"
(Peterson 2002;Steans2003), for gender is not just one of many
variables. Yet, [[gender is one of many variables when we are discussing
international issues]{.underline}]{.mark}, from human rights to war. As
Fred Halliday (1988) has observed, [[gender is not the core of
international relations or the key to understanding
it]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Such a position would grossly overstate the
feminist case]{.mark}. [Gender may be]{.mark} an [important]{.mark}
explanatory and predictive component [but it certainly is not the only
one]{.mark}]{.underline}.260 Such a critique only serves to undermine
the feminist argument against a scientific methodology for the social
sciences by questioning the scholarship of those who employ quantitative
methodologies. [One does not pull variables \"out of the air\" to put
into a model]{.underline}, thereby \"[adding and
stirring]{.underline}.\" Variables are added to models if a theoretical
justification for doing so exists. Peterson (2002:158) postulates that
\"as long as IR understands gender only as an empirical category (for
example, how do women in the military affect the conduct of war?),
feminisms appear largely irrelevant to the discipline\'s primary
questions and inquiry.\" Yet, little evidence actually supports this
contention---unless one is arguing that gender is the only important
category of analysis. [If researchers cannot add gender to an analysis,
then they must necessarily use a purely female-centered analysis, even
though the utility of using a purely [female- centered analysis]{.mark}
[seems equally biased]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Such research
would]{.mark} merely [be gender-centric]{.mark} based on women rather
than men, and it would thereby provide an equally biased
account]{.underline} of international relations [as those that are
male-centric.]{.underline} Although one might speculate that having
research done from the two opposing worldviews might more fully explain
international relations, surely an integrated approach would offer a
more comprehensive analysis of world affairs. Beyond a female-centric
analysis, some scholars (for example, Carver 2002) argue that feminist
research must offer a critique of gender as a set of power relations.
Gender categories, however, do exist and have very real implications for
individuals, social relations, and international affairs.
[[Critiquing]{.mark} the social construction of [gender]{.mark} is
important, but it [fails to provide new theories]{.mark} [of
i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations [or to address the implications
of gender]{.mark} for what happens in the world]{.underline}. Sylvester
(2002a) has wondered aloud whether feminist research should be focused
primarily on critique, warning that [[feminists should avoid an
exclusive focus on highlighting anomalies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [for
such a focus does not add to feminist IR theories.]{.underline}

#### Our methods are compatible

The International Studies Encyclopedia, ed. Robert A. Denemark\]

We acknowledge the important role played by some IR feminists in
critiquing/expanding security studies to be more inclusive of women\'s
needs. But it is also true that deploying gender as a variable and a
category of analysis has contributed important insights to security
studies, which must be taken seriously by security studies scholars not
only for feminist reasons, but because security scholars -- and policy
makers -- miss much of what is going on by ignoring gender. **[[We
reject the claim]{.mark} that [IR feminist approaches require
non-quantitative methods or a critical]{.mark} theoretical
[epistemology]{.mark}, a claim which has in the past been reified both
by IR feminists]{.underline}** (Tickner 2005) and by those writing
within the IR mainstream (e.g., Carpenter 2003). **[As Mary Caprioli has
argued, much [quantitative work is also relevant]{.mark} to feminist
questions]{.underline}** (Caprioli 2004). We agree with Robert Keohane
(1989) that gender as a category of analysis can contribute something to
IR as conventionally defined, and it is this contribution which we
explore in this essay. In our view, **[[seeking to integrate
gender]{.mark} more fully [into]{.mark} the discipline of [security
studies serves to validate]{.mark} the empirical [insights]{.mark}
yielded [by]{.mark} many [feminist]{.mark} IR [scholars]{.mark} by
[taking them seriously within the mainstream]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
While methodologies and specification of explanans and explanandum may
differ from the work cited above, **[[such analysis can]{.mark} indeed
[be consistent with "rethinking security on feminist grounds]{.mark}."
By drawing on empirical insights from gender theory, while speaking to
the major concerns of international security studies]{.underline}** as a
discipline, the **[literature on gender and security can speak to both
IR feminists and security studies scholars]{.underline}**. In this
essay, we will concentrate on what this literature can say to mainstream
security studies, whose primary concerns are, following Walt: "the
conditions that make the use of force more likely, the ways that the use
of force affects individuals, states and societies, and the specific
policies that states adopt in order to prepare for, prevent, or engage
in war (1991:212). **[Taking a gender perspective [need not entail a
rejection of conventional]{.mark} concepts, [methodologies]{.mark}, or
questions that define the discipline.]{.underline}** Unlike the critical
feminist scholarship, which is skeptical of conventional methodologies,
this literature review includes a range of **[empirical scholarship on
gender,]{.underline}** whether qualitative or quantitative, positivist
or constructivist, that **[make a meaningful contribution to security
studies]{.underline}**.

### Essentialism-ish

#### The kritik's framing of women as victims steals female power -- turns the K.

**[Stringer 2k,]{.underline}** \[Rebecca, "'A Nietzschean Breed':
Feminism, Victimology, Ressentiment," Why Nietzsche Still? Reflections
on Drama, Culture, Politics. Pg. 249-251\] Mr.Mr.

[[There is nothing wrong with identifying one's
victimization]{.mark}.]{.underline} The act is critical. [[There is a
lot wrong with moding it into an identity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Naomi
Wolf, Fire with Fire. Feminist debate about victimology is not new, but
its appearance in the feminist popular press is. That discourse about
feminist victimology has attracted substantial contributions from
popular press feminists is an indication of this discourse's
significance to feminism's appeal as a social movement, indeed to
feminism's "marketability" as a cultural formation. For these
contributions aim precisely to revitalize feminism's appeal, to rewire
its "marketing strategy," in order to overcome the "alienation" of
"ordinary" women from feminism that, they argue, victimology has brought
into effect. Although Denfeld, Wolf, and Roiphe have been vocal about
their disagreements with one another, their accounts of "the victim
problem in current feminism" have more substantive similarities than
differences, with Wolf having produced the most generous and systematic
account. The manner in which they deal with victim feminism follows the
same line, and both Denfeld and Wolf exhibit the same desire to cure
feminism of victimology and charge inexorably toward an alternative.
What, then, is [[feminist victimology]{.underline}]{.mark}, or victim
feminism? It [[can be understood]{.underline}]{.mark} in general terms
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} an attitude fueled by [[the belief that women
are victims of power, where power is understood]{.underline}]{.mark}
exclusively [[as man's capacity to dominate]{.underline}]{.mark} -- a
capacity [given a fixed and central place in a social order]{.underline}
(patriarchy) [that fosters its systematic and repeated
expression]{.underline}. In short, and to exemplify, [[relations between
the sexes are understood as "a system of sexism]{.mark} in which men as
a group have access to power and privilege that women do not have." This
understanding of the sexed distribution of power is posited as an
exhaustive account of the power]{.underline} and, as such, breathes life
into an elaborate feminist morality. Feminist victimology is, on all
accounts, a morally righteous kind of feminism. [[The experience of
powerlessness (women's experience, whether they "realize" it or
not]{.mark})]{.underline}, as the inverse and opposite of power, [[is
the]{.mark} raw [material from which the]{.mark} injurious [effects of
domination can be tabled]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Wolf writes, [[victim
feminism proffers]{.underline}]{.mark} definitive judgment on good and
evil with reference to sexual difference and thereby "[[casts women
themselves as good and men themselves as wrong]{.mark}."]{.underline} A
mantle of virtue is bestowed on women and their distinctive ways of
doing things, on account of their radical subjection to power, while men
"as a group" take on the suits of evil as they are cast as the source of
harm. Under the auspice of victim feminism, resistance to domination
begins with the process of articulating and tabling its effects to
produce an undistorted view of how domination really works, where the
responsibility for it really lies, and who stands outside of it -- who
can, at the end of the day, be evacuated to a position that is, morally
speaking, "above" domination and outside of power. Wolf's criticism of
[[situating feminism's constituency outside of
power]{.underline}]{.mark} is that it ["[urges women to identify with
powerlessness]{.mark}]{.underline} even at the expense of taking
responsibility for the power they do possess." It follows from this that
[adherents]{.underline} to a victimological line of thinking [[would
avoid registering the]{.underline}]{.mark} figure of the consciously and
deliberately [[powerful woman]{.mark} -- who is not, and does not desire
to be, above or outside of power -- much less the workings of power
within its own auspice.]{.underline} The possibility that women and
feminists might themselves practice and participate in domination, that
not all men have or use the capacity to dominate, that power expresses
itself in forms other than domination, is rendered unthinkable if power
is conflated with male domination. This much is noted by Denfeld, who
argues that [[victimology makes]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[women's
conscious participation in "racism, sexism, and
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}" at most invisible and at least
[[excusable]{.underline}]{.mark}. For Denfeld, under the auspice of
victim feminism [women are cast not only as victims but also as
dupes]{.underline}. This casting serves a dual purpose. First, some
[wome[n's participation in]{.mark} regimes of [domination can be excused
as "manipulated by]{.mark} negative [male ideas]{.mark}." Second,
anointing patriarchy with great [powers of deception is an effective
means of defending feminism]{.mark}]{.underline} against negative
criticism. Denfeld writes, [[If you don't agree with]{.mark} current
[feminists about the enemy, that's only another sign that he
exists]{.mark}."]{.underline} Victimology, on Denfeld's account,
embraces a hopeful purity of position and registers anything less as
contaminated compromise. We can add to Denfeld's complaint that a
victimological perspective will evade the idea that [not all experiences
of powerlessness are the same and should not, therefore, be collapsed
under a single moral claim]{.underline} and that the experience of
powerlessness offers no less distorted a view than does the
"power-infused" view with which it competes politically. Wolf argues
that [[victimology]{.underline}]{.mark} is especially impoverished in
the respect that it [[inhibits]{.underline}]{.mark} the registration and
representation of [[women's capacities to assume positive relationships
to power]{.mark}. It dwells exclusively on powerlessness, "[molding it
into an identity]{.mark}," ratifying and regenerating, rather than
transforming, socially derived stereotypes of female
weakness]{.underline} and vulnerability. Moreover, having granted
victimhood the status of a grand category into which women as a group
can be hereded, [feminists effectively eschew the conceptual
strategies]{.underline} at their disposal [for overcoming victim
identity.]{.underline} As Sandra Harding has commented,
"[[Victimology]{.underline}]{.mark}... often [[hide\[s\] the
ways]{.underline}]{.mark} in which [[women have struggled against
misogyny and exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}." Harding's comment
indicates that [[even as a victimological perspective can have a]{.mark}
dramatic [reversal of the social order in mind]{.mark}]{.underline} --
for men must be made to repent for the injuries they have caused by
relinquishing the values, ideals, and sociocultural configurations that
secure their power -- [[the very logic through which relations of power
are conceived]{.underline}]{.mark} from this perspective [works against
registration of struggle]{.underline} (successful and otherwise) [with
these values]{.underline}, ideals, and sociocultural configurations.
