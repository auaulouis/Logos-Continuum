## BBB \-- Dead as a door knob 

#### BBB is dead---Manchin watered it down to a Medicare bill that doesn't solve the DA's impacts 

David **Dayen 22**, 7-15-2022, \"May Build Back Better Never Be Spoken
Of Again,\" American Prospect,
https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/may-build-back-better-never-be-spoken-of-again/

In the end, having to negotiate with a coal baron on transitioning away
from fossil fuels was not the most reliable option. As **[you and the
rest of the world know]{.underline}** by now, Joe **[Manchin walked away
from adding climate measures or tax increases to any party-line
reconciliation package]{.underline}**. What was **[once a
transformative, multitrillion-dollar agenda]{.underline}** to face
numerous long-standing crises in domestic policy has **[narrowed to an
exceptionally narrow drug price reform]{.underline}**, the main part of
which---price negotiation in Medicare---**[doesn't kick in until
2026]{.underline}**, two years after the next presidential election, and
a two-year extension on ACA subsidies that were set to expire at the end
of the year**[. Eighteen months of fruitless negotiation has come down
to that]{.underline}**. There's going to be a ton to say about this in
the coming days, and we're certainly going to say it. We're going to
note that progressives who said that the social-spending and
infrastructure plans had to be tied together or else the social spending
wouldn't happen were proven entirely correct. We're going to reinforce
that **[Manchin was never a viable partner in this
enterprise]{.underline}**, something that we've known for at least this
entire year. We're going to note that the Trump tax cuts---opposed
unanimously by every Democrat in or out of Congress---are now looking
incredibly likely to become permanent, without much of a fight. We're
going to try and draw lessons out of the policy and governance
structures of the Democratic Party that led to this utter failure. We're
going to once again highlight, as we have for three years, the
importance of executive action as the main path forward for progress in
Washington. (The states are a different matter, and we'll talk about
that, too.) But first things first. Staring us in the face is this
health policy bill that by all accounts has the support of all 50
Democratic senators. That should be passed the moment that those 50
senators are physically available to cast a vote in the chamber. Manchin
made a play at walking back his comments on local radio today, saying
that climate measures weren't dead, that he just wants to see one more
inflation report, just one more set of data, before coming back and
hammering something out in September. Humoring him would be a colossal
mistake. **[Manchin has shown the world who he is]{.underline}**; Chuck
Schumer spending one more second in a room with him would be absurd. If
he wants to **[go down in history as the man responsible for the
diminishment of life on Earth, that's between him and his network of
coal companies]{.underline}**. What we're left with on the table isn't
great, but it is, and this is a low bar, a lot better than nothing. The
drug price reform is narrow and pinched and limited mostly to seniors
and it still **[saves nearly \$300 billion in Medicare costs, plus a lot
more for individual patient]{.underline}**s. Extending the ACA subsidies
prevents the self-own October surprise of a spike in insurance premiums.
Yes, a two-year extension sets up the same brinkmanship and potential
premium spike before the presidential election, but Republicans will
share some of the blame for that if they control the House and/or
Senate, and a presidential race could be a better stage for highlighting
that issue. Most important, stopping the will-they-or-won't-they is an
absolute political imperative. **[The party is exhausted by failure, and
won't hold out for another couple months of wishes and
hopes]{.underline}**. Eighteen months of Joe Manchin being America's
most well-known Democrat is enough. Just put the bill on the floor and
get this over with. Get something completed, and spend the August recess
thinking about how we got here.

#### Manchin pulled the plug -- no more BBB, makes their impacts inevitable 

Laura **Benshoff 22**, 7-15-2022, \"Sen. Joe Manchin pulled the plug on
major spending to address climate change,\" 90.5 WESA,
https://www.wesa.fm/2022-07-15/sen-joe-manchin-pulled-the-plug-on-major-spending-to-address-climate-change

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

Last night, Democratic Senator **[Joe Manchin]{.underline}** of West
Virginia **[pulled the plug on major spending to address climate
change]{.underline}**. Manchin said he was **[concerned about inflation
right]{.underline}** now but is open to negotiating more later. Even so,
his fellow Democrats say **[his refusal to act before the August recess
dooms any climate policy deal]{.underline}** before the midterms.

NPR\'s Laura Benshoff is here to help us understand what that means for
the U.S. and its commitment to lower emissions. Hey, Laura.

LAURA BENSHOFF, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.

CHANG:OK. I mean, we\'ve seen these negotiations stop and start for -
what? - at least a year at this point. So what was even on the table at
this point when it came to climate policy

BENSHOFF: Basically, a lot of money. There is **[already a massive
energy transition underway]{.underline}**. People are moving towards
electric vehicles, and renewable energy is growing. And the idea behind
the climate spending that was in both the Build Back Better bill last
year and reconciliation negotiations this year was to speed up that
transition and make it more affordable, make it more attractive to
invest in. Most recently**[, the size of that federal subsidy was
reported to be as much as \$300 billion,]{.underline}** with Democrats
trimming and tailoring the package to keep Manchin on board. Trevor
Higgins with the Center for American Progress gives one example of a
proposed program to incentivize clean energy manufacturing in areas that
depend on coal, such as Manchin\'s home state of West Virginia.

TREVOR HIGGINS: And he has spiked all of that. And **[he\'s done it, he
says, because of inflation]{.underline}**. But these investments were
designed to cut energy costs.

CHANG: So how did Manchin explain his decision here?

BENSHOFF: He gave an interview on a local radio show in West Virginia
this morning, and he said year-over-year inflation is what gave him
pause. **[Those numbers came out this week. And energy prices are a
driver of inflation]{.underline}**. They **[caused about a third of the
price increases]{.underline}** we\'ve all seen in the last year and a
half, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. But the Democrats
who wanted climate action say that means **[Manchin just blew a chance
to do something about inflation by rejecting policy that would have
subsidized energy]{.underline}**. I should say NPR reached out to
Manchin\'s office multiple times, and we\'ve had no response yet.

CHANG: No response. OK. Well, we should remind people that President
Biden promised his administration would reduce U.S. emissions by, like,
half before the decade is out. So how is that goal looking after this
development?

BENSHOFF: Not good. I talked to Jesse Jenkins, who leads a team at
Princeton University which models the impact of federal policy on
climate goals. And he says since Biden took office, the sum of
congressional action on climate change has basically barely moved the
needle.

JESSE JENKINS: It is extremely **[likely that the United States will
fall well short of our climate goals]{.underline}** without the Senate
passing some kind of clean energy investment package.

BENSHOFF: And representatives for renewable energy manufacturers echoed
this. You know, wind and solar adoption is strong. But **[in order for
the U.S. to cut emissions as quickly as it wants to, they\'ll have to
speed up considerably]{.underline}**.

CHANG: OK. Well, I mean, are there other options available at this
point? Is there a Plan B, a Plan C? What do you think?

BENSHOFF: You know, environmental groups say failure is not an option.
Any action is better than no action. And in a statement today, President
Biden vowed to use executive orders for things like energy security and
to address climate change. But, of course, those orders often bring
lawsuits from fossil fuel companies or GOP state officials, so they can
get hung up in court. And, you know, this is something that, without
legislative action now, it could be off the table for years to come.

CHANG: That is NPR\'s Laura Benshoff. Thank you so much, Laura.

BENSHOFF: Thank you for having me.

## BBB\-- AHA! its still alive 

#### Manchin walked back and is open to climate negotiations later -- only by walking on egg shells can the bill be passed in September -- floor time and PC are key 

Emily **Cochrane 22**, 7-15-2022, \"Manchin Dangles Hopes of a Future
Compromise. Democrats Revolt.,\"
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/us/politics/joe-manchin-senate-climate-tax.html?auth=login-google

WASHINGTON --- It was a familiar, if excruciating, position for
Democrats. A day after pulling the plug on his party's plans to pass a
climate, energy and tax package this summer, Senator Joe **[Manchin III
of West Virginia]{.underline}**, the conservative-leaning Democrat who
has **[repeatedly flirted with compromise]{.underline}** only to scuttle
his party's highest ambitions, **[called in on Friday to a West Virginia
radio show.]{.underline}** Perhaps**[, he suggested, in another month or
so, he might see his way clear to salvaging the last bits of President
Biden's domestic agenda]{.underline}**. There was no guarantee, of
course, and the comments were only the latest instance of Mr. Manchin
capitalizing on his role as a swing vote in an evenly divided Senate to
dictate his party's legislative strategy, leaving Democrats at his
mercy. This time, Democrats had had enough. Rather than engage in
another round of will-he-or-won't-he negotiations with Mr. Manchin, Mr.
Biden let it be known that he was done trying to secure his climate
agenda in Congress. Mr. Manchin's abrupt withdrawal left Senator Chuck
Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, jilted after
months of courting a colleague whose demands and red lines seemed to
shift by the day, or the latest economic projection. And it prodded many
Democrats into open revolt against Mr. Manchin, blaming him for the
demise of their ambitions and the last chance for their party to tackle
the existential threat of climate change. Mr. Manchin, said
Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the chairwoman of the
Congressional Progressive Caucus, "has shown that he doesn't know how to
close a deal --- or he doesn't want to close a deal --- and that you
can't trust him." For more than a year, Mr. Manchin, who at 74 is
serving his third term in the Senate, has been situated exactly where he
prefers to be: at the center of a high-stakes political and policy
negotiation, with attention and speculation focused on him. Democrats
have toiled to win his vote on any piece of their once-ambitious
domestic agenda, tailoring their policy moves so as not to alienate him.
They have contorted themselves to suit his often-changing dictates and
have scaled back their ambitions repeatedly to stay within his red
lines, but they have so far come away empty-handed on their biggest
priorities. Because of Democrats' razor-thin margin of control in the
50-50 Senate and unified Republican opposition to most of their agenda,
Mr. Manchin has effective veto power over the party's legislative
strategy --- and has exercised it often and unapologetically. But while
Mr. Biden and congressional Democrats have pushed for transformative
policies to confront generational challenges such as climate change, Mr.
Manchin, who channels the desires of his very conservative,
coal-and-gas-producing state, has focused on nearer-term issues. On
Friday, he said **[he had told party leaders he wanted to wait another
month --- until inflation numbers for July were released --- before he
could decide on whether to act on climate change]{.underline}**. 'Build
Back Better.' Before being elected president in 2020, Joseph R. Biden
Jr. articulated his ambitious vision for his administration under the
slogan "Build Back Better," promising to invest in clean energy and to
ensure that procurement spending went toward American-made products. A
two-part agenda. March and April 2021: President Biden unveiled two
plans that together formed the core of his domestic agenda: the American
Jobs Plan, focused on infrastructure, and the American Families Plan,
which included a variety of social policy initiatives. A \$6 trillion
budget. June 2021: President Biden proposed a \$6 trillion budget for
2022. The proposal detailed the highest sustained levels of federal
spending since World War II, with the goal of funding the investments in
education, transportation and climate initiatives articulated in the two
plans. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Nov. 15, 2021:
President Biden signed a \$1 trillion infrastructure bill into law, the
result of months of negotiations. The president hailed the package, a
pared-back version of what had been outlined in the American Jobs Plan,
as evidence that U.S. lawmakers could still work across party lines. The
Build Back Better Act. Nov. 19, 2021: The House narrowly passed a \$2.2
trillion social spending bill intended to fund a package of initiatives
from the American Families Plan and the American Jobs Plan. But on Dec.
19, 2021, Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, said he
would not support the bill as written, dooming his party's drive to pass
it. A new attempt. July 15, 2022: Efforts to revive the bill, in a much
smaller form, ahead of the midterm elections were dealt a severe blow
when Mr. Manchin told Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, that
he was unwilling to support funding for climate or energy programs or
raising taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations. "I am where I have
been --- I would not put my staff through this, I would not put myself
through this if I wasn't sincere about trying to find a pathway forward
to do something that's good for our country," Mr. Manchin said on Friday
in the interview with the radio host Hoppy Kercheval. "They cannot come
to grips because I have a 'D' by my name or someone has an 'R' by their
name, we should do whatever one side wants. That's not me." Mr. Biden
made no mention of Mr. Manchin in a statement issued on Friday. Asked at
a news conference in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, whether the West Virginian
had been negotiating in good faith, the president demurred, saying he
was not the one who had been negotiating with him. But angry
congressional Democrats pinned their frustration on the West Virginia
Democrat. One, Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, mused publicly
about whether Mr. Manchin deserved his chairmanship of the Committee on
Energy and Natural Resources. "It's been a really, really terrible day,"
Senator Tina Smith, Democrat of Minnesota and a key champion of the
climate provisions, said in an interview. "**[If Senator Manchin wants a
deal on climate and energy, he can have one in a
heartbeat.]{.underline}** This is Senator Manchin's deal for the taking,
and if it doesn't happen, it is on him." On Capitol Hill, Mr. Manchin is
something of a unicorn --- the only national Democrat from his ruby-red
state --- and acts and votes accordingly. Set to face voters in 2024, he
is unlikely to be threatened by a primary challenger in a state former
President Donald J. Trump won by nearly 40 points in 2020. That has
given Mr. Manchin leverage to accomplish his own policy goals ---
including holding firm against moving entirely away from oil and gas ---
and resist what he considers his party's lurch toward its liberal base.
He appears happiest when he is in the middle of a consequential policy
negotiation; he has been wined and dined as a crucial participant in
bipartisan talks, invited to Mr. Biden's Wilmington home for breakfast
and pursued by the White House officials, lawmakers, aides and reporters
who dissect his every syllable for a kernel of insight. But the
murkiness, and at times inconsistency, of Mr. Manchin's positions has
increasingly grated on his Democratic colleagues. Barely three months
into the Biden administration, he prompted the longest open vote in
modern Senate history by raising a last-minute objection to the size of
unemployment benefits in the \$1.9 trillion pandemic aid plan. Democrats
had to slash the jobless payments to win his vote, which cemented
passage of the package. He refused to help Democrats change filibuster
rules to enact voting rights legislation, killing the effort even after
Mr. Schumer gave him the lead role in writing an alternative bill to
ensure he would support it. But on no issue has Mr. Manchin bedeviled
Democrats more than on their ambitious social safety net, climate and
tax package. To win his vote to begin work on the plan, Mr. Schumer
signed on to a secret memo with Mr. Manchin that made clear that the
West Virginian had no intention of accepting the \$3.5 trillion in
spending envisioned in Democrats' budget. The document outlined Mr.
Manchin's much narrower parameters for a \$1.5 trillion package,
including income thresholds for social programs and accommodations for
fossil fuel tax credits and natural gas. "I will try to dissuade Joe on
many of these," Mr. Schumer scrawled on the document, which enraged many
Democrats when it became public. He never could. Six months later, Mr.
Manchin abruptly walked away from talks on the package. Democrats
regrouped in January and began efforts to rebuild their shattered plan,
adhering strictly to the components Mr. Manchin had repeatedly laid out:
paying down the national debt, overhauling parts of the tax code and
lowering the cost of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to
negotiate prices and some spending. By early this month, Senate
Democrats had begun rolling out pieces of a package they believed could
win Mr. Manchin's support, including a drug pricing proposal and a plan
to shore up the solvency of a key Medicare program by increasing taxes
for some high-earning Americans. But by Thursday evening, after news
that prices had surged 9.1 percent in the year ending in June, Mr.
Manchin balked again, telling Mr. Schumer that he wanted to wait on any
climate or tax proposals until seeing inflation figures for July. Should
Democrats insist on pushing forward with legislative action before then,
Mr. Manchin said, they should act only on proposals aimed at lowering
the cost of prescription drugs and extending expanded Affordable Care
Act subsidies. "Let's wait until that comes out, so we know that we're
going down the path it won't be inflammatory, to add more to inflation,"
Mr. Manchin said in the radio interview. Recounting Mr. Schumer's
response, **[Mr. Manchin added]{.underline}**: "I said, 'Chuck, it's
wrong. It's not prudent to do the other right now.'**[" "I want climate.
I want an energy policy," he said, adding, "I thought we were moving
truly in the right direction]{.underline}**." But Mr. Schumer appeared
to have grown exasperated and convinced that Mr. Manchin's vote was not
obtainable. One official said that Mr. Manchin had rebuffed major
concessions that would have enraged progressive Democrats, including
adding more drilling measures, removing a key electric vehicle tax
credit and dropping tax increases he had resisted. Mr. Manchin's stance
effectively scuttled the chances of action in the coming days on a
critical priority for Democrats and strongly suggested that unless they
abandoned the climate and tax proposals altogether, they might not
salvage any of their domestic policy package before the midterm
congressional elections in November. **[In September]{.underline}**,
after a five-week planned recess, **[lawmakers will have only a limited
window to act on the package. And they are eager to give themselves as
much time as possible to campaign on whatever they pass before the
November elections.]{.underline}** Bearing political scars from a year
of fractious talks, few Democrats on Friday seemed willing to gamble
that there was a larger deal to be had in September. "I can't get blood
from a stone," said Representative Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat
facing re-election in a competitive district. "I'm not in the Senate.
They're clearly having problems negotiating among themselves. And I will
just --- for my constituents --- take what I can get."

#### Their evidence exaggerates Manchins claim---he just didn't want to pass the bill in July 

Jacob **Fischler 22**, 7-15-2022, \"Climate change legislation still
could pass Congress this year, Manchin insists,\" Iowa Capital Dispatch,
https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/07/15/climate-change-legislation-still-could-pass-congress-this-year-manchin-insists/

U.S. Sen. Joe **[Manchin]{.underline}** III on Friday **[held open the
prospect of Congress passing significant climate legislation yet this
year, denying reports he's tanked the effort by walking away from talks
with leadership]{.underline}**. The reports have brought a flood of
criticism for Manchin from fellow members of Congress, who say the very
survival of the planet is at stake. Manchin, a moderate West Virginia
Democrat, gains unusual national attention for his remarks because he is
in the center of his party's negotiations over a major spending bill and
represents a crucial vote in the evenly divided Senate. Manchin on a
West Virginia radio station talk show on Friday said he told Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that after June's consumer price index
showed a 9.1% increase, **[he wanted to wait to see July's inflation
numbers and Federal Reserve interest rates before deciding what clean
energy programs and tax changes he could support]{.underline}**.
"**[Let's wait until that comes out so that we know that we're going
down the path that won't be inflammatory to add more to
inflation]{.underline}**," Manchin said he told Schumer, a New York
Democrat. "Inflation is absolutely killing many, many people... Can't we
wait to make sure that we do nothing to add to that?" Schumer "took that
as 'no,' I guess, and came out with this big thing last night," Manchin
told Hoppy Kercheval, the host of the Metronews Talkline radio show in
West Virginia. The New York Democrat or someone close to him then told
The Washington Post that talks were dead, Manchin implied. The Post
published a story Thursday night saying Manchin told Democratic leaders
he wouldn't support new climate programs or raising taxes on the
wealthy. **[Manchin seemed surprised by the Washington Post
repor]{.underline}**t, saying during a 15-minute interview with
Kercheval that Schumer's team knew where the West Virginian stood and
that the sides had made major progress in the past few months. He
**[seemed to view the leak as a negotiating ploy, rejecting the
conclusion that talks were at an end or even seriously set
back.]{.underline}** "**[I'm not stopping," he said]{.underline}**.
"This is rhetoric. I've been through this all my life, politically. I've
never seen it at this level... thinking they're going to put all this
pressure on me. I am where I have been. I would not put my staff through
this, I **[would not put myself through this if I wasn't
sincere]{.underline}**." Reconciliation bill Manchin said Schumer wanted
an agreement by the end of July on a budget reconciliation bill --- a
legislative tool that would allow Senate Democrats to pass legislation
with a simple majority vote, which they'd gain with Vice President
Kamala Harris breaking a tie. Inflation figures for July will not be
released until August, when the Senate will be in a month-long recess.
**[Manchin has also set a Sept. 30 deadline to reach a deal on a
spending bill]{.underline}**, **[making the four weeks the chamber is in
session in September a crucial period.]{.underline}** That tight
timeline was not an obstacle, he said Friday. "We could come back the
first of September and pass this legislation," he said. "If it's a good
piece of legislation." Manchin said he thought he was "close" to a deal
with Schumer. "I thought we were," he said. "I thought we were moving
truly in the right direction." Energy policy differences Manchin, **[who
has financial ties to his state's coal industry, said he supports
spending for clean energy programs, but had disagreements with
Democratic colleagues who he said wanted to eliminate production of oil,
gas and coal.]{.underline}** That may happen in 20 years, but would not
be possible in the next decade, **[Manchin said. The U.S. should instead
work on making fossil fuel production cleaner and on developing
non-fossil fuel sources, including hydrogen and nuclear]{.underline}**,
he said. Carbon emissions from fossil fuels are the dominant cause of
global warming, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change. The international group has called for significant reductions to
fossil fuel emissions in order to curb the worst effects of climate
change. President Joe Biden has joined international efforts to reduce
carbon emissions, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions to 50% of
2005 levels by 2030. The White House proposed --- and the
Democratic-controlled House passed last year --- more than \$550 billion
for climate programs, mostly tax credits for energy producers that use
renewable sources. Manchin's objections sidelined that bill in December.
Manchin 'whims' criticized Climate advocates in and out of Congress
slammed Manchin on Friday, reacting to apparent news he had again
blocked even a slimmed-down climate bill. "Like most Americans right
now, I am sickened that the changing whims of one man could put the very
near future of our country, our planet, and our health and safety on the
brink," U.S. House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl M. Grijalva
of Arizona said in a statement. "I think it's shortsighted at best,
reckless endangerment at worst." Grijalva also blamed Republicans for
the impasse. "It's infuriating and nothing short of tragic that Senator
Manchin is walking away, again, from taking essential action on climate
and clean energy," Minnesota Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said in a
statement. "The world is literally burning while he joins every single
Republican to stop strong action to cut emissions and speed the
transition to clean energy for the survival of our planet." "We have an
opportunity to address the climate crisis right now," U.S. Sen. Martin
Heinrich of New Mexico, who sits on the Energy and Natural Resources
Committee that Manchin chairs, wrote on Twitter. "Senator Manchin's
refusal to act is infuriating," Heinrich added. "It makes me question
why he's Chair of ENR." "This failure falls squarely on Joe Manchin and
the Republicans, as do the barren croplands, flooded homes, and
incinerated communities that will result from this inaction," said
Manish Bapna, the president and CEO of environmental group NRDC Action
Fund. "One of those senators must reconsider." Representatives for
Schumer, who has been absent from the Senate with COVID-19, did not
respond to a message seeking comment Friday.

## Midterms 

#### Healthcare bill passage before midterms boosts dem popularity 

Margot **Sanger-Katz 22**, 7-15-2022, \"Build Back Better Is a Health
Care Bill Now,\" No Publication,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/upshot/build-back-better-health-care-biden.html

WASHINGTON --- President Biden and **[Democrats in Congress had hoped to
pass a broad domestic policy package]{.underline}** that would expand
the social safety net, raise taxes on corporations and the wealthiest
Americans, and tighten regulation of climate-changing pollutants.
**[But]{.underline}** the decision by Senator Joe
**[Manchin]{.underline}** of West Virginia to **[withdraw his support
from other aspects]{.underline}** of an already-shrunken package this
week leaves nothing **[but health care]{.underline}** on the table. But
even if what was once a sidecar of sorts to the so-called Build Back
Better Act is now the only vehicle left on the road, it would **[still
have a substantial impact on the lives of many Americans]{.underline}**.
And unlike other provisions that faced a mixed political reception**[,
the central health care proposal that remains is enormously popular with
the public --- including Republicans]{.underline}**. That piece is
prescription drug price reform, which Democrats have been promising for
years and **[many Americans tell pollsters they want.]{.underline}** The
bill would **[take several whacks at the price of drugs]{.underline}**
--- directly regulating prices for a group of expensive medications
purchased by Medicare and punishing drug companies that raise prices too
fast on existing medicines for all Americans. The legislation under
discussion would also expand Medicare's prescription drug benefit,
increasing financial help for poorer seniors and eliminating the
program's current unlimited cost sharing, which leaves some
beneficiaries facing more than \$10,000 a year in medication costs. No
one on Medicare would be asked to pay more than \$2,000 a year for
prescription drugs under the legislation, a significant benefit to
patients who take expensive medications for serious diseases like cancer
and multiple sclerosis. The prescription drug provisions are unusual in
that they offer Americans tangible benefits --- lower drug prices, more
financial protections --- while actually saving the federal government
money. That's because **[the bill essentially puts the savings on the
back of the pharmaceutical industry]{.underline}**, which will have to
accept lower prices for some of its big sellers. Understand What
Happened to Biden's Domestic Agenda Card 1 of 6 'Build Back Better.'
Before being elected president in 2020, Joseph R. Biden Jr. articulated
his ambitious vision for his administration under the slogan "Build Back
Better," promising to invest in clean energy and to ensure that
procurement spending went toward American-made products. A two-part
agenda. March and April 2021: President Biden unveiled two plans that

proposal detailed the highest sustained levels of federal spending since
World War II, with the goal of funding the investments in education,
transportation and climate initiatives articulated in the two plans. The
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Nov. 15, 2021: President Biden
signed a \$1 trillion infrastructure bill into law, the result of months

form, ahead of the midterm elections were dealt a severe blow when Mr.
Manchin told Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, that he was
unwilling to support funding for climate or energy programs or raising
taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations. Defenders of the industry
in Congress, and the drug companies themselves, argue that the change
could thwart innovation and cost jobs. Such arguments have staved off
drug price reforms in the past. But previous rounds of negotiation
suggest that this package is likely to have enough votes to pass the
Senate. Dig deeper into the moment. Special offer: Subscribe for \$1 a
week. Mr. Manchin has also signaled his support for another health
provision that has received less attention in recent reports of the
emerging deal. He said he was open to an expansion of premium subsidies
that lower the price of insurance for Americans who buy their own
coverage, rather than get it through the government or a job. Those
subsidies were already expanded as part of Congress's pandemic relief
bill last year, but the expansion will expire in December unless new
legislation continues them. **[The subsidies are important to many
Democratic lawmakers because they are seen as fulfilling the promise of
the Affordable Care Act]{.underline}**. The **[extra money lowers
premiums for nearly every American]{.underline}** who buys a health plan
through the Obamacare marketplaces, making certain plans free for
lower-income Americans and offering financial support for higher-income
people who previously received no help paying for insurance. In a
statement on Friday supporting the measures in which he called on the
Senate to pass the legislation before its August recess, Mr. Biden said
Democrats had "come together" and "beaten back the pharmaceutical
industry." "This will not only lower the cost of prescription drugs and
health care for families," he added, "it will reduce the deficit and
help fight inflation." But for Democrats who had hoped for social
spending on programs other than health care, the price of extending the
Obamacare subsidies may disappoint. A slightly outdated estimate
suggests they will cost the federal government nearly as much to extend
as the drug-pricing provisions would save --- \$220 billion over a
decade, compared with about \$288 billion in savings. Mr. Manchin has
said he might be open to considering climate and tax provisions in the
fall. If he is also hoping for deficit reduction, there may be less
money to spend than some lawmakers expected.

#### Manchin's refusal to cooperate on climate policy energizes democratic voter's 

Hans **Nichols 22**, 7-16-2022, \"Democrats\' Manchin rage,\" Axios,

**[Democrats are publicly fuming]{.underline}** that Sen. Joe Manchin
(D-W.Va.) can\'t be trusted and has doubled-crossed them yet again on
Build Back Better. But privately, they\'re taking him at his word that
he\'s still committed to working with them to lower prescription drug
prices.

Why it matters: Party leaders are moving to vote on a drug pricing and
health care subsidy package this month**[. Capping drug costs is hugely
popular across party lines and could give Democrats a major boost ahead
of November]{.underline}** if infighting doesn\'t sink a deal.

From President Biden to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)
**[Democrats are seizing on Manchin's public comments that he's willing
to a support a package focused on deficit reductio]{.underline}**n,
allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices and two years of
funding to bolster the Obamacare insurance exchanges.

Driving the news: Democrats made no attempt to hide their rage and
indignation after reports Thursday night that Manchin had told party
leaders that due to inflation concerns he was out on any economic
package with climate change spending or new taxes on the wealthy or
corporations.

After negotiating with Schumer all spring on a modified package to
include \$1 trillion in revenue and \$500 billion in new spending, he
was again taking his ball and going home.

What they\'re saying: \"**[We\'re going to have to get two more
Democrats --- real Democrats --- who will actually help us to implement
the president\'s agenda and not obstruct it]{.underline}**,\" Rep.
Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the chair of the House Progressive Caucus,
told reporters.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) told SiriusXM host Dean Obeidallah that
\"Manchin is not particularly concerned about President Biden
succeeding. He\'s not particularly concerned about the needs of working
people."

\"Senator Manchin's refusal to act is infuriating," Sen. Martin Heinrich
(D-N.M.) tweeted.

Manchin somewhat tempered his stance on Friday, telling a radio show in
his home state that he simply wants more time and to see how the Federal
Reserve responds to the 9.1% June inflation report. He also underscored
his willingness to get the Medicare piece done now.

Reality check: Dems fear if they wait another month for Manchin to get
comfortable with approximately \$300 billion to fight climate change,
they\'ll get nothing.

They\'re left shouting their outrage on twitter and cable news.

But their anger and frustration won't change the fundamental filibuster
math that has governed the Senate for 18 months.

How we got here: Frustration with Manchin in the Democratic caucus runs
deep. It stems, in part, due to his crafty habit of always playing for
more time.

Last September, he first called for a \"strategic pause,\" in a Wall
Street Journal op-ed.

In November, he told Fox News he wanted to \"slow down and take a
breath.\"

All the while, Manchin\'s relationship with Schumer was deteriorating,
with both sides questioning if the other could be trusted.

A February effort to mend fences over Italian food didn\'t help them
reset their relationship.

What we're watching: Manchin's call to dedicate most of \$287 billion in
estimated Medicare savings towards deficit reductions, with only \$40
billion for the insurance exchanges, isn't guaranteed to sail through
both chambers.

A group of centrist House lawmakers is already making noise that they
want tax increases to be included in any package.

"There are numerous options for raising the revenue necessary to get our
nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory," nine lawmakers, including
Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-Ga.) and Ed Case (D-Hawaii) wrote to their
party leaders.

The bottom line: Democrats are hopping mad at the senator from West
Virginia and aren\'t trying to hide it. But they also know they need
Manchin to deliver the 50th vote on any reconciliation bill.
