Others argue that the "total package" approach of [[US security
assistance]{.mark} does [provide]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [with **real influence** over partners]{.mark}, and thus
a real [opportunity]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **[enforce conditions]{.mark}**.
[Partners]{.mark} are [dependent on American
expertise]{.mark}]{.underline} to operate, maintain, and modernize
weapons systems throughout their entire life-cycles. [[This
dependency]{.mark} [should]{.mark} [give]{.mark} **[US]{.mark} officials
[leverage]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but one expert noted that the US
government is often "constitutionally incapable or unwilling to use that
leverage" for fear of disrupting the bilateral relationship.256 Given
this mixed record, [[policymakers]{.mark} might try to [identify
opportunities to implement positive conditionality: a
**conditions**]{.mark}**-[based]{.mark}** [framework where partners are
incentivized to **demonstrate good behavior**]{.mark}]{.underline} over
time [[in exchange for]{.mark} security
[assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than authorizing aid and then
withholding it when confronted with undesirable behavior, [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [could identify specific positive
actions]{.mark} the partner is open to taking, [and]{.mark} the
[specific incentives]{.mark} the United States would provide if
benchmarks were met]{.underline}. To implement this, the State
Department could negotiate a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between
the United States and the partner. It should reflect the elements,
including civilian protection measures, that would govern security
assistance between the two countries over a certain period of time.
Milestones should be built over the course of the MOU such that when the
partner meets a goal, they are rewarded. If the partner fails to meet
the milestone, they do not receive the agreed-upon security assistance.
The implementation of [[this]{.mark} framework [would have a **real
impact** by lending]{.mark} [predictability]{.mark} to the relationship
and [limit]{.mark} the [potential]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
[mismanaged]{.mark} [expectations]{.mark} on both sides]{.underline}.257
One major hurdles would be overcoming entrenched bureaucratic tendencies
to "shovel security assistance out the door," as one expert put it.258
However, if tackled in a piecemeal fashion -- for example, starting with
a few "easy" partnerships and building on momentum and success -- [this
approach [could]{.mark} [feasibly be implemented]{.mark}]{.underline} at
either State or DoD.

What can the United States and the European Union Do?

[Both the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [through]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark}
and our European allies]{.underline} through the EU [[should]{.mark} do
more to [**encourage common values** like]{.mark} the rule of **law and
[democracy in Turkey, Hungary and Poland]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While
it may be hard to achieve concrete results in the very short term, both
[organizations should be aware that they are playing a long game, and
that **[none of the three]{.mark} [current]{.mark} [leaders]{.mark}** in
Ankara, Budapest, and Warsaw **[will be in power
indefinitely]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While lecturing allies and friends
on democratic principles may easily backfire and be quickly condemned as
hypocrisy, [the [US]{.mark} especially [should]{.mark} [stand by]{.mark}
its enduring [commitment]{.mark} [to democratic freedoms]{.mark} and the
rule of law [in]{.mark} [all]{.mark} its official (and unofficial)
[foreign policy]{.mark} [statements]{.mark}]{.underline}. Going forward,
the European Union can: • [**[make]{.mark} its [funding]{.mark} more
[conditional on abiding by democratic principles]{.mark} and rule of
law** [and]{.mark} **[withhold funding if
necessary]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The EU is currently debating
instituting tougher 'rule of law' conditions on its funding in the next
budget cyle. • **[[condemn]{.mark} [anti-democratic countries
directly]{.mark}]{.underline}**, rather than focusing on economics, the
EU could also rank countries based on political freedoms, by naming and
shaming the worst performers. • encourage its mainstream pan-European
political parties -- especially the center-right EPP and the center-left
D&S -- to not allow parties with autocratic or illiberal tendencies
within their political groupings. Going forward, the United States
should: • continue to support civil society groups and free media in
countries experiencing democratic backsliding. For instance, recent
reports that Radio Free Europe would be recommencing operations in
Hungary are a step in the right direction. • [**[emphasize]{.mark} that
[NATO]{.mark} membership [means]{.mark} rights** as well as
[responsibilities]{.mark}]{.underline} beyond spending 2% of GDP on
defense[. [NATO must be an alliance based on **basic common democratic
values**]{.mark}. [The transatlantic alliance has proven so
strong]{.mark} and enduring]{.underline} not simply because of
Realpolitik, but also [[because it has been an alliance based on a
shared commitment to]{.mark} freedom and [democratic values]{.mark}.
[If]{.mark} those **[values]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [no longer seen as
common]{.mark} to the alliance, [it will inevitably
erode]{.mark}**]{.underline}. • encourage overseas investment through
OPIC in countries that [[show]{.mark} a strong commitment to the rule of
law and democracy while showing a [higher level of reluctance to
support]{.mark} investment in [regimes that are distmantling those
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### That saves the LIO. AND illiberalism shreds [all]{.underline} NATO initiatives.

Question: [[Rising]{.underline}]{.mark} rightist or leftist
[[populist]{.mark} political [groups in]{.mark} Europe]{.underline} and
the US indicate that they would be quite influential in their own
national politics in the near future. Do you think that this could
complicate **[[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark}** stance regarding democracy
and freedom?

Luis Tome: Of course it can. The spread of nationalism, populism,
authoritarianism and extremisms [**[threaten]{.mark}s the
[l]{.mark}iberal [i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder** and the
security environment]{.underline}. And [[if]{.underline}]{.mark}
national egoisms, populisms, autocratic tendencies and "[[illiberal
democracies]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[flourish in NATO]{.mark} member
countries]{.underline}, as is already happening, [then it [makes it
**very complicated** for]{.mark} the transatlantic [Alliance to be
**the** **bulwark** for]{.mark} the defence and [promotion of
freedom]{.mark}, [democracy]{.mark} and **[liberal
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Fortunately, there seems to be a sense of
urgency within NATO today to put democratic values back at the heart of
the transatlantic Alliance's action. But we must recognise that the
virus of nationalism and populism is difficult to fight even within NATO
countries.

Question: There are too many significant points to cover in an
interview, but as a closing question, I would like to have your comments
on an issue that is the most important one regarding NATO's future.

Luis Tome: [The [decisive]{.mark} [factor]{.mark} **[for the evolution
and future of NATO is]{.mark}**]{.underline} the strengthening of its
political dimension, namely dialogue, articulation, cooperation and
[[political cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark} among Allied countries.
Organisations are what their members make of them, and NATO is no
exception. [[NATO is]{.mark} a military alliance, but it is also the
[main]{.mark} political [forum]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the transatlantic
community of [shared]{.mark} [values]{.mark} and interests. [Without
political cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline} among Allies,
[[powerful]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[deterrent]{.mark} and defence
[capabilities have less value]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Without
constructive political dialogue, differences between member countries
cannot be overcome or minimised. [[Without political cooperation, it is
not possible to formulate common and]{.mark} [coherent
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Without political articulation, the
transatlantic Alliance will face many difficulties in projecting
security and stability in its periphery, whether to the East or to the
South; effectively confronting the many risks and threats; managing
crises and conflicts; establishing fruitful partnerships with external
partners; or dealing with major rivals such as Russia and China.
[[Without]{.mark} political [cohesion]{.mark}, it **will [not]{.mark} be
[possible]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} [NATO to make]{.mark} the necessary
[re-adaptation to]{.mark} a [geopolitical]{.mark} and [security
context]{.mark} in great transformation]{.underline}. Nor to be the
pillar of democracy and liberal order that the Allies want and preach
NATO to be. [NATO's military dimension remains robust, but the
[Alliance's political dimension]{.mark} and political [role]{.mark} are
[undervalued]{.mark} and underused. [NATO's]{.mark} future [success
depends on the]{.mark} ability of the Allies to leverage the [political
dimension of the]{.mark} transatlantic [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### LIO solves nuclear war, climate change and tech disruption -- [all]{.underline} existential

**Harari 18**, Professor of History at Hebrew University of Jerusalem
(Yuval Noah, "We need a post-liberal order now," *The Economist*,
<https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/26/we-need-a-post-liberal-order-now>)

The second thing to note about [this vision of friendly
fortresses]{.underline} is that it **[has been
tried]{.underline}**---[and it **failed spectacularly**. [**All
attempts** to divide the world]{.mark} into clear-cut nations
have]{.underline} so far **[[resulted in war]{.mark} and
genocide]{.underline}**. When the heirs of Garibaldi, Mazzini and
Mickiewicz managed to overthrow the multi-ethnic Habsburg Empire, it
proved impossible to find a clear line dividing Italians from Slovenes
or Poles from Ukrainians. This had set the stage for the second world
war. The key problem with the network of fortresses is that each
national fortress wants a bit more land, security and prosperity for
itself at the expense of the neighbors, and without the help of
universal values and global organisations, rival fortresses cannot agree
on any common rules. Walled fortresses are seldom friendly. But if you
happen to live inside a particularly strong fortress, such as America or
Russia, why should you care? Some nationalists indeed adopt a more
extreme isolationist position. They don't believe in either a global
empire or in a global network of fortresses. Instead, [they deny the
necessity of any global order whatsoever]{.underline}. "Our fortress
should just raise the drawbridges," they say, "and the rest of the world
can go to hell. We should refuse entry to foreign people, foreign ideas
and foreign goods, and as long as our walls are stout and the guards are
loyal, who cares what happens to the foreigners?" Such extreme
isolationism, however, is completely divorced from economic realities.
Without a global trade network, all existing national economies will
collapse---including that of North Korea. Many countries will not be
able even to feed themselves without imports, and prices of almost all
products will skyrocket. The made-in-China shirt I am wearing cost me
about \$5. If it had been produced by Israeli workers from Israeli-grown
cotton using Israeli-made machines powered by non-existing Israeli oil,
it may well have cost ten times as much. Nationalist leaders from Donald
Trump to Vladimir Putin may therefore heap abuse on the global trade
network, but none thinks seriously of taking their country completely
out of that network. And we cannot have a global trade network without
some global order that sets the rules of the game. Even more
importantly, whether people like it or not,
[[humankind]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[faces]{.underline}]{.mark}
three [[common problems that]{.mark} make a mockery of all national
borders]{.underline}, and [that [can **only be solved through global
coop**]{.mark}**eration**. [These are **nuclear war, climate change
and**]{.mark} **[tech]{.mark}nological [disruption]{.mark}**. You cannot
build a wall against nuclear winter or against global warming, and [no
nation can regulate]{.mark}]{.underline} artificial intelligence
([[AI]{.mark}) or [bioengineering single-handedly]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[It won't be enough if only the European Union]{.underline}]{.mark}
forbids producing killer robots [[or only America]{.underline}]{.mark}
bans genetically-engineering human babies. Due to the immense potential
of such disruptive technologies, if even one country
[[decides]{.underline}]{.mark} to pursue these high-risk high-gain
paths, other countries will be forced to follow its dangerous lead for
fear of being left behind. [[An **AI** ]{.mark}**arms race** [or]{.mark}
a **[biotech]{.mark}nological [arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline} almost
[[**guarantees the worst outcome**.]{.mark} Whoever wins]{.underline}
the arms race, **[[the loser will]{.mark} likely [be humanity]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}**. For in an arms race, [all regulations will
collapse]{.underline}. Consider, for example, conducting
genetic-engineering experiments on human babies. Every country will say:
"We don't want to conduct such experiments---we are the good guys. But
how do we know our rivals are not doing it? We cannot afford to remain
behind. So we must do it before them." Similarly, [consider developing
autonomous-weapon systems]{.underline}, that can decide for themselves
whether to shoot and kill people. Again, [every country will say:
"This]{.underline} is a very dangerous technology, and it [should be
regulated]{.underline} carefully. [But we don't trust our rivals to
regulate it, so we must develop it first]{.underline}". [[The **only
thing** that can]{.mark} [prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} such [destructive
[arms races is **greater trust**]{.mark} **between
countries**]{.underline}. [This is **not an impossible
mission**]{.underline}. If today the Germans promise the French: "Trust
us, we aren't developing killer robots in a secret laboratory under the
Bavarian Alps," the French are likely to believe the Germans, despite
the terrible history of these two countries. [We need to build such
trust globally]{.underline}. We need to reach a point when Americans and
Chinese can trust one another like the French and Germans. Similarly, we
need to create a global safety-net to protect humans against the
economic shocks that AI is likely to cause. Automation will create
immense new wealth in high-tech hubs such as Silicon Valley, while the
worst effects will be felt in developing countries whose economies
depend on cheap manual labor. There will be more jobs to software
engineers in California, but fewer jobs to Mexican factory workers and
truck drivers. We now have a global economy, but politics is still very
national. [[Unless we find solutions on a global level]{.mark} to the
disruptions caused by AI, entire countries might collapse, and [the
resulting chaos]{.mark}]{.underline}, violence and waves of immigration
[[will **destabilise the entire world**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is
the proper perspective to look at recent developments such as Brexit. In
itself, Brexit isn't necessarily a bad idea. But is this what Britain
and the EU should be dealing with right now? How does Brexit help
prevent nuclear war? How does Brexit help prevent climate change? How
does Brexit help regulate artificial intelligence and bioengineering?
Instead of helping, Brexit makes it harder to solve all of these
problems. Every minute that Britain and the EU spend on Brexit is one
less minute they spend on preventing climate change and on regulating
AI. In order **[[to survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and flourish [in the
21st century, [humankind needs]{.mark} **effective [global
coop]{.mark}eration**]{.underline}, and so far [[the **only viable
blueprint**]{.mark} for such cooperation [is]{.mark} offered by
**[liberalism]{.mark}**. Nevertheless, [governments]{.mark} all over the
world [are undermining]{.mark} the foundations of [the liberal
order]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the world is turning into a network of
fortresses. The first to feel the impact are the weakest members of
humanity, who find themselves without any fortress willing to protect
them: refugees, illegal migrants, persecuted minorities. But if the
walls keep rising, eventually the whole of humankind will feel the
squeeze.

Hard Is Not Impossible

These failings notwithstanding, there exists no shortage of arguments in
favor of the status quo and against shifting America's focus in security
assistance to security-sector reform and conditional aid. In an era of
great-power competition, Russia, China, or regional competitors may
simply step in to fill the gap with the partner nation if the United
States insists upon unwelcome reforms in exchange for aid. I know this
is a valid concern because I have sat in meetings where partners made
thinly veiled reference to other nations which may provide assistance if
the United States is unable or unwilling. Still[, the quality and
**[tech]{.mark}nological** [edge of **U.S**]{.mark}**.** kit and the
total-package approach which includes **training and follow-on
[support]{.mark} do [provide the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [a
competitive advantage]{.mark}**. But the bureaucratic apparatus
responsible for delivering aid is far too slow and, as a result, is a
liability. To outcompete, the **security assistance enterprise itself
requires major reform to shorten typical lead times** from years to
months. The Pentagon and State Department need the agility to turn aid
on and off like a switch or rheostat.]{.underline}

Another argument against placing preconditions on security assistance is
that the stakes are too high to deny a partner a critical capability
while waiting for reform to happen. This is the "we can't let them fail"
mentality. It is also valid --- but only in certain crisis situations
where aid is needed immediately, and reform truly cannot wait. Ukraine
today is a good example. [[Rather than ceasing aid]{.mark} writ large
until a condition is met, **[place]{.mark} [conditions on]{.mark}**
discrete **packages of [aid]{.mark}**. The **[intent should]{.mark} be
[to provide sufficient]{.mark} [incentive]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
host-[nation]{.mark} government [to modify
behavior]{.mark}**,]{.underline} not threaten national
survival[.]{.underline} During the years I spent in Afghanistan, the
security threats faced by the government never appeared to afford the
breathing space to withhold aid while institutional reform took place.
In hindsight, doing so may have required coalition forces to carry a
greater operational burden while the Afghan forces sorted themselves
out, but it also would have been worth it. As the events of August 2021
demonstrated, 20 years of unconditional capacity-building built
shockingly little capacity. Implementing this change requires a
recurring review of Defense Department-led train and equip programs to
determine which truly qualify as crisis situations. Those which do not
should be moved under State Department control for more deliberate,
reform-focused approach.

There is also the simple argument that instituting meaningful reform in
a recalcitrant partner nation is hard. This is true. But hard is not
impossible. The security assistance enterprise should approach reform
not in broad, sweeping terms but incremental steps. Rather than
requiring the partner to eliminate corruption wholesale across the
security forces, perhaps require that a particularly corrupt commander
be removed before providing assistance to that unit. In the case of Iraq
in the late 2000s, the United States might have required Prime Minister
Nouri al-Maliki to fire certain commanders guilty of sectarian excesses
or modify the personnel policy to make the armed forces more broadly
inclusive. In other cases, reform measures may be as mundane as
switching to an electronic pay system to reduce the opportunity for
graft. Such a change in approach would also require a change in how the
United States prepares officers for security assistance duties. The
Defense Security Cooperation Agency has made great strides in its
educational program to professionalize the security assistance workforce
in recent years. It could further improve this program by embedding
security sector reform more deeply into the curriculum.

Better Rewards, Tougher Inducements

[The United States is **not getting the most for its security assistance
dollars**. [Programs]{.mark} intended to build partner capacity tend to
underperform because **they [fail to address underlying weakness in
defense]{.mark} [institutions]{.mark}** or take principal-agent problems
into account. [To]{.mark} build meaningful, long-lasting capacity in
partners and better [align security assistance with policy goals, the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should shift]{.mark} from a "building
partner capacity" **approach [to a reform focus using conditional aid as
leverage]{.mark}**. [Doing so]{.mark} in an environment where security
assistance [is]{.mark} yet [another **arena for strategic
competition**]{.mark} [with Russia]{.mark}, [China]{.mark}, and others
will require internal reform of the U.S. security assistance apparatus.
Rather than a slow-moving bureaucracy, [the United States needs]{.mark}
an agile and streamlined security assistance enterprise able [to]{.mark}
deliver aid rapidly when needed and be [paused or turn]{.mark}ed
[off]{.mark} just as easily [when]{.mark} [conditions require]{.mark}.
In short, [the **United States needs sweeter carrots**]{.mark} **and
harder sticks**.]{.underline}

While the current U.S. effort to arm and equip Ukrainian forces is the
most visible example today, it is not representative of the day-to-day
work of security assistance which the United States carries out around
the world. In most cases, the greater threat facing these partners is
not an invading army but rather defense institutions for which reform is
needed but not properly incentivized. **[[Modifying]{.mark} the [U.S.
approach]{.mark} to security assistance [is one way to create that
incentive]{.mark} and [better align aid with policy
goals]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### **Conditions have the potential to [drastically increase cooperation]{.underline} and send a [signal of US commitment]{.underline} to democracy -- but unilateralism [hampers effectiveness]{.underline} -- the counterplan's personalized framework is key to generate [tangible reforms]{.underline}**

Strengths, Weaknesses, and Gaps

When strategically applied, [[conditionality has]{.mark} the [potential
to]{.mark} **mitigate risks, strengthen security partnerships**, and
**[incentivize good behavior]{.mark}**. Policymakers can employ
[punitive]{.mark} [conditionality]{.mark} to [mitigate]{.mark} the
[risk]{.mark} that a partner [country will abuse]{.mark} U.S.
[S]{.mark}S[A]{.mark}. Transparent, [positive conditionality]{.mark}, in
which U.S. policymakers collaborate with recipient countries to develop
a road map for SSA, [would]{.mark} help **[incentivize reform]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} likely **[result in stronger partnerships]{.mark}** and a
better alignment of policy objectives between donor and recipient

also **[signal]{.mark} and influence the [behavior of those seeking

**[lack]{.mark} a [common framework]{.mark}** that enables them to
assess the various factors at play in a security relationship and make
judgements about whether placing conditions on assistance will be
effective. [This]{.mark} deficit [has led to]{.mark} the **[ad hoc
use]{.mark}** and narrow application [of
conditions]{.mark}.]{.underline} One of conditionality's greatest
weaknesses results from the narrow way policymakers employ it. Different
interests between donor and recipient countries often lead to different
policy objectives. To bring goals into alignment, donors place
conditions on SSA, [However, U.S. policymakers often fail to consider
partner countries to establish mutually beneficial SSA programs and
acceptable conditions. Instead, U.S. policymakers often impose
**unilateral conditions, exacerbating disagreements** between
partners.]{.underline}

Conditionality Recommendations

[[U.S.]{.mark} policymakers [should develop]{.mark} and adopt a set of
**[common]{.mark} [principles]{.mark}** that will guide decision-making
on conditioning SSA]{.underline}. This framework will [help policymakers
determine]{.underline} both whether to apply conditionality and [the
form **best suited for the relationship and objectives**]{.underline}.
While [policymakers should continue programming]{.underline} such as EUM
[to [ensure]{.mark} [oversight]{.mark} and accountability [of U.S.
defense articles]{.mark}]{.underline}, [they should also proactively
[employ]{.mark} **[positive]{.mark} [conditionality]{.mark}**,
[linking]{.mark} the [incentive of new capabilities]{.mark}, training,
and equipment [for]{.mark} the [partner]{.mark} [if]{.mark} [it takes
greater steps of s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation [to achieve
common goals]{.mark}.]{.underline} There are three ways in which U.S.
policymakers can begin to implement positive conditionality. First, U.S.
policymakers should collaborate with recipient countries to develop
memoranda of understanding (MOUs) that articulate the partners' shared
goals and road maps that detail partners' expectations and obligations.
Second, [U.S. SSA programs [should]{.mark} **[tie]{.mark} the [ongoing
provision of]{.mark} a consumable piece of equipment or weapons
[systems]{.mark}** to its use for a specific purpose -- such as a
[shared]{.mark} [operational]{.mark} [objective]{.mark}. A key to this
type of conditionality lies in the United States being able to
**[control]{.mark} the [flow]{.mark}** of these good **[based on]{.mark}
a country's [behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, the United States
would need to be the only provider of these goods or coordinate with
those countries that could undermine the effort. Third, [a portion of
the total amount authorized for SSA to the partner country should be set
aside for a grant program]{.underline} modeled on those administered by
the Millennium Challenge Corporation in the development sector. [Partner
countries would be **[rewarding]{.mark} [for]{.mark} achieving strategic
and security goals that are linked to [governance]{.mark} and
[stability]{.mark}**. Policymakers should look to the development
community for lessons learned and best practices on how to effectively
employ positive conditionality. [Upfront]{.mark} positive
[conditionality]{.mark} will [strengthen]{.mark} security
[partnerships]{.mark} by **encouraging collaboration, [establish clear
expectations, and help]{.mark} align donor and recipient
[objectives]{.mark}.** Other options for positive conditionality include
developing SSA programs that make [additional funds]{.mark} or
assistance available [to]{.mark} [countries that achieve institutional
reform]{.mark} milestones, or programs that allocate additional copies
of defense articles to countries that are able to sustain the first
batch of articles for a set number of years]{.underline}. Finally, [when
designing conditioned security assistance programs, [U.S. policymakers
should]{.mark} **account for the activities and efforts of other donors

TOOLS FOR INFLUENCING PARTNER BEHAVIOR [The [U.S]{.mark}. and other
actors [can]{.mark} [use]{.mark} a range of tools to encourage changes
in conduct by state]{.underline} and non-state [partner
forces]{.underline}: ▪ Conditioning Support. [By setting **antecedent
[conditions of compliance with human rights]{.mark}** and
[i]{.mark}nternational humanitarian [law]{.mark} (such as implementation
of the Leahy laws), the United States [define]{.mark}s basic
[parameters]{.mark} for itself and its partners: a form of
conditionality on security assistance]{.underline}. [This approach
**[establishes]{.mark} up-front [expectations]{.mark}** that certain
activities---such as training for specific units or other types of
[assistance]{.mark}--- [will be discontinued if items are
misused]{.mark} or diverted, or if partners otherwise fail to fulfill
their legal obligations.]{.underline} But "ultimatum" conditionality,
where the United States publicly or privately threatens to end all
support due to partner conduct, seldom occurs for several reasons,
including the possibility that U.S. policymakers view the partnership as
too critical to U.S. interests. Attempts to use the threat of
deprivation as leverage are often thwarted by the reality that the U.S.
government is more invested in a partnership than the partner, or driven
by fears of peer competition over economics or influence.6 [The United
States can]{.underline}, however, [creatively augment]{.underline}
existing [conditionality by [calibrating]{.mark} and sequencing
assistance [based on]{.mark} an honest and **[transparent assessment of
risks]{.mark}** and the capabilities realistically needed to maintain
the relationship. This process [might]{.mark} [entail]{.mark}
**[requirements]{.mark} for specific training** based on past incidents
or gaps that create vulnerabilities, adding or strengthening terms for
arms transfers and purchases, **[limiting]{.mark} certain kinds of
[assistance]{.mark}** or materiel, or setting clearer expectations
through diplomatic engagement in response to patterns of behavior that
result in civilian harm]{.underline}. However, conditionality may not be
the most effective approach when issues primarily result from legitimate
capacity gaps. In these cases, [the United States could also
[place]{.mark}]{.underline} the sale of [[defense
items]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as munitions or aircraft,
[[within]{.mark} a [sequence]{.mark} that [requires
pre-assessment]{.mark}; robust, upfront, and continuous
[training]{.mark} and technical [assistance]{.mark}; and indirect
[operational oversight]{.mark} or access following the transfer to
ensure appropriate use of the equipment]{.underline}.7 [Follow through
on unacceptable behavior---in the form of **[cutting off support]{.mark}
to some security partners**---[may]{.mark} ultimately [be **necessary to
prevent U.S.**]{.mark} **government [liability]{.mark} for criminal
conduct** and to **[send]{.mark} a [powerful political message]{.mark}**

NATO's Political Cohesion", CSIS, 3/12/2021,

FGY

First, allies should recommit to abide by the principles of the North
Atlantic Treaty. These principles are often mentioned in NATO's official
communiqués in a cursory way, reflecting the limited attention given to
them within the alliance. Allies should, as a first step, adopt at the
highest level a declaration reaffirming the spirit and letter of the
Washington Treaty. This could happen in conjunction with or, ideally, be
imbedded in the new Strategic Concept that NATO is likely to launch
later this year. While this declaration is not an end in itself, it is a
first step to focus member countries and remind them what they will be
held accountable for. Regarding the substance of such a pledge, the
recent Reflection Group provides a good template with its proposed [code
of good
conduct](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2020/12/pdf/201201-Reflection-Group-Final-Report-Uni.pdf).
This includes the North Atlantic Treaty articles and two new tenets
focused on good behavior.

Second, [**[NATO should monitor]{.mark} individual [Allies'
compliance]{.mark}** with these principles. To have a meaningful effect,
such declaration needs to be complemented by an evaluation of its actual
implementation]{.underline}, on the basis of an annual report prepared
by the International Secretariat under the authority of the assistant
secretary general for political affairs or the deputy secretary general.
Building on existing metrics and findings (from [nongovernmental
organizations](https://freedomhouse.org/) or other international
organizations such as the [European
Union](https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/2020-rule-law-report-communication-and-country-chapters_en) or [Council
of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/greco/evaluations)), this report
would provide a basis for a periodic discussion on the political health
of the alliance. Ideally, the assessment would be linked to NATO's
resilience metrics, in effect underscoring their link with external
security threats. In addition to this cyclical process, an "emergency
brake" mechanism, similar to what the European Union has established
under its rule of law mechanism, could be put in place to allow an ally,
or group of allies, to request a discussion at the North Atlantic
Council or ministerial level when a serious violation of the declaration
by an individual ally occurs. Such discussion would shed light on the
problematic behavior of the ally in question and create political
pressure in itself.

Third, NATO should [**[raise]{.mark} the [political cost for allies who
break]{.mark} the [rules]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is admittedly the
most challenging course of action to implement given NATO's consensus
rule and the lack of legal mechanisms to sanction or expel members who
violate NATO values and principles. As such[, the alliance will need to
be creative and **[use]{.mark} a [mixture of incentives]{.mark} and
[disincentives]{.mark}**,]{.underline} proceeding to this stage only
when the above-mentioned monitoring and naming of violations of the code
of conduct (behind closed doors) fail to achieve results. [In terms of
incentives, allies should [make clear that decisions on
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} leadership positions, facility placement, or
ministerial locations (once again planned to rotate among capitals)
[[will consider **respect for the code of good conduct**]{.mark}. If
this fails to induce better behavior, **[allies should move to]{.mark}
[publicize the infringement]{.mark}**. If this further step also fails,
allies would need to consider restrictions on the problem member, which
could be decided by "[consensus minus
one](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-06-14/natos-enemies-within)"
and encompass the following measures: [suspension]{.mark} [from]{.mark}
participation in a specific committee, [military]{.mark} planning, or
exercises; suspension of [intel]{.mark}ligence [sharing]{.mark}; or
[cancellation of exercises]{.mark}, ministerial meetings, or visits of
NATO officials.]{.underline} Additionally, pressure can be brought to
bear through bilateral or [EU
channels](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/stronger-together-strategy-revitalize-transatlantic-power#toc-2-0-0),
in effect harnessing these instruments of power in support of NATO
objectives.

Conclusion

[**[Political will is vital]{.mark}** to prevent such a framework from
turning into a hollow shell.]{.underline} As the European Union has
shown, actual implementation of the rules is not a given even when they
are in place. NATO's approach will also need to be proportional and
graduated in order to give dialogue a chance to change behavior. If NATO
moves too quickly or aggressively, it risks widening divisions in the
alliance. Alternatively, if it moves too slowly or is overly technical
in its approach, it will fail to achieve its broader political objective
of repairing the values gap and restoring political cohesion. All in
all, [a careful balance between restraint and ambition will be paramount
in this endeavor to renew NATO's cohesion]{.underline}.

A Framework of Analysis for Civilian Harm and Human Rights Risks in
Security Cooperation

[[To]{.mark} [establish]{.mark} a more [suitable]{.mark}
[approach]{.mark} to managing the different kinds of risks associated
with different kinds of security cooperation, [policymakers]{.mark},
program managers and those who evaluate government practices from the
outside, [might look to]{.mark}ward a new framework of analysis that
**[establish]{.mark}es the basis for designing programs with
[adequate]{.mark} controls and [safeguards]{.mark}** in place. A
well-designed framework would 1) align with the emerging policy
consensus about the necessary components of effective and sustainable
security cooperation programs; 2) [identify]{.mark} the
[variables]{.mark} within several categories [of analysis]{.mark} (e.g.
political, legal, and operational) [that correspond with the
risks]{.mark} most worthy of attention; 3) **[allow for customised
application to]{.mark} a [specific]{.mark} [s]{.mark}ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation activity**; 4) [consider]{.mark} the [risks]{.mark}
that derive both from the 'partner' as well as from the 'acts of
partnership', and 5) lend itself to relatively clear policy
prescriptions that flow from the diagnosis it presents.]{.underline}

Each category of risks in the framework that follows includes a sample
of representative risk indicators, along with an associated claim about
how any perceived or deal deficits may impair the government's ability
to achieve a desired end-state with its partner. [Ideally, the
government could [use]{.mark} the [framework to make]{.mark} policy
decisions about the viability of partnership (e.g. as **[prerequisite
conditions]{.mark}**); to **design and modify partnership activities**;
and to prioritise and [integrate risk]{.mark} [mitigation]{.mark}
measures.]{.underline} Among options that may be considered in response
to analysis conducted on the basis of this framework, [policymakers or
program managers might consider moderating or reducing any forms of
assistance that materially enhance the lethality of security
forces]{.underline} (Kleinfeld 2018, 283--285).  [The government may
also elect to [sequence]{.mark} [support]{.mark} or **establish
pre-requisite requirements (e.g. [demonstrating]{.mark} a particular
[competency]{.mark}) [prior to providing]{.mark} certain kinds of
[assistance]{.mark}** or partaking in certain kinds of partnership
activities]{.underline}; (Shiel and Mahanty 2017, 32), [or to
[require]{.mark} more direct oversight ('operational [end-use
monitoring']{.mark})]{.underline} (Lewis 2019, 28) [of operations that
benefit from support or assistance.]{.underline}

Legal Compliance and Interoperability Factors

Questions related to the interaction between security cooperation and
international law fall loosely into two broad and distinct, but related,
categories. The first category includes questions that relate to the
obligations each state has under international law, how the cooperation
activity accrues responsibility to each for their own action and how
each might share responsibility for the actions of the other. [The
**degree of [legal liability imparted to states]{.mark} that participate
[in]{.mark} [s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation** activities largely
[depends]{.mark} [on]{.mark}]{.underline} the applicable legal theory of
state responsibility (and how it is being interpreted), and may depend
on [the nature and significance of the action, and whether and **[how
much]{.mark} a [state 'knows' about]{.mark} any internationally
[wrongful acts it is
supporting]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [\[4\]](https://www.e-ir.info/2021/02/16/human-rights-and-civilian-harm-in-security-cooperation-a-framework-of-analysis/#_ftn4) This
category of concerns also [[raises questions about]{.mark} any
[gaps]{.mark} that are [created]{.mark} [with respect to]{.mark}
[attribution]{.mark} and accountability for actions among states in
'coalitions of the willing']{.underline} (Tondini 2017, 11--13). Common
Article 1 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions also [obliges states to
'undertake to respect and to ensure respect' for international
humanitarian law (IHL)]{.underline}, [which could]{.underline}, in
theory, [create an additional obligation on states to promote respect
for IHL]{.underline} through both positive and negative means available.

Figure 5: Legal (partner state)

[Other questions relate to the **[degree of 'legal
interop]{.mark}erability'**]{.underline}[\[5\]](https://www.e-ir.info/2021/02/16/human-rights-and-civilian-harm-in-security-cooperation-a-framework-of-analysis/#_ftn5) [**[between]{.mark}
the [partnering states]{.mark} that [ensures]{.mark} [compatible
interpretation]{.mark}** and **[application]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
[law]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Goddard 2017, 211, 212). [Legal
interoperability might also [include]{.mark} a **[consideration for
how]{.mark} any formal or informal [legal arrangements dilute]{.mark} or
strengthen [accountability]{.mark}** to the law, e.g. in the form of
status of forces agreements that relieve one of the states of
accountability]{.underline} (Hussein, Moorehead and Horowitz 2018).
[Indicators in this category may be most useful for circumstances in
which the US is providing operational support or is involved with the
partner in joint operations]{.underline} (so-called 'partnered
operations').

Figure 6: Legal interoperability

Operational Factors

Operational capacity is unlikely to overcome factors at the political
level that enable, encourage or tolerate human rights abuses. But [some
degree of tradecraft competency is [necessary]{.mark} [for
**translating**]{.mark} **a [political commitment to]{.mark} [protecting
rights]{.mark} or preventing harm into operational
reality**]{.underline}. In the case of law enforcement operations,
police, or security forces acting as police, can avoid or reduce harm
through tactical proficiency in escalation of force or the effective use
of non-lethal methods (OHCHR 2004, 27). Similarly, [military forces can
take meaningful steps toward preventing, mitigating, and responding to
any ham they cause in the course of their own operations during the
conduct of hostilities]{.underline} (Lewis 2019, 38). (Note: the small
selection of sample variables here applies to military operations and
civilian harm, rather than law enforcement activities and human rights.
They are meant to be representative of the kinds of variables that may
be appropriate.)

Figure 7: Operational

Similar to the other categories within this framework, [operational
risks derive]{.underline} not only [from the characteristics of the
partners, but also from the acts of cooperation they
undertake]{.underline}. Just as **[[risks]{.mark} can
[emerge]{.mark}]{.underline} [[from]{.underline}]{.mark}** variations in
the understanding and application of law, so too can they stem from
[**[gaps in interoperability]{.mark}** in joint or partnered security
operations, to [include]{.mark} the [ways]{.mark} in which
[partners]{.mark} plan, prepare, and execute missions, and in the ways
in which they [respond to]{.mark} allegations or [reports of]{.mark}
harm or [abuse]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dalton et al. 2018, 20). [When
providing materiel or logistical support, the **[US may]{.mark} [benefit
from]{.mark} ensuring it is able to undertake 'operational
[oversight']{.mark}** (or 'operational end-use monitoring') so that it
can better understand the nature of the military activities it is
supporting.]{.underline} (Lewis 2019, 28).

#### The counterplan ensures [sustained domestic political support]{.underline} for SC by minimizing justifications for aid-reduction

[The experience of policymakers and practitioners in security and
humanitarian fields provide significant lessons about the best ways to
mitigate harm and protect civilians in the context of security
partnerships]{.underline}. The following are key emerging themes from
select discussions facilitated by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS), the Center for Civilians in Conflict
(CIVIC), and InterAction about practitioner experiences.

Reconciling Geopolitical Dynamics

[[In]{.mark} the **[face of]{.mark} significant [harm to
civilians]{.mark}** resulting from a partner's conduct, the **pursuit or
[continuation of]{.mark} the [partnership may compromise]{.mark}** the
**[political viability of its operations and may affect U.S.
cred]{.mark}ibility** [in relation to other states, in multilateral
forums]{.mark}, and in the eyes of the civilian population where the
United States pursues the partnership.]{.underline} For instance,
individuals familiar with the Saudi military intervention in Yemen
report that Yemeni citizens largely blame the United States and United
Kingdom for civilian loss of life resulting from Saudi-led coalition
airstrikes, given the U.S. and UK role in providing arms and logistical
support for the campaign. [[Continuing a partnership despite
harm]{.mark} to civilians can also **[erode domestic support]{.mark}**,
both [in the U.S. Congress and the public. U.S.]{.mark} foreign
[policy]{.mark} choices often [prioritize]{.mark} relationships or
[perceived security interests]{.mark} [at]{.mark} the [expense
of]{.mark} ensuring that partners have the capacity and commitment to
maximize the protection of civilians, or even to meet their [obligations
under i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}. The pressure to contend with a
threat, the political or economic urgency of cooperation, lack of
professional partner capacity, or simply the status quo of arms deals
and security partnerships can obscure or overwhelm other, real costs.
When the United States believes that partner conduct can or will
improve, or that the near-term benefits of partnership outweigh the
short- and long-term costs, the United States may [tolerate]{.mark}
greater levels of [harm]{.mark} to civilians---including **possible
patterns of [human]{.mark} [rights]{.mark} and international
humanitarian law** **[violations]{.mark}**---arising from the conduct of
partner countries.]{.underline} Similarly, the United States has pursued
partnerships with non-state armed groups in the context of volatile and
evolving armed conflicts, where [the United States focuses on its
near-term security objectives while giving **minimal consideration to
the longer-term implications** of the partnership and the conduct of
those partners towards civilian populations.]{.underline} Policymakers
are ultimately responsible for placing the short-term costs and benefits
of partnership within the broader context of strategic objectives and
enduring interests. In order to accurately assess the correlation
between a partnership and its strategic ends, policymakers must have a
realistic and accurate understanding of the benefits and limitations of
partnership. [[Current]{.mark} [practice suggests]{.mark} that although
[policymakers may express concerns]{.mark} about the costs of specific
partnerships, the [policy options]{.mark} available to them---and U.S.
capacities to encourage changes in partner behavior and policy---[are
**not sufficient**]{.mark} **to address critical issues related to
civilian harm**]{.underline}. Many of the good practices highlighted in
this report come from U.S. and NATO experience in Afghanistan. But
recent partnered operations indicate that lessons from Afghanistan are
not systematized across U.S. security partnerships and military
operations and, indeed, have not been sustained in re-escalation in
military operations in Afghanistan itself.

Challenges to Security Cooperation Success

Our research also highlights various challenges that can reduce
prospects for success in security cooperation. Some of these aspects can
be controlled by the assistance provider and can (and should) be
improved upon; others are inherent in or under the control of partners
and are things the United States needs to keep in mind when managing its
expectations for future security cooperation efforts.

First among these challenges relates to a previous section of my
testimony today: partner willingness. One of the findings of our
research is that you can't want it more than they do.9 Lack of partner
willingness can disrupt security cooperation at many levels, any of
which can result in delay, diminished success, or outright failure.
Examples include partners unwilling to participate in security
cooperation (and this can be at the ministerial level, command level, or
level of individual troop trainees), partners willing to participate but
unwilling to focus their efforts in areas of U.S. strategic interest,
partners unwilling to use the capacity built for the intended purpose
(often because they would prefer to use it for something else), and
partners unwilling to respect human rights while benefiting from and
using the capabilities provided by security cooperation.

[Many of the [challenges to s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation
success [stem from shortcomings in U]{.mark}.S.
[practices]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because of funding and budgetary cycles
and changing priorities, [the United States funds and delivers security
cooperation inconsistently, and that decreases effectiveness. This
problem is [exacerbated with partners who]{.mark} face **significant
[contextual]{.mark} [challenges]{.mark}**.]{.underline} When the United
States drops the ball with a robust partner, either that partner picks
it up or the ball floats to some extent. When the United States drops
the ball with a partner that faces significant contextual challenges,
the ball sinks.

[**[Inadequate]{.mark} sustainment [planning]{.mark}** hurts security
cooperation effectiveness]{.underline}, too. As noted, unless they are
sustained, [[forces]{.mark} and capabilities built through partner
[capacity-building]{.mark} efforts [rapidly]{.mark} atrophy. Some
partners have resources to dedicate to sustainment, as well as forces
with backgrounds and training that support maintenance, and some do not.
Even where [sustainment]{.mark} support from the partner is possible, it
[needs to be an integrated part of]{.mark} the [overall]{.mark} security
cooperation [plan]{.mark}.]{.underline} When partners lack the resources
necessary for sustainment, sustainment needs to be provided as part of
the security cooperation package.

[Similarly, a **[lack of flexibility]{.mark}** in security cooperation
constrains its effectiveness. The administrative requirements of
security cooperation often [prevent executors from wielding]{.mark}
necessary [flexibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, in one
country, the commander of the partner formation designated for security
cooperation refused to allow his troops to participate. U.S. personnel
located a similar formation in the same municipality whose commander was
enthusiastic about the planned activities, but program procedures
prevented U.S. personnel from making the needed shift and engaging with
the willing formation. In another case, [partner stakeholders were
delaying participation in planned activities, but materiel and
**[resources]{.mark} were still [being delivered]{.mark} to the
partner.** **[U.S. personnel]{.mark} were extremely [frustrated]{.mark}
that [they could not control]{.mark} the [flow]{.mark} of resources
sufficiently [to use that as an incentive]{.mark} for better partner
participation**.]{.underline}

These last three problems stem in part from weaknesses in the
authorities. [While the patchwork of authorities available to fund and
support security cooperation enables a wide range of activities, the
authorities rarely support an activity for more than a year or two at a
time, resulting in uncertainty about their continuation. Programs under
Title 10 authorities are short duration; some Title 22
authoritie]{.underline}s (such as Foreign Military Sales and Foreign
Military Financing) [can be more enduring but have fairly limited scope
and application. There are few authorities that allow for sustainment
support]{.underline}, and [none]{.underline} that I am aware of [can
support sustainment of capabilities built as part of some other
effort.]{.underline} While needs, objectives, and the situation on the
ground can change fairly quickly, once an effort is launched and funded
by a program, it is difficult to change important execution details.

Filling the policy gap: civilian protection and security assistance

The absence of a comprehensive US strategy in Yemen between 2015--2018
is a symptom of a larger problem: Although the [[US]{.mark}]{.underline}
is the world's largest dealer of military arms, it [**[does not
have]{.mark} a [policy]{.mark} [addressing]{.mark} [civilian]{.mark}
[protection challenges]{.mark}** **that** come when the recipient of
military assistance uses force in armed conflict]{.underline}. [The only
safeguards are the Leahy law and a basic requirement that partner
military forces comply with IHL]{.underline}.41 For example, DOD
provides basic training regarding IHL through institutions such as
Defense Institute of International Legal Studies (DIILS). [Previous
[analysis]{.mark} [shows]{.mark} that these **[safeguards are]{.mark}
necessary but [not sufficient]{.mark}** for avoiding significant harm to
civilians in armed conflict: many **[civilians]{.mark} [can be
harmed]{.mark}, and [medical]{.mark} [facilities]{.mark} and
[critical]{.mark} [infra]{.mark}structure can be [damaged]{.mark}**,
even when military forces do not violate international]{.underline}
[law]{.underline}.42 [Given this policy gap, [how can]{.mark} the [US
manage]{.mark} differing interests and [risks]{.mark} with respect to
civilian protection?]{.underline} The overall construct in the Leahy law
is instructive here; it includes two types of activities: [1. Improving
operational effectiveness: **[general security assistance]{.mark}** that
[can]{.mark} [include]{.mark} military [equipment]{.mark} and weapons,
tactical [training]{.mark}, and [operational support]{.mark} 2.
**[Promoting]{.mark} responsible [behavior]{.mark}**: training and
education on IHL and human rights law **[to]{.mark} [avoid]{.mark} gross
[violations of human rights]{.mark}**, and working with the partner
military and their justice system to **promote accountability**.
**[When]{.mark} [specific concerns arise]{.mark} with a partner, the
[first]{.mark}** (improving operational effectiveness) **[can be
curtailed]{.mark} or paused while the [second]{.mark} is continued**, or
even [intensified]{.mark}, with the intent of remediation and restoring
the security assistance relationship. This overall approach can also be
taken with civilian protection]{.underline}. The specific tools for
promoting responsible behavior will differ, but the overall approach
helps promote the interest of both the US and the partner force, and the
security of civilians. This approach to managing risk in security
assistance is shown in Figure 2.

BACKSLIDING AWAY

In the early years of this century, some observers, including me,
worried that the credibility of NATO\'s admission criteria was being
undermined by new members that managed to meet NATO\'s standards only to
backslide after joining the alliance. [When international organ-
izations increase their membership, they often become more un- wieldy
and slow to act. Greater numbers mean greater diversity in interests and
priorities. [NATO]{.mark} [argued]{.mark} that a [shared commitment to
liberal democracy would mitigate]{.mark} this [challenge]{.mark}, but
that would be [true **only** if new members sustained those
values]{.mark} **[after]{.mark}** [accession]{.mark}]{.underline}. At
the time, I feared that long-standing NATO members were being ex-
ploited by states such as Hungary that had made promises of political
reform they did not intend to keep. [[Giving]{.mark}
[backsliders]{.mark} a **[free pass]{.mark}** [would harm NATO\'s
credibility]{.mark} and detract from its ability to cultivate liberal
values]{.underline}. [And if NATO became unwilling to enforce its
member- ship requirements, the United States\' most important
multilateral alli- ance would become **rife with weak
links**]{.underline}.

## solvency -- say yes -- general 

### 2nc -- say yes

#### Bargaining is effective, even with countries [who aren't currently aligned with US interests]{.underline} -- furthers their economic and political stability

("US Military Aid and Recipient State Cooperation", *Foreign Policy
Analysis*, July 2011, Vol. 7, No. 3,
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/24909798>) FGY

According to this model, [a **[powerful state can use military
assistance as leverage]{.mark}** to [compel]{.mark} recipient
[state]{.mark} [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this
straightforward model, [military aid is a source of **bargaining power**
because [donors]{.mark} can **[link benefits to]{.mark} [desired]{.mark}
[behavior]{.mark}** by recipients.]{.underline} This theory [builds on
early work on asymmetrical influence]{.underline}. Keohane and Nye.
(1977) argue, for example, that [dominant states can influence the
foreign policy of dependent states using aid [allocations]{.mark} to
**[reward or punish]{.mark} past [behavior]{.mark}** and to act as an
**[incentive]{.mark} that [encourages]{.mark} future
[compliance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} More recently, Palmer, Wohlander,
and Clifton Morgan (2002) contend that [\"Foreign aid, at the most
general level, is a tool of influence---states give it because they
believe it encourages recipients to take desired actions\".]{.underline}
Similarly, Bueno de Mesquita and Smith (2007) propose a model in which
[donors give foreign aid to **[purchase]{.mark} [policy
support]{.mark}** from recipients.]{.underline} States are most likely
to give aid to [\"countries **whose [leaders]{.mark} do [not inherently
support]{.mark} the [policies]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a prospective
[donor]{.mark}** but [are **willing to back**]{.mark} **those [policies
in exchange for aid]{.mark} sufficient [to improve]{.mark} their
[political]{.mark} and economic [welfare]{.mark}**\"]{.underline} (254).
[If [military aid gives the US bargaining power]{.mark}, [recipient
states that receive]{.mark} larger amounts of [aid]{.mark} and those
that have a greater need for assistance [should be]{.mark} more [willing
to accommodate]{.mark} their foreign policy to [US
preferences]{.mark}]{.underline}. While Derouen and Heo (2004) suggest
that aid is more often used as an ex post reward than as an ex ante
inducement, we suspect that the relationship is circular; a state\'s
level of cooperation with the United States influences the amount of aid
it receives and the amount of aid a state receives influences subsequent
levels of cooperation with the United States. The example of US military
aid to Georgia is consistent with the expectations of the Arms for
Influence model. US military aid to Georgia spiked from an average of
\$2.76 million per year from 1991-2001 to \$92 million in 2002 and then
aver aged \$13.9 million per year between 2003 and 2006 (USAJD 2006).
Most aid was directed toward the 2002-2003 Georgia Train and Equip
Program (GTEP) (Shan ker 2002). As part of GTEP, about 2,000 Georgian
soldiers were trained by US military personnel and equipped with
American weapons and technology in order to better prepare Georgia to
help the United States counter global terrorism (United States
Department of Defense 2002). One year after the initiation of the GTEP,
Georgia was a dedicated member of the \"coalition of the willing\" that
sup ported the US war in Iraq. In the years after the Rose Revolution of
2003, new President Mikheil Saakashvili sent a total of 2,000 soldiers
to support US opera tions in Iraq, making it the third largest
contributor of forces by 2007. Aiding the United States in Iraq was part
of a larger pattern of cooperative behavior by Geor gia; our events data
indicate that Georgia\'s overall level of cooperation with the United
States more than tripled after 2002 (King and Lowe 2003a,b)

#### Material inducements are a sufficient incentive

Ross and **Dalton 20**, Tommy Ross, non-resident senior associate at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Melissa Dalton,
directs the Cooperative Defense Project and is a senior fellow and
deputy director of the International Security Program at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, ("A ROADMAP FOR BETTER CHOICES FROM
SECURITY PARTNERS," *War on the Rocks*,
<https://warontherocks.com/2020/01/a-roadmap-for-better-choices-from-security-partners/>)

**[Toward]{.underline}** a Framework for **[Positive
Conditionality]{.underline}**

What if the United States had approached its relationship with Uganda
differently in pursuit of shared objectives? It's possible that if the
United States had structured its assistance in a way that incentivized
Uganda's politicians and security officials to take specific steps
toward clearly --- and mutually --- identified milestones, that could
have led to the development of stronger capabilities for and commitment
to civilian protection and governance by Uganda's military over time.
Instead, [a **reactive** posture to human rights and corruption
transgressions has]{.underline} had **[limited effects]{.underline}**,
and punitive measures may only strain the relationship and undermine
possibilities for cooperation.

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should]{.mark} [develop]{.mark} a
**framework for [positive conditionality]{.mark}** [in
**security**]{.mark}]{.underline} sector [**[assistance]{.mark}** to
better shape political and security outcomes with partner
countries]{.underline}. [On balance an affirmative framework will
[offer]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates the [**widest
latitude** in shaping outcomes]{.mark} in a broad range of
circumstances]{.underline}. This approach also does not rule out the
sequencing of punitive steps --- or a pause to assess partner
performance.

First, [this framework assumes]{.underline} [an **ex
ante**]{.underline}/**[positive]{.underline}** [approach to
conditionality]{.underline}, at least in some manner. With the U.S.
government providing security sector assistance to nearly 200 countries
around the world, it is unlikely that the United States will be
initiating a security sector assistance relationship wholly from
scratch. [An ex ante approach would [focus on developing concrete
plans]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including [triggers for]{.mark} **clearly
identified** [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[at the
inception]{.underline}** of an initiative or set **[of
programs]{.underline}**. It should involve a plan covering at least five
years, identifying ultimate objectives and intermediate milestones, a
theory of change for how objectives will be achieved, and metrics to
provide a basis for assessing progress. [[Policymakers]{.mark} and
planners can then [link]{.mark} [conditions to
milestones]{.mark}]{.underline} and metrics. Moreover, such an approach
builds on recognized best practices for capacity-building initiatives.

Second, [the framework [must include a partner
government's]{.mark}]{.underline} mutual participation in the creation
of the assistance plan, the identification of objectives, and the
**[[agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}** [on conditions]{.underline}. [The
partner will be more incentivized to progress toward objectives when
it]{.underline} understands and **[commits to such
objectives]{.underline}** based on its own identified interests. A
memorandum of understanding, bilateral compact, or some other formal
written instrument can commit both parties to its terms.

Third, [the framework should structure conditions as positive
inducements]{.underline} for the recipient to take steps toward
milestones or objectives. [[Milestones]{.mark} could
[include]{.mark}]{.underline} completion of defense
**[[institutional]{.mark} [reforms]{.mark}]{.underline}**, starting with
development of a process to align budget to strategy, progressing to
completion of a first budget cycle with the new process, and culminating
in institutionalization of the process through policy and/or law. They
might also include **[[progress toward capability]{.mark} or
[interoperability]{.mark} [milestones]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g.,
ability to conduct nighttime counter-terrorism operations in accordance
with the laws of armed conflict or command and control and intelligence
integration across platforms and systems). In addition, milestones could
include [transparency and accountability activities]{.underline} (e.g.,
publication of public budget, completion of audit, investigation of
specific incidents of resource waste and abuse or diversion,
establishment and activity of an independent third-party investigative
unit for accountability).

[[Partners]{.mark} **[will likely respond]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
[inducements]{.mark} that are [material in nature]{.mark}]{.underline},
[including [access]{.mark} [to]{.mark} an expanded [variety of **types**
of assistance]{.mark} and an **[expanded]{.mark} [quantity]{.mark}** of
assistance]{.underline}. However, [partners may also value incentives
such as eligibility for key agreements to [facilitate]{.mark}
[access]{.mark} and [info]{.mark}rmation and/or [tech]{.mark}nology
[sharing]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., acquisition and cross-servicing,
general security of military information, etc.) [or eligibility for
**[expanded]{.mark} [partnership]{.mark}
[opportunities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., National Guard State
Partnership Program or the Military Personnel Exchange Program).
Moreover, incentives may also be political, such as access to membership
in certain organizations or eligibility for certain agreements.

#### Security Cooperation provides [sufficient]{.underline} leverage

**Tecott 21**, PhD in Political Science @ MIT (Rachel, "The Cult of the
Persuasive: The U.S. Military's Aversion to Coercion in Security
Assistance," Proquest Dissertations)

[Recipients are more likely to follow U.S. direction when the United
States combines teaching]{.underline} and persuasion
**[with]{.underline}** **[[bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark}** and/or
direct command. [Bargaining is [well suited to]{.mark} the context
of]{.underline} SFA \[**[[Security]{.underline}]{.mark}** Force
**[[Assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**\]. Bargaining is in a sense a much
simpler, less ambitious influence strategy than persuasion. This study
argues that [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has ample
bargaining]{.mark} [power in]{.mark} most cases of [**security
assistance**, and]{.mark} is therefore **well[-positioned to wield
carrots and sticks]{.mark}** to shape recipient
decision-making]{.underline}. Bargaining power, in Glenn Snyder's
framework, varies as a function of the 54 two sides' relative
dependence, commitment, and interest in the object of bargaining.59
Lumpy (each variable could be further subdivided into many constituent
pieces), subjective, and consequently hard to measure as those variables
are, the argument that recipients of United States SFA, particularly in
the context of severe internal threats, have more bargaining power than
the United States, does not hold up to scrutiny. [[Recipients
o]{.mark}f]{.underline} SFA \[**[Security]{.underline}** Force
**[[Assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] may not always depend for their
survival on the United States, but they **[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}**
almost [[always]{.mark} far more [dependent on]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates than the United States is on
them]{.underline}. With respect to relative commitment, SFA \[Security
Force Assistance\] recipients often view the U.S. commitment to an SFA
\[Security Force Assistance\] partnership, or to the leaders themselves,
as fickle. In such cases, [the United States' relative lack of
commitment should be a bargaining asset, because it should help increase
the credibility of its threats to withdraw support]{.underline} or to
replace the leadership. Moreover, SFA \[**[Security]{.underline}** Force
**[[Assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** as
**[[conducive]{.mark} to]{.underline}** the establishment of
[credibility with respect to promises of carrots and threats of
sticks]{.underline} as any international partnership can be. Providers
need not rely on the nuclear threats of complete support or total
abandonment. Rather, SFA \[[Security]{.underline} Force
[Assistance]{.underline}\] [relationships [create]{.mark} myriad
[opportunities for]{.mark} the application of [calibrated]{.mark}
[carrots]{.mark} ranging from]{.underline} the provision of additional
ammunition to a particular unit, to [a dramatic increase in the scale of
U.S. assistance]{.underline} to the recipient military as a whole, [and
calibrated sticks ranging from]{.underline} the disbanding of a
particular unit, to [a [dramatic decrease in
assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}, to the ouster of the civilian leader.
SFA \[[Security]{.underline} Force [Assistance]{.underline}\]
[relationships are also typically long-term,]{.underline} and involve
iterated interactions between provider and recipient. [There is,
therefore, an extended shadow of the future]{.underline},60 and
opportunities for the United States to demonstrate the credibility of
its promises and threats through consistent follow-through. These two
features of SFA \[[Security]{.underline} Force
[Assistance]{.underline}\] [relationships]{.underline}---the
opportunities for calibrated carrots and sticks, and the shadow of the
future---**[[should]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[help to]{.mark}
[resolve]{.mark} the [credibility problem]{.mark} that plagues, for
instance, the challenge of extended nuclear deterrence]{.underline}. In
the context of SFA, [threats to decrease support]{.underline} to a unit
[or increase support]{.underline} to a unit, or even to support or oust
a civilian leader, [are far less difficult than the challenge the United
States faced in its efforts to convince the Soviet Union that it would
trade New York for Paris]{.underline}. SFA \[Security Force Assistance\]
is the United States trying to convince brigade commanders that their
interests are better served following U.S. direction to remove a corrupt
battalion commander than ignoring that direction. It may not be an easy
task, but **[[the United States certainly has the
carrots]{.mark}]{.underline}** and sticks [**[to do it]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} the context of SFA
\[**[[Security]{.underline}]{.mark}** Force
**[[Assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] **[[is more conducive than
most]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### 2nc -- say yes -- pressure 

#### NATO says yes -- allies see it as an opportunity to [expand their sphere of influence]{.underline}, others rely on security assistance to [counter Russia and China]{.underline} and face [international pressure]{.underline} to cooperate

Fourth, NATO should revisit its partnership policy, which allows the
alliance to delegate certain aspects of resilience to third countries
and actors that are better placed. The partnership policy has not been
reformed since 2011, when the alliance was experimenting with the idea
of "going global." [NATO presently comprises 30 allied
countries]{.underline}---soon 32, when Sweden and Finland expectedly
join. However, it also has as many as 43 partners in Europe and around
the world, from Columbia to Mauritania, [with little idea of what their
partnerships are supposed to add. [NATO needs to
better [differentiate](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03071847.2021.1945486) among]{.mark}
its [partners]{.mark} as it engages competition [with illiberal
contenders]{.mark}; given the fault lines of the conflict,
technologically advanced and **[like-minded liberal
partners]{.mark}**]{.underline} should [[**[assume greater
importance]{.underline}**](https://transatlanticrelations.org/publications/forward-resilience-protecting-society-in-an-interconnected-world/).]{.mark}
[This primarily concerns NATO's partnership]{.underline} with the
European Union and Switzerland due to their shared resilience across
[technologically advanced and highly integrated countries that share the
same values.]{.underline} [NATO [partners in]{.mark} the Western
[Balkans]{.mark}, [Georgia]{.mark} and obviously Ukraine [need]{.mark}
the **[resilience assistance that NATO can provide them to defend
against Russian]{.mark} and [Chinese subversion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Additionally, the [Asia-Pacific partners]{.mark}---Japan, South Korea,
Australia and New Zealand---are [gaining prominence due to the values
they share with NATO and]{.mark} their advanced experience with
technological and economic decoupling from China in sectors sensitive
for national security.]{.underline}

#### That means that the affirmative's "say yes" justifications apply to the counterplan as well

(Stephen, "How to Improve Return on Investment for Security Assistance,"

Negative conditionality, which is what many people think of when the
idea of conditioning assistance comes up, entails threatening to end,
suspend, or reduce assistance if conditions are not met.
[[Positive]{.mark} [conditionality]{.mark}]{.underline}, which has been
used for years in the development world, [[promises assistance in return
for "good behavior]{.mark}" that is defined in advance]{.underline}.
Rather than authorizing aid and then withholding it, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates would [identify]{.mark} [positive
actions]{.mark} that a [recipient is
considering]{.mark}]{.underline}---or at least open to taking---[and
then incentivize them]{.underline}. Critically, we argue the process of
identifying these actions and benchmarks to measure them should be done
in consultation with the recipient. This would help to reduce the
potential for mismanaged expectations on either side and get the
recipient more invested in the process, signaling that it is a partner
and not merely a proxy benefiting from U.S. paternalism. It would also
reduce the chances for caving by the United States. [[Positive
conditionality may]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be]{.mark} the **[most
optimal route]{.mark}** for cases [where the United States has little
leverage]{.mark} over a recipient, [**but** where the
**recipient**]{.mark} **[desires]{.mark} [further U.S.
engagement]{.mark} and investment**]{.underline}. We envision at least
three different ways to implement this approach.

### 2nc -- say yes -- civil society

#### Recipient-states say yes. The counterplan builds support through political pressure, even if the government is initially reluctant

**Goldberg 21**, master\'s degree in International Affairs from
Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, et al, (Ilan, "A
People-First U.S. Assistance Strategy for the Middle East," *Center for

Third, by creating a regional pool of funds [the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} could generate competition among
regional states that [[could incentivize reforms]{.underline}]{.mark}
and better projects. Proposals for various projects could be judged
across the region and given to the most compelling investments based on
their impact on democracy and development objectives instead of starting
with an assistance number for each country. Recent research demonstrates
that introducing competition among the beneficiaries of
[[foreign]{.mark} [assistance]{.mark}]{.underline} and shifting aid
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}**ward [successfully [reform]{.mark}ing
[countries]{.mark} **[raises]{.mark} the [enticements]{.mark} for
reform**]{.underline}.26 Still, the leverage of U.S. assistance should
not be overstated, particularly in the Middle East where Gulf countries
provide significantly more assistance with no strings attached. However,
as evidence from the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) shows,
[**[positive conditionality]{.mark}** can [provide]{.mark} that
**[extra]{.mark} [nudge]{.mark}** [to catalyze
reform]{.mark}]{.underline} where there is already a willingness to do
so. A recent Brookings Institution study found that
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called MCC [effect [allows]{.mark}
"'sympathetic [interlocutors' in]{.mark}]{.underline} low- and
lower-middle income [[countries]{.mark} [who consider the prospect
of]{.mark} receiving [the]{.mark}]{.underline} MCC's '[[good
housekeeping seal of approval']{.underline}]{.mark}---[and access to
hundreds of [millions of dollars in]{.mark}]{.underline} flexible grant
[[assistance]{.mark} from the U.S government]{.underline}---[as an
[opportunity to **rally domestic reform**]{.mark} **[efforts]{.mark}**
and **[neutralize]{.mark} anti-reform
[opposition]{.mark}**]{.underline}."27

#### Even if the government drags their feet, US prioritization of democracy builds support for civil society and political opposition that guarantees say yes.

Endowment for International Peace and Benjamin Press, research assistant

In addition, [[policymakers]{.mark} should not limit their expectations
for positive change only to potential liberalizing actions by the
partner government]{.underline}. They should also ask whether [[greater
attention]{.mark} from the United States [on]{.mark} [democracy]{.mark}
issues helps **[bolster]{.mark} the [will]{.mark} and [steadfastness of
embattled leaders in civil society]{.mark}** or the **[political
opposition]{.mark} of the country** in question]{.underline}. [A [common
mistake is to think of]{.mark} the push on [democracy]{.mark} and rights
issues [with]{.mark} a [problematic security partner only in terms
of]{.mark} effects on the [government]{.mark}. [But]{.mark} other parts
of the political and civic [communities]{.mark} [are highly important
and reactive]{.mark} to external signals]{.underline}. However, U.S.
policymakers need to be careful of crossing the line between support and
perceived (or real) interference in a foreign country's domestic
politics. For example, pushing the government hard on maintaining
electoral integrity may be more effective than expressing direct support
for opposition forces.

Critics of conditionality within the United States government often
argue that it has rarely directly changed the domestic decisionmaking of
U.S. allies.50 However, [advocates of conditionality]{.underline} within
the U.S. government [have argued that withholding assistance and
cooperation is not always about direct effect; in fact,
[withholding]{.mark} [items]{.mark} [to partner governments]{.mark} that
they could use to support internal repression [signals]{.mark} the
**[broader range of goals]{.mark}** and objectives constitutive of U.S.
foreign policy, [including **U.S. values**]{.mark} **and the [role of
international norms]{.mark}**. There is a [**signaling function** of
conditionality]{.mark}, since the United States can use it to
[send]{.mark} a [message]{.mark} [of discontent to]{.mark}
the]{.underline} local [[governments]{.mark} in question [and]{.mark},
more importantly, **to their [publics]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Therefore,
while many within and outside of the U.S. government are debating the
relative impact of the recent Bahrain and Egypt conditionality
exercises, the larger discussion will continue about the purpose of
conditionality. Up for debate is how U.S. policymakers use it, either
proactively or retroactively, and how specifically the United States
must tie the specific punishment to the desired change of behavior in a
partner state. Such discussion must also account for concerns among some
that conditioning assistance could deleteriously affect other U.S.
objectives in the recipient country or its region. However, because it
is nearly impossible to prove that partners have "punished" the United
States by reducing cooperation in one area as a direct result of
dissatisfaction with U.S. policy in another area, the concern about
tradeoffs will remain largely speculative.

### 2nc -- say yes -- EDT-specific 

#### New security challenges underscore the importance of [embedding democratic values]{.underline} in emerging tech to NATO allies

- EDT = Emerging and Disruptive Technologies

[Key [Drivers of NATO Innovation in EDTs]{.mark}]{.underline}

There is an obvious prioritization in NATO's innovation efforts in
relation to five key drivers.

The first is that NATO's defense and technological innovation does not
occur in a political, ideological, or strategic vacuum. [The [rise of
China]{.mark} as a long-term great-power competitor, the [return of
Russian revisionism]{.mark}, the **rapid progress and
"[democratization]{.mark}" [of]{.mark} advanced [tech]{.mark}nologies**
among state and non-state actors, and [new]{.mark} transnational
security [challenges like climate change]{.mark} shape the strategic
environment and [set]{.mark} new **[requirements for
innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** Though [allies are concerned with
Russia's adoption of EDTs, Chinese investment and leadership ambitions
in the adoption of these technologies is the main geopolitical driver
behind allied innovation plans.]{.underline}11

The second and related driver is maintaining a technological edge. [The
**[perception that tech]{.mark}nological [dominance]{.mark}** (and the
[imperative to avoid]{.mark} strategic technological [surprise]{.mark})
**[is]{.mark} an [inherent strategic advantage is well established
in]{.mark} the strategic [culture of NATO and]{.mark}** many
**[allies]{.mark}.** Over the past two decades, the technological
dominance of the West---from stealth to long-range precision strike
capabilities---has been increasingly challenged, especially by Russia
and China. Officially, NATO and some of the leading allies continue to
pursue the goal of maintaining a technological edge---in relation to
EDTs]{.underline}.12 [This message is [an essential component]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [NATO's]{.mark} [geopolitical]{.mark} [signaling]{.mark} and
**consistent with its policy of competing from a position of strength**.
However, there is a [growing]{.mark} informal [recognition among the
allies of]{.mark} the [magnitude of the challenge]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[maintain]{.mark} technological [dominance]{.mark} across all critical
emerging technologies. In view of the trajectory of Chinese investment
in EDTs, it is important for NATO to develop its resilience, deterrence,
and defense, to improve its adaptability, and to be prepared to mitigate
adverse conditions where rivals temporarily achieve technological parity
or even dominance.]{.underline}

The third driver is to foster the interoperability of military
capabilities that are enabled by emerging technologies13 and to
incentivize transatlantic defense cooperation on EDTs to avoid or bridge
technology gaps between allies. This goes to the core of NATO's mission
to deter and defend against threats, but it is an enduring challenge.
Streamlining standardization and testing, evaluation, verification, and
validation procedures remains important. However, NATO should also
double down on its efforts to ensure greater compliance with
interoperability and baseline requirements for the security of critical
infrastructure. Recent challenges in relation to national compliance
with the 2019 NATO requirements for security of telecommunications
infrastructure are a case in point, but there are wider and enduring
challenges with hardware and communications interoperability.14 While
the plans for the new Defence Innovation Accelerator promise to
contribute to maintaining NATO's technological edge, it also remains to
be seen whether they will contribute sufficiently to building technology
capacity among some of the smaller and more vulnerable allies. As they
establish governance procedures and participation rules, allies need to
mitigate the risk that the accelerator could contribute to a two-speed,
two-tier alliance, dividing the technology haves from the technology
have-nots.

The fourth driver is [a [desire to lead in]{.mark} [setting]{.mark}
[global]{.mark}, normative [EDTs]{.mark}
[governance]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Advisory Group on Emerging and
Disruptive Technologies, for example, has emphasized that [NATO "is
exceptionally well placed to be a global driver of a values-based
innovation agenda."]{.underline}15 [**[Democratic values are at]{.mark}
the [core of what defines security for transatlantic allies]{.mark}**
and the target of adversarial subversive measures. Consequently,
**[embedding]{.mark} [democratic values into]{.mark} the
[development]{.mark}, [adoption]{.mark}, and [use]{.mark} of EDTs by the
allies [is key to NATO's mission]{.mark}**. Thus, innovation efforts
need to be closer linked to NATO's democracy-centered tech diplomacy
with like-minded global partners]{.underline}, some of whom could be
invited to join the Defence Innovation Accelerator.

The fifth driver is organizational and procedural change, notably to
build "a resilient innovation pipeline for the alliance"16 and a
sustainable innovation ecosystem. This is a more challenging undertaking
than it may first appear. Military organizations have historically
innovated more coherently and efficiently than other public
organizations.17 However, in the case of EDTs, this pattern is
challenged. NATO and allied military organizations are not driving
technological progress, are not the main agents of innovation, and
depend on effective civilian-military collaboration for their own
innovation efforts.

#### **Mounting danger in emerging tech means that NATO allies are [willing to cooperate]{.underline} to counter threats** 

**Harper 22** -- Jon Harper, managing editor of DefenseScoop covering
the Pentagon and military technology ("Emerging tech to have prominent
role in NATO's new strategic concept", 6/1/2022,

Emerging and disruptive technologies will be a key focus area of NATO's
new Strategic Concept which will be unveiled later this month, the U.S.
ambassador to the alliance told reporters Wednesday.

The document is expected to be adopted at the upcoming NATO summit in
Madrid, marking the first time in more than a decade that the
transatlantic military pact has released a new Strategic Concept. The
guidance sets the alliance's strategy and security tasks, outlines the
challenges and opportunities it faces in a changing security
environment, and provides direction for its political and military
implementation.

There will be "a lot on new threats and challenges, a heavier emphasis
on things like emerging and disruptive technologies, heavier emphasis on
new domains like cyber and space, more on climate change," U.S.
Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told the Defense Writers Group in
Washington.

Smith did not elaborate on what the emerging technologies are, and
FedScoop did not have the opportunity to ask her about them before the
meeting with reporters ended.

However, [**[individual members of NATO]{.mark} have already their
[signaled]{.mark} [interest and concerns]{.mark}** [about]{.mark}
unmanned systems, [AI]{.mark}, [autonomy]{.mark} and
[hypersonics]{.mark}, among other [emerging]{.mark}
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, last week senior
Pentagon officials and their U.K. counterparts signed an Artificial
Intelligence Cooperation Statement of Intent, setting shared strategic
objectives related to AI readiness. The agreement "will deepen AI
cooperation between the two Allies, maintaining and increasing
interoperability and promoting values-based global leadership for the
responsible development, procurement, and use of AI in defense,"
according to a DOD news release.

Non-NATO members from the Asia-Pacific region will also be attending the
summit for the first time, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and
South Korea. [The **[threat posed by Russia]{.mark} and [China]{.mark}**
will be addressed]{.underline} during discussions and in the new
Strategic Concept.

At the meeting [[leaders]{.mark} will have an opportunity "to have a
conversation about what we're both seeing]{.underline}. It's been
interesting for me to watch, say, [**[countries]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the
[Asia]{.mark}-Pacific [talk about hybrid threats]{.mark}** on their side
of the Pacific, how are they [grappling with disinfo]{.mark}rmation,
[cyberattacks]{.mark}, the [aggressive tactics]{.mark} that they're
seeing, acts of intimidation from China. And then you pair that with an
**[Estonian]{.mark} or a [Lithuanian]{.mark}** and they talk about some
of the **[challenges]{.mark} that they're seeing [from
Russia]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} Smith said.

["It's about sharing lessons learned, sharing new policies that we're
developing. We've had a number of conversations about emerging and
disruptive technologies \[and\] how are we grappling with
that,"]{.underline} she added.

Other topics expected to be discussed at the confab include NATO's force
posture in Eastern Europe, and Sweden and Finland's plans to join the
alliance.

#### Ukraine [exacerbates Europe's dependency]{.underline} on the US for security -- forces compliance 

**Brookings 22 --** The Brookings Institution Press Release, American
research institution ("Strategic responsibility: Rebalancing European

**[[Russia's war]{.mark} has [exposed]{.mark} [Europe's
dependencies]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[Vladimir Putin's greatest achievement thus far in renewing his brutal
and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine has been to
reinvigorate the Atlantic alliance]{.underline}. North American-European
unity has been remarkable, exemplified by harsh and complementary
sanctions against Russia; efforts to wean Europe off its dangerous
dependence on Russian energy; military, financial, and political support
for Ukraine; and actions to strengthen NATO's own defense.

[A more corrosive effect of Putin's war, however, has been to
**[deepen]{.mark} even further [Europe's strategic dependence on
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited** [S]{.mark}tates --- a trend]{.underline}
that had already become unsustainable [[even]{.mark} [before]{.mark} the
[conflict began]{.mark}.]{.underline} As the alliance continues its most
urgent task --- helping Ukraine beat back Russia's assault --- it must
address this important longer-term challenge of rebalancing
trans-Atlantic defense.

[Doing so means [squaring]{.mark} a triangle of [issues]{.mark}:
[ensuring]{.mark} [Europe's capacity to defend itself]{.mark}
[against]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark} and manage a range of additional
crises]{.underline}, many along its southern periphery; addressing
European aspirations for greater strategic autonomy; and [[maintaining
confidence]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[can]{.mark} adequately [uphold]{.mark} its [commitments]{.mark} in both
the north Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}.

**[Creating]{.underline}** a Basis for **[[Unified Action through

In a few countries, agreements already exist between DOD and USAID on
how the two agencies will coordinate future programs at the country
level.240 However, the policy should dictate that this should be the
norm and not the exception. Further, U.S. agency partnership is not
enough. In situations where the circumstances require, [DOS [policy must
be willing to make SC]{.mark}]{.underline}/SA [[conditional]{.mark}
based on]{.underline} corruption [reform benchmarks]{.underline}. It was
not until the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework Conference in July
2012 that the Afghan government had to meet hard conditions regarding
reductions in corruption to receive U.S. military and other aid.241
[Political [conditions]{.mark} for assistance [need to be
tailored]{.mark} to a specific]{.underline}, identified reform and done
in coordination with the interagency (and other donors if possible) [if
it is going to be effective]{.underline} and not have unintended
consequences.242 [[Diplomatic]{.mark} [methods]{.mark} for creating
conditions [include]{.mark}]{.underline} sanctions, embargoes,
**[[conditional]{.mark} [aid]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} and
domestic legislation with international scope and reach. [[Some]{.mark}
critics [contend that conditionality does not work]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Others contend that **[[even if it does not work]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[it sends a message]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [both [to]{.mark} the
[host nation]{.mark} and to [other nations]{.mark} around the world,
[that]{.mark} the [U.S. is serious about its commitments to]{.mark}
universally recognized **[rights for all]{.mark}** people, such as those
outlined in]{.underline} the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations' Universal **[D]{.underline}**eclaration of

[Because [alliance membership is a club good]{.mark}, not a pure public
good, **[worries]{.mark} [about being excluded]{.mark}** from the
security benefits of an alliance can [incentivize]{.mark} a
[state]{.mark} [to]{.mark} try to **[shore up the alliance]{.mark}** by
[sending]{.mark} a]{.underline} costly [[signal]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
their [commitment]{.mark} to their alliance partners]{.underline}.
"[Today, we should [expect]{.mark} the [European]{.mark} [allies]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} find that the best way to
**[[strengthen]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or avoid weakening) **[their
[bonds]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[St]{.mark}ates]{.underline}** is to contribute to out-of-area
operations like ISAF. According to this line of reasoning, the allies
who put the highest premium on NATO's traditional products should be the
ones---together with the United States---shouldering the heaviest
burdens in Afghanistan" (Ringsmose 2010, 331). Yet the Afghanistan case
demonstrates [this is not just a story [about]{.mark} club goods in
formal alliances, but **[s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation more
[generally]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[States]{.mark} may]{.underline} use
war efforts as a [[signal]{.mark} of their [willingness]{.mark} to
[accept]{.mark} [large]{.mark} [costs]{.mark} in the hopes that this
will **improve their relationship with the coalition leader** in the
future]{.underline}. States use conflicts that are not of immediate
strategic importance to--- hopefully---gain the attention and respect of
important international players. [Closer alignments may be valued
inherently, for unspecified reasons, or to [help]{.mark} the [state
acquire]{.mark} side payments or **[policy concessions on unrelated
issues]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Henke (2019a) argues that
**[states]{.underline}** **[contribute]{.underline}** to coalition
conflicts **[[when]{.mark} the "[pivotal
state]{.mark}"]{.underline}**--- **[what we call the coalition
leader]{.underline}**---**[[provides]{.underline}]{.mark}** side
**[[payments as incentives to contribute]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
highlights our broader logic about variation in club goods and public
goods in alliances and coalitions. States contribute to coalition
warfare when there are benefits to contributing troops that fall outside
the traditionally understood alliance mandates or security concerns. In
US-led conflicts since the Korean War, Henke (2019a) find that future
benefits offered by pivotal states can induce coalition participation.
We extend upon this finding by arguing that
**[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}** with unrealized alliance potential are
most likely to be moved by that logic. Furthermore, they **[[will go
above and beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}** in their coalition participation
[to try to secure future benefits]{.underline}--- **[whether side
payments or unrelated payments]{.underline}**---[that extend from a
**closer relationship** with the coalition leader]{.underline}.

[A [persistent]{.mark} [tendency]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [U.S. foreign

something that it does because Washington wants it to, but out of its
own self-interest. Egypt's brokering of peaceful relations between Hamas

view, but also serves Cairo's interests, since open conflict between
Israel and Hamas could potentially destabilize Egypt. [The [notion that

What can the United States and the European Union Do?

[Both the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [through]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark}
and our European allies]{.underline} through the EU [[should]{.mark} do
more to [**encourage common values** like]{.mark} the rule of **law and
[democracy in Turkey, Hungary and Poland]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While
it may be hard to achieve concrete results in the very short term, both
[organizations should be aware that they are playing a long game, and
that **[none of the three]{.mark} [current]{.mark} [leaders]{.mark}** in
Ankara, Budapest, and Warsaw **[will be in power
indefinitely]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While lecturing allies and friends
on democratic principles may easily backfire and be quickly condemned as
hypocrisy, [the [US]{.mark} especially [should]{.mark} [stand by]{.mark}
its enduring [commitment]{.mark} [to democratic freedoms]{.mark} and the
rule of law [in]{.mark} [all]{.mark} its official (and unofficial)
[foreign policy]{.mark} [statements]{.mark}]{.underline}. Going forward,
the European Union can: • [**[make]{.mark} its [funding]{.mark} more
[conditional on abiding by democratic principles]{.mark} and rule of
law** [and]{.mark} **[withhold funding if
necessary]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The EU is currently debating
instituting tougher 'rule of law' conditions on its funding in the next
budget cyle. • **[[condemn]{.mark} [anti-democratic countries
directly]{.mark}]{.underline}**, rather than focusing on economics, the
EU could also rank countries based on political freedoms, by naming and
shaming the worst performers. • encourage its mainstream pan-European
political parties -- especially the center-right EPP and the center-left
D&S -- to not allow parties with autocratic or illiberal tendencies
within their political groupings. Going forward, the United States
should: • continue to support civil society groups and free media in
countries experiencing democratic backsliding. For instance, recent
reports that Radio Free Europe would be recommencing operations in
Hungary are a step in the right direction. • [**[emphasize]{.mark} that
[NATO]{.mark} membership [means]{.mark} rights** as well as
[responsibilities]{.mark}]{.underline} beyond spending 2% of GDP on
defense[. [NATO must be an alliance based on **basic common democratic
values**]{.mark}. [The transatlantic alliance has proven so
strong]{.mark} and enduring]{.underline} not simply because of
Realpolitik, but also [[because it has been an alliance based on a
shared commitment to]{.mark} freedom and [democratic values]{.mark}.
[If]{.mark} those **[values]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [no longer seen as
common]{.mark} to the alliance, [it will inevitably
erode]{.mark}**]{.underline}. • encourage overseas investment through

### 2nc -- say yes -- baltics

#### Baltics states say yes -- Ukraine has made them [desperate for more defense]{.underline}

TAPA MILITARY BASE, Estonia, June 15 (Reuters) - [Since Russia invaded
Ukraine in February, the **Baltic states of [Estonia]{.mark},
[Latvia]{.mark} and [Lithuania]{.mark} have been [calling for]{.mark}
their region to receive the [biggest build-up]{.mark} of** combat-ready
**NATO forces** in Europe [since]{.mark} the end of the [Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline}, to be agreed at a summit on June 28-30 in
Madrid.

It will not happen, interviews with seven senior diplomats and officials
from leading NATO allies show.

This is partly because the proposals come as the NATO alliance faces a
slew of demands not seen in decades: from countering Russia and China in
the Arctic to quelling Islamic insurgencies in the Sahel, and tackling
new frontiers in space.

Since Russia invaded, the U.S. Congress has approved extra funds and the
Pentagon sent F-35 stealth fighters, as well as attack helicopters, to
Estonia; Britain doubled its force presence at Estonia\'s Tapa military
base to around 1,700 personnel.

But [for many [people in the region]{.mark}, which has been occupied by
both Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany and which lies within striking
distance of a Russian garrison at St. Petersburg, that is not enough.
For instance, 84.6% of Latvian respondents]{.underline} to a Benu
Aptiekas/Gemius poll in May [said they were **[highly anxious about
Russia\'s invasion]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[\"The fact that we could be in danger, it\'s been on the table all the
time,\"]{.underline} said Dzintra Bungs, 82, head of the Latvian
Occupation Museum Association in Riga. [\"It is very
**[important]{.mark} that we have woken up, and that all [Europe
awakes]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline}

[The [Baltics]{.mark}, with a combined population of just over six
million, **[want]{.mark} the [alliance to boost]{.mark} its pre-Ukraine
invasion**]{.underline} presence of around 5,000 multinational soldiers
by as much as tenfold, as well as [adding air and maritime
**[defences]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Many of NATO\'s 30 allies in Europe and the United States support the
calls for a bigger force in principle, but in reality say allies can
only commit to maintaining higher troop levels, pre-positioning more
equipment, weapons and ammunition in the region and promising rapid
reinforcements.

The broad outline for leaders to agree at the summit, the diplomats and
NATO officials said, is a model of larger multinational NATO
battlegroups in the Baltics, with a commitment to quickly reinforce if
Russia were about to invade. Planning for new air and maritime defences
will come later.

Many members, including Britain and the United States, do not favour
permanent new bases in the Baltics, three of the diplomats told Reuters.
They said it would cost billions and be hard to sustain: The states may
not have enough troops and weaponry, and a permanent presence would be
highly provocative for Moscow.

\"The Baltic states will not each get enough NATO troops to create a
division,\" a NATO diplomat said, referring to their request for up to
15,000 troops across the region, as well as more on stand-by in allied
countries to complement national forces. \"Whatever is decided must be
sustainable.\"

Instead, allied intelligence will help NATO act if Moscow looks set to
invade. During informal discussions at NATO headquarters and in
capitals, that view has won over the majority, the diplomats and
officials said -- the plans will need more work after the summit.

The Latvian government declined to comment. [Lithuania\'s presidential
office]{.underline} also declined to comment, but an advisor to the
president [said the **country would [continue to
insist]{.mark}**,]{.underline} in the run-up to the summit, on the need
for more NATO troops[. The office of Estonia\'s prime minister said it
and allies were working out the details of how to strengthen the allied
presence.]{.underline}

A senior U.S. defence official at NATO declined to comment. A British
defence ministry spokesperson declined to go into details, saying it was
\"working closely with our friends and partners to explore how we can
strengthen the alliance\'s defensive posture.\"

Russian President Vladimir Putin says his \"special military operation\"
in Ukraine is essential to ensuring Russia\'s security. Ukraine and its
Western allies call this a baseless pretext for an invasion which has
raised fears of wider conflict in Europe.

NEXT IN LINE?

[[For]{.mark} the [Baltics]{.mark}, the [issue is clear: **They could be
next**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

NATO currently rotates a multinational troop presence through the
region, but the [Baltic states say that leaves them
vulnerable]{.underline}.

[\"[After the war]{.mark} - I don\'t think [Russia]{.mark} [will]{.mark}
be defeated - they will [still have huge military capabilities]{.mark}
remaining,\" Valdemaras Rupsys, Lithuania\'s Chief of Defence, told
Reuters. \"After some time \... they will try to threaten us by military
means. You will see.\"]{.underline}

[Since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Baltics have been
warning about a Russian threat that many NATO allies considered
overblown]{.underline}. Now, looking at Moscow\'s playbook in Georgia
and Ukraine of capturing a small portion of territory from which to
build, Baltic states want NATO to change its approach to their region, a
strategically crucial gateway to a busy commercial shipping route
linking Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany and
Denmark.

Tuuli Duneton, undersecretary for Defence Policy at the Estonian
Ministry of Defence, told Reuters Russia has been preparing for the last
20 years for large-scale military confrontation with NATO while the
alliance\'s focus was partly elsewhere, particularly in Afghanistan.

A public report by the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service earlier
this year said Russia\'s largest war game to date, near NATO\'s eastern
borders in 2021, involved 200,000 troops, 250 aircraft, 290 tanks, 240
weapon systems and 65 warships. Called Zapad, or West, the war games
were evidence of Moscow\'s long-term strategy to attack NATO, the report
said. At the time, the Russian defence ministry said the exercise was
rehearsing a purely defensive scenario and allegations it was preparing
to invade Poland or the Baltics were false.

The Kremlin did not reply to an email seeking comment.

A MATTER OF TRANSPORT

In May, the kilted bagpipers and drummers of the Royal Welsh Battlegroup
played marching songs at a parade ground filled with British, Danish and
French troops in the Tapa military base in Estonia. It was a show laid
on for visiting ambassadors.

Tapa is one of four bases, originally of around 1,000 troops each, that
NATO set up in the Baltic states and Poland after Crimea, from 2017
onwards. That force presence has grown and after Russia invaded Ukraine,
NATO activated its Response Force and the United States sent some 20,000
more U.S. troops to Europe. That gives NATO\'s Supreme Allied Commander
in Europe (SACEUR) more than 42,000 troops under his command in Europe,
with 120 jets at high alert and over 20 ships ready to respond.

But NATO\'s Baltic deterrent is still too small, the Baltic states say.
U.S. officials have long warned about the Russian army\'s surface-to-air
missile systems in its St. Petersburg Garrison, just 160 km (99 miles)
from the Estonian border city of Narva.

[\"The situation in Ukraine shows we were right,\" said Estonian Colonel
Andrus Merilo]{.underline}, referring to Baltic warnings since 2014.
[\"Estonia cannot lose territory, **[NATO cannot lose
territory]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline}

He and others say the argument that NATO allies could quickly regroup to
defend a Baltic state in the event of a possible Russian invasion
overlooks an important hurdle: infrastructure.

Before the COVID pandemic, the European Union planned to spend 6.5
billion euros (\$6.8 billion) between 2021 and 2027 to modernise
Europe\'s disjointed road and rail links and weak bridges so states
could move troops east in the case of conflict with Russia.

But the pandemic shock forced a rethink. Only 1.7 billion euros was
allocated.

#### Baltic states are already asking for more defense from NATO -- the Ukraine invasion makes them [perceive danger]{.underline}

broadcaster, media group that is owned by the public ("Estonian PM says
Baltic states would be 'wiped off the map' under current NATO plans",

[[Current NATO defence plans would not prevent **Estonia** from being
**wiped off**]{.mark} **the [map]{.mark}** and the capital Tallinn from
being razed to the ground, the country's [prime minister]{.mark}, Kaja
Kallas, was quoted as telling reporters]{.underline} on Wednesday by the
Financial Times.

[She [said]{.mark} the **[alliance's]{.mark} current [plans]{.mark}
[envisage]{.mark} that the [Baltic states would be
overrun]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but then be retaken 180 days later.

Noting that the invasion of Ukraine has been going on for over 100 days,
Kallas said: "If you compare the sizes of Ukraine and the Baltic
countries, it would mean the complete destruction of countries and our
culture."

"Those of you who have been to Tallinn and know our old town and the
centuries of history that's here and centuries of culture that's here --
that would all be wiped off the map, including our people, our nation,"
the Estonian prime minister said.

[She was [commenting on NATO's defence]{.mark} plans]{.underline} ahead
of next week's NATO summit in Madrid, where the **[[Baltic]{.mark}
[countries]{.mark} are [asking]{.mark} the [allies to reinforce
their]{.mark}]{.underline}** deployed [**[capabilities]{.mark}** and to
[change]{.mark} their defence [strategy from]{.mark} the current
"[tripwire]{.mark}" [approach]{.mark} to one where the alliance defends
every inch of territory at once.]{.underline}

Commenting on the current plan to "lose \[territory\] and liberate it
afterwards", Kallas pointed out that atrocities in Bucha near Kyiv were
committed by Russian troops within 80 of the invasion. "Now everyone
sees that this tripwire concept doesn't really work," the Estonian prime
minister stressed.

She said she had spoken to allied troops stationed in Estonia, most of
them British, who told her that under current plans, the Russian
invasion would wipe out the troops: "They are not fond of the idea that
\[...\] they are supposed to die."

Asked about Kallas' comments, an unnamed NATO official said that the
alliance had plans to defend members, "but we never go into operational
details".

The official noted that strengthening deterrence and defence will be the
focus of the Madrid summit.

["We will [do more to ensure we can defend]{.mark} every inch of
[allied]{.mark} [territory]{.mark}, at all times and against any threat.
We will **[adapt]{.mark} the [NATO force structure]{.mark}**, with more
forces at high readiness. We will also have more NATO forward-deployed
combat formations, to strengthen battle groups in the
east,]{.underline}" the official is quoted by the FT.

Kallas asks that each Baltic country be assigned a division of 20-25,000
troops. This does not mean that all the troops would be permanently
deployed in the Baltics, notes the FT.

Berlin has proposed the creation of a brigade assigned to Lithuania,
which would be stationed in Germany. Kallas commented that "I wouldn't
be so fixated on these different models as long as they deliver the
result that we are able to defend ourselves from the first day."

### 2nc -- say yes -- turkey 

#### Turkey says yes:

#### 1 -- the counterplan's [transactional negotiation]{.underline} is a signal of prestige for Erdogan

**Rossomondo 6-10**-2022 (John, "NATO Must Confront Turkey's
Human-Rights Abuses," Epoch Times,
https://www.theepochtimes.com/nato-must-confront-turkeys-human-rights-abuses_4522853.html?welcomeuser=1)//BB

"The real message he was trying to send to the Biden administration was
that he wants to sit around the table and negotiate with them," Bozkurt
told me, noting that Erdoğan likely wants help to stop the upcoming
trial of Halkbank, a Turkish state bank, that builds on the earlier
Hakan Atilla/Reza Zarrab case that showed the bank was allegedly
involved in helping Iran evade sanctions by laundering money through the
U.S. financial system. "He is hoping to put pressure on the Biden
administration that they will interfere in the judicial process and hush
up, like he did in Turkey, the case," Bozkurt said. Erdoğan fears being
directly implicated in the case because he allegedly personally approved
using Halkbank to move funds on Iran's behalf, Bozkurt said. Turkish
Foreign Minister Mevlut Casuvoglu last month raised the issue with
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, claiming that Halkbank that Atilla
worked for was a Turkish-government bank and was immune from U.S. law.
President Joe Biden snubbed Erdoğan last fall during the opening of the
U.N. General Assembly, and [[Turkey's president **hopes to get
attention**]{.mark} **[from]{.mark} [Biden]{.mark}** by holding up
Swedish and Finnish accession into NATO]{.underline}, Bozkurt said. "[He
[has to play]{.mark} that [relationship]{.mark} \[[with]{.mark} the

in the world]{.mark}]{.underline}," Bozkurt said. "[He doesn't care at
all about the PKK; Erdoğan would bargain with the Devil for all he
cares]{.underline}." He dismisses rhetoric about the PKK and Gülenists
as "packaging," because Sweden cannot offer anything of value. Former
Syrian opposition figure Kamal al-Labwani, who worked with the Turks in
the past and likewise lives in Sweden, agrees. Sweden's Left Party
includes PKK supporters according to al-Labwani.

#### 2 -- positive incentives that bind Turkey to NATO are successful

(Tongfi and Mehmet, "It's time to bind Turkey to NATO," The Brussels
Times,
<https://www.brusselstimes.com/223900/its-time-to-bind-turkey-to-nato)//BB>

Turkey under Recep Tayyip [[Erdoğan has]{.mark} had an [uneasy]{.mark}
[dance with]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies
and Russia for years. The ongoing war in Ukraine has accentuated
Turkey's ambiguous position in international relations, as Ankara
criticizes Russia's invasion and continues to sell armed drones to
Ukraine while also taking distance from Western sanctions against
Moscow. This ambiguity is sometimes useful, as can be seen in Turkey's
hosting of peace talks for Russia and Ukraine.
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies, however, [should now [strive to bind
Turkey closely to the alliance]{.mark}, **[through]{.mark}
[positive]{.mark}**]{.underline} economic
**[[incentives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [One might wonder why
[NATO]{.mark} [allies]{.mark} need to [coax Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline},
a formal military ally since 1952, into solidarity, especially when
Turkey's largest external threat is invading Ukraine, a Black Sea
neighbour of Turkey. [The answer lies in Turkey's [geopolitical
position]{.mark} and the recent [history of Russia's wedge
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} ­-- the "attempt to prevent, break up, or
weaken a threatening or blocking alliance at an acceptable cost."
[Turkey [plays]{.mark} a [critical role]{.mark} in the region around the
Black Sea]{.underline}, where ten wars have been fought since the end of
the Cold War. Moreover, within NATO, Ankara has demonstrated its foreign
policy autonomy from Washington and European allies on issues such as
the Cyprus dispute, the U.S. invasion of Iraq, treatment of Kurds, and
civil wars in Libya and Syria. Taking advantage of the frictions between
Ankara and other NATO member capitals, Vladimir Putin has been driving a
wedge between Turkey and NATO allies in recent years. Moscow has a
variety of tools to pressure Ankara because of the two countries'
economic ties and involvement in various conflicts. After Turkey shot
down a Russian Su-24 fighter jet near the Syria--Turkey border in
November 2015, for instance, Russia imposed economic sanctions on Turkey
in tourism and agricultural trade and raised military pressure against
Turkey in Syria. The pressure forced Erdoğan to send a letter of
apology. Then came the July 2016 coup attempt against Erdoğan, after
which Putin immediately expressed support for the Turkish president in
contrast to the muted response from NATO allies. Turkey subsequently
made a deal to purchase Russia's S-400 air-defense system, reportedly
worth US\$2.5 billion, despite U.S. objections. Arguing that Turkey's
acquisition of the S-400 system creates security risks, Washington
imposed sanctions on the Turkish defense industry in December 2020 and
expelled Ankara from its F-35 fighter jet program. Due to concerns over
further U.S. sanctions, Turkey has yet to fully activate the S-400
system. In an international environment where Erdoğan was increasingly
isolated, Putin offered precious diplomatic victories to him. Some
Turkish analysts, for instance, suspect that Putin allowed Ankara to
become a power broker in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war between
Azerbaijan and Armenia "to keep driving a wedge between Turkey and other
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." Turkey's current
role as the mediator between Russia and Ukraine, of course, is also a
big boost for Erdoğan in the field of diplomacy. **[The [West
has]{.mark}]{.underline}** greater **[[leverage]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[The West]{.underline}**, however, **[has]{.underline}** its own
**[[tools to bind Turkey]{.mark} to NATO]{.underline}**. Most
importantly, [the West has a superior **[power to reward]{.mark}
Turkey**]{.underline}. For instance, analysts often refer to close
economic ties between Turkey and Russia, but the EU is by far Turkey's
largest trading partner and main source of investments, accounting for
33.4% of Turkey's imports and 41.3% of its exports in 2020 (and 21 out
of the 27 EU member states are also members of NATO). Military relations
between Turkey and NATO also favour the West. [[NATO's collective
defense protects Turkey]{.underline},]{.mark} and the decades-old
alliance ties have made Turkey far more dependent on the West than on
Russia. The S-400 system is expensive, but the delivery to Turkey began
only in 2019, and Russia accounts for only 5% of arms import by Turkey
in the last ten years between 2012 and 2021. During the decade, Russia
ranked below other weapons suppliers of Turkey such as the United States
(51%), Italy (16%), Spain (13%), and South Korea (6%) according to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's Arms Transfers
Database. [For binding Turkey to NATO and wedging Turkey away from
Russia, we **recommend reward-based strategies** rather than
coercion]{.underline}. [Academic literature suggests that positive
sanctions work better and that a coercive approach is chosen by those
with weaker reward power]{.underline}. A coercive strategy can easily
antagonize the target, whereas [a reward-based strategy is unlikely to
worsen the status quo]{.underline}. [[Reward-binding is]{.mark}
particularly [important in relation to the Turkish
public]{.mark}]{.underline}, who have resented the West's treatment of
their country in the aftermath of the Syrian refugee crisis and the 2016
coup attempt against Erdoğan. This anti-Western sentiment has been
further exacerbated by pro-government Turkish media. In fact, unlike the
seemingly neutral position of the Turkish government in this
Russia-Ukraine war, Turkish mass media is dominated by anti-Western
discourse and criticism against NATO. A poll in March revealed that
48.3% of Turks blamed the United States and NATO for the current
situation in Ukraine and only 33.7% thought Russia was responsible. In
the same poll, 51.7% of Turks see the United States as the biggest
threat to their country as opposed to Russia (19.4%). As a Turkish
scholar points out, anti-Western sentiments that developed for years
will not easily disappear from the Turkish public opinion even after
Erdoğan's recent U-turn. In international security and diplomacy, NATO
allies have already begun taking a conciliatory approach toward Ankara.
This can be seen in the recent Franco-Turkish rapprochement and the
Biden administration's support for "appropriate U.S. defense trade ties
with Turkey." Economic [**reward-binding** by NATO allies is [likely to
be appreciated by Erdoğan]{.mark}]{.underline}, who faces the
presidential election in 2023. More importantly, [this is a chance for
the West to offer the olive branch to the Turkish public]{.underline} as
Turkey experiences the highest level of inflation in 20 years, with
Erdoğan's economic mismanagement, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the war in
Ukraine creating a perfect storm for the economy. Deepening of the
EU-Turkey customs union and other **[positive]{.underline}** economic
**[incentives]{.underline}** **[are [useful]{.mark} tools [to
improve]{.mark}]{.underline}** media freedom and **[[human
ri]{.mark}ghts in Turkey]{.underline}**, and **[the [West]{.mark}
[should ask for domestic]{.mark} political [concessions from
Erdoğan]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Rather than using Turkey's political
problems]{.mark} as excuses [to keep]{.mark} Turkey [at
distance]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, economic **[[rewards should be

FGY

WHAT IS NEXT?

One thing is clear: Turkey's democracy is in trouble and it is likely to
remain that way for the foreseeable future. It is also difficult to
imagine that NATO could enjoy much influence over Turkey to ensure its
commitment to the shared values so eloquently raised in [the NATO
communique](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_156624.htm) (in
which member states reinforced their commitment to "common values,
including individual liberty, human rights, democracy, and the rule of
law"). [The **[emphasis of NATO]{.mark}---and of [key member
states]{.mark} such as [Belgium]{.mark}, [Britain]{.mark},
[France]{.mark}, [Germany]{.mark}, the [Netherlands]{.mark}, and the
United States, which [seek to defend liberal democracy]{.mark}**---in
the near future should be on making sure that Turkey stays aligned with
the trans-Atlantic community]{.underline}. In the meantime, allies need
to be realistic and accept that until they can stop and [reverse
democratic regression
elsewhere](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/07/14/yes-russia-is-a-threat-to-nato-so-are-the-alliances-anti-democratic-members/) in
the trans-Atlantic community, they will enjoy limited influence with
respect to improving democracy in Turkey.

[This does not]{.underline} necessarily [mean that NATO should remain
silent]{.underline}, especially with respect to egregious violations of
democratic values both in Turkey and beyond. However, alongside its
criticism, [[NATO should]{.underline}]{.mark} offer greater recognition
of Turkey's contributions to the defense of the alliance and
[**[acknowledge]{.mark} [Turkey's]{.mark} [unique]{.mark} national
[security needs]{.mark}** resulting from the ongoing war in Syria. In
addition, **NATO members ([particularly]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} members of the [E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion) [could]{.mark} [incentivize Turkey to re-establish rule
of law]{.mark}**]{.underline} and restore a secure investment
environment by offering to expand economic relations with Turkey. [[This
could be **particularly promising**]{.underline}]{.mark}, since unlike
its neighbors in the region, Turkey has no oil or gas to sell. Its
economy has to produce, attract foreign direct investment, and
trade---and the EU is by far Turkey's most important partner in this
regard. [This dependence [gives]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark} members [leverage
over Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}, even more so when the country faces a
pending [economic
crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/business/turkey-economy-erdogan.html).
Specifically, the United States could offer to exempt Turkey from new
tariffs and the EU could offer to modernize the [Customs
Union](http://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/12/13/trade-as-turkey-s-eu-anchor-pub-75002) with
Turkey in return for certain rule-of-law-related improvements.

At a time when we are starkly being warned that a "[world crisis is upon
us](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/everything-will-not-be-okay/2018/07/12/c5900550-85e9-11e8-9e80-403a221946a7_story.html?utm_term=.35c5eff404df),"
threatening to wreck the international order as we have known it,
weakening of Turkey's bond with NATO would deeply undermine the
trans-Atlantic alliance. The challenge will be how to maintain a balance
between realpolitik and the defense, if not the promotion, of shared
democratic values within the alliance.

Its Values Seriously, 6/9/2021,

FGY

The Price of Unity 

Admittedly, pursuing a tougher course of action on values and principles
comes with risks. Even measured steps could create serious rifts among
allies, with the potential of paralyzing the alliance. Because NATO
operates by consensus, any punitive action on an ally could provoke
retaliatory action on other NATO business. In reaction to Norway's stark
criticisms against the Portuguese and Greek regimes at a June 1971
foreign ministers meeting, then-NATO Secretary General Manlio
Brosio [warned](https://warontherocks.com/2017/08/how-to-deal-with-authoritarianism-inside-nato/) that
"if we undermine our solidarity, we run the risk of undermining the
substance of our alliance."

[[Overcoming]{.mark} this [dilemma]{.mark} between prioritizing values
and preserving unity [requires]{.mark} a graduated, [collective]{.mark},
and dispassionate [approach]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, [NATO will need
to be proportionate when dealing with an ally violating trans-Atlantic
values.]{.underline} Allies should start with discussions behind closed
doors rather than publicize the dispute. Open and frank dialogue among
allies should always be the first step before adopting restrictive
measures. If NATO moves too quickly or aggressively, it risks being
counterproductive by widening divisions in the alliance. At the end of
the day, this progressive approach should have a deterrent effect on
NATO countries, especially on those that value their membership in the
alliance and do not want to be singled out as "bad allies."

Second, [NATO's response should be as collective and resolute as
possible]{.underline}. If pressure is applied by only a few NATO
countries, the ally in question may not take the warning seriously and
could use the divisions among allies to avoid accountability. [**[If
enough allies]{.mark} [agree to lean on a problematic NATO
country]{.mark}, then [accepting]{.mark} [short-term disunity]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} the sake of [preserving trans-Atlantic values could be
worth]{.mark} it.** In 2019, [Turkey]{.mark} ultimately [decided
to [lift its longstanding
veto](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1193506/nato-endorses-baltic-defence-plans-after-turkey-withdraws-veto) to
the defense plans of Poland]{.mark} and the [Baltic states because it
was facing]{.mark} a [growing]{.mark} and **[consistent pressure from
numerous]{.mark} [allies]{.mark}, including the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, the [U]{.mark}nited [K]{.mark}ingdom, [France,]{.mark}
and [Germany]{.mark}**. The unity of the members of the Quad was
critical in that case and changed Ankara's strategic
calculus.]{.underline}

Last but not least, all allies must be subject to the same objective
criteria and scrutiny. Otherwise, the backsliding ally will simply claim
it is being singled out and dismiss the charges. The International
Secretariat can be helpful here by conducting an impartial, evenhanded
assessment. Strong involvement of NATO's secretary general will also be
key in preserving political cohesion through this thorny process.
[Recently, Secretary General Stoltenberg played an instrumental role in
easing the tensions between Greece and Turkey through the establishment
of a bilateral [de-confliction
mechanism](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_178523.htm) in which
he did not assess blame but merely facilitated dialogue to be informed
by international rules and norms.]{.underline}

[While confronting [NATO's internal challenges]{.mark} is not an easy
task, it is an essential one. [Left unaddressed]{.mark}, [political
cohesion will]{.mark} falter and [inhibit NATO's ability to act]{.mark}
in the defense of its collective interests. To prevent this, [NATO
leaders should act now]{.mark} to tackle the alliance's democratic
deficit. In the long run, this is [the only way to restore unity]{.mark}
and reinforce European defense.]{.underline}

[While]{.underline} the [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [has
[elevated]{.mark} the [fight against authoritarian
trends]{.mark}]{.underline} and corruption [to a foreign policy
priority, the [U.S]{.mark}. now [faces]{.mark} a [tough
challenge]{.mark} to its democracy agenda]{.underline}: the
[authoritarian developments [among]{.mark}]{.underline} its European
[NATO allies]{.underline}, [particularly [Hungary]{.mark} and
[Poland]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both countries experienced the sharpest
decline in democratic quality in the Western world since the recent
incumbents, Viktor Orbán's Fidesz party in Hungary and Poland's Law and
Justice (PiS) led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, came to power in 2010 and 2015,
respectively. The fact that neither of the world's two leading
democracy-measuring institutions --- Freedom House and V-Dem ---
considers Hungary to be any sort of democracy anymore should raise alarm
about the true authoritarian nature of illiberal projects among U.S.
allies in Central and Eastern Europe. [If Washington turns a blind eye
to the authoritarian developments in its own]{.underline}
self-described, [value-based alliance system, the [U.S. risks running
into]{.mark} the **accusation of [double]{.mark} [standards]{.mark}**,
which may **significantly weaken** its democracy agenda]{.underline}.
However, the autocratization of Hungary and Poland poses more challenges
for the U.S. than just its credibility when it comes to democracy and
rule of law. Besides Turkey, Hungary is the only NATO member state that
fails to comply, not only with democratic values that the current
administration promotes, but also with the foreign policy priorities and
interests of the U.S. regarding China and Russia. [In stark contrast to
Budapest, [Poland's commitment to NATO has been unshakeable because of
the existential security]{.mark} [threat]{.mark} stemming from
Russia]{.underline}. [Warsaw also has been ready in the past to comply
with Washington's]{.underline} main [expectations]{.underline} regarding
China, in order to keep the U.S. engaged as a security provider on
NATO's Eastern Flank. [However, since the Biden administration took
office, Poland appears to be distancing itself]{.underline} from
Washington's China policy by seeking a more intense and balanced
relationship with Beijing and labeling U.S.-China strategic competition
as a "bilateral issue." [[Warsaw]{.mark} [may believe it has]{.mark} the
[upper]{.mark} [hand]{.mark} in U.S.-Poland bilateral relations if it
rests on the assumption **[that]{.mark} the [U.S. won't
reduce]{.mark}**]{.underline} its **[[security]{.mark}
[engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the Eastern Flank without
undermining its own strategic approach to NATO. According to the Polish
perception, the Biden administration cannot credibly threaten Poland
with weakening security cooperation if the PiS government further
proceeds with its authoritarian agenda. [How can Washington then address
the autocratization of]{.underline} its Central European NATO allies,
Hungary and [Poland]{.underline}, and their rapprochement with Beijing?
While U.S. influence over Hungary might be limited, [[Washington]{.mark}
still [does have **significant leverage** **over**]{.mark}
**[Poland]{.mark}** [because of **Warsaw's substantial**]{.mark}
**[interest in security cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[**[Washington should]{.mark}** be ready to [play]{.mark}]{.underline}
out [[the]{.mark} [security card to put pressure on
Warsaw]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, it should calibrate its diplomatic
and policy moves in a way that drives a wedge between Poland and
Hungary. This could allow European Union institutions to address
authoritarian developments in both countries, but primarily in Hungary,
more effectively. [How can such a strategy be realized? [U.S.]{.mark}
diplomacy [should clearly communicate]{.mark} with Poland that [Warsaw's
strategic alliance]{.mark} with Budapest [poses]{.mark} a [heavy burden
on any **further deepening**]{.mark} **[of]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[[s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation]{.underline}**. **[Washington
also should [use]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[security cooperation

stage]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to weaken]{.mark} the vanguards of
[authoritarian politics]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Polish government
coalition and strengthen moderate forces. [It should communicate the
message]{.underline} on all available channels [that]{.underline} the
[policies of]{.underline} Justice Minister Zbigniew [Ziobro pose severe
obstacles to deeper transatlantic relations]{.underline}, while Deputy
Prime Minister Jarosław Gowin should be backed in parallel. Furthermore,
as a strong contrast to former President Trump's approach to the
European Union, President Biden should recognize --- and use --- EU
institutions as potential vehicles for amplifying U.S. interests. In
this spirit, the U.S. should elevate the question of autocratizing EU
member states to the highest levels of the transatlantic dialogue and
create a discourse of reciprocity with regard to the democracy homework
that both the U.S. and the EU have to do on the home front. The U.S.
recently started working on strengthening democracy at home after
Trump's four-year onslaught on democratic institutions, but the EU
largely has failed to do so for a decade. Since the European Union
expressed its high expectations for a renewal and reinforcement of U.S.
democracy, Washington should not shy away from communicating the same
message to EU institutions and key European governments, including
Germany. Germany lately has evolved into a key autocracy-enabler within
the EU, so Berlin's policy toward Budapest and Warsaw also should be put
on the U.S.-German bilateral relations agenda.To provide the appropriate
impetus for U.S.-EU dialogue on authoritarian developments in Europe,
and to push EU institutions toward a more activist approach, Washington
could consider moves that may ridicule EU passivity, especially towards
Hungary. In similar fashion, as it happened recently with former Slovak
general prosecutor Dobroslav Trnka, the Biden administration should
trigger sanction mechanisms against key stakeholders of political
corruption in Hungary --- potentially including general prosecutor Péter
Polt; the regime's top oligarch, Lőrinc Mészáros; or Orbán's son-in-law,
István Tiborcz. That would put pressure on the EU to act and could help
to push forward the application of the EU's rule of law conditionality
regulation, which is actually suspended. With an eye on the upcoming
2022 elections in Hungary, the U.S. should emphasize the question of
electoral integrity both in its dialogue with the EU and within the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and should
act proactively to put in place a robust international electoral
monitoring mission under an OSCE flag. On a bilateral level, the U.S.
should renew its commitment to supporting democracy in central and
eastern Europe, making financial resources available for the support of
critical civil society and free media, and calibrating priorities in a
way that will allow for grants to have real impact on the ground. [[If
Washington would like to **preserve**]{.mark} **the [credibility]{.mark}
of its democracy agenda**, it **[must]{.mark}** [address]{.mark} the
[autocratization]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its Central European [allies in a
**convincing**]{.mark} **way**]{.underline}. However, [[it can only
succeed if]{.mark} the [Biden administration is **ready to meddle** in
European politics]{.mark}]{.underline} in unprecedented ways.

### 2nc -- say yes -- ai logistics 

#### **NATO allies see AI defense as key to combat China -- the [US has already started leveraging its lead]{.underline}** 

**Warrell 21** -- Helen Warrell, assistant opinions editor at the
Financial Times ("Nato allies need to speed up AI defence co-operation",

[As **[Russia intensifies cyber hostilities]{.mark}** and **[China
weaponises a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence**, [joining forces
in]{.mark} the field of [high-tech warfare]{.mark} will [feature high
on]{.mark} the [list of topics discussed by Nato
allies]{.mark}]{.underline} at a summit next week. But the transatlantic
alliance's [30 members will need to move fast]{.underline} if they aim
to make up lost ground. Nato is proposing a new tech innovation centre
bringing together military personnel with industry to foster digital
defence start-ups. Some of these might be financed by a separate
initiative, also set to be debated: a venture capital fund for
innovation which member states could choose to opt in to. The efforts
are belated, as Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg himself
acknowledged. "For decades, Nato allies have been leading when it comes
to technology, but that's not obvious any more," he told the Financial
Times in an interview last week. ["**We [see]{.mark} [China]{.mark}
[especially investing]{.mark} heavily [in]{.mark} new, [disruptive
tech]{.mark}nologies** like artificial intelligence, autonomous systems,
big data, and they implement them into new advanced weapon systems,
drones, submarines, aircraft and so on." He is not the first to sound
the alarm.]{.underline} Eric Schmidt, the former Google chief executive
who now chairs the US's National Security Commission on AI, warned
earlier this year that Beijing was planning to undermine conventional
military forces by "leapfrogging" to new technologies. The commission's
report, published in March, raised concerns that China would use AI for
"reconnaissance, electromagnetic countermeasures and co-ordinated
firepower strikes". Part of the problem is that western defence
institutions have been slow to recognise the potential of innovation
beyond their own industry. "For decades, a lot of technological
development would happen within the defence sector --- the internet,
nuclear, GPS, all of that was developed by the defence industry and then
shared with the civilian sector," Stoltenberg said. "Now, it goes the
other way around. It's a civilian sector which is leading in the
development of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and many of
the new disruptive technologies." Some Nato members are ahead of others.
[The [US]{.mark} and [France]{.mark} have [published military AI
strategies]{.mark}, while the UK announced this year that it is to
establish a centre for defence AI. For the first time, Britain's
intelligence agency, MI6, is recruiting from the private sector for a
new head of its "Q" branch]{.underline} --- the technical lab made
famous in the James Bond films. Establishing a new Nato hub --- known as
an "accelerator" --- in which tech companies and members of the armed
forces can experiment with new ideas has advantages, according to
Professor Fiona Murray, co-director of MIT's innovation initiative.
Start-ups and investors do not always have the time to tackle defence
challenges when solutions are "hard to test, markets are fragmented and
procurement is slow", Murray said. **[[Working together would
create]{.mark} a [wider market for new products]{.mark} and [enhance
collective]{.mark}]{.underline} [[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**, she
noted. [It was **"[not enough" for countries to]{.mark} be
[handl]{.mark}ing this [individually]{.mark}**]{.underline}, she said.
[The **[US]{.mark} has [started marshalling allies on]{.mark} the
[policy implications of]{.mark} using [new
]{.mark}**[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}. The Pentagon's "AI
Partnership for Defense", comprising [13 countries (including Nato
members Canada, Denmark, Estonia, the UK, France and Norway) met
virtually for the first time last year to agree joint military standards
on AI]{.underline}. Schmidt's commission has called on the Five Eyes
intelligence-sharing alliance (the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New
Zealand) to work more closely on developing AI systems. Ulrike Franke,
an expert in military technology at the European Council on Foreign
Relations, argues that [Nato's tech centre will be most effective if it
prioritises systems designed to facilitate joint military
operations]{.underline}. The alliance should look at areas such as
AI-enabled command and control, she said, which could [**give members a
unified picture** of the battlefield across multiple regions, using
intelligent data analysis to sift information.]{.underline} Franke said
that in the vast arena spanning drones to quantum computing, there was a
temptation to cover too much. "It makes massive sense for Nato to look
more at this \[technology\]", she said. "The question is, what exactly
are they focusing on? There's a danger of Nato spreading itself too
thin."

#### Allies are hyperaware of the [mutual benefits]{.underline} of AI intel sharing 

**Ryseff 20** -- James Ryseff, senior technical policy analyst at the
RAND Corporation, M.S. in security studies from Georgetown University
("The United States Can Only Achieve AI Dominance with its Allies",

FGY

First, the [Defense Department]{.underline} could create a 10-year
roadmap for [[upgrading data interoperability]{.mark} that lays out
specific operational objectives to demonstrate improvements. To ensure
these objectives are met, they could be [incorporated into]{.mark} the
major annual [exercises conducted with NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and
East Asian allies. For example, American and South Korean units could
draw spare parts and other consumables from each other during their
annual training exercises. [Throughout the exercise, [both sides]{.mark}
could **[confirm]{.mark} their [logistics databases]{.mark} can combine
to [present a unified picture of the allied logistical
situation]{.mark}** and provide projections of future needs as the
simulated combat event evolves.]{.underline}

Establishing tangible objectives and aligning the timeframe with
existing multinational exercises will be the key to success. Militaries
invest a great deal of time and effort training their personnel to be
ready for the fight. They must now learn how to "train" and prepare
their data as well. This can mean many things. When training their
personnel, militaries spend some of their time imparting specific
skillsets that will be useful in combat. In other cases, soldiers learn
how to work together to solve unforeseeable problems as they arise ---
or simply learn how the operational routines of other units or allied
militaries differ from their own. Regardless, commanders recognize their
soldiers must routinely practice their skills under real-world
conditions if they will be expected to work as an effective team on the
battlefield.

Data needs the same types of preparation to be ready for its role in the
fight. Much as soldiers need to leave the garrison and work through
practical exercises in the field, it is not enough to develop a
technical specification documenting how two data sets are supposed to
work together. Someone needs to actually make the data sets work
together. They must be routinely explored, analyzed, and aggregated to
solve real problems in order to ensure they will remain interoperable
and effective. Similarly, the analysts and engineers responsible for
curating data need opportunities to interact with each other in order to
develop the operational routines necessary to ensure effective
collaboration during a crisis. Without these forcing functions, too much
military data will remain isolated and unusable at the scale needed to
engineer AI algorithms.

[Second, the military may need to collaborate with [allies]{.mark} to
[achieve]{.mark} **common [understandings]{.mark} about when and how to
share data**.]{.underline} European governments in particular have begun
to codify digital norms for the consumer space in frameworks like
the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) and the
establishment of new legal concepts like the [Right to be
Forgotten](https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/). The United States
could play a role in shaping the equivalent norms in the national
security and public policy space. [[Otherwise]{.mark},
[fragmented]{.mark} [data repositories]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the United
States and its [allies may not be able to achieve]{.mark} the critical
[mass]{.mark} --- that is, gather enough data --- [necessary to compete
with China's data]{.mark} warehouses.]{.underline}

Past disagreements between the United States and its allies over norms
related to atomic weapons demonstrate how these [considerations can
ultimately impact military operations]{.underline}. [In Europe, the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [managed to forge]{.mark} an
[agreement]{.mark} that allowed the stationing of tactical nuclear
weapons on the territory of its NATO allies, even [in the face
of]{.mark} significant domestic
[oppositio]{.mark}]{.underline}[n]{.mark} in key nations such as West
Germany. In contrast, the United States was unable to achieve a similar
consensus among its allies in Asia. Both Japan and New Zealand banned
the introduction of nuclear weapons into their territory, causing
headaches for U.S. Navy operations in the region. While in that case
Navy ships could find alternate ports to operate from, a similar
divergence in norms would have much greater consequences for the U.S.
military's ability to develop AI. **[[Data withheld is data
lost]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[**Most [norms]{.mark}** about the use of military data **[will]{.mark}
likely [be uncontroversial]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Unlike Facebook or
Google, whose business models depend on precisely targeting ads at their
user bases, militaries in democracies have little reason to exchange
personally identifiable information or other sensitive details about
their citizens. Norms about controversial topics such as [autonomous
systems](https://warontherocks.com/2015/02/between-a-roomba-and-a-terminator-what-is-autonomy/) may
prove more difficult to forge a consensus around. Agreements that data
provided by partners would not be used to train these systems without
explicit consent could be a compromise acceptable to all parties.

Finally, [the United States could seek deeper integration and
cooperation with its allies who have **unique resources to advance
specific applications of AI**. Many, including the [National Security
Commission on Artificial
Intelligence](https://science.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Schmidt%20Testimony%20Attachment.pdf),
have called for the United States to leverage its existing "Five Eyes"
alliance and extend it to include cooperation in AI. A complementary
approach might be to focus on partners who have unique technical assets
to contribute.]{.underline} For example, East Asian allies such as Japan
and South Korea have invested heavily in robotics and automation, which
makes them attractive partners for developing more capable drones and
other autonomous vehicles. They may also have fewer hesitations
about [deploying these
technologies](https://www.lawfareblog.com/foreign-policy-essay-south-korean-sentry%E2%80%94-killer-robot-prevent-war) than
other potential partners. Similarly, the Israeli government has
carefully incubated a [world-class cyber security
sector](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2017/07/18/6-reasons-israel-became-a-cybersecurity-powerhouse-leading-the-82-billion-industry/#6b99f394420a),
potentially positioning it as a valuable collaborator in training
AI-enhanced cyber defenders how to protect critical infrastructure and
assets.

Ultimately, close collaborators in any AI alliance must pass two tests:
They must be able to usefully contribute to the work, and they will also
need to be trustworthy enough to share in these cutting-edge technical
advancements. While achieving the kind of close collaboration with
allies that the United States has enjoyed in other realms may be
difficult, it will be essential if the United States hopes to achieve
the data dominance needed to succeed in future combat.

Strategically critical

[The **[strategic environment]{.mark}** in Europe and the Asia-Pacific
region **[heightens]{.mark} the [importance of coordinating]{.mark}
national and [multinational logistics]{.mark}**, while
[collaboration]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [AI]{.mark}-enabled logistics can
[provide]{.mark} an [operational advantage]{.mark} in multinational
operations]{.underline}. The U.S. military is a global force that must
remain ahead of competitors and adversaries and be prepared for a broad
range of contingencies and missions. [Yet in multinational operations,
the **[gap in]{.mark}** military and technological
**[capabilities]{.mark}** [between]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} and partners, and more
specifically, significant discrepancies in allies' logistic
capabilities, **can [negatively impact survivability]{.mark}**,
[interoperability]{.mark}, cohesion, and ultimately, [mission
success]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Thus, [for]{.mark} the United States and
its [allies]{.mark}, [collaboration]{.mark} on logistics and sustainment
in general, and on AI-enabled logistics and sustainment in particular,
[is]{.mark} [important]{.mark} [for]{.mark} several [operational]{.mark}
and [strategic reasons]{.mark}.]{.underline} Operationally speaking,
logistic support during multinational military operations differs from
unilateral operations. Nations have different national and military
objectives, cultures, capabilities, and approaches to logistic support
and functions. These differences impact how the United States military
organizes, prepares, and eventually executes logistic support during
multinational operations.56 [Moreover, in multinational operations,
nations share a collective responsibility for logistics in support of
the mission.]{.underline} Thus, the logistic capabilities of each allied
nation affect not only their ability to support their own forces but the
operational-level support capabilities of the coalition as a whole.57
[On a strategic level, the **global threat landscape and U.S. security
posture** in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region **elevate the
significance of joint, streamlined logistics** and comparable military
endurance capabilities between the United States and its allies. In
Europe, on NATO's eastern flank, the [Baltic states]{.mark} of Estonia
and Latvia, (as well as potentially Lithuania) [could be overrun by
Russia's]{.mark} superior [military]{.mark} forces in a matter of
days]{.underline}.58 Thus, in the event of a major conflict in the
Baltic states, NATO would have to move thousands of troops and heavy
military equipment from across Europe as well as from the United States
very rapidly and efficiently to counter Russian aggression. [Sound
[logistics]{.mark}]{.underline}---from the coordination and transfer of
military cargo ships and private merchant vessels to the surge and
movement of [military equipment]{.underline} and supplies along Europe's
roads, rivers, and incompatible rail [infrastructure---would [prove
essential to success]{.mark}]{.underline}. 59 [[Preventing China from
becoming]{.mark} a [regional hegemon]{.mark} in East Asia and
strengthening the U.S.-led security architecture in the western Pacific
is high on the list of U.S. strategic interests]{.underline}. Yet the
U.S. military has no local shore bases from which to project power in
the region, and its dependence on more distant bases in Guam, Japan, and
South Korea, presents significant operational limitations. Moreover,
U.S. air bases, aircraft carriers, surface vessels, ports, airfields,
and logistics systems---those already in the region and those surge
forces moving into the theater in the event of a crisis or a
conflict---are currently vulnerable to Chinese air and missile attacks
and cyberattacks.60 U.S. national security experts are well aware of
these challenges and recognize the [need to work with allies to protect
shared security interests in these strategically important
regions]{.underline}. For instance, the NSCAI's interim report
recommends assisting [NATO]{.underline} in its [adoption of AI and
negotiating formal AI cooperation agreements with allies and
partners]{.underline} like Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South
Korea, and Vietnam.61 Moreover, the report explicitly recommends that
[**U.S. alliances, primarily [NATO]{.mark}, "explore pilot projects in
low-risk areas** such as for enterprise AI applications (logistics and
sustainment) to [derive lessons]{.mark} that would [support]{.mark}
[broader application]{.mark} of AI systems for alliance
efforts."]{.underline}62 Along similar lines, in their assessment of
U.S. competitiveness in the Indo-Pacific region, the Center for a New
American Security recommends integrating logistics and sustainment
considerations into the U.S. military strategy and operational concept
development for China in order to ensure that the United States is able
to project and sustain combat power in the Indo-Pacific region. 63 These
efforts, however, could be strengthened by paying closer attention to
the role AI/ML technologies could have in enabling more responsive
logistics systems as well as in building the capacity of key partners in
the region. Certainly, when it comes to international collaboration in
general, or collaborative AI projects related to military logistics and
sustainment more specifically, disagreements and complications are
inevitable. The past four years have seen more friction between NATO
member states as well as between the United States and NATO. Rebuilding
U.S. alliances is high on the Biden administration's agenda. But
**[[restoring trust]{.mark} and good collaborative relationships
[takes]{.mark}]{.underline}** time, effort, and
**[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover, NATO member states have
very different military and technological capabilities which makes it
difficult to implement alliance-wide initiatives. And while confronting
China's assertiveness is a top priority for the United States, many of
the United States' European and Asia-Pacific allies have economic and
technological relationships with China. Their objectives vis-à-vis China
on questions of geopolitics and technology are not necessarily aligned
with those of the United States. Nevertheless, [the **[strategic]{.mark}
and operational [arguments]{.mark}** **[in favor of working together
on]{.mark} [AI]{.mark}-enabled logistics and sustainment [are quite
powerful]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Coordination on AI embedded in logistic
systems can make for more efficient and streamlined movement of
personnel and equipment, enable interoperability between systems and
forces, and expedite the provision of medical services. Such
improvements directly contribute to the readiness and endurance of
allied military forces and their ability to deter and defeat adversaries
if conflict erupts.

### 2nc -- say yes -- cyber

#### Russia's invasion of Ukraine [forces]{.underline} NATO allies to remain open to cooperation and [strengthen democratic values]{.underline} 

**Smith 22** -- Brad Smith, president of Microsoft and chief legal
officer, B.A. from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of
Public and International Affairs, J.D. from Columbia Law School, studied
international law at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in
Switzerland ("Defending Ukraine: Early Lessons from the Cyber War",

<https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/22/defending-ukraine-early-lessons-from-the-cyber-war/>)
FGY

This report offers five conclusions that come from the war's first four
months: 

First, [**[defense against]{.mark} a [military invasion]{.mark}** now
**[requires]{.mark}** for most **[countries]{.mark}** the [ability
to]{.mark} disburse and **[distribute digital
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} and [data]{.mark} assets [across
b]{.mark}orders** and into other countries]{.underline}. Russia not
surprisingly targeted Ukraine's governmental data center in an early
cruise missile attack, and other "on premise" servers similarly were
vulnerable to attacks by conventional weapons. Russia also targeted its
destructive "wiper" attacks at on-premises computer networks. But
Ukraine's government has successfully sustained its civil and military
operations by acting quickly to disburse its digital infrastructure into
the public cloud, where it has been hosted in data centers across
Europe.  

This has involved urgent and extraordinary steps from across the tech
sector, including by Microsoft. While the tech sector's work has been
vital, it's also important to think about the longer-lasting lessons
that come from these efforts.  

Second, recent advances in cyber threat intelligence and end-point
protection have helped Ukraine withstand a high percentage of
destructive Russian cyberattacks. Because cyber activities are invisible
to the naked eye, they are more difficult for journalists and even many
military analysts to track. Microsoft has seen the Russian military
launch multiple waves of destructive cyberattacks against 48 distinct
Ukrainian agencies and enterprises. These have sought to penetrate
network domains by initially comprising hundreds of computers and then
spreading malware designed to destroy the software and data on thousands
of others.  

Russian cyber tactics in the war have differed from those deployed in
the NotPetya attack against Ukraine in 2017. That attack used "wormable"
destructive malware that could jump from one computer domain to another
and hence cross borders into other countries. Russia has been careful in
2022 to confine destructive "wiper software" to specific network domains
inside Ukraine itself. But the recent and ongoing destructive attacks
themselves have been sophisticated and more widespread than many reports
recognize. And the Russian army is continuing to adapt these destructive
attacks to changing war needs, including by coupling cyberattacks with
the use of conventional weapons.  

[A [defining aspect of]{.mark} these destructive [attacks]{.mark} so far
[has been]{.mark} the [strength]{.mark} and relative [success of cyber
defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}. While not perfect and some destructive
attacks have been successful, these cyber defenses have proven stronger
than offensive cyber capabilities. This reflects two important and
recent trends. First, [threat intelligence advances, including the use
of artificial intelligence, have helped make it possible to detect these
attacks more effectively. And second, internet-connected end-point
protection has made it possible to distribute protective software code
quickly both to cloud services and other connected computing devices to
identify and disable this malware]{.underline}. Ongoing wartime
innovations and measures with the Ukrainian Government have strengthened
this protection further. But continued vigilance and innovation will
likely be needed to sustain this defensive advantage. 

Third, as [a [coalition of countries has come together]{.mark} to defend
Ukraine]{.underline}, Russian intelligence agencies have stepped up
network penetration and espionage activities targeting allied
governments outside Ukraine. At Microsoft we've [detected Russian
network intrusion efforts on 128 organizations in 42 countries outside
Ukraine. While the **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has been]{.mark}
Russia's [number one target]{.mark}**, this **activity has [also]{.mark}
prioritized [Poland]{.mark}**, where much of the logistical delivery of
military and humanitarian assistance is being coordinated. Russian
activities have **also targeted [Baltic]{.mark} [countries]{.mark}**,
and during the past two months there has been an increase in similar
activity targeting computer networks in [Denmark]{.mark},
[Norway]{.mark}, [Finland]{.mark}, [Sweden]{.mark}, and
[Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}. We have also seen [an increase in
**[similar activity targeting]{.mark} the foreign ministries of [other
NATO countries]{.mark}**.  ]{.underline}

[[Russia]{.mark}n targeting has [prioritized]{.mark} governments,
especially among [NATO members]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the list of
targets has also included think tanks, humanitarian organizations, IT
companies, and energy and other critical infrastructure suppliers. Since
the start of the war, the Russian targeting we've identified has been
successful 29 percent of the time. A quarter of these successful
intrusions has led to confirmed exfiltration of an organization's data,
although as explained in the report, this likely understates the degree
of Russian success.  

We remain the most concerned about government computers that are running
"on premise" rather than in the cloud. This reflects the current and
global state of offensive cyber espionage and defensive cyber
protection. As the SolarWinds incident demonstrated 18 months ago,
Russia's intelligence agencies have extremely sophisticated capabilities
to implant code and operate as an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) that
can obtain and exfiltrate sensitive information from a network on an
ongoing basis. There have been substantial advances in defensive
protection since that time, but the implementation of these advances
remains more uneven in European governments than in the United States.
As a result, significant collective defensive weaknesses remain. 

Fourth, in coordination with these other cyber activities, Russian
agencies are conducting global cyber-influence operations to support
their war efforts. These combine tactics developed by the KGB over
several decades with new digital technologies and the internet to give
foreign influence operations a broader geographic reach, higher volume,
more precise targeting, and greater speed and agility. Unfortunately,
with sufficient planning and sophistication, these cyber-influence
operations are well positioned to take advantage of the longstanding
openness of democratic societies and the public polarization that is
characteristic of current times. 

As the war in Ukraine has progressed, [Russian agencies are focusing
their cyber-influence operations]{.underline} on four distinct
audiences. They are targeting the Russian population with the goal of
sustaining support for the war effort. They are targeting the Ukrainian
population with the goal of undermining confidence in the country's
willingness and ability to withstand Russian attacks. They are
[targeting American and European populations with the [goal of
**undermining Western**]{.mark} **[unity]{.mark}** and deflecting
criticism of Russian military war crimes]{.underline}. And they are
starting to target populations in nonaligned countries, potentially in
part to sustain their support at the United Nations and in other
venues. 

Russian cyber-influence operations are building on and are connected to
tactics developed for other cyber activities. Like the APT teams that
work within Russian intelligence services, Advance Persistent
Manipulator (APM) teams associated with Russian government agencies act
through social media and digital platforms. They are pre-positioning
false narratives in ways that are similar to the pre-positioning of
malware and other software code. They are then launching broad-based and
simultaneous "reporting" of these narratives from government-managed and
influenced websites and amplifying their narratives through technology
tools designed to exploit social media services. Recent examples include
narratives around biolabs in Ukraine and multiple efforts to obfuscate
military attacks against Ukrainian civilian targets.  

As part of a new initiative at Microsoft, we are using AI, new analytics
tools, broader data sets, and a growing staff of experts to track and
forecast this cyber threat. Using these new capabilities, we estimate
that Russian cyber influence operations successfully increased the
spread of Russian propaganda after the war began by 216 percent in
Ukraine and 82 percent in the United States.  

These ongoing Russian operations build on recent sophisticated efforts
to spread false COVID narratives in multiple Western countries. These
included state-sponsored cyber-influence operations in 2021 that sought
to discourage vaccine adoption through English-language internet reports
while simultaneously encouraging vaccine usage through Russian-language
sites. During the last six months, similar Russian cyber influence
operations sought to help inflame public opposition to COVID-19 policies
in New Zealand and Canada.  

We will continue to expand Microsoft's work in this field in the weeks
and months ahead. This includes both internal growth and through the
agreement we announced last week to acquire Miburo Solutions, a leading
cyber threat analysis and research company specializing in the detection
of and response to foreign cyber influence operations. 

We're concerned that many current [Russian cyber influence operations
currently go for months without proper detection, analysis, or public
reporting]{.underline}. This increasingly impacts a wide range of
important institutions in both the public and private sectors. And the
longer the war lasts in Ukraine, the more important these operations
likely will become for Ukraine itself. This is because [a **[longer
war]{.mark} will [require]{.mark} [sustaining public support]{.mark}**
from the inevitable challenge of greater fatigue. **This [should add
urgency to]{.mark} the [importance of strengthening Western
defenses]{.mark}** against these types of foreign cyber influence
attacks. ]{.underline}

Finally, the [[lessons from Ukraine call for]{.mark} a
[coordinated]{.mark} and comprehensive [strategy]{.mark} to strengthen
defenses against the full range of cyber destructive, espionage, and
influence operations]{.underline}. As the war in Ukraine illustrates,
while there are differences among these threats, the Russian Government
does not pursue them as separate efforts and we should not put them in
separate analytical silos. In addition, [defensive strategies must
consider the coordination of these cyber operations with kinetic
military operations, as witnessed in Ukraine]{.underline}.  

[[New advances to thwart]{.mark} these [cyber threats are]{.mark}
needed, and they will depend on]{.underline} four common tenets and ---
at least at a high level --- [**a [common]{.mark} [strategy]{.mark}.**
The first defensive tenet should recognize that Russian cyber threats
are being advanced by a common set of actors inside and outside the
Russian Government and rely on similar digital tactics. As a result,
advances in digital technology, AI, and data will be needed to counter
them.]{.underline} Reflecting this, a second tenet should recognize that
unlike the traditional threats of the past, cyber responses must rely on
greater public and private collaboration. A third tenet should
**[[embrace]{.mark} the [need for close]{.mark} and common
[multilateral]{.mark} [collaboration]{.mark} among governments [to
protect open]{.mark} and [democratic societies]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
And a fourth and final defensive tenet should [[uphold free
expression]{.mark} and [avoid censorship]{.mark} in democratic
societies, even as new steps are [needed to address]{.mark} the full
range of cyber threats that include [cyber influence
operations]{.mark}.  ]{.underline}

[An effective response must build on these tenets with four strategic
pillars. These should increase collective capabilities to better (1)
detect, (2) defend against, (3) disrupt, and (4) deter foreign cyber
threats. This approach is already reflected in many collective efforts
to address destructive cyberattacks and cyber-based espionage. They also
apply to the critical and ongoing work needed to address ransomware
attacks. We now need a similar and comprehensive approach with new
capabilities and defenses to combat Russian cyber influence
operations.  ]{.underline}

As discussed in this report, the war in Ukraine provides not only
lessons but a call to action for effective measures that will be vital
to the protection of democracy's future. As a company, we are committed
to supporting these efforts, including through ongoing and new
investments in technology, data, and partnerships that will support
governments, companies, NGOs, and universities.

FGY

Given the recent blockbuster headlines about alleged Chinese snooping on
server hardware sold to major technology companies and the latest
joint-denunciation of Russian cyber operations, you could be forgiven
for having missed an important NATO-related development. The Associated
Press reports that the U.S. Defense Department will announce a new
commitment to use offensive and defensive cybersecurity capabilities on
behalf of NATO allies.

The new commitment is notable given how [cybersecurity has long been
treated as an exceptional domain of operations, and cyber capabilities
reserved as strategic national assets to be shared with only the closest
of allies]{.underline}. With this announcement, the Pentagon is
suggesting that [[cyber]{.mark} capabilities [might be used alongside
conventional weapons]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [allies]{.mark} and indeed,
**[equal weight]{.mark} appears to be [given to offensive and defensive
operations]{.mark}**. Perhaps most significantly, the [announcement
**moves NATO partners closer** to what has been]{.mark} a [tight coterie
of U.S.-favored signals]{.mark} intelligence partners]{.underline} such
as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.

The DoD announcement is a sign of the [continued]{.underline}, if
nascent, [[normalization of cybersecurity]{.mark} under the current
administration and in Europe]{.underline}. Even where offensive cyber
operations may not rise to the level of war, they [[provide]{.mark}
[decision-makers with]{.mark} [options to influence]{.mark} the
[geopolitical]{.mark} [environment]{.mark}. This aligns with recent
trends in the U.S. military to integrate cyber capabilities into
maneuver units and large exercises, and reflects the shift towards more
risk acceptant and offensive measures to counter
cyberattacks]{.underline} found in the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy.

[[Moving]{.mark} cyber [capabilities into]{.mark} the [same strategic
frame]{.mark} as conventional weapons, especially [with]{.mark}
[NATO]{.mark}, [reflects]{.mark} a [shift in]{.mark} institutional
[cyber]{.mark} [arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline} within the United
States and the growing power of the military relative to the
intelligence community. For the United States, cyber capabilities have
always had a complicated relationship with the intelligence community,
in particular the National Security Agency (NSA). When Cyber Command
stood up in 2010 as a sub-unified combatant command within the
Department of Defense, it moved into the NSA's headquarters, staffed its
management ranks with longtime NSA employees, borrowed networks and
technical capabilities, and to this day shares a dual-hatted commander.
In the immediate years after the command was created, it was logical
that the structure of partnerships with allies looked more like the
special signals intelligence relationships formed around the NSA rather
than traditional alliance networks in NATO and Asia. The recent
announcement aligns cyber operations more closely with Department of
Defense missions, which are more likely to posture capabilities for
deterrent effects, than intelligence missions, which view capabilities
as assets to be carefully husbanded.

[Treating cybersecurity capabilities more like conventional arms and
less like national assets also helps drive the integration of cyber
operations into the planning and execution of a broader array of
conventional military missions]{.underline}. Early cyber operations were
largely conventional espionage and surveillance activities supercharged
by the spread of computing and the internet. In the United States, this
led to the creation of large and complex software tools, carefully
guarded by the intelligence community as national assets (sometimes
unsuccessfully). The DoD's announcement indicates a move towards
treating at least some of these capabilities, along with their
supporting infrastructure, more like conventional armaments and making
them available for broader use; a model closer to Central or Special
Operations Command and less like the National Security Agency.

The Pentagon's new [commitment]{.underline} also [[reflects changes in
how Europe talks about cybersecurity]{.mark} and characterizes the
Russian threat]{.underline}. [The last two years have seen a trend
toward more open discussion of offensive cyber operations and the
possibility of the alliance adopting more assertive postures to counter
cyber operations against its members. After years of devastating
ransomware attacks and cyber-enabled information attacks,
**[NATO]{.mark} [members]{.mark} are [more willing to explore
cyber]{.mark}**]{.underline} triggers to Article 5. [They have also been
more willing to **[articulate]{.mark} the [cyber threat against]{.mark}
the [alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition to last week's
denunciation by Dutch, UK, and U.S. authorities, Russian state actors
are widely suggested to be responsible for an increasingly brazen series
of operations, including targeting German government ministries, French
and British TV stations, and more.

Sharing offensive cyber capabilities raises the question of whether
cyber operations can extend effective deterrence to NATO partners. There
seems to be little focus on using these operations to deter conventional
or nuclear attacks on NATO countries, but this may evolve. The United
States seems to want NATO to use cyber operations to deter other cyber
operations, particularly those falling under the threshold of armed
conflict. Cyber operations have all sorts of problems for deterrence:
signaling is difficult, they can be perceived as a cheap threat, and
their effects are largely uncertain. By contrast, moving new military
forces in Eastern Europe or conducting ground exercises are credible
signals of extended deterrence, but are costly and time consuming. Cyber
capabilities aren't free, nor are they necessarily cheap, but the
promise to use them can add new credibility to a deterrent threat
without the same investment and delay as conventional alternatives.
[**[Sharing]{.mark} cyber [capabilities may be a cheaper]{.mark} [way
to]{.mark} [signal]{.mark} alliance [commitment]{.mark}** than other
options and might signal a further maturation, and acceptance, of
cybersecurity into geopolitics.]{.underline}

[The [Biden]{.mark} administration [and]{.mark} **a [bevy of allies are
calling out China]{.mark}** this morning for a raft of bad behavior in
cyberspace]{.underline}, including a hack into Microsoft email servers
that compromised at least 30,000 organizations in the United States
alone. 

[U.S. officials are formally attributing
that]{.underline} [[hack]{.underline} ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/china-hack-microsoft-email-biden-response/2021/03/06/7fe6652c-7e1a-11eb-85cd-9b7fa90c8873_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_4)to
China's Ministry of State Security, [as are **allies [from]{.mark} the
[E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion, [NATO]{.mark}, the [U]{.mark}nited
[K]{.mark}ingdom**, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.]{.underline}

[The group is also condemning the Chinese government for working with
criminal contract hackers]{.underline}, including for cyberattacks aimed
solely at personal gain rather than intelligence gathering. Those
operations include ransomware attacks, a senior Biden administration
official said --- including at least one attack in which hackers locked
up computers at a U.S. company and demanded a multimillion-dollar ransom
to unlock them. 

[It\'s [among]{.mark} the **[most far-reaching condemnations]{.mark}**
of Chinese hacking [to date.]{.mark}]{.underline} And the behavior it
describes is far more thuggish than Beijing\'s traditional hacking,
which has focused on espionage and helping Chinese firms outcompete
their rivals rather than on common theft. 

Such close links between government and criminal hackers are a trademark
of Russia's cyber operations. They were thought to be less common in
China, but not unknown there. 

The move comes as the Biden administration is already in a cyber face
off with the Kremlin, threatening severe punishments for criminal
ransomware gangs operating on Russian territory that have wreaked havoc
on U.S. businesses. 

"We've raised our concerns about both the Microsoft incident and \[the
People's Republic of China's\] broader malicious cyber activity with
senior PRC government officials, making clear that the PRC's actions
threaten security, confidence and stability in cyberspace," the senior
administration official said. 

The administration isn't announcing any sanctions or other punishments
against Chinese officials for the hacks but isn't ruling them out, the
official said. 

In a separate action, the Justice Department revealed indictments this
morning against four Chinese officers in a provincial arm of the
Ministry of State Security for a seven-year hacking campaign focused on
stealing intellectual property including information about infectious
disease research. 

Here are three big takeaways:

1\. **[Allies, allies and more allies]{.underline}**

[It's [[not
uncommon](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-and-more-than-a-dozen-allies-to-condemn-china-for-economic-espionage/2018/12/20/cdfd0338-0455-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_19) for
the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to join with allies in
jointly attributing government-backed hacks]{.mark}** that have global
consequences. But there's an **[especially long list of nations]{.mark}
and alliances [making]{.mark} this [attribution]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
NATO, for example, has never before attributed a cyberattack to China. 

[Other nations may make similar attributions in coming
weeks]{.underline}, the administration official said. 

[The [message is clear]{.mark}: These **[nations]{.mark} [all]{.mark}
basically [agree]{.mark}** about what's in and out of bounds for
government hackers]{.underline}. And China, despite its status as an
economic and military powerhouse, is firmly out of bounds. 

"\[China's\] pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace is
inconsistent with its stated objective of being seen as a responsible
leader in the world," the senior administration official said. The
official later added, "we\'re putting forward a common cyber approach
with our allies and laying down clear expectations on how responsible
nations behave in cyberspace."

2\. Strong words, but no punishments yet.

The United States has slapped sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea
for hacking. But it has been wary of sanctioning China, with which it
has a much broader relationship, including massive trade ties.

But harsh words have not been sufficient so far to change China's
behavior, and some analysts say it's time to give stronger measures a
try. 

"The lack of any sanctions by the U.S. government against Chinese cyber
threat actors is a huge problem that transcends four
administrations," Dmitri Alperovitch, chairman of the Silverado Policy
Accelerator think tank, told my colleague Ellen Nakashima. "We need to
stop treating China as if they have a special immunity to being held
accountable and we need to act in parity as we have with the other major
malicious cyber actors, including Russia."

The E.U. has been somewhat more aggressive, [sanctioning Chinese
hackers](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-slaps-sanctions-on-hackers-in-russia-north-korea-china/) last
year for a 12-year hacking campaign dubbed Cloud Hopper that vacuumed up
data from major industries in a dozen countries.  

The Biden official emphasized that today's naming and shaming campaign
is just one step in responding to Chinese hacking, and more responses
may be coming. 

["We're also aware that no one action can change behavior, and neither
can one country acting on its own. So, we really **focused initially in
bringing other countries along with us**,"]{.underline} the official
said.

Security Assistance as Incentive

[Security [assistance generates]{.mark} a **classic [principal-agent
problem]{.mark}**. In such relationships between a principal and its
agent or proxy, there [exists]{.mark} an [information asymmetry]{.mark}
where the agent inherently has more information about their own
capabilities, activities, and interests than the principal.
[Agents]{.mark}, being rational actors, [place]{.mark} their [own
interests above]{.mark} those of the [principal]{.mark} and, in the
absence of other incentives, behave accordingly. The **[great]{.mark}er
the [degree of misalignment]{.mark}, the more problematic this
becomes**. U.S. frustration during its 20-year war in Afghanistan over
Pakistan's perceived failure to adequately confront extremist groups,
despite significant military aid, is an example of principal-agent
problems at work.]{.underline}

Fortunately[, these are not insurmountable obstacles]{.underline}.
[**Security [assistance]{.mark}** in the form of arms, equipment, or
other support **[can be an effective]{.mark} [incentive]{.mark} when it
is [used]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a [carrot]{.mark} to reward desired
behavior**, such as achieving a specific reform or taking some other
action aligned with the interests of the principal]{.underline}.
[Alternately, such aid [becomes]{.mark} a [stick when it is
withheld]{.mark}. An example of this carrot-and-stick approach being
used effectively is described in Walter Ladwig's study of U.S.
assistance to the Philippines]{.underline} to combat the Hukbalahap
rebellion in the decade following World War II. Heavy-handed tactics
used by the local constabulary forces were a major factor driving
support for the rebels. Recognizing this problem, [[U.S. advisors
insisted on a series of]{.mark} **[reforms]{.mark} within the security
forces [as a precondition for further aid]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} These
measures,]{.underline} along with the appointment of the reform-minded
Ramon Magsaysay as defense chief, [contributed to a far more effective
counterinsurgency campaign]{.underline} and the eventual defeat of the
rebel movement.

[This approach of using aid as an incentive [stands in **sharp contrast
to**]{.mark} Ladwig's other case study,]{.underline} Vietnam, where
[[**U.S. aid** was used **as**]{.mark} **an [inducement]{.mark}** in the
hope that it would eventually change partner behavior. In this case,
U.S. advisors tried in vain]{.underline} year after year to cajole prime
minister Ngo Dinh Diem and successor regimes to implement reforms that
would have broadened domestic political support and made the South
Vietnamese forces more effective. All the while, [**[massive]{.mark}
U.S. [assistance]{.mark} [continued to flow]{.mark}** in with the
expectation that it would eventually bring about a change of heart in
the host-nation government. Such **[change never]{.mark}
[came]{.mark}**, and the United States]{.underline} and its South
Vietnamese proxies [lost]{.underline} the war.

[The more recent U.S. experience]{.underline} in Iraq from 2003 until
the withdrawal in 2011 contains echoes of Vietnam. David Lake's study of
that conflict [suggests that]{.underline} [provision of **[unconditional
security]{.mark} assistance [may still be America's default]{.mark}
setting**. Despite massive volumes of military aid provided]{.underline}
to the Iraqi government during this period, [**U.S. [urging to
reform]{.mark} the security forces and national government repeatedly
[failed]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Nouri al-Maliki, prime minister during
much of this period, resisted efforts to make the armed forces more
broadly inclusive and apolitical, instead continuing to employ them as
his own sectarian instrument. Again, the United States used an approach
focused on training and equipping, known in the current lexicon as
building partner capacity. The Iraqi [**government received assistance
regardless of its effort, or lack thereof, to implement much-needed
reform** while the **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [failed to
use]{.mark} the [leverage]{.mark} [which]{.mark} hundreds of millions of
dollars of [assistance could]{.mark} buy**.]{.underline} Several years
later, the Iraqi military in which the United States had invested so
much fell apart virtually upon first contact with the Islamic State's
irregular militia.

[The **"[building partner capacity]{.mark}" approach has two main
flaws**. First, it **[ignores]{.mark} fundamental problems, such as
[corruption]{.mark}, coup-proofing, and otherwise [weak]{.mark} defense
[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [which additional military capacity
cannot overcome and may even exacerbate. Paradoxically, a focus
primarily on capacity-building often fails to build meaningful,
long-term capacity because it [neglects]{.mark} underlying
[institutional]{.mark} problems]{.underline}. [Second, it ignores
[principal-agent problems]{.mark} by assuming that once in possession of
highly capable security forces, the partner will wield them in a manner
aligned with U.S. interests. U.S. advisors and diplomats may recognize
the pressing need for security sector reform in the partner.
Unfortunately, the [ingrained culture of U.S. security assistance
seemingly relies on]{.mark} the [false premise]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
with [enough U.S.]{.mark} training and [relationship-building]{.mark},
[other countries]{.mark}' militaries [will voluntarily]{.mark}
[reform]{.mark} even though it is often not in their personal interests
to do so.]{.underline}

Hard Is Not Impossible

These failings notwithstanding, there exists no shortage of arguments in
favor of the status quo and against shifting America's focus in security
assistance to security-sector reform and conditional aid. In an era of
great-power competition, Russia, China, or regional competitors may
simply step in to fill the gap with the partner nation if the United
States insists upon unwelcome reforms in exchange for aid. I know this
is a valid concern because I have sat in meetings where partners made
thinly veiled reference to other nations which may provide assistance if
the United States is unable or unwilling. Still, [the quality and
technological edge of U.S. kit and the total-package approach which
includes training and follow-on support do provide the United States a
competitive advantage. But]{.underline} [**[the bureaucratic
apparatus]{.mark} responsible for delivering aid [is]{.mark} far too
slow and, as a result, is [a liability]{.mark}**. To outcompete, the
security assistance enterprise itself requires major reform to shorten
typical lead times from years to months. The Pentagon and State
Department need the agility to turn aid on and off like a switch or
rheostat.]{.underline}

Another argument against placing preconditions on security assistance is
that the stakes are too high to deny a partner a critical capability
while waiting for reform to happen. This is the "we can't let them fail"
mentality. It is also valid --- but only in certain crisis situations
where aid is needed immediately, and reform truly cannot wait. Ukraine
today is a good example. Rather than ceasing aid writ large until a
condition is met, place conditions on discrete packages of aid. The
intent should be to provide sufficient incentive to the host-nation
government to modify behavior, not threaten national survival. During
the years I spent in Afghanistan, the security threats faced by the
government never appeared to afford the breathing space to withhold aid
while institutional reform took place. In hindsight, doing so may have
required coalition forces to carry a greater operational burden while
the Afghan forces sorted themselves out, but it also would have been
worth it. As the events of August 2021 demonstrated, 20 years of
unconditional capacity-building built shockingly little capacity.
Implementing this change requires a recurring review of Defense
Department-led train and equip programs to determine which truly qualify
as crisis situations. Those which do not should be moved under State
Department control for more deliberate, reform-focused approach.

There is also the simple argument that instituting meaningful reform in
a recalcitrant partner nation is hard. This is true. But hard is not
impossible. The security assistance enterprise should approach reform
not in broad, sweeping terms but incremental steps. Rather than
requiring the partner to eliminate corruption wholesale across the
security forces, perhaps require that a particularly corrupt commander
be removed before providing assistance to that unit. In the case of Iraq
in the late 2000s, the United States might have required Prime Minister
Nouri al-Maliki to fire certain commanders guilty of sectarian excesses
or modify the personnel policy to make the armed forces more broadly
inclusive. In other cases, reform measures may be as mundane as
switching to an electronic pay system to reduce the opportunity for
graft. Such a change in approach would also require a change in how the
United States prepares officers for security assistance duties. The
Defense Security Cooperation Agency has made great strides in its
educational program to professionalize the security assistance workforce
in recent years. It could further improve this program by embedding
security sector reform more deeply into the curriculum.

Currently, [[human rights considerations are rarely given **significant
weight**]{.mark} in decisions about [who to support]{.mark} and when
[with U.S. security assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}. In moving resources
to the State Department, [[officials]{.mark} [should conduct]{.mark} a
full [review]{.mark} of a partner's capability, capacity, and political
will to]{.underline} protect civilians and [[abide]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
human rights [requirements before approving future]{.mark} U.S.
[assistance]{.mark}.]{.underline}92 [These reviews, conducted at the
outset of U.S. security relationships, could [ensure]{.mark} that a
[partner is unlikely to abuse]{.mark} U.S. [aid]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Additionally, to counter the sizeable influence of regional bureaus, the
Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor should be required to
review and concur on security assistance projects that involve countries
found to have a history or pattern of human rights abuses in the conduct
of its security forces or security policy. This determination should be
informed by the State Department's own annual human rights reporting in
addition to information from civil society groups. Human rights vetting
should also be reformed. Under the current system, partners who purchase
U.S. assistance and equipment circumvent Leahy law vetting, and aid that
flows directly to ministries of defense, rather than individual units,
is not subject to the same human rights restrictions.93
[[Closing]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[loopholes]{.underline}]{.mark}
would not only bring all U.S. assistance in accordance with existing
U.S. law, but it [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[make]{.mark} for
[smarter p]{.mark}olicy]{.underline}. [Researchers have found that [when
partners commit human rights abuses with known U.S. support]{.mark},
[civilians]{.mark} on the ground [are more likely to blame
America]{.mark}n foreign policy]{.underline}.94 [Prioritizing partners
that are willing to abide by international human rights standards would
protect American interests and civilians on the ground]{.underline}. The
Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, in collaboration with the Bureau
of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, should jointly increase the human
rights vetting of arms transfers. Finally, the State Department should
develop a framework of triggers and indicators on human rights and
civilian protection that would require a reevaluation or termination of
a security partnership. [[When partners commit abuses]{.mark} or refuse
to abide by international law, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
**[must]{.mark}** [be willing to cut off assistance]{.mark}. This would
ensure that the United States is not complicit in abusive behavior and
could incentivize partners to clean up]{.underline} security force
[conduct.]{.underline} This internal trigger should also automatically
alert Congress to ensure that proper remediation is done by the
executive branch.

#### Security Cooperation should [not]{.underline} be a handout to non-democracies

**Bergmann** and Schmitt **21**, \*senior fellow at the Center for
American Progress, where he focuses on European security and U.S.-Russia
policy. From 2011 to 2017, he served in the U.S. Department of State in
a number of different positions, including as a member of the secretary
of state's policy planning staff, where he focused on political-military
affairs and nonproliferation; special assistant to the undersecretary
for arms control and international security; speechwriter to
then-Secretary of State John Kerry; and senior adviser to the assistant
secretary of state for political-military affairs. Prior to serving in
the State Department, he worked at CAP as a military and
nonproliferation policy analyst and at the National Security Network as
the deputy policy director. Bergmann received his master's degree from
the London School of Economics in comparative politics and his
bachelor's degree from Bates College, \*\*senior policy analyst on the

<https://www.americanprogress.org/article/plan-reform-u-s-security-assistance/)//BB>

While [this report calls for [realigning U.S. assistance toward
**democratic allies**]{.mark}]{.underline} and partners, it avoids
diving into the specific policy debates over what countries should or
should not receive security assistance. Those are obviously critical
foreign policy debates, but the authors focus on improving the ability
of U.S. officials to make coherent policy decisions by first creating an
effective management and organizational structure of security
assistance. [This will]{.underline} also [[require]{.mark}
[major]{.mark} [reform]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the State
Department's own [[security assistance]{.mark} programs, [which]{.mark}
**[routinely]{.mark}** and **[without deliberation]{.mark}** [provide
billions in]{.mark} [aid to nondemocracies]{.mark}. Security [assistance
should **not be a diplomatic handout**]{.mark} **or entitlement**; it
[should serve U.S. foreign policy]{.mark} and be [flexible enough in its
administration to align with U.S. foreign policy objectives]{.mark} and
**values**]{.underline}. That not only requires consolidating security
assistance programs in one place, but also demands significant reforms
to the decision-making structure and security assistance system at the
State Department.

#### Doing both [requires]{.underline} assistance to undemocratic states -- undermines democratization 

**Sullivan 18**, associate professor in the Department of Public Policy
and the Curriculum in Peace, War, and Defense at the University of North
Carolina (Patricia, et al, "Arming the Peace: Foreign Security
Assistance and Human Rights Conditions in Post-Conflict Countries,"
Defence and Peace Economics, doi:10.1080/10242694.2018.1558388)

[Only a handful of other studies systematically investigate the impact
of military aid on civilian populations outside the context of an
ongoing war]{.underline}. This scholarship tends to focus on weapons
transfers. Like much of the literature on economic aid, [[the bulk of
the research on arms transfers concludes that]{.underline}]{.mark} major
conventional [weapons [transfers to]{.mark} developing [countries
increase human rights abuses]{.mark} and **[impede]{.mark}
[democratization]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Blanton 1999a, 1999b, de Soysa,
Jackson, and Ormhaug 2010). More recently, Pamp et al. (2018) find that
conventional weapons imports increase the risk of intrastate conflict
onset -- particularly in countries with other risk factors for political
violence. This study echoes results from Craft and Smaldone (2002) who
find that arms imports increase the risk of civil war in sub-Saharan
Africa. In sum, **[extant [research leans toward a pessimistic
outlook]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the prospects for foreign assistance
to improve human security in fragile and conflict-affected countries.
While there is some evidence that economic aid could increase the
capacity of governments to deter violent nonstate actors and lessen
armed conflict, [most studies suggest]{.underline} economic aid,
**[military [assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and arms transfers all
**[[negatively]{.mark} [impact]{.mark} governance and [human rights
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

3\. Combatant Commands

Throughout the execution of SC activities, CCDRs and their staffs
continually direct, assess, monitor, evaluate, and adjust the SC
activities when possible and the CSCSs/country plans as required, while
the component commands do the same with their supporting plans. However,
[[once resourced]{.mark}, execution of **specific [SC]{.mark} activities
[occurs as planned]{.mark}**]{.underline} unless a crisis affecting US
forces and/or the PN precludes completion of those SC activities.
[[SC]{.mark} activities normally take place through bilateral agreements
that **[constitute]{.mark} [binding]{.mark} [legal obligations]{.mark}**
[for both the USG and PN]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result, [any
**[deviation]{.mark} from the terms of a bilateral agreement** likely
**[requires]{.mark} the [consent of both
governments]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Consequently, [major changes are
unlikely during the execution of a specific SC activity]{.underline}.
However, in the absence of a governing bilateral agreement and with
several FYs of SC activities at various stages of planning, programming,
and budgeting during any given calendar year, this process can make
changes for the future.

#### It's [unconditional entitlement]{.underline} and [not a QPQ]{.underline}

**Munson 13**, senior vice president for preventive services and global

If SC is incapable in many cases of building meaningful partner capacity
or creating real influence, then wonks will argue that SC and especially
military aid payments are needed to secure much more black-and-white
U.S. interests: overflight and transit agreements and peace treaty
compliance. Yet, this is another instance where the bankruptcy of SC
ideology is demonstrated. SC [\[[Security Cooperation]{.mark}\] [funding
and services **are**]{.mark}]{.underline} generally [**[not]{.mark}**
initiated as a **[q]{.mark}**uid **[p]{.mark}**ro
**[q]{.mark}**uo]{.underline} for overflight and transit. [[Once the
flow]{.mark} of cash [has started]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, threats
of closing off cooperation in the form of overflight, transit, or other
agreements become tools of extortion in the hands of the foreign
partner. [No matter how inefficient or expensive, [the U.S. **cannot**
turn the spigot down or off]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[SC]{.mark} thus [is
**not a tool to condition partner behaviors**, but rather an
**entitlement**]{.mark}]{.underline}---a fee for maintaining the status
quo---[a baseline bribe that creates a market of fees-for-service for
the most mundane issues]{.underline}.

#### 2 -- cooperation -- it requires [voluntary]{.underline} adjustment, not coercion

**Berenskotter 8** -- PhD @ LSE (Felix Sebastian, From Friends to
Strangers: A Theory of Interstate Security Cooperation Applied to
German-American Relations, 1945 -- 1995,
<http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/2986/1/U615938.pdf)//BB>

In this thesis [[cooperation is]{.mark}]{.underline} not understood as
an instantaneous decision but as a process, that is, something occurring
over time. It builds on Keohane's definition of cooperation as the
phenomenon when "the politics actually followed by one government are
regarded by its partners as facilitating realization of their own
objectives, as the result of a process of policy coordination".
Importantly, this process implies change where "actions of separate
individuals\...be brought into conformity with one another" (Keohane,
1984: 5 If, emphasis added). This is echoed by [Grieco]{.underline}
(1990: 22) who [adds the qualification of cooperation as]{.underline}
"[**[voluntary adjustment]{.mark}**" [of policies]{.mark}]{.underline},
thereby [limiting cooperation to those relationships where policy
coordination was **[not a consequence of coercion but of
choice]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thus implying agency. Taken together,
[[cooperation thus requires]{.underline}]{.mark} the convergence of
policies through a process of mutual coordination and [[**voluntary**
adjustment]{.underline}]{.mark}. The qualification that these policies
are 'actually followed' is important and points out that cooperation
goes beyond rhetoric and distinguishes, in Morgenthau's (1960: 186)
words, an operative from an inoperative alliance. In this sense,
following Grieco (1990) and Stein (1990), cooperation is defined as
costly investment in a shared institutions (or regime) on the
international level over a period of time.

#### This definition of 'cooperation' is widely recognized. [International relations]{.underline} [distinguishes]{.underline} between QPQs and cooperation

**Tang 9** -- PhD, Professor of IR and Public Affairs @ Fudan U
(Shiping, "Living with China: Regional States and China through Crises
and Turning Points," p. 4)

In contrast, [[issue linkage means]{.underline}]{.mark} many [instances
of [quid pro quo]{.mark}, thus limiting]{.underline} the chances of
obtaining [cooperation]{.underline} in some issue areas via piecemeal
cooperation building. [[Issue linkage is]{.mark} essentially
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[coercive]{.underline}** [measure to extract
concessions]{.underline}]{.mark} from the other side, and
\"cooperation\" obtained from such a process can be only tactical
concessions, **[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** genuine
[**[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline} based on goodwill to forge a more
cooperative relationship. As a result, even if one side succeeds in
coercing the other side into concession through issue linkage, the
chance for achieving [a]{.underline} more [cooperative relationship is
reduced]{.underline} because such an outcome generates resentment rather
than trust from the other side. More likely than not, [the other side
will want]{.underline} some [payback]{.underline} next time, [rather
than a]{.underline} more [cooperative relationship]{.underline}.
Certainly, while [issue linkage was one of]{.underline} Henry
[Kissinger\'s favorite tools for getting]{.underline} the Soviet Union
to agree to some [concessions]{.underline} during the Cold War years,
[he had no intention to build cooperation]{.underline} with the Soviet
Union.9

Sharepoint supports people who are collaborating, focused on specific

collaboration, but also workplace **[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**

connections by making work more transparent. But is a separate
collaboration platform necessary, or just an added extra? It will be
interesting to see if the triad of Yammer + Sharepoint + Office will
dominate in large organizations, over more pure-play enterprise social
platforms

The legal question to be resolved by the court is whether the word
\"should\"[13](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn13)
in the May 18 order connotes futurity or may be deemed a ruling in

The answer to this query is not to be divined from rules of
grammar;[15](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn15)
it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal
professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the
omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, \"and
the same hereby is\", (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an
expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2)
constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the
trial judge\'s intent must be garnered from the four corners of the
entire
record.[16](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn16)

\"Should\" not only is used as a \"present indicative\" synonymous with
ought but also is the past tense of \"shall\" with various shades of

It would be wishful thinking, however, to argue that Washington could
avoid working with such regimes altogether. In fact, [many]{.underline}
of the [regimes in which Washington]{.underline} claims to [have vital
security interests are]{.underline} fragile and [plagued by]{.underline}
the same [governance]{.underline} [problems]{.underline} discussed
herein. [Working with these regimes is often unavoidable. Where this is
the case, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[should]{.mark}]{.underline} consider the following. First, due to
misaligned security priorities, productive cooperation and
capacity-building in these cases can only be achieved by shaping and
**[[alter]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing **[[host-state incentives
through]{.underline}]{.mark}** the establishment and
**[[credible]{.mark} [enforcement of
conditionality]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline} notion [is
widely recognized among development aid scholars, but has recently
gained traction among those who study security
assistance.]{.underline}32 [Recent work on [security]{.mark} [assistance
advocates allocating]{.mark} security assistance **[ex post as a reward
for effort]{.mark} and [reform]{.mark}**, [**rather than** ex
ante]{.mark} as an inducement]{.underline}, in a manner similar to the
Millenium Challenge Account.33 In a recent book,34 Walter Ladwig shows
that [[the United States **has been able** to exercise great]{.mark}er
[influence]{.mark} over host government policy [when it enforces
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}, as it did in the Philippines and El
Salvador. [Positive [conditionality]{.mark}
[requires]{.mark}]{.underline} the United States to verify the efforts
undertaken by the partner government, which in turn necessitates more
intrusive **[[monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Many countries will
balk at this as a violation of sovereignty, but **[[the United States
should insist upon it as a condition of military
assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [A [larger presence]{.mark} will not
only [enable]{.mark} better [monitoring]{.mark} of the host government's
coup-proofing actions, but may also [mitigate]{.mark} the [internal
security dilemma]{.mark} that drives such behavior]{.underline}. The
worst paranoid excesses of the Maliki regime did not occur until after
2011, when the United States was no longer present on the ground as a
safety net protecting his regime. The United States should also signal
that it is prepared to cut ties with regimes that work against its
security interests. Washington's reliance on security assistance to
fight terrorism abroad, without putting large numbers of U.S. forces in
combat, often undermines the credibility of any threats to withdraw this
assistance. Even in the rare cases when punishment has been enacted, as
it has been several times with Egypt and Pakistan,35 it has historically
come in the form of temporary freezes that are later lifted even after
little change in behavior. In the case of both Diem and Maliki, the
United States ultimately withdrew its support when backing them became
untenable. But the fact that this only happened after years of military
assistance instilled in both leaders the perception that they could do
no wrong, and that steadfast support would continue even as they further
consolidated power. By the time America decided to advocate for their
removal, it was far too late and the damage was already done.
[**[Unwillingness to enforce conditions]{.mark}** and withdraw support
[can **seriously** undermine]{.mark} the [objectives of U.S.
assistance]{.mark} and [makes it more likely that **other**]{.mark}
**[leaders will test the limits]{.mark}** of what the **United States

#### The "ask perm" relies on [persuasion]{.underline}, [not]{.underline} explicit [bargaining]{.underline}. That fails. 

**Tecott 21**, PhD in Political Science @ MIT (Rachel, "The Cult of the
Persuasive: The U.S. Military's Aversion to Coercion in Security
Assistance," Proquest Dissertations)

This study offers a novel conceptualization of U.S. influence strategies
in security assistance based on inductive analysis of U.S. security
assistance projects since World War II. [[In conducting security]{.mark}
[assistance]{.mark}, the [U.S.]{.mark} military has historically
[employed]{.mark} an influence strategy "ladder" comprised of four
rungs: teaching, [persuasion]{.mark}, [bargaining]{.mark},
and]{.underline} direct [command]{.underline}. [Teaching refers to the
transmission of information]{.underline} and expertise to recipient
decision-makers. This didactic approach hinges on the assumption that
recipients are actually interested in building stronger militaries, and
only insufficient knowledge stands in their way. [Persuasion,
bargaining, and direct command each begin with recognition of interest
misalignment between provider and recipient]{.underline}. [[Persuasion
aims to reshape recipient]{.mark} [preferences
through]{.mark}]{.underline} a variety of mechanisms including
inducements (**[[no strings attached]{.underline}]{.mark}**) designed to
spur reciprocal concessions, conversation and argumentation to change
minds, demonstration of "what right looks like" to inspire
[emulation]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the development of
interpersonal relationships and [rapport]{.underline} [to motivate
compliance]{.underline} on the basis of personal friendship.
**[[Bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in contrast, [**[refers
to]{.mark} the [use of conditionality]{.mark}**---[carrots and sticks
tied to compliance or defiance]{.mark}---to overcome interest
divergence]{.underline}. Finally, the U.S. may take direct command of
partner militaries or military units, exercising influence directly by
replacing partner decision-makers with Americans. In early examples of
U.S. security assistance---to China during World War II, to Greece in
the 1950s, and to South Korea in the 1940s and 1950s---the United States
taught and persuaded, but it also escalated to bargaining and direct
command to push partners to purge incompetent officers, root out
corruption, follow the chain of command, and implement other
professional military practices necessary for military effectiveness. In
contemporary security assistance, however, persuasion has emerged the
overwhelming rule. A review of U.S. security assistance doctrine reveals
a strong emphasis on relationship building and argumentation as the
preferred tools of influence in security assistance. Advisory efforts
have been redefined as the absence of direct command, and bargaining is
explicitly discouraged.14 Practice matches doctrine: in the post-9/11
period, U.S. military personnel frustrated with Afghan and Iraqi leaders
for the politicization and corruption rotting the militaries they were
trying to build nonetheless remained generally committed to persuasive
tactics and eschewed conditionality or command. Building from the
premise that the fundamental challenge of security assistance is
influence, and observing the prevalence of persuasion in the
contemporary period, this study asks and answers the following two
questions: 1) How do different U.S. influence strategies in security
assistance affect recipient military effectiveness? 2) What explains
U.S. strategy selection? 1.2 Arguments This study proposes and tests two
theories. The first theory examines the consequences of U.S. security
assistance influence strategies for recipient military effectiveness.
The second theory moves a link back in the causal chain and examines the
causes of United States strategy selection. Causes of Influence
Strategies Influence Strategies Consequences of Influence Strategies
Influence Strategy Theory (Consequences) I argue that [teaching and
[persuasion]{.mark}]{.underline} on their own **[[will not
suffice]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is
[more likely to influence partners]{.mark} to build better militaries
[when it employs]{.mark} the [full]{.mark} escalation
[ladder]{.mark}]{.underline}. Teaching is unlikely to succeed because
motivation, not lack of expertise, is almost always the reason recipient
leaders make decisions that undermine the development of their
militaries. Persuasion, bargaining, and direct command are all logical
improvements over teaching because they begin from the more realistic
premise that recipient decision-makers may not be interested in---and
may actively oppose---the development of a more effective military. [The
persuasion strategy on its own]{.underline}, however, [is ill-suited to
the security assistance context, because the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [tends to provide]{.mark} the [most assistance to states
whose leaders are least likely to be receptive]{.mark} to normative or
personal entreaties by U.S. personnel]{.underline}. Conversely, [the
ingredients necessary for successful
bargaining]{.underline}---**[[recipient]{.mark}
[dependence]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[iterated
interactions]{.underline}**, and the **[availability of calibrated
[carrots]{.mark} and [sticks]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[are]{.mark}
[met]{.mark} in the context of security assistance]{.underline}**.
Direct command works because it removes the influence challenge
altogether as American decision-makers replace partner decision-makers.
United States influence strategies are by no means the only factor that
affect security assistance outcomes. The United States might employ
bargaining and direct command and still fail to build more effective
partner militaries for a whole host of reasons. Though bargaining or
direct command are not sufficient for effective security assistance in
cases where interests between provider and recipient diverge (i.e.
almost all cases of security assistance), I argue that they are
necessary. I call this theory of influence strategy consequences
"Influence Strategy Theory," or, IST.

FGY

[[As]{.mark} **the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [pursues]{.mark} its
[initiative to bolster democratic rule]{.mark} and [human
rights]{.mark}**]{.underline} after last week's Summit for Democracy, [a
**[priority should be to]{.mark} diagnose and [repair]{.mark} the flaws
in [U.S.]{.mark} and allied [approaches to]{.mark} helping vulnerable
nations strengthen their [security]{.mark}**. Our **[existing]{.mark}**
pattern of security sector [assistance]{.mark} focuses largely on
training and equipping such nations' forces, and it emphasizes the
security of governments and institutions, rather than of the people they
are meant to serve. This type of **assistance [prioritizes]{.mark}
[short-term]{.mark} tactical [gains]{.mark} to the [detriment of
long-term]{.mark} U.S. strategic [goals]{.mark}**---and it should be
reformed.]{.underline}

Ample evidence---including the global surge in coups d'états and crises
of police violence from Brazil and Nigeria to the Philippines---shows
that dozens of countries must improve not only the "kinetic" capacities,
but also their governance, of police, military and other security
institutions. Yet a first outline last week of the new U.S. "initiative
for democratic renewal" omits any mention of this vital task.
[The]{.underline} [United States and its allies must re-shape their
assistance to support democracy and human]{.underline}
[rights]{.underline}. In some countries---for example Egypt and
Uganda---U.S. security sector assistance has helped to consolidate
authoritarianism. [Current trends risk [exacerbating]{.mark} the problem
in **a "[race]{.mark} to the bottom" [among]{.mark} the United States,
[Russia]{.mark} and [China]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[U]{.mark}.[S. policies]{.mark} too often [set aside]{.mark} the
nation's [commitment to democratic values]{.mark} on a flawed assumption
that this is necessary to advance U.S. interests amid great-power
competition. Yet **democratic [backsliding]{.mark}** and
**authoritarianism** [create]{.mark} **long-term [risks of violence,
instability]{.mark} and [extremism]{.mark}**. Even measured by the
narrower metric of strategic military alliances, these risks [weaken
U.S. security interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. Serious democratic
backsliding preceded Turkey's decision to purchase one or more Russian
S-400 missile defense systems. Democratic backsliding in the Philippines
weakened the U.S.-Philippine security relationship to the point of
endangering the agreement that has enabled a U.S. troop presence in the
Philippines. [Worldwide, democratic deficiencies help **push countries
into the arms of China or Russia**.]{.underline}

How Security Assistance Can Hurt Democracies

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and others [have historically
ignored]{.mark} the [significance of effective security]{.mark} [sector
governance]{.mark} for consolidating democracy. Donor countries have
treated security sector reform as a technical problem, rather than a
political endeavor that can change power dynamics and the political
trajectory in a country]{.underline}. The recent coups in Sudan, Mali,
Guinea, Myanmar and Chad show how an emboldened military and weak or
absent civilian control over security forces may not simply weaken
democracy, but end it.

To promote peace, stability, democracy and U.S. strategic objectives,
the United States helps violence-afflicted nations with assistance to
strengthen civil society, political parties, and legislative oversight.
Yet the people overthrowing civilian, elected rule in Chad, Guinea and
Mali this year were military officers who had been direct beneficiaries
of U.S. training. This agonizing irony underscores that we can no longer
neglect the central importance for democracy of helping nations improve
security sector governance.

In these latest coups and in other examples, we see how [security
assistance itself can undermine democracy when it effectively
"super-sizes" a vulnerable nation's security services relative to weaker
democratic, civilian institutions that are meant to control them. Where
governments lack funding and capacities to meet populations' basic
needs, this danger skyrockets. Yet in too many cases---Egypt, Mali,
Niger, the Philippines and others---U.S. and other security assistance
has [led to significant increases in]{.mark} military and security
[budgets]{.mark} at the expense of strengthening other critical
services. Ill-balanced security assistance especially risks weakening
democratic governance where it has backed major counterterrorism
operations.]{.underline}

Egypt is a prime example. In the past four years, U.S. bilateral
assistance to Egypt has been \$1.4 billion per year, most of that to pay
for Egypt to buy U.S.-made weapons. While this assistance has not
enabled Egypt to end the threats from its terrorist groups in Sinai, it
has buttressed the military regime, which now controls much of the
country's economy. [[Under current law]{.mark} and policy, [only \$300
million]{.mark} of the United States' bilateral [aid in]{.mark} FY [2021
was subject to being]{.mark} [withheld]{.mark} by the State Department
if Egypt failed to meet certain human rights and rule-of-law standards.
The [threat to withhold 23 percent]{.mark} of its assistance [is far too
little to show a powerful]{.mark} U.S. [commitment to democracy]{.mark},
rights and governance. It reflects the relatively small amount that the
United States has invested in promoting good governance.]{.underline}

President Biden often has said, "Don\'t tell me what you value. Show me
your budget, and I\'ll tell you what you value." This month, the Biden
administration proposed spending up to \$424.4 million next year on
programs to strengthen democracy---an initiative that hardly compares to
U.S. spending of roughly \$18-20 billion each recent year on security
assistance.

A Race to the Bottom

The United States' current approach risks becoming a race to the bottom
with China and Russia. [In recent years, **[countries receiving]{.mark}
security [assistance]{.mark} have [encouraged bidding wars]{.mark} among
Russia, China, and the United States to seek the most attractive
possible aid packages**, including weapons. I]{.underline}n fear of
losing leverage over partners such as Philippines or Nigeria , the
United States has participated. [This [allows authoritarian]{.mark} or
authoritarian-leaning [governments to procure weapons]{.mark} and other
equipment and training for their militaries or police [with]{.mark}
little or **[no requirement for human rights]{.mark} or security
governance improvements**]{.underline}. In some cases, the fear of
losing leverage may be unwarranted: After his initial flirtation with a
closer relationship with China, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte
understood that China's threat to his interests is very real and shifted
back to the U.S. camp.

This means [[the **United States has compromised on democracy**]{.mark}
**and human rights** for, at best, short-term gains in relations with a
given country. In the long term, however, [this]{.mark} approach
[undermines stability and democracy]{.mark}.]{.underline} During the
Cold War, the U.S.'s primary goal of maintaining partnerships with
governments in Africa to prevent them from absorbing Soviet influences
yielded a similar approach. A RAND study concluded that "U.S. assistance
appears likely to have increased the incidence of civil wars in this
period, likely by either exacerbating domestic instabilities or
provoking proxy conflicts." There is no reason to believe that a
21st-century race to the bottom with Russia and China, in the interest
of maintaining partnerships, will not have the same results.

[We Can Do Better]{.underline}

[The current U.S. approach to security sector assistance not only
detracts from President Biden's expressed goals of consolidating
democracy and countering authoritarianism, it damages U.S. strategic
interests in making it easier for China and Russia to engage with
authoritarian regimes.]{.underline} As [the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} builds from last week's Summit for
Democracy, it [[needs to fully apply]{.mark}, and in some cases
[expand]{.mark}, existing [policies]{.mark} [supporting]{.mark}
[democratic governance]{.mark} of the security sector]{.underline}. [Key
steps will include these:]{.underline}

1\. [**Keep promises to [withhold security assistance from human rights
violators]{.mark}**. Following through on existing legislation and
keeping promises to withhold aid to bad actors is critical for the
United States' ability to support democracy abroad and for its
credibility on the international stage. U.S. [policy]{.mark} [statements
describe **conditionality** for aid]{.mark}---**[democratic]{.mark}
[governance]{.mark} and [adherence to human rights
norms]{.mark}**---that often is ignored.]{.underline} As in Egypt, [the
United States often sustains security assistance to security partners
even when countries fall far short of critical governance and human
rights benchmarks. Frequently, senior U.S. officials may threaten to
withhold aid, but without follow-through. This needs to change if
democracy consolidation efforts are to have teeth]{.underline}.

2\. **[[Enforce]{.mark} [assessment]{.mark}, [monitoring]{.mark} and
[evaluation]{.mark} requirements]{.underline}**. The 2017 National
Defense Authorization Act required better assessment, monitoring and
evaluation of security sector assistance. [U.S. government officials
admit that this is not happening yet, and big strides need to be taken
to implement and learn from security assistance monitoring and
evaluation. This is one way **[to ensure]{.mark} [programming is
effective]{.mark}** and that it [helps]{.mark} [broader]{.mark}
strategic [objectives]{.mark}, including the **[consolidation of
democracy]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

3\. Create a global architecture for effective security sector
assistance. The Summit for Democracy offers a vital opportunity to start
discussions with allies on the creation of a global architecture for
effective security sector assistance, based on aid effectiveness
principles borrowed from development aid. This would not only avoid
duplication of effort and programming but would also show unity among
allies and strengthen each individual democratic assistance provider to
hold the line on human rights, good governance and democracy.

4\. [**[Center]{.mark} U.S. security sector [assistance on people's
security]{.mark}**. Human security [must be at the]{.mark}
[center]{.mark} [of]{.mark} security sector assistance for
[democracy]{.mark} to flourish. Otherwise, the United States risks
empowering authoritarian governments, without regard to what makes
communities safer. In this regard, we need to help countries to improve
their accountability mechanisms, and also to [enhance]{.mark} their
[citizen]{.mark} [participation]{.mark} in the design and development of
national security strategies.]{.underline}

5\. Be transparent about security assistance programs. Publicizing
details of the U.S.'s nearly \$19 billion in assistance, including
military and weapons projects, is vital to coordinate work among U.S.
and international donor agencies and organizations and to cut
programming that either wastes taxpayer funds or undermines strategic
priorities. Moreover, this [transparency is critical for recipient
partners' **security sector actors, civil society organizations, media,
to hold their own governments to account** about how the aid is
used.]{.underline}

#### Democratic principles must be [explicitly]{.underline} tied to security cooperation. That solves.

must]{.mark} **first** [get tough with fellow NATO

[[that brazenly backslide on core NATO values]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Democratic principles]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and fundamental
[human]{.mark} [rights]{.mark}]{.underline} such as press freedom [must
be [**welded** to strategic geopolitical interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.
For its part, Europe must earn Biden's trust. The only way it can do
this is by getting its own house in order. [Starting with the prickly
populists of Central and Eastern Europe]{.underline}. [Shared democratic
values have anchored NATO as the most successful alliance in history.
These values are now being chiselled away]{.underline} in Hungary and
Poland as well as Slovenia, which takes over Presidency of the EU
Council on July 1. A spate of recent reports by international watchdogs
has painted a grim picture of independent journalism being stifled. It
came as no surprise when a few months ago Reporters Without Borders
relegated Hungary to 92nd position in its World Press Freedom Index.
Poland, meanwhile, has fallen over 40 spots on the Index since the
ruling Law and Justice party came to power in 2015. It is now behind
Niger and war-pocked Armenia. The Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán
has used legislative and regulatory tools to muzzle critical outlets.
This has included a law that puts journalists behind bars for up to five
years if they are found guilty of spreading disinformation. The
Hungarian government has used the fog of the Covid-19 pandemic to
tighten the screws: starving independent media of advertising revenues
while swallowing small independent outlets, either directly or through
its large web of business cheerleaders. Earlier this year, Hungary's
government-controlled media regulator forced Klubrádió, a leading
independent radio station, off the air. With only flickers of free press
left in Hungary, Orbán's state capture of the media is now almost
complete. Poland follows Hungary's lead No wonder that Orbán's playbook
is so appealing to other illiberal governments looking to put the press
under its thumb. Following Hungary's lead, Polish public broadcasters
are being transformed into propaganda mouthpieces. Plans to 'repolonise'
the media are already underway. In December, Poland's state-controlled
energy giant PKN Orlen bought German-owned Polska Press, giving it
control over 20 regional dailies, 120 magazines and hundreds of online
portals across the country. Independent minded editors and reporters
have already started to be swapped for pro-government foot soldiers. In
a few months time, there will be pockets of Poland without access to
newspapers that do not toe the government line. Polska Press has a total
reach of over 17 million readers. PKN Orlen's shopping spree will be a
valuable tool for the ruling Law and Justice party ahead of the 2023
parliamentary elections. Lawsuits and targeted taxes aimed at private
media have become the norm. Government cronies with deep pockets have
launched over 50 lawsuits against independent media outlets. The idea is
to wear down the opposition into submission -- or bankruptcy. There are
echoes here of Poland's dark past. During communism, editors were
summoned to the party's Central Office for the Control of the Press in
Warsaw where their articles were often heavily massaged, redacted or
withdrawn. Editors of unruly publications would be replaced or have
their paper quota reduced. The irony is that the current government led
by erstwhile anti-communist crusaders is now reaching for similar
tactics. Independent television and radio stations are also facing the
heat. Poland's most watched news channel, TVN 24, owned by US-based TV
content provider Discovery, has been waiting for over 18 months for its
licence to be renewed by the National Broadcasting Council, an agency
packed with government apparatchiks. TVN's US-links have so far shielded
it from more aggressive state meddling. But without assertive action
from the EU and US, TVN 24 could still succumb to a similar fate as
German-owned Polska Press. Another television channel, ATM Rozrywka, did
not have its licence renewed on the grounds that it did not submit
proper documentation. Earlier this year, the anti-monopoly watchdog
stopped Agora, the publisher of Poland's top-selling liberal newspaper
Gazeta Wyborcza, from taking over radio broadcaster Eurozet due to
"competition concerns". **[[Time to deploy]{.mark} the right
[tools]{.mark}]{.underline}** To protect what remains of the free media
in Central and Eastern Europe, leading democratic lights within the NATO
alliance must deploy the right tools to stop Europe's worst offenders in
their tracks. German Chancellor Angela Merkel should use her last months
in office to flex political muscle. The EU can make sure that Budapest
and Warsaw do not weaponise national regulation to intimidate
independent outlets. Introducing EU legislation to weed out lawsuits
against journalists will also go a long way. In turn, the
[Biden]{.underline} Administration [can [needle]{.mark} the [populists
where it hurts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Poland is an important ally, but
**[[US security]{.mark} [assistance should not be
unconditional]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[NATO is not solely about]{.mark}
battle [tanks]{.mark} and gleaming fighter jets; [it is a community of
values that have to be defended]{.mark}]{.underline} not only
[against]{.underline} external foes but also [those trying to subvert
basic rights at home]{.underline}.

[As shown in our response to Ukraine, our [global network of

[play a vital role in strengthening]{.mark} those

F. LITERATURE REVIEW

1\. [[U.S. Security Assistance Supports]{.mark} Host Nation
[Democratization]{.mark}]{.underline}

There are four causal mechanisms supporting the hypothesis that U.S.
security assistance supports host nation democratization. The first
mechanism is that when prosperous democracies set a good example of
protecting human rights and individual liberties, it influences other
countries to do likewise. Marcin Krol wrote, "The future of democracy in
the world---and especially in East Central Europe and the former Soviet
Union---depends much more on the state of democracy in the West than it
does on developments in the new democracies themselves."22 His logic was
that if established democracies produce unappealing results and lack
credibility, then states in transition may opt for alternative systems
of government.23 Charles S. Robb argued that U.S. democracy is not
perfect, but the manner in which it overcame obstacles to increasingly
protect freedom makes it a suitable example to democratizing
states---who should mimic the function of U.S. democracy while
customizing a locally appropriate form of it.24 He recommended that
"building democratic competence abroad should \[be\] the central aim of
U.S. foreign policy, for in the long run, the best way to promote our
national interests is to promote basic democratic values."25 In his
view, implementation includes bolstering the host nation's "democratic
center" (whatever it may be); it is a bottom-up approach, because he
argued a top-down approach leads to bloated government bureaucracy.26
The second mechanism is that [**[aid conditionality incentivizes]{.mark}
state [elites to democratize]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [secure]{.mark} the
future [flow of aid]{.mark} money. [Countering]{.mark} the [idea
that]{.mark} the "inconsistent application of human rights"
[conditionality undermines]{.mark} the [moral force]{.mark} of the
United States]{.underline}, Paula J. Dobriansky argued that [coercion
and aid [conditionality]{.mark} are **[significantly more
influential]{.mark} than "moral force"** [in stimulating
liberalism]{.mark} and [democratization]{.mark} in repressive
governments.]{.underline}27 Her main argument was that "[the promotion
of democracy and human rights abroad is not only a moral imperative but
also [a sound strategic approach to bolster U.S.]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark}.]{.underline}"28 She detailed how, [beginning in the
1970s, U.S. Congress made foreign assistance and security assistance
conditional on host nation human rights considerations, but that the
enduring dilemma is "how to reconcile human rights considerations with
other foreign-policy factors."]{.underline}29 She reasoned that
[**[human rights]{.mark}-guided [policy]{.mark}** choices **[must
provide tangible results]{.mark} and be actionable [within]{.mark} the
[limits of U.S. resources]{.mark}** and capabilities]{.underline}. The
third mechanism is that externally sourced peacekeeping operations,
security force assistance, and security sector assistance efforts
bolster the security necessary for democratic transitions,
consolidation, and all other aspects democratic governance itself.
Kristine Hoglund argued that security sector reform---especially
civilian control of the military and police reform---delivers the
security that is fundamentally necessary for liberal democracy.31 Jeroen
de Zeeuw and Krishna Kumar argued that ["domestic political will and
commitment to political reform" are influential factors in
democratization]{.underline}, but that external democracy assistance can
also make a difference.32 They specified what is required for a
successful war-to-peace transition: "disarmament, demobilization, and
reintegration of former combatants, the installation of democratic
civilian control over the military, and other related security
reforms."33 Particularly relevant is de Zeeuw and L. van de Goor's focus
on security sector reform: ["[Unless security forces are
accountable]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [democratically elected]{.mark} civil
[authorities]{.mark} and oversight bodies under the rule of law, the
[sustainability of democratic transitions]{.mark} of postconflict
societies [will remain fragile]{.mark}."]{.underline}34 They recommended
**[[integrating]{.mark} security sector reform into a comprehensive
democracy assistance strategy]{.underline}**.35 In short, they proposed
[a **maximalist approach** to support host nation democratization with
the view that SA supports democratization]{.underline}.

#### Ensuring that alliances on emerging tech [forefront democratic norms]{.underline} is vital for global democracy

**Rasser 21**, Senior Fellow and Director of the Technology and National
Security Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS). Prior
to joining CNAS, Mr. Rasser served as a senior intelligence officer and
analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency (Martijin, "The case for an
alliance of Techno-Democracies,"
https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/the-case-for-an-alliance-of-techno-democracies/)

An effective tech alliance will need to balance the national interests
and shared interests of its members, a difficult but feasible
proposition when one considers common values and goals for economic
competitiveness. [A change in mindset in]{.underline} what 'sovereignty'
in this context means is also [necessary]{.underline}. Ultimately,
[[interdependencies with allies]{.mark} and like-minded countries
[should be viewed foremost as a]{.mark} [shared techno-democratic
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}, [while **those with [autocratic
countries]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as China are fraught with economic
and national security vulnerabilities that **[[pose]{.mark} a [direct
challenge to liberal-democratic]{.mark} norms and values]{.underline}**.

The other critique would be that a tech alliance would exacerbate a
'Tech Cold War', referring primarily to the strained US--China
relationship. In less dramatic terms, this concerns a bifurcation of the
tech ecosystem of China and that of the United States, as well as other
tech-leading democracies. A partial divergence has already happened
because leaders in both countries want it that way. American leaders are
rightfully concerned about the risks associated with products from
Chinese tech companies, and the Chinese Communist Party has been clear
in word and deed that it seeks to be self-sufficient in a range of
technology disciplines. China, like the US and its allies, also seeks
greater resiliency and security in its supply chains.

American leaders are rightfully concerned about the risks associated
with products from Chinese tech companies, and the Chinese Communist
Party has been clear in word and deed that it seeks to be
self-sufficient in a range of technology disciplines.

A tech alliance is unlikely to worsen these dynamics, nor is it destined
to result in fully decoupled ecosystems. [[By cooperating]{.mark} and
harmonising their efforts, the [tech-leading democracies have
**considerable**]{.mark} **[leverage]{.mark} and
influence**]{.underline}, making a more favourable dynamic plausible.
[The incentives and [opportunity for China to establish]{.mark} an
[independent]{.mark} tech [sphere]{.mark} of different standards, norms,
and rules that other countries can join [dwindle]{.mark} quickly
[if]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**
accounting for most of the world's GDP, science and tech infrastructure,
and R&D spending **[[offer]{.mark} a [robust
alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Should Beijing persist, it would
isolate itself and any country that chose to follow from the bulk of the
global economy.

[A tech [alliance]{.mark} [is]{.mark} the [best way]{.mark} to ensure
technological leadership by the **world's
techno-democracies**]{.underline}. [This leadership will be [**essential
to safeguarding democratic institutions**, norms]{.mark}, and values,
and be a driver for sustainable and equitable economic growth around the
world]{.underline}. [[Anything short]{.mark} of this goal
[carries]{.mark} major [risk of a world marred by **ascendant
techno-authoritaria**]{.mark}**nism**]{.underline}, [[a **direct
challenge** to]{.mark} the economic **vitality**, **national security**,
and values of [democratic nations **across the
globe**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Ensuring that future never happens should
be the clarion call to the leaders of the
techno-democracies]{.underline}.

#### US key

**HRW 20** (Human Rights Watch, "US: President Should Set a Human Rights
Foreign Policy,"
https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/11/10/us-president-should-set-human-rights-foreign-policy#R9)//BB

The United States should strive to be a world leader on human rights.
Human Rights Watch offers 12 priorities for the next US administration
to create a rights-focused foreign policy.

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} the **[power]{.mark},
[influence]{.mark}, and [resources]{.mark}** to create positive change
for human rights beyond its borders]{.underline}. The global defense of
human rights is stronger when the United States joins with others to
promote and protect them. Although US policymakers often espouse human
rights and humanitarian values, the United States has been inconsistent
in defending human rights abroad and has been complicit in or has
committed serious abuses in its foreign policies and engagement. The US
government has often invoked human rights selectively or to achieve a
short-term diplomatic goal. Instead, [the president should [commit in
**word and deed** to a foreign policy]{.mark} that [consistently
prioritizes]{.mark} promoting and [protecting]{.mark} [human
rights]{.mark}, not solely as a means to an end]{.underline}.

### 2nc -- turns case

#### Creeping authoritarianism [zeroes]{.underline} solvency\-\--it shreds cohesion and causes European instability

Ellehuus and **Morcos 21**, \* deputy director and senior fellow with
the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, D.C. and previously served as
principal director for European and NATO policy in the Pentagon,
\*\*visiting fellow with the Center for Strategic and International
Studies' Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program and was formerly deputy
head of the Strategic Affairs and Cybersecurity Division in the French
foreign service (Rachel and Pierre, "NATO SHOULD FINALLY TAKE ITS VALUES
SERIOUSLY," War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2021/06/nato-should-take-its-values-seriously/)

From Russia and China to terrorism and climate change, [[NATO faces no
shortage of]{.mark} external [threats]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Yet an
equally [serious challenge now comes from **democratic**
**decline**]{.mark}]{.underline} [within the alliance
itself]{.underline}. [[Left]{.mark} [unaddressed]{.mark}, the
[erosion]{.mark} of democratic values [will]{.mark}]{.underline} further
[[accentuate]{.mark} [divisions]{.mark} between allies and create
vulnerabilities that can be exploited by NATO's rivals]{.underline}. The
upcoming NATO summit is a unique opportunity for allies to tackle this
underlying challenge. The trans-Atlantic alliance will only remain
strong if members genuinely abide by its founding principles. The
adoption of a "political pledge" in which allies recommit to upholding
trans-Atlantic values would be a start. But [[NATO]{.mark} countries
will [need to move beyond words]{.mark}]{.underline} if they want to
have a meaningful impact. [This means]{.underline} regularly
[[reviewing]{.mark} [allies' compliance with NATO values]{.mark} and
principles and [using incentives]{.mark}]{.underline} and disincentives
[to [raise]{.mark} the [political cost for countries breaking]{.mark}
the [rules]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} a
[challenging]{.underline} path with potential risks for NATO unity.
**[But]{.underline}** turning a blind eye
\[**[[ignoring]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] to the ongoing [[erosion]{.mark}
of NATO's founding principles [will be]{.mark} even more
[damaging]{.mark} [to]{.mark} its political cohesion and
[credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Democratic values are not only
important to the alliance in the abstract. They also help create the
societal resilience that gives it strength]{.underline}. As such, [NATO
should]{.underline} link democratic progress with its existing
resilience metrics and draw on joint NATO-European Union resilience
response teams to [assist struggling allies]{.underline}. [This would
enable]{.underline} NATO to take a graduated, collective, and
dispassionate approach to [addressing democratic decline and **[shoring
up]{.mark} [trans-Atlantic values]{.mark}** [while]{.mark} also
**[preserving]{.mark} its [political cohesion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The Threat from Within Over the past decade, several NATO allies have
taken a turn away from democracy. [Hungary and Poland are sliding into
illiberalism]{.underline}, while the rule of law has long since
unraveled in Turkey. In Greece and Slovenia, press freedom is rapidly
deteriorating. [NATO's newest members made substantial
progress]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War, [but [democracy
remains fragile]{.mark}]{.underline} in Montenegro, Albania, and North
Macedonia. [As a result]{.underline}, internal corruption or [[malign
influence could **readily unleash new
instability**]{.underline}]{.mark}. From the beginning, NATO has faced
tensions over how much emphasis to put on democratic values. On one
hand, NATO has always been more than just a military alliance. Its
strength and resilience have long derived from the shared commitment of
allies to the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty. The preamble to
this document stresses democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of
law while its second article explicitly commits to "peaceful and
friendly international relations." But the alliance has not always lived
up to these ideals. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, NATO debated how
to deal with authoritarianism in Portugal and Greece as well as multiple
coups in Turkey. Ultimately, members decided not to address the problem,
instead prioritizing cohesion and geopolitical interests during a tense
Cold War period. As explained by then-National Security Adviser Walt
Rostow, "\[T\]he time has come to separate our NATO relationship from
our disapproval of domestic Greek politics." This was the wrong choice
then and an even worse one today. [The risks [of ignoring NATO's
internal strains far outweigh the benefits of addressing]{.mark}
them]{.underline}. Some of the reasons are longstanding: A country's
treatment of its own citizens reflects, positively or negatively, on
NATO's brand, and [an [unstable]{.mark} [domestic environment
**inhibits**]{.mark} that [country's ability to meet]{.mark} its
**[international obligations]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Today,
though, [[ignoring democratic decline carries new risks. NATO's
adversaries]{.mark} have become increasingly skilled at
**[tak]{.mark}**ing [advantage of]{.mark}]{.underline} and, in some
cases, actively exacerbating countries' societal
[[vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. A compromised media environment
allows disinformation campaigns to flourish, while corruption opens
space for Russian networks to operate and gain influence. Moscow is also
preying on the grievances of racial and ethnic minorities in NATO member
countries in order to weaken national-level governance and cohesion.

#### Rising authoritarianism turns the case. Expands Russian influence, causes European instability and shreds interoperability

senior fellow with The German Marshall Fund of the United States,

Transatlantic Relationship at Harvard Kennedy School\'s Belfer Center.

<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/07/10/an-inconvenient-truth-addressing-democratic-backsliding-within-nato/)//BB>

[There is]{.underline} also significant [[democratic backsliding among
NATO member states]{.underline}]{.mark}. The cast of illiberal
characters---who are leading the charge in the wrong
direction---includes the recently reelected and empowered Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party
(AKP), Jaroslaw Kaczynski's Law and Justice (PiS) Party in Poland, and
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the ruling Fidesz Party. Each
has proven more than willing to repress free media, dismantle checks and
balances, demonize political opposition, clamp down on civil society,
and diminish the rule of law. America's democratic system and norms
under President Trump are also under duress; as a result, Freedom House
downgraded the country's score on the basis of weakening political
rights and civil liberties. [Despite these alarming developments, [NATO
leaders have relegated democratic backsliding to the
backburner]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Opponents of making the case for
democracy within NATO might argue that pushing Ankara, Warsaw, and
Budapest too hard on their commitments to good governance
will]{.underline} [exacerbate]{.underline} already tense
[divisions]{.underline} in the alliance. Others might say that Russia
would be the prime beneficiary of a contentious democracy discussion at
NATO. Yet this is a counterproductive approach with current and
potential costs to NATO's future. Here are three security-based reasons
why **[the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} [NATO should
care]{.mark} about democratic backsliding]{.underline}**,
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** actions the alliance can take to
**[[address t]{.mark}hem]{.underline}**. 1 [[Russia]{.mark}
is]{.underline} already [[benefiting from]{.mark} and effectively
[leveraging]{.mark} its [relationships with Hungary]{.mark} and
[Turkey]{.mark} to [exacerbate]{.mark} [discord]{.mark} within Europe
and NATO]{.underline}. Viktor Orbán and Vladimir Putin see one another
as allies in their disdain for the European Union and Orbán has courted
Russian financial and political support as he builds an illiberal
democracy in Hungary. Russian propaganda also finds fertile ground in
Hungarian media. A 2018 Senate Foreign Relations Committee report noted
that Russian state-owned media content "by Sputnik and RT is widely
referenced by pro-government news sources in Hungary." The report cited
Orbán as the EU and NATO's most supportive leader of Putin's worldview
and leadership. Acting as the Russian "camel's nose under the tent,"
Orbán is thwarting Ukraine and NATO's partnership efforts by blocking
the Ukraine-NATO Commission from meeting at the upcoming summit. In
Turkey, Erdoğan has rattled the NATO alliance by pursuing a deal to
purchase the S-400 missile system from Russia. In addition to hurting
NATO's ability to cooperate on security, the system is also not
compatible with NATO's defenses. Through arms and energy deals, Putin
uses Turkey as a wedge to divide NATO. Similarly, Erdoğan might see his
deals with Putin as a way to free Turkey from Western leverage,
particularly as European states push back on his brand of authoritarian
politics by cutting EU pre-accession funds. After winning the recent
twin parliamentary and presidential elections, an emboldened Erdoğan
will likely become an even more problematic partner for NATO. President
Putin is building ties with illiberal leaders across Europe while
attacking fundamental elements of Western democracies. Other illiberal
and populist governments, including Italy's new anti-establishment
government, could follow suit in enhancing their partnerships with
Russia, creating future intelligence-sharing and cohesion problems for
the alliance. President [Putin is [building ties with illiberal
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} across Europe [while attacking fundamental
elements of Western democracies, including electoral process and open
information spaces]{.underline}. 2 [[There is a **strong link** between
democratic governance and security gains]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Liberal]{.mark} [democracies]{.mark} have [historically]{.mark} been
[less likely to experience intra]{.mark}- and [interstate
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, generate refugees, [and harbor violent
extremists]{.underline}. [They are also better at [maintaining]{.mark}
transparent institutions, civilian control of the [military]{.mark} and
[intel]{.mark}ligence [services]{.mark}, and [working together]{.mark}
on confidence-building measures]{.underline}, **[all of which are [core
features of NATO's ability to collectively defend its
members]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On the other hand, [[corruption]{.mark}
and [insecurity]{.mark} grow under politicized institutions and poor
rule of law]{.underline}. **[This [hurts]{.mark}
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**'s renewed efforts to combat terrorism, as
military and security communities have long acknowledged the connection
between corruption and the existence of criminal networks, traffickers,
and terrorists within state borders. [[Corruption]{.mark} also [opens
space for Russian]{.mark} kleptocratic [networks]{.mark} close to Putin
[to]{.mark} operate and [gain influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, in 2014 Orbán awarded Rosatom, a Russian state-owned nuclear
company, the sole contract to build two nuclear plants in Hungary in
exchange for a 10 billion euro loan from Moscow. The Hungarian
parliament, dominated by Orbán's Fidesz Party, then passed a rushed vote
to keep data from the nuclear deal confidential for 30 years in the name
of "national security." The deal diminished transparent economic
competition within the European Union and solidified Hungary and
Russia's energy ties. 3 [[Distrust]{.mark} among allies [hurts]{.mark}
alliance [interoperability]{.mark}]{.underline}. The PiS Party's assault
on independent media and the Constitutional Court, including efforts
last week to summarily force out 27 Polish Supreme Court justices, have
isolated Poland from France and Germany, diminishing trust among the
European nations. This could make it increasingly difficult for
Washington to gain consensus on joint decisions, communications, and
operations. [[If NATO is dedicated to building
resiliency]{.mark}]{.underline} along Russia's periphery by placing
multi-national battalions in Poland, [[then it should not ignore]{.mark}
the **[accountable]{.mark}** [**institutions** that would strengthen
this joint effort]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[of]{.mark} [autocratic, illiberal]{.mark}, and [liberal]{.mark}
[democratic states]{.mark} that, [devoid of shared values]{.mark}, [do
not agree on security threats]{.mark} or areas for

destruction]{.mark}, [chaos]{.mark}, [human rights violations]{.mark},
[social strife]{.mark}, and other grievances. They rarely contribute to

#### Erosion of democracy collapses NATO

Within: How Democratic Decline Could Destroy the Alliance," Council on
Foreign Relations, 97.4)//BB

[[NATO]{.mark} today [faces]{.mark} [multiple
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. Terrorists have attacked European
capitals, migration is putting pressure on border and homeland security
systems, Russia is both able and will- ing to use military force and
other instruments of influence in Eu- rope, and U.S. President Donald
Trump has threatened to scrap the alliance altogether. [But the
**[most]{.mark} [serious]{.mark} problem** [is]{.mark} not one of these
obvious threats; rather, it is the **[breakdown of liberal
democracy]{.mark}** within the alliance itself]{.underline}. The North
Atlantic Treaty Organization has never been a typi- cal alliance. From
its inception in 1949, NATO has not only deterred and defended against
external threats; it has also advanced the principles of liberal
democratic governance. Although its cohesion initially rested on the
common threat of the Soviet Union, NATO was more unified than most
multilateral organizations thanks to the common character of its
members. Nearly all were democratically elected governments that were
accountable to their citizens, bound by the rule of law, and dedicated
to upholding political and civil rights. Article 2 of NATO\'s founding
treaty committed members to \"strength- ening their free institutions.\"
Countries facing a common threat have often banded together for defense
and survival, but most alliances don\'t last long once that threat is
eliminated. That is why so [[many]{.mark} [observers]{.mark}
[feared]{.mark} that [NATO would disappear]{.mark}]{.underline} with the
end of the Soviet Union. [[But thanks to]{.mark} the **internal**
**cohesion** created by its [democratic values]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
the incentives its stan- dards created for aspiring new members, [[the
alliance]{.mark} defied predictions. Instead of disintegrating, NATO
[adapted]{.mark}]{.underline} to new challenges and became a cornerstone
of transatlantic security after the Cold War. Today, the Kremlin once
again poses a serious threat in Europe and beyond.
**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** unlike the last time the alliance faced
down Russia, now **[[NATO is in peril]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[[Multiple members are dismantling]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
institutions and practices of **[[liberal
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}** that emerged triumphant in the Cold
War, [and [things may get worse if autocratic demagogues]{.mark} exploit
populist fears to [gain]{.mark} political [clout]{.mark}]{.underline} in
other member states. [Just when the alliance is needed]{.underline} as
much as ever to meet challenges from with- out, [the
**[foundations]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its [power are at risk]{.mark}** of
crumbling because of challenges from within]{.underline}. THE PRICE OF
ADMISSION [After the fall of the Soviet Union, the liberal democratic
credentials of NATO\'s members became even more important to the
alliance]{.underline}. Al- though many experts and policymakers hoped
that Europe would emerge from the Cold War whole, free, and at peace,
others warned that without a shared enemy, [the [region]{.mark} [might
return to past cycles of instability]{.mark} and conflict fueled
by]{.underline} revanchist, chauvinistic, and [il- liberal European
regimes]{.underline}. Far from being irrelevant, these observers argued,
NATO would play a key role in bolstering liberal democracies and
creating trust among countries that had spent centuries fighting one
another. As if on cue, border disputes and simmering ethnic conflicts in
eastern Europe began to threaten the peace almost immediately after the
fall of the Soviet Union. And with the disintegration of Yugoslavia in
the early 1990s, they ultimately broke it. In the face of these
challenges, NATO sought to leverage the desire for member- ship to
encourage political reforms by requiring that new members meet its
standards for good governance. This decision was based on the belief
that liberal institutions, practices, and values would pre- vent a
return to the nationalist, nativist, extremist, and intolerant dynamics
that had driven destructive conflicts in Europe for centu- ries. To
foster security within Europe, NATO required that new members leave
autocratic practices behind. Fulfilling these requirements was often
politically contentious, and aspiring members did not always succeed.
Countries that had spent decades under authoritarian communist rule had
to root out the linger- ing influence of intelligence agencies, overturn
politicized control of the military in favor of apolitical professional
defense forces, establish legislative oversight for military
procurement, and implement person- nel policies that would combat
corruption. All of that has taken time: Montenegro set the goal of
achieving membership in 2007 but had to wait ten more years to earn
admission. And mere aspiration is not enough: Bosnia, for example, has
yet to fulfill the criteria that the alliance set in 2010 for the
country to be granted the Mem- bership Action Plan, a procedural pre-
cursor to joining. These requirements may have slowed the process of
NATO\'s expansion, but liberal institu- tions and practices are central
to creating security and trust among Europe\'s diverse societies.
Anything less would have weakened the alliance instead of strengthening
it. [Beyond its stabilizing effect on the broader continent, there is
an- other reason NATO\'s **liberal democratic character**]{.underline}
came to [matter]{.underline}: in the absence of a shared external
threat, [the **[binding]{.mark} [force of liberal democratic
values]{.mark} and institutions** has become [**essential** to the alli-
ance\'s]{.mark} [effectiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[NATO\'s]{.mark}

In recent years, much strategic discussion has focused on competition
among states of "great power." It is becoming clear, however, that this
competition extends beyond traditional measures of power; it centers
increasingly on forms of governance. Adversaries big and small are
selling **[autocracy]{.underline}** as "efficient." They tout their own
systems and use a broad array of tools to amplify fissures and undermine
confidence within democracies. When they can't do that successfully,
they use diplomatic and other means of coercion. They support illiberal
democracies. Others are beginning to follow their model. This puts
democratic resilience at the heart of the new international system and
international competition. It is a fundamental issue for the next few
decades. **[NATO must focus on it]{.underline}**. The Security Case for
Democratic Resilience [[Integrating democratic resilience]{.mark} more

[is **foundational**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [democratic

founded [are]{.underline} [under assault]{.underline} from external and
internal challengers. [[Countries with weak protections for
democracy]{.mark}, individual liberty and the rule of law are
[vulnerable to subversion]{.mark}, [corruption]{.mark}, and mis- and
dis-information]{.underline}. [Waning attention to NATO's core values
has resulted in some Allies prioritizing unilateral national decisions
over collective Alliance interests, or using their position to block
Alliance activities as a way to gain leverage in bilateral
disputes]{.underline}. Some Allies are themselves manipulating
information and distorting data, engaging in direct cyberattacks on
their opponents, undermining democratic processes and the rule of law,
even threatening each other. [These [points of disunity could be used by
strategic competitors to **destabilize**]{.mark} individual allies or
**[NATO]{.mark}** as a whole]{.underline}. [[Malign influences]{.mark}

FGY

The United States' national security and defense strategies, as well as
trends in U.S. military operations around the globe, reflect a
preference for working by, with, and through partners to achieve common
security objectives. Partnership may enhance the capacity of a partner
government to maintain effective control over territory. It can also
signal unity in deterring or degrading a common adversary or threat, for
example in the U.S.-led coalition and partnered approaches to confront
the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). As outlined in our policy
brief, Civilians and "By, With, and Through," security partnerships can
take a wide range of forms, from support operations and advise, assist,
and accompany missions, to direct participation in hostilities through
"joint" or "partnered" operations and coalitions.2 [Here, we report the
practical experiences of policymakers and practitioners in security and
humanitarian fields in **positively shaping the conduct of armed forces
partnering with U.S. forces.** Their combined experience--- supported by
the available [research]{.mark}---[suggests]{.mark} that [it is
possible]{.mark}, with the right conditions for success, [to
affect]{.mark} the [conduct of]{.mark}]{.underline} both
[[state]{.mark}]{.underline} and non-state [armed actors [to minimize
harm to civilians]{.mark}. Practitioner lessons also suggest that in
some cases, the **risk of harm to civilians may be too great** and the
options to control risk too few to continue the partnership in an
accountable manner which both effectively spares civilian lives from the
effects of conflict and respects human rights]{.underline}. This report
outlines considerations and recommendations for policymakers, military
actors, and humanitarian professionals, all of whom play a role in
encouraging improved policies and practices of armed forces with whom
the United States partners. [**Partnerships** in [armed conflict **can
aggravate**]{.mark} or reduce the **[risk of harm]{.mark} to
civilians**, depending on the form and significance of the partnership
and the technical and political attributes and tendencies of each
partner. Effectively reducing the risk of harm to civilians and
optimizing positive results **depends on candidly assessing the most
likely sources of harm** and using available options to address them
throughout a partnership (i.e., before, during, and after active
fighting). [Partnered]{.mark} [military operations]{.mark} in armed
conflicts **[expose]{.mark} [civilians]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} a **wide
array of risks**, including **injury, [death]{.mark}, trauma,
[displacement]{.mark}**, and the **[destruction of]{.mark} homes,
schools, [infrastructure]{.mark}, and livelihoods**. Harm may occur
because of negligence or deliberate misconduct by state and non-state
actors; harm may also occur [in spite of]{.mark} cautious and purposeful
[attempts to avoid it]{.mark}. [Hostilities in urban]{.mark}
[areas]{.mark} can **particularly [disrupt]{.mark} civilian life:
[water]{.mark}, [health]{.mark}, [electricity]{.mark}, and
[sanitation]{.mark} [systems are]{.mark} often interconnected and
[interdependent]{.mark}**, and the destruction of part of the system
impacts the whole.3 When [explosive]{.mark} [remnants]{.mark} of war
[contaminate]{.mark} the [area]{.mark} and infrastructure damage is
significant, the **[consequences]{.mark} of conflict [last]{.mark} well
[beyond]{.mark} the [end of]{.mark} active
[fighting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These challenges are evident in Mosul,
Iraq and Raqqa, Syria, both of which will [take decades to rebuild after
intense urban conflict. **[Breakdowns]{.mark} [in]{.mark} services and
[social cohesion]{.mark}** significantly **[impact]{.mark}
[stability]{.mark}, governance**, and the **[security]{.mark}** of
populations, **[creating]{.mark} [challenges]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
restoring the [rule of law]{.mark}.** When the United States partners
with state and non-state forces, the **[U]{.mark}nited** [S]{.mark}tates
**[must consider]{.mark} what [costs]{.mark} these [partnerships will
inflict on]{.mark} civilians, [security]{.mark}, [governance]{.mark},
rule of law enforcement, and transitional justice.** Whether a
partnership is initiated in the context of an ongoing conflict or in
preparation for one, the United States can and should institute adequate
protections to minimize the risk of civilian harm. In order to
effectively reduce harm to civilians from military operations conducted
by U.S. partners, whether jointly or alone, the U.S. government must
have internal clarity about desired outcomes, political and strategic
commitment to those outcomes, adequate resources and technical
competence, and coherence and coordination among government
agencies]{.underline}. Adding more than one partner to an operation
increases the complexity of these variables. Fighting collectively only
serves to underscore the importance of defining desired outcomes, as the
actions of one partner affect the efficacy, reputation, and legitimacy
of the other. Many of these factors for success are seldom implemented.
The following policy approaches and practical suggestions may help
minimize harm to civilians in the context of security partnerships.

### 2nc -- terror ! 

#### Lack of robust assessment of civilian casualties enables terrorist propaganda, radicalization, and decimates US legitimacy -- threatens national security

Information gap: preventing an evidence-based approach During the US
advisory effort to the coalition in 2015--2016, a key question was: is
this assistance having a positive effect? And even more broadly, could
the US determine how its support, in terms of bombs, aircraft,
intelligence, and refueling, was being used? To what degree was US
assistance contributing to the disaster on the ground in Yemen? How
accurate were the findings of the JIAT? [As the [US]{.mark} wrestled
with policy decisions, [having]{.mark}]{.underline} this
[[info]{.mark}rmation [would]{.mark} have [enable]{.mark}d [more]{.mark}
of **an [ev]{.mark}idence-[based approach to US
strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Yemen. However, [**there is [no
established assessment process ]{.mark}**[to]{.mark} help
[answer]{.mark} these [questions regarding security assistance]{.mark}
to partners.]{.underline} Operational end use monitoring It is
worthwhile to note that the US has some processes in place to address
accountability when defense equipment, including weapons, are sold or
transferred to foreign militaries. This process, mandated by the Arms
Export Control Act, is called end-use monitoring (EUM).51 As part of the
foreign military sales process, the receiving nation must agree to
certain conditions to enable EUM. These conditions include: • The
equipment must only be used for the purpose intended; • No equipment can
be transferred to a third party without the prior approval of the US; •
The receiving nation must protect the equipment to US standards; and •
The receiving nation must allow monitoring processes to verify the
conditions above.52 Several programs conducted under the EUM process
include Golden Sentry and Blue Lantern. These US end-use programs focus
on verifying equipment presence and security.53 This matches their
intended purpose: they were developed to protect against unauthorized
exports and technical espionage involving sensitive military equipment.
These programs do not address how US equipment are used operationally.
For example, in the Vignette on page 2 where the Saudi-led coalition
struck a school bus full of children, the US government had no idea that
a US-provided bomb was used until third parties performed open source
analysis and disclosed that fact. [While the US has no process for
capturing how its equipment and weapons are used operationally -- what
we refer to as **operational end use monitoring** -- this information is
relevant for the US. For example, understanding how partners use
US-provided weapons should inform policy and assistance decisions. This
[info]{.mark}rmation [is]{.mark} also **[relevant for foreign
policy]{.mark} and [national security]{.mark}**, since the **theme of
[US-provided weapons killing civilians is]{.mark} a [frequent]{.mark}
and powerful [subject of]{.mark} [messaging]{.mark} and [terrorist
propagand]{.mark}**[a]{.mark}, **[influencing]{.mark} [US relations
]{.mark}**[with other countries]{.mark} and **[contributing to
radicalization]{.mark}** and support to terrorist groups that can then
**[threaten]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} [homeland]{.mark} [and]{.mark} its
[interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.**54 Three sources of information If
a government wanted to conduct operational end-use-monitoring, how can
this information be obtained? Governments providing security assistance
can leverage three different types of information for operational end
use monitoring. They are: • Partner forces. Getting information from
partner forces is invaluable for helping to understand the operational
effects of assistance. For example, the Saudi-led coalition created a
spreadsheet with mission reports documenting basic details on every
strike conducted in the campaign, including the type of aircraft and
weapon used. It is also helpful to know the rationale and intent for
particular strikes. For example, if there are allegations that
non-combatants were targeted, what was the intended target? What types
of intelligence were used in that strike? And what is the partner force
assessment for what happened? While such access is not guaranteed, this
information was at times made available to the US when it specifically
requested it. And [greater access could be made a requirement for future
assistance in order to strengthen monitoring efforts]{.underline}. •
Government information. In Yemen, the US sometimes also had intelligence
or other information that could be useful in helping to determine what
was happening on the ground. This was not frequent, since the conduct of
partnered militaries like the Saudiled coalition was not an intelligence
requirement for the Intelligence Community. It is possible that making
this a priority would enhance the value of intelligence in this
operational end use monitoring process. • Open source information.
Another rich information source for determining the outcome of
operations is using open sources. This can range from civil society
groups that do on-the-ground investigations to open source investigators
leveraging social media. While militaries and governments are often
dismissive of these types of sources, considering military data to be
more reliable and accurate, the reality is that a complete picture of
operational outcomes requires a merging of military and open source
data. This is not limited to the Saudi-led coalition: a recent study by
the US military determined that external allegations, based on open
source data, were the source for the majority of the civilian casualties
confirmed by the US-led coalition in Iraq and Syria. Militaries lack the
full picture, and open source information can help complete that
picture.

(accessed 5-24-2022)

Wielding influence and securing tactical cooperation is the second. This
may translate into trading assistance for access to bases, airspace, or
other transit routes. [The United States sometimes uses assistance to
incentivize]{.underline} short-term tactical [cooperation]{.underline}
against shared threats. In other cases, assistance is intended to
reassure allies and partners of America's commitment to its security,
either in general or against common enemies. Here it is worth noting
that plans to slash the State Department's budget and cut foreign
assistance compound concerns about U.S. abandonment and further reduce
American influence. [Finally, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has
[tried]{.mark}, often without [success, to use assistance as a]{.mark}
[lever to shape a recipient's behavior]{.mark} either domestically or
internationally]{.underline}. Some U.S. objectives overlap with one
another. Others conflict. And [lest we forget, [our partners also get a
vote]{.mark}. American [objectives]{.mark} for security assistance
[often do not align with theirs]{.mark}, due in large part to
differences in how the United States and a recipient prioritize and
perceive threats. The number of different objectives at play complicates
efforts to condition assistance; [enforcing conditions]{.mark} to
achieve one set of objectives could [hamper efforts to achieve another
set]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For example, after the Bahraini government's
security forces launched a major crackdown on protesters]{.underline}
during the Arab uprisings, the [United States temporarily restricted
arms sales to the country. Some members of the Obama administration also
argued for placing conditions on security assistance. Others worried
that this would undermine Bahrain's support for U.S. basing and
access]{.underline}, which is important for Afghanistan, Iran
deterrence, and counterterrorism operations. As a result of competing
priorities, the United States often chooses not to condition assistance,
as was the case with Bahrain, or attempts to do so in an ad hoc manner.
Worst of all, the United States sometimes imposes conditions, but then
blinks first and backs down when they are not met.

#### Countries will not allow intrusive monitoring

University of Central Florida, **2018** "POLICY ROUNDTABLE: THE PROS AND

[[Positive conditionality]{.mark} [requires]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [to verify]{.mark} the [efforts]{.mark} undertaken by
the partner government, which in turn [necessitates]{.mark} more
[intrusive]{.mark} [monitoring]{.mark}. [Many countries will balk at
this as a]{.mark} [violation of
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} but the United States should
insist upon it as a condition of military assistance. A larger presence
will not only enable better monitoring of the host government's
coup-proofing actions, but may also mitigate the internal security
dilemma that drives such behavior. The worst paranoid excesses of the
Maliki regime did not occur until after 2011, when the United States was
no longer present on the ground as a safety net protecting his regime.

#### Positive conditionality fails because recipients pretend success

Promotion by the EU: Case Studies of Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast and Niger,"
Perceptions, Volume 10, No. 1, (accessed 5-24-2022)

[[Negative conditionality is]{.mark} generally criticized to be
[ineffective]{.mark}]{.underline} because sanctions imposed as a result
of conditionality might hit the poor instead of the targeted
government25 and the recipient country's government might easily find
access to alternative funding resources. [In contrast, the application
of positive conditionality is much less contested in the critical
discussion]{.underline}. The EU's enlargement strategy is generally used
as a clear example of the effectiveness of positive conditionality to
boost the democratic space in the Eastern European countries. In fact,
the desirability of EU membership appears to have prompted candidate
countries to adhere to a host of conditions contained in the so-called
Acquis Communautaire. [Yet, there are still problems with]{.underline}
the way EU uses [positive [conditionality]{.mark}: it [does not]{.mark}
always [deliver]{.mark} the [incentives]{.mark} promised]{.underline}
(extra aid, for example), [or at least it does not deliver them quickly.
[Governments]{.mark} may even [pretend progress without actually
achieving]{.mark} a policy [change]{.mark}]{.underline}.26

[[Enforcement of human rights initiatives]{.mark} will often **[damage

[aid]{.mark} [restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline} or sanctions on the
guilty units or nations. [The issue is [compounded when]{.mark} the [US
does not hold states **equally accountable**]{.mark} to the US code on
foreign aid and policy standards]{.underline}. Until recently, many US
embassies did not share vetting results with partner nations, despite
legal requirements to share the data with the host nation to avoid
damaging relationships.2 As of 2017, the DOS publishes an annual list of
suspended units on its website.3 [This year, an advisor to the Supreme
Court of Bangladesh disclosed that the country is debating whether it
should follow procedures established by the Leahy Laws]{.underline} that
would remediate Bangladeshi units sanctioned from receiving aid, noting
that Bangladesh would then go to the PRC for support. [The advisor
identified **[inconsistencies]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} how the US
administered its [human rights policies]{.mark} to close allies such as
**Israel, Saudi Arabia, and others**]{.underline}.4 The [US must stand
up for human rights abroad but must **evenly enforce** a policy that
does not damage relations, ultimately [prevent]{.mark}ing the [US from
influencing partners]{.mark} to adhere to human rights
concepts]{.underline}.

3.4 At What Cost? The Salience of Donor-Recipient Relations

Bueno de Mesquita and Smith (2009) assert that [[leaders use foreign aid
to buy policy concessions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Further, they argue that
the [salience of these policy concessions is one key determinant of
whether a donor provides aid to a potential recipient and, if aid is
provided, how much aid is allocated]{.underline}. I argue that [donors
[consider]{.mark} the [salience]{.mark} of these concessions [when
deciding whether to punish human rights]{.mark} violators. If a donor
decides to punish a potential recipient by withholding or reducing aid,
the [opportunity cost]{.mark} of such action [is losing]{.mark} the
policy [concession]{.mark}]{.underline}. I expect, therefore, that as
the value of the concessions increases, the probability that a donor
decides to punish a violator decreases. 27 I conceptualize the salience
of policy concessions using two dimensions: security and economic ties.
3.4.1 Security Ties Many scholars place national security at the top of
any list of foreign policy goals (c.f. Morgenthau 1951; Waltz 1979;
Kennan 1985). [It would be **[too]{.mark} [idealistic to assume]{.mark}
that [human rights concerns can trump national security]{.mark}
concerns** in making foreign policy. In fact, [punishing]{.mark} [human
rights violators may be **counterproductive**]{.mark} to security goals.
For example, **[violators]{.mark} may [respond]{.mark} to being punished
[by retaliating]{.mark}** in such a way that hurts the donor's national
security interests]{.underline}. [For example, a recipient may
[restrict]{.mark} donor [access to military bases or air]{.mark}
[space]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a 1979 lecture on foreign policy and
human rights, Morgenthau states: We have a great interest in continuing
the normalization of our relations with mainland China, and for this
reason we are not going to hurt her feelings. On the other hand South
Korea is an ally of the United States, it is attributed a considerable
military importance, and so we are not going to do anything to harm
those relations. (Morgenthau 1979: 7). Another example of the strategic
importance of foreign aid lies in Cold War foreign policy. In
particular, western donors were concerned that cutting foreign aid could
precipitate a fall to communism. [For example, the United States used
its foreign aid program during the Cold War to prop rightist regimes in
the western hemisphere to contain communism]{.underline} (c.f. Carleton
& Stohl 1986; Apodaca & Stohl 1999; Regan 1995). [In addition, foreign
aid often directly or indirectly supported repressive regimes over
leftist opposition]{.underline} (Regan 1995). [In these cases, [cutting
aid would have clear negative implications]{.mark} for the donor's
strategic interests]{.underline}. Morgenthau's concern -- and he is not
alone (c.f. Gillies 1996) -- is that **[criticizing or punishing a human
rights violator would]{.underline} [[very likely harm
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}** [with that country and, in turn, the
soured relationships could **[hurt]{.mark} the [strategic]{.mark} or
material [interests of]{.mark} the [donor]{.mark}**. When donors use
foreign aid to punish human rights violators, that foreign [aid cannot
be used to buy]{.mark} important policy [concessions]{.mark}. This
represents the opportunity cost for using foreign aid as a punishment
tool. If a donor has an interest in buying a policy concession from a
recipient, then it is unlikely to manipulate its aid policy to punish
human rights violations when, instead, it needs to provide aid to buy
the policy concession. One way to conceptualize the strategic importance
of potential donors is security alignment. **Donors are [more inclined
to buy]{.mark} policy concessions [from states with which they
are]{.mark} closely [aligned]{.mark}** than enemies]{.underline}. Bueno
de Mesquita and Smith (2009) find that ["recipients who are moderately
aligned with the donor receive the most aid"]{.underline} (331). [If
security alignment signifies the presence of important policy
concessions, then it follows that close allies are unlikely to be
punished for human rights violations because these countries can offer
the donor valuable policy concessions]{.underline}. For example, until
the mid1970s, the United States consistently turned a blind eye to
rights violations by South American dictators with whom the U.S. was
allied. Hypothesis 1: Donors are less likely to punish recipients as the
strategic alignment between them increase, all else equal.

provoke retaliatory action]{.mark} [on]{.mark} other [NATO]{.mark}
business]{.underline}. In reaction to Norway's stark criticisms against
the Portuguese and Greek regimes at a June 1971 foreign ministers
meeting, then-NATO Secretary General Manlio Brosio warned that "[if we
undermine our solidarity, we run the risk of undermining the substance
of our alliance]{.underline}." Overcoming this dilemma between
prioritizing values and preserving unity requires a graduated,
collective, and dispassionate approach. First, NATO will need to be
proportionate when dealing with an ally violating trans-Atlantic values.
[Allies should start with discussions behind closed doors]{.underline}
rather than publicize the dispute. Open and frank dialogue among allies
should always be the first step before adopting restrictive measures.
[[If NATO moves to]{.mark}o]{.underline} quickly or
[[aggressively]{.mark}, it [risks being counterproductive]{.mark} by
widening divisions in the alliance]{.underline}. At the end of the day,
this progressive approach should have a deterrent effect on NATO
countries, especially on those that value their membership in the
alliance and do not want to be singled out as "bad allies."

Hard Is Not Impossible

[These failings notwithstanding, there exists no shortage of arguments
in favor of the status quo and against shifting America's focus in
security assistance to security-sector reform and conditional
[a]{.mark}id. [In]{.mark} an **[era of great-power competition]{.mark},
[Russia]{.mark}, [China]{.mark}, or regional [competitors]{.mark} may
simply step in to [fill the gap]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} the [partner
nation if]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [insists upon
unwelcome reforms]{.mark} in exchange for aid.]{.underline} I know [this
is a valid concern]{.underline} because I have sat in meetings where
**[[partners]{.mark} [made]{.mark} thinly veiled [reference]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} other [nations which may provide assistance if]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} unable or
[unwilling]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Still, the quality and
[technological edge of **U.S**]{.mark}**.** kit and the total-package
approach which includes **training and follow-on [support]{.mark} do
[provide the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [a competitive
advantage]{.mark}**. But the bureaucratic apparatus responsible for
delivering aid is far too slow and, as a result, is a liability. To
outcompete, the **security assistance enterprise itself requires major
reform to shorten typical lead times** from years to months. The
Pentagon and State Department need the agility to turn aid on and off
like a switch or rheostat.]{.underline}

[Another argument against placing preconditions on security assistance
is that the **[stakes are too high to deny]{.mark} a partner a [critical
capability]{.mark}** [while waiting for reform]{.mark} to happen. This
is the "[we can't let them]{.mark} [fail]{.mark}" mentality. It is also
valid]{.underline} --- but only in certain crisis situations where aid
is needed immediately, and reform truly cannot wait. Ukraine today is a
good example. [[Rather than ceasing aid writ large]{.mark} until a
condition is met, **[place]{.mark} [conditions on]{.mark}** discrete
**packages of [aid]{.mark}**. The **[intent should]{.mark} be [to
provide sufficient]{.mark} [incentive]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
host-[nation]{.mark} government [to modify
behavior]{.mark}**,]{.underline} not threaten national
survival[.]{.underline} During the years I spent in Afghanistan, the
security threats faced by the government never appeared to afford the
breathing space to withhold aid while institutional reform took place.
In hindsight, doing so may have required coalition forces to carry a
greater operational burden while the Afghan forces sorted themselves
out, but it also would have been worth it. As the events of August 2021
demonstrated, 20 years of unconditional capacity-building built
shockingly little capacity. Implementing this change requires a
recurring review of Defense Department-led train and equip programs to
determine which truly qualify as crisis situations. Those which do not
should be moved under State Department control for more deliberate,
reform-focused approach.

There is also the simple argument that [**instituting [meaningful
reform]{.mark} in a recalcitrant partner nation [is
hard]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} This is true.]{.underline} But hard is not
impossible. The security assistance enterprise should approach reform
not in broad, sweeping terms but incremental steps. Rather than
requiring the partner to eliminate corruption wholesale across the
security forces, perhaps require that a particularly corrupt commander
be removed before providing assistance to that unit. In the case of Iraq
in the late 2000s, the United States might have required Prime Minister
Nouri al-Maliki to fire certain commanders guilty of sectarian excesses
or modify the personnel policy to make the armed forces more broadly
inclusive. In other cases, reform measures may be as mundane as
switching to an electronic pay system to reduce the opportunity for
graft. Such a change in approach would also require a change in how the
United States prepares officers for security assistance duties. The
Defense Security Cooperation Agency has made great strides in its
educational program to professionalize the security assistance workforce
in recent years. It could further improve this program by embedding
security sector reform more deeply into the curriculum.

Better Rewards, Tougher Inducements

[The United States is **not getting the most for its security assistance
dollars**. [Programs]{.mark} intended to build partner capacity tend to
underperform because **they [fail to address underlying weakness in
defense]{.mark} [institutions]{.mark}** or take principal-agent problems
into account. To build meaningful, long-lasting capacity in partners and
better align security assistance with policy goals, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [should shift]{.mark} from a "building partner capacity"
**approach [to a reform focus using conditional aid as
leverage]{.mark}**. Doing so in an environment where security assistance
is yet [another **arena for strategic competition**]{.mark} [with
Russia]{.mark}, [China]{.mark}, and others will require internal reform
of the U.S. security assistance apparatus. Rather than a slow-moving
bureaucracy, the United States needs an agile and streamlined security
assistance enterprise [able to deliver aid rapidly when needed]{.mark}
and be [paused or turned off]{.mark} just [as]{.mark} easily when
[conditions require]{.mark}. In short, the **United States needs sweeter
carrots and harder sticks**.]{.underline}

While the current U.S. effort to arm and equip Ukrainian forces is the
most visible example today, it is not representative of the day-to-day
work of security assistance which the United States carries out around
the world. In most cases, the greater threat facing these partners is
not an invading army but rather defense institutions for which reform is
needed but not properly incentivized. **[[Modifying]{.mark} the [U.S.
approach]{.mark} to security assistance [is one way to create that
incentive]{.mark} and [better align aid with policy
goals]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[Putin's True Fear]{.underline}

[The **more [serious]{.mark} [cause of tensions has been]{.mark} a
[series of democratic breakthroughs]{.mark}**]{.underline} and popular
protests for freedom throughout the 2000s, what many refer to as the
"Color Revolutions." [Putin [believes]{.mark} that [Russian]{.mark}
national [interests]{.mark} have been [threatened]{.mark} by what he
portrays as U.S.-supported coups.]{.underline} After each of
them---Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring
in 2011, Russia in 2011--12, and Ukraine in 2013--14---[Putin has
[pivoted to more hostile policies]{.mark} toward the United States, and
then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.]{.underline}

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first
round of expansion in 1997 because he believed his close ties to
President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing
over this comparatively smaller matter. Through Partnership for Peace
and especially the NATO-Russia Founding Act, Clinton and his team made a
considerable effort to keep US-Russian relations positive while at the
same time managing NATO expansion. The 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia to
stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo severely tested that strategy but
survived in part because Clinton gave Yeltsin and Russia a role in the
negotiated solution. When the first post-communist color revolution
overthrew Slobodan Milosevic a year later, Russia's new president,
Putin, deplored the act but did not overreact. At that time, he still
entertained the possibility of cooperation with the West, including
NATO.

However, the next round of [[democratic expansion in]{.mark} the
[post-Soviet world]{.mark}]{.underline}, the 2003 Rose Revolution in
Georgia, [[escalated]{.mark} U.S.-Russian [tensions]{.mark}
significantly. Putin [blamed]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
directly [for assisting]{.mark} in this [democratic]{.mark}
[breakthrough]{.mark}]{.underline} and helping to install what he saw as
a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Immediately after
the Rose Revolution, Putin sought to undermine Georgian democracy,
ultimately invading in 2008 and recognizing two Georgian
regions---Abkhazia and South Ossetia---as independent states.
U.S.-Russian relations reached a new low point in 2008.

A year after the Rose Revolution, the [most consequential democratic
expansion in the post-Soviet world erupted in Ukraine]{.underline} in
2004, the [Orange
Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Orange-Ukraines-Democratic-Breakthrough/dp/0870032216).
In the years prior to that momentous event, Ukraine's foreign-policy
orientation under President Leonid Kuchma was [relatively balanced
between east and
west](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ponars-policy-memo-291-paradoxes-kuchmas-russian-policy),
but with gradually improving ties between Kyiv and Moscow. That changed
when a [falsified presidential
election](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/McFaul-16-3.pdf) in
late 2004 brought hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians into the streets,
eventually sweeping away Kuchma's---and Putin's---handpicked successor,
Viktor Yanukovych. Instead, the prodemocratic and pro-western Orange
Coalition led by President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yuliya
Tymoshenko took power.

Compared to Serbia in 2000 or Georgia in 2003, the Orange Revolution in
Ukraine in 2004 was a much larger threat to Putin. First, the Orange
Revolution occurred suddenly and in a much bigger and more strategic
country on Russia's border. The abrupt pivot to the West by Yushchenko
and his allies left Putin facing the prospect that he had "lost" a
country on which he placed tremendous symbolic and strategic importance.

To Putin, the Orange Revolution [**[undermined]{.mark} a core [objective
of his [grand
strategy](https://www.csis.org/blogs/post-soviet-post/four-myths-about-russian-grand-strategy)]{.mark}**:
to [establish]{.mark} a privileged and [exclusive sphere of
influence]{.mark} across the territory that once comprised the Soviet
Union. Putin believes in spheres of influence; that as a great power,
Russia has a right to veto the sovereign political decisions of its
neighbors. Putin also demands exclusivity in his neighborhood: [Russia
can be the only great power]{.mark} to exercise such privilege (or even
develop close ties) with these countries]{.underline}. This position has
hardened significantly since Putin's conciliatory position of 2002 as
Russia's influence in Ukraine has waned and Ukraine's citizens have
repeatedly signaled their desire to escape from Moscow's grasp.
Subservience was now required. As Putin explained in a [recent
historical article](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181),
in his view Ukrainians and Russians "were one people" whom he is seeking
to reunite, even if through coercion. For Putin, therefore, the loss of
Ukraine in 2004 to the West marked a major negative turning point in
U.S.-Russian relations that was far more salient than the second wave of
NATO expansion that was completed the same year.

Second, those Ukrainians who rose up in defense of their freedom were,
in Putin's own assessment, Slavic brethren with close historical,
religious, and cultural ties to Russia. If it could happen in Kyiv, [why
not in Moscow](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480974)? Several years
later, it almost did happen in Russia when [a series of mass
protests](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480973) erupted in Moscow, St.
Petersburg, and other cities in the wake of fraudulent parliamentary
elections in December 2011. They were the largest protests in Russia
since 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. For the first time in
his decade-plus in power, ordinary Russians showed themselves to have
both the will and the capability to threaten Putin's grip on power. That
popular uprising in Russia, occurring the same year as the Arab Spring,
and then followed with Putin's return to the Kremlin as president for a
third term in 2012, marked another major negative turn in U.S.-Russian
relations, ending
the [reset](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-War-Hot-Peace-Ambassador/dp/0544716248) launched
by Presidents Obama and Medvedev in 2009. **[[Democratic]{.mark}
[mobilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**, first the Middle East and then
Russia---[not NATO expansion---**[ended]{.mark} this last chapter of
[U.S.-Russian cooperation]{.mark}**. There have been [no]{.mark} new
chapters of [cooperation since]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[But U.S.-Russian [relations]{.mark} [deteriorated]{.mark} ever
[further]{.mark} in 2014, again [because of]{.mark} new [democratic
expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}. The next democratic mobilization to
threaten Putin happened a second time in Ukraine in 2013--14. After the
Orange Revolution in 2004, Putin did not invade Ukraine, but wielded
other instruments of influence to help his protégé, Viktor
Yanukovych, [narrowly win the Ukrainian
presidency](https://www.brookings.edu/on-the-record/understanding-ukraines-presidential-shift/) six
years later. Yanukovych, however, turned out not to be a loyal Kremlin
servant, but tried to cultivate ties with both Russia and the West.
Putin finally compelled Yanukovych to make a choice, and the Ukrainian
president chose Russia in the fall of 2013 when he reneged on
signing [an EU association
agreement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ukraine-under-pressure-from-russia-puts-brakes-on-eu-deal/2013/11/21/46c50796-52c9-11e3-9ee6-2580086d8254_story.html) in
favor of membership in Russia's Eurasian Economic Union.

To the surprise of everyone in Moscow, Kyiv, Brussels, and Washington,
Yanukovych's decision to scuttle this agreement with the EU triggered
mass demonstrations in Ukraine again, bringing [hundreds of
thousands](https://euromaidanpress.com/2016/02/20/the-story-of-ukraine-starting-from-euromaidan/2/) of
Ukrainians into the streets in what would become known as
the [Euromaidan](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/how-modern-ukraine-was-made-on-maidan/) or
"Revolution of Dignity" to protest Yanukovych's turn away from the
democratic West. The street protests lasted several weeks, punctuated by
the killing of dozens of peaceful protestors by Yanukovych's government,
the eventual collapse of that government and Yanukovych's flight to
Russia in February 2014, and a new [pro-Western
government](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/world/europe/ukraine.html) taking
power in Kyiv. Putin had "lost" Ukraine for the second time in a decade.

This time, [**[Putin]{.mark} [struck back with military]{.mark}
[force]{.mark}** to punish the alleged American-backed]{.underline},
neo-Nazi [usurpers]{.underline} in Kyiv. Russian armed forces seized
Crimea; Moscow later annexed the Ukrainian peninsula. Putin also
provided money, equipment, and soldiers to back separatists in eastern
Ukraine, fueling a simmering war in Donbas for eight years, in
which [approximately 14,000 people have been
killed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2022/russia-ukraine-conflict-photos-2014/).
After invading, not before, Putin amped up his criticisms of NATO
expansion as justification for his belligerent actions.

In response to this second Ukrainian democratic revolution, [Putin
concluded that cooption through elections and other nonmilitary means
had to be augmented with greater coercive pressure, including military
intervention]{.underline}. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has
waged [an unprecedented
war](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Putin_s_War_Against_Ukraine/frfXAQAACAAJ?hl=en) against
Ukraine using a full spectrum of military, political, informational,
social, and economic weapons in an attempt to [destabilize and
eventually topple Ukraine's democratically elected
government](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/10/06/heres-why-putin-wants-to-topple-ukraines-government-not-to-engineer-a-frozen-conflict/).
Ukraine's relationship with NATO and the United States is just a symptom
of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign,
democratic Ukraine.

Putin's Real Casus Belli: Ukrainian Democracy

Amazingly, eight years of unrelenting Russian pressure did not break
Ukraine's democracy. Just the opposite. After Putin's annexation and
ongoing support for the war in Donbas, Ukrainians are now more united
across ethnic, linguistic, and regional divides than at any other point
in Ukrainian history. In 2019, President Volodymyr Zelensky won in a
landslide, winning popular support in every region of Ukraine. Not
surprisingly, Putin's war also has fueled greater popular support among
Ukrainians for joining NATO.

So now, [[Putin]{.mark} has [decided on a new strategy for
ending]{.mark}]{.underline} Ukrainian [[democracy]{.mark}:
**[massive]{.mark} [military]{.mark} [intervention]{.mark}**. **Putin**
**claims that his purpose is to stop NATO expansion. But that's a
fiction**]{.underline}. Nothing in the past year in Ukraine-NATO
relations has changed. It is true Ukraine aspires to join NATO someday.
(The goal is even embedded in the Ukrainian constitution.) But while
NATO leaders have remained committed to the principle of an open-door
policy, they have also clearly stated that Ukraine today is not
qualified to join. Putin's casus belli is his own invention.

[Putin has fabricated this crisis about NATO expansion to
undermine]{.underline} Ukrainian [democracy]{.underline} even more
directly. Already, the Russian military mobilization on Ukraine's
borders has triggered [significant damage to the Ukrainian
economy](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putin-has-seriously-wounded-ukraines-economy-without-firing-a-single-shot/) and
fueled new divisions among Ukraine's political parties over how Zelensky
has handled the crisis. Some argue that Zelensky should have created a
new grand coalition or unity government; others lament his alleged
inadequate preparations for war. And some contend that Zelensky showed
his diplomatic inexperience by arguing with U.S. president Joe Biden
about the probability of a Russian invasion at a time when unity with
the West is most needed. In other words, Putin's military mobilization
already achieved some early successes in his war against Ukrainian
democracy.

Paradoxically, Putin's use of force may have strengthened Ukrainian
democracy in the short term. His [decision to invade
Ukraine](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67836) by sending
Russian forces into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions (still recognized as
sovereign Ukrainian territory under international law) has united
Ukrainians and strengthened Zelensky's popularity and image as a leader
of the nation. But the long-term survival of Ukraine's democracy hangs
in the balance, and Putin's [bellicose
rhetoric](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/67828) suggests
that Moscow's assault is just beginning. A blitzkrieg invasion and rapid
encirclement of Kyiv could result in Zelensky's forcible removal from
power. New elections held at gunpoint could deliver the desired
government, just as they did in [post--World War II Eastern
Europe](https://ipn.gov.pl/en/digital-resources/articles/7193,Rigged-elections-19-January-1947.html) in
the shadow of Soviet tanks. It is too early to predict the outcome. But
Putin's objective is clear.

[**[Putin may dislike NATO]{.mark} expansion, [but]{.mark} [he is not
genuinely frightened by it]{.mark}.** [Russia]{.mark} [has]{.mark} the
[largest army in Europe]{.mark}, now much more capable after two decades
of lavish spending. [NATO is]{.mark} a [defensive]{.mark}
alliance]{.underline}. It has never attacked the Soviet Union or Russia,
and it never will. Putin knows that. [[But Putin is threatened
by]{.mark} a successful [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} in Ukraine. He
cannot tolerate a successful, flourishing, and democratic Ukraine on his
borders, especially if the Ukrainian people also begin to prosper
economically. [That undermines the Kremlin's own regime stability and
proposed rationale for autocratic state leadership]{.underline}. Just as
Putin cannot allow the will of the Russian people to guide Russia's
future, he cannot allow the people of Ukraine, who have a shared culture
and history, to choose the prosperous, independent, and free future that
they have voted for and fought for.

Though the chance of deescalation is remote, further negotiations and
the [threat of
sanctions](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/sanctioning-russia-over-ukraine-no-silver-bullet-200031) could
still---in theory---prevent a Russian invasion beyond Ukraine's Donbas
region in the coming days or weeks. But regardless of where Putin
finally orders his troops to halt---be it Luhansk and Donetsk or
Kharkiv, Odessa, Kyiv, or Lviv---the Kremlin will remain committed to
undermining Ukrainian (and Georgian, Moldovan, Armenian, etc.) democracy
and sovereignty for as long as Putin remains in power and maybe longer
if Russian autocracy continues. Tragically, George Kennan's warning in
his 1947 Foreign Affairs article on "The Sources of Soviet Conduct"
still holds true today:

"\[The\] Kremlin is under no ideological compulsion to accomplish its
purposes in a hurry ... Here caution, circumspection, flexibility and
deception are the valuable qualities ... And being under the compulsion
of no timetable, it does not get panicky under the necessity for such
retreat. Its political action is a fluid stream which moves constantly,
wherever it is permitted to move, toward a given goal."

[There [should be no illusions about]{.mark} Putin's long-term strategic
[goal of stopping democratic]{.mark} [expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
Ukraine and the rest of the region.

As the world waits to learn
if [Putin ](https://thehill.com/people/vladimir-putin/)will order a
full-scale military offensive in Ukraine, Washington seems to be
stumbling over a simple question: [How much does Russian aggression in
Europe matter to U.S. interests?]{.underline}
One [view](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/584619-why-the-us-shouldnt-try-to-deter-a-russian-invasion-of-ukraine) is
that Ukraine's status is more important to Russia than to us, especially
because Ukraine is not a part of NATO. Others go further, questioning
whether even NATO members, guaranteed protection by [Article
5](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm), are
worth defending. 

Media
have [noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/01/27/tucker-carlson-support-putin-republicans/) Tucker
Carlson's growing influence in Republican circles on this question. Two
years ago, he previewed his stance when
I [debated](https://video.foxnews.com/v/5989829150001#sp=show-clips) him
on his show. He argued that NATO members Estonia and Latvia, are, like
Ukraine, not worth defending if invaded by Russia. I countered, as I
explain in more detail here, that it's in America's vital interest to
support these sovereign nations --- precisely because Putin is targeting
them for their decision to turn away from the governance model on offer
from Russia.

To understand why Putin's threat to invade Ukraine --- or any other
independent state in Europe --- matters, consider why he might do
it. Putin wants you to believe it's because NATO expansion to Ukraine
threatens the Russian people and Russia's security. He doesn't genuinely
believe this. It's propaganda.

NATO is a defensive alliance. No member of NATO, since the fall of the
Berlin Wall, has conveyed a credible threat to peoples or places inside
Russia's current borders. In fact, NATO sought a

Russia after the dissolution of the U.S.S.R., until Putin steered the
country onto its present course. Putin is a careful study and knows that
NATO isn't interested in gobbling up Russian territory or subjugating
Russian people. Similarly, a sovereign and independent Ukraine presents
no actual threat to Russian lands.

[Putin fears an independent Ukraine with strong ties to the
West]{.underline} for the same reason he [sent
troops](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-sends-troops-into-kazakhstan-as-protests-turn-deadly/) to

interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. [There's [one]{.mark}
[**common thread** running through]{.mark} each of these endeavors ---
and nearly [every]{.mark} other foreign policy [initiative]{.mark} now
[championed by Putin]{.mark}: [He **wants to undermine
democracy**]{.mark}, wherever it is, or can take root, [especially in
countries on Russia's border]{.mark} that [he's worried he can't
control.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Why does he fear democracy so much?]{.underline} Sure, Putin is a Cold
War enthusiast, but his main priority is not to restore the eminence of
old U.S.S.R. in Eastern Europe. [It's [to]{.mark} **[boost]{.mark} his
own prospect for [self-preservatio]{.mark}**[n]{.mark}. To Putin, this
means [[consolidating](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-putin-controls-russia) all
political powers]{.mark} in Russia inside his office and carefully
**[guarding]{.mark} [against]{.mark} the [appeal of democratic
challengers to]{.mark} his "[forever
presidency]{.mark}."**]{.underline} Last year,
Putin [amended](https://www.theweek.co.uk/106126/putin-s-plan-to-rule-for-longer-than-stalin) the
Russian constitution so he can remain President until at least 2036.
This will make him Kremlin's [longest
serving](https://nationalpost.com/news/world/putin-signs-law-that-could-make-him-russias-longest-serving-ruler-since-stalin) leader
since Peter the Great, even longer than Stalin.

[NATO has never posed a real threat to Putin's supremacy inside
Russia. But a **[well-functioning democracy on Russia's border]{.mark},
which could [inspire]{.mark} new [democratic movements within
Russia]{.mark}**, would. And this **[threat could be especially
dangerous for Putin]{.mark}** if it re-focused Russians inward, at their
own
lamentable [economy](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/04/23/the-kremlin-has-isolated-russias-economy),
instead of on Putin's outward bluster that NATO is the [greatest]{.mark}
[threat]{.mark} to their well-being]{.underline}.

[Because the true source of Putin's ire is the adoption of more
democratic institutions by sovereign states in Russia's neighborhood,
**Putin is actually challenging not a particular nation or alliance, but
the spread of democracy and rule of law.**]{.underline}

[When the sovereignty of nations striving for more stable democracies is
threatened, U.S. commitment to democracy in general is at
stake.]{.underline}

[The U.S. cheered Ukraine during three defining events in its
democracy]{.underline}: first, when it held a referendum in 1991 and [90
percent](https://www.ft.com/content/0cbbd590-8e48-4687-a302-e74b6f0c905d) of
its population voted in favor of independence; second, during [the
"Orange
Revolution"](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/how-ukraines-orange-revolution-shaped-twenty-first-century-geopolitics/) in
the winter of 2004, when people took to the streets of Kyiv to protest
an election clearly rigged to benefit the Kremlin-backed candidate (the
pro-Western candidate [survived an attempted assassination by
poison](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-43611547)), and third,
when a groundswell of democratic protests in
2013 [forced](https://www.vox.com/2022/1/30/22908600/ukraine-crisis-putin-russia-one-people-myth-nato-europe) former
President Viktor Yanukovych from power after his decision to back out of
a popular trade agreement with the EU in fealty to Moscow. [All three
were clear rejections of Russia, in favor of democracy.]{.underline}

[What Russia is posing to do now, after 30 years of Ukrainian
independence, is a clear violation of international law. The lack of a
response could **[usher]{.mark} the [collapse]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a
[rules-based order]{.mark}** which the U.S. has nurtured]{.underline}
since the end of WWII. The U.N. is already absent on the issue of
Ukraine's sovereignty because of
Russia's [veto](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/why-united-nations-can-t-solve-ukraine-crisis-n1288480).

In 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait without any legal basis for doing so,
the
U.S. [organized](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/gulf-war) a
coalition and mobilized in Kuwait's defense, with
U.N. [authorization](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/678). This sent a
message to aggressors around the world that if they invade their
neighbors, they could be destroyed.

If Putin successfully invades Ukraine without serious consequences, it
would send the opposite message --- and might lead Putin to believe he
can do it again, including to one of those NATO democracies in Eastern
Europe that [Tucker
Carlson ](https://thehill.com/people/tucker-carlson/)believes aren't
worth defending.

It would also signal to other nationalist regimes with extraterritorial
aspirations --- including China, Iran, and Turkey --- that they too
could orchestrate cross-border offensives to stamp out democratic
tendencies in their region without repercussion.

#### Putin is [uniquely emboldened]{.underline} by democratization 

**West 22** -- John West, adjunct professor at Tokyo's Sophia
University, executive director of the Asian Century Institute ("Saving
democracy from Russian rage", *The Interpreter*, 3/14/2022,
<https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/saving-democracy-russian-rage>)
FGY

Much is being written about Russia's invasion of the Ukraine, and much
more will surely be said in the months and years ahead of this
potentially epoch-defining event. But some of the most insightful and
almost prescient analyses were made well before the conflict, such as in
Larry Diamond's excellent 2020 book, [Ill winds: Saving democracy from
Russian rage, Chinese ambition, and American
complacency](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/588987/ill-winds-by-larry-diamond/).

Diamond, a professor at Stanford University, documents the political
transformation of the world through the ["[third wave of
democratisation]{.mark}", beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by
a big bang after the fall of the Berlin wall, with the democratisation
of central and eastern Europe. But then [began]{.mark} a [global]{.mark}
[democratic recession]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Badly governed, poorly performing democracies are indeed accidents
waiting to happen. It may be difficult to remember but there were hopes
back in the 1990s that a nascent Russian democracy might mature under
the leadership of Boris Yeltsin. But the country's politics were then
hijacked by Vladimir Putin. Putin led a backslide to authoritarianism.

Diamond begins the chapter "Russia's global assault" by recalling the
famous "Long Telegram" written in 1946 by George F. Kennan, the number
two official at the US Embassy in Moscow. Kennan wrote of the "Kremlin's
neurotic view of world affairs" and "a traditional and instinctive
Russian sense of insecurity" and "a fear of more competent, more
powerful, more highly organised" Western societies. The Soviet Union's
leaders knew that their "fragile and artificial" regime was "unable to
stand comparison or contact with political systems of Western
countries". Kennan predicted a [[relentless]{.mark} [Soviet campaign to
"disrupt]{.mark} national self-[confidence]{.mark}" [in]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Europe]{.mark} and "to
[stimulate]{.mark} all forms of [disunity]{.mark}" [within Western
democracies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Diamond argues that [[Putin's view of Russia]{.mark} and the world is
[strikingly]{.mark} [similar]{.mark} [to]{.mark} that of the [Soviet
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} whom Kennan described in the Long Telegram.
[Putin [believes]{.mark} that the **[West is seeking to encircle
Russia]{.mark} and [keep it weak]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Despite his
unrivalled power, Putin is deeply insecure about the legitimacy of his
rule. And he **[panics]{.mark} [at]{.mark} the [sight of popular
demonstrations]{.mark}, which he [blames]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [Western
plots]{.mark} to unseat him**.]{.underline}

[So **Putin has [responded by vast military interventions]{.mark},
[cyber]{.mark}-[hacking]{.mark}, and other interference and influence
operations** [against]{.mark} the [West]{.mark} and its interests. He is
using the openness and pluralism of Western democracies to subvert
them and taking advantage of the West's reluctance for military
engagement.]{.underline}

[In sum, Putin's Russia is "[waging]{.mark} a [global assault on
democracy]{.mark}",]{.underline} according to Diamond.

#### Should does not mean absolutely mandatory, it's a discretionary term

**Legel**, Judicial Law Clerk at the Drug Enforcement Administration,
**2017**

"CURRENT NAVIGATION POINTS IN DRUG DIVERSION LAW: HIDDEN ROCKS IN
SHALLOW, MURKY, DRUG-INFESTED WATERS," Marquette Law Review, p. 384

[The [Agency]{.mark}]{.underline} disagreed with the ALJ\'s
interpretation of the Oklahoma provisions, and [[held]{.mark} that
\"[should\" does not really mean \"should]{.mark},\"]{.underline} at
least in those provisions, [but actually [means]{.mark}
\"[must]{.mark},\" and connoted a mandatory obligation]{.underline} in
the context of the provisions at issue. 292 The Agency based its
decision on its interpretation of cases from the Seventh Circuit, the
D.C. Circuit, a federal district court in Florida, and a dictionary
definition of \"should,\" as well as an analysis of the Oklahoma Medical
Practice Act and a Policy Statement. 293 Interestingly, a Tenth Circuit
(which includes Oklahoma) case which held that \"\"should\' indicates a
recommended course of action, but does not itself imply the obligation
associated with \"shall,\'\" received no mention in the Agency\'s
decision in Pope. 294 Thus, [contrary to the [Agency\'s view]{.mark},
the pertinent Circuit Court of Appeals [holds]{.mark} the view that the
[most reasonable interpretation of the word \"should\" is really]{.mark}
\"should\" - [a discretionary term]{.mark}]{.underline}. 295 The Agency
did not discuss the fact that there is some level of conflict in the
circuit courts about whether to treat \"should\" as mandatory or
permissive, 296 but the Agency has apparently taken the position that,
if the state law supplying the practice standard in a DEA case uses the
word \"should,\" the Agency is likely to read that word as \"must,\"
irrespective of federal circuit law on the issue. 297

#### The term "should" carries flexibility and discretion

Sam Foster **Halabi**, Assistant Professor, University of Tulsa College
of Law. J.D., Harvard Law School, **2010**

"ARTICLE: THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION\'S FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON
TOBACCO CONTROL: AN ANALYSIS OF GUIDELINES ADOPTED BY THE CONFERENCE OF
THE PARTIES", 39 Ga. J. Int\'l & Comp. L. 121, 136

The purpose, scope, and applicability of the guidelines variously
declare that States \"should,\" \"should consider,\" \"should
endeavour,\" \"should ensure,\" and \"should require\" the measures
adopted by the COP. 66The text of the FCTC uses the word \"shall\" as to
certain of Parties\' obligations. 67The use of the word
\"[[should]{.underline}]{.mark},\" in most contexts, [[is]{.mark}
\"[precatory, not mandatory]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" 68Yet the word
\"[should\" may also be used to [express]{.mark} a duty or
[obligation]{.mark} albeit [with]{.mark} a degree of
[flexibility]{.mark} or discretion]{.underline}. 69FCTC Article
11.1(b)(iv) illustrates this distinction, requiring that warnings and
messages \"should be 50% or more of the principal display areas but
shall be no less than 30% of the principal display areas.\"
70Furthermore, many of the measures adopted without objection by the COP
are styled \"recommendations,\" the ordinary meaning of which does not
entail mandatory action. 71In the following sections, the treaty
language is juxtaposed with key language from the guidelines in an
effort to sort out obligations imposed by the treaty language,
obligations clarified by virtue of guidance from the guidelines, and
non-obligatory provisions of the guidelines that are precatory or
recommendatory. 72

#### Should means encouragement, not requirement

Ryan **Williams**, received his law degree in 2008 from Louisiana State
University , graduating with honors. He was a member of the Law Review
and served as a Senior Editor during his Senior year, **2008**

"Reputation and the Rules: An Argument for a Balancing Approach under
Rule 8.3 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct", 68 La. L. Rev.
931, p. 936

As in Canon 29, [use of the permissive \"[should]{.mark}\"
[implies]{.mark} that the Georgia Rule is merely [hortatory]{.mark}; it
[encourages]{.mark} reporting misbehavior [without]{.mark}
[requiring]{.mark} it]{.underline}. Georgia Rule 8.3 goes a step further
than Canon 29, in fact, by explicitly disclaiming any threat of
disciplinary proceedings for failure to comply.

#### It's not a mandatory obligation

Gil **Fried**, University of New Haven **and** Robin **Ammon**, Slippery
Rock University, **2001**

"What is Appropriate Signage for the Sport Industries?," Journal of
Legal Aspects of Sports, p. 190

The everyday use of signage affects the efficient and safe flow of
vehicular traffic. Tort liability for traffic signage related issues is
predicated upon standards established by each states\' Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Under these guidelines government
entities are required to develop uniformity in communicating safety
concerns. Uniformity means that the same type of device should be used
for the same type of road condition, which helps drivers to develop and
maintain certain expectancies (Blashke, 1990). The MUTCD uses terms such
as \"shall,\" \"should,\" and \"may\" to suggest or demand the
application of traffic control devices. [If the word \"[shall]{.mark}\"
is [used]{.mark} it is [a mandatory term]{.mark} and the state has to
follow the guidelines. In contrast, the term \"[should]{.mark}\"
[indicates]{.mark} only a [strong recommendation]{.mark}, but
[not]{.mark} a [mandatory]{.mark} recommendation]{.underline}. A good
example of this difference can be seen with stop signs. The MUTCD states
that stop signs \"shall\" be an octagon and further provides that when
two highways intersect the stop sign \"should\" be posted on the minor
street (Blashke, 1990[). The difference between \"shall\" and \"should\"
is very significant]{.underline} for traffic sign cases since liability
is harder to prove if the state was not required to post a sign when
compared with instances where the state failed to post a required sign.

Unimaginably, [the [US is like a loose cannon with its double

(accessed 6-2-2022)

[The [US has faced accusations of voter suppression]{.mark}]{.underline}
by introducing policies such as requiring citizens to show ID and
prohibiting early votes, both of which disproportionately affect Black
Americans and disabled people. The report highlights that [[people of
colour and]{.mark} specifically Black Americans are "[particularly
v]{.mark}ulnerable]{.underline} to abuses of every single right
measured". [This highlights a [worrying disregard for]{.mark} [human
rights]{.mark} which appears to affect vulnerable minority groups at a
higher level]{.underline}. THE HYPOCRISY OF THE US [America has taken a
leading role in condemning human rights abuses worldwide]{.underline}.
In December 2019, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned Iran for
violating human rights, including "the violent crackdown on protestors
in November 2019". This US subsequently placed sanctions on Iran. [The
current [protests]{.mark} taking place in the US [demonstrate the
country's outright hypocrisy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The death of George
Floyd at the hands of US police officers has triggered worldwide
protests against police brutality. American protestors have largely been
met with further violence from the police. What began as a series of
peaceful protests quickly became widespread chaos, with police cars
driving into protestors, elderly men being pushed to the ground and
seriously injured, and assaults on innocent reporters. Pompeo has also
criticised Tehran for using violence against anti-government protestors.
He stated that "we pray for a day when ... all peoples can speak and
assemble freely without fear of their own governments." Whilst this
violation of human rights should certainly be condemned, [it is
[difficult to see how]{.mark} [any country could learn lessons from the
US,]{.mark} where the state is encouraging the use of violence against
its own citizens during protests]{.underline}. For instance, Trump
tweeted a controversial warning to protestors, stating that "when the
looting starts, the shooting starts". This statement was flagged by
Twitter as violating their guidelines by "glorifying violence". These
protests are a clear example of the US committing the same violations it
condemns overseas. THE EFFECTS OF HYPOCRITICAL POLICY [The
[hypocrisy]{.mark} demonstrated by the US [has a huge impact on]{.mark}
the [enforcement of international human rights]{.mark}. The [US has a
reputation for boasting]{.mark} about its citizens' freedoms and claims
to set an example for the rest of the world. US violations]{.underline},
however, [of its own citizens freedoms have allowed countries such as
China and Russia to undermine American efforts to condemn human rights
abuses. [America's]{.mark} recent [violations]{.mark} are [likely to
prohibit any effective intervention]{.mark} when encouraging other
countries to respect human rights]{.underline}.

Externally, [the war [waged by America in countries]{.mark} like

from Afghanistan, a US drone killed 10 members of an Afghan
family,]{.underline} including seven children, among which the youngest
was only two years old. [Also, to date, the US still holds 39 detainees
at the Guantanamo high-security prison]{.underline}. Hence, given all
these, it is imperative to ask if the US, a title-holder in pointing
fingers at the human rights shortcomings of other countries, will take
responsibility and address its dismal human rights record within its
borders and beyond? Conclusion Indeed, "righteous indignation should be
reserved for the truly righteous." But [[America is far from being
righteous]{.mark} given its blatant dismal human rights record within
its borders and beyond]{.underline}. [America [lecturing the world on
human rights is a farce]{.mark}, for it [doesn't have the moral
ascendancy and integrity]{.mark} given its gloomy human rights
record]{.underline}. [Instead of schooling other countries on their
human rights shortcomings, the US]{.underline} probably [needs some
self-introspection and should first address its human rights
situation]{.underline}.

#### Failure to shore up democracy at home makes global democracy promotion impossible

[[American diplomats have long understood]{.mark} that
[hypocrisy]{.mark} [has]{.mark} a [cost,]{.mark} especially [for a
nation that seeks to champion]{.mark} the ideals of [democracy]{.mark}
and human rights as the cornerstone of global peace and
security]{.underline}. As E.J. Dionne Jr. rightly pointed out in his
June 10 Thursday Opinion column, "[Our national security now depends on
civil rights," failing to shore up our democratic institutions and
uphold human rights at home deepens the United States' credibility
deficit and weakens its effectiveness as a champion of these values
abroad. And that has serious national security
implications]{.underline}, because we know --- from hard data and grim
experience --- that Americans are safer when democracies set the rules
of a global order. But though it's true that [our [adversaries]{.mark}
will [use]{.mark} this [hypocrisy to discredit]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates in the global struggle of ideas, there's
a deeper and more [direct security threat posed by]{.mark} our [failure
to live up to]{.mark} those [ideals at home]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Societal divisions that result from systemic racism and other human
rights violations]{.underline} left to fester, combined with weak
institutions seemingly incapable of addressing these challenges, [make
us]{.underline} [not just a weaker champion but also a weaker
nation]{.underline}, increasingly vulnerable to attacks of all kinds

[NATO is a popular punching bag for President Trump.]{.underline} Days
before coming into office, he called it "obsolete." As president, he's
railed against European spending on defense and noted time and again
that many NATO allies don't meet the target of 2 percent of gross
domestic product on defense. Other U.S. politicians --- in Congress, for
example --- have rushed to make sure NATO allies know that the United
States remains committed to the alliance. But as NATO approaches its
70th birthday Thursday, it's worth asking --- [are [Americans]{.mark}
[still behind NATO]{.mark} or have they been swayed by Trump's
arguments?]{.underline}

[According to a new study by the Program for Public Consultation of the
School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and released by
the nonpartisan organization Voice of the People, **the American people
remain committed to NATO**, too.]{.underline}

Respondents were put in the position of policymakers and presented with
arguments for and against remaining in NATO. [Just over 8 in 10, or
**[83 percent]{.mark}**, of the roughly 2,400 respondents [said]{.mark}
that **the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should]{.mark} remain in
[NATO]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

"The idea is that you're putting the respondent in the shoes of the
policymaker so they've really heard the essential side of the issue,"
said Steven Kull, director of the survey.

[And **support bridged the proverbial aisle**, with 90 percent of
Democratic respondents and 77 percent of Republicans saying the United
States should remain in NATO.]{.underline} (Since at least 2009,
according to the Pew Research Center, Democrats have taken a more
favorable view of NATO.)

"Given that there is substantial discussion questioning whether NATO
membership is necessary, and given that Russia has become relatively
weak and that it's been some years since the Cold War, [I thought it was
[striking]{.mark} that **[support]{.mark} for NATO membership is as
robust** as it is]{.underline}," said Kull, noting that, [**even [in
"very red districts]{.mark}**," 78 percent of respondents thought the
United States should remain in NATO (and that millennials, many who do
not remember the Cold War, overwhelmingly supported that option, with 77
percent opting to remain).]{.underline}

But it isn't just that Democrats and Republicans alike think the United
States should remain in NATO. Respondents were presented with three
choices --- press Europeans to spend more on defense and threaten to
disengage if they do not; urge Europeans to spend more but do not
threaten to disengage; or remain part of NATO but bring military
investments in line with what Europeans spend.

[The most popular option was actually to bring U.S. military investments
in line with the investments Europeans are making.]{.underline}

"It wasn't a conclusion we should necessarily spend less --- it's more
to bring U.S. military investments in line with the European level,"
Kull clarified, the thinking being that, " 'Well if the Europeans are
comfortable at the level that they're at, maybe we should adjust ours.'
"

B[ut the significant thing to Kull was that **[most people did not favor
threatening NATO allies]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For both Democratic and
Republican respondents, [[**threatening to disengage** was the **least
popular** option]{.mark}, with only 4 percent of Democrats and 21
percent of Republicans saying that they found it to be the most
convincing.]{.underline}

It's "one more indicator of how robust support is for the alliance,"
Kull said. "[That the threat to withdraw was so widely
rejected.]{.underline}" A little something for NATO to celebrate,
perhaps, on its 70th birthday.
