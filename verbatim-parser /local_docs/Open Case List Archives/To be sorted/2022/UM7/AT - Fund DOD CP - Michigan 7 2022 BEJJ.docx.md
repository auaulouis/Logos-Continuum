## AT: Fund DoD CP

### 2AC -- PDCP -- Normal Means

#### Historically, Congress has increased funding for every new program from the DoD

American Institute of Physics, 6-15-2022, \"DOD Budget: FY22 Outcomes
and FY23 Request,\" No Publication,
https://www.aip.org/fyi/2022/dod-budget-fy22-outcomes-and-fy23-request//jc

Following on a string of budget increases[, funding across the
Department of Defense's Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation
(RDT&E) accounts increased 11% in fiscal year 2022 to a new record of
\$123 billion]{.underline}. That is nearly \$50 billion above where
those accounts stood just five years earlier. The [Biden administration
is seeking a 7% increase]{.underline} in fiscal year 2023, which would
bring RDT&E spending to \$132 billion. [Within RDT&E funding, the budget
increased 12%]{.underline} to \$18.9 billion for DOD's early-stage
science and technology portfolio, comprising Basic Research, Applied
Research, and Advanced Technology Development accounts. [The
appropriation rebuffed the 13%]{.underline} cut to the portfolio the
administration proposed, and it significantly exceeded the amounts
proposed by House and Senate appropriators. [That outcome]{.underline}
stemmed from negotiations between Democrats and Republicans that
resulted in the legislation [containing a much higher allocation for
overall defense spending]{.underline} than Democrats\' initial drafts.
For fiscal year 2023, the administration is seeking \$16.5 billion
across these three accounts, representing a 13% cut. However,
[Republicans are again insisting on higher defense spending than the
administration proposes]{.underline}, which could well result in another
spending increase.

First Set of Projects to Receive Funding From the Pilot Program to
Accelerat,\"
https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3098211/dod-announces-first-set-of-projects-to-receive-funding-from-the-pilot-program-t///jc

[The]{.underline} Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research
and Engineering ([OUSD(R&E)) announced the first set of projects to
receive funding via the pilot program]{.underline} [to Accelerate the
Procurement and Fielding of Innovative Technologies
(APFIT]{.underline}). The purpose of the APFIT pilot program is to
expeditiously transition technologies -- with priority given to those
developed by small businesses and/or nontraditional defense contractors
-- from pilot programs, prototype projects, and research projects into
production. The benefits of this pilot will be to deliver war-winning
capability earlier than scheduled while contributing to the viability of
small business and nontraditional defense contractor vendors. [APFIT is
an additional tool the DoD can use to propel innovative capabilities
across the "Valley of Death"]{.underline} and into the hands of the
warfighter. "[APFIT holds great promise to transform the way the
Department procures next generations solutions. This pilot program is
well positioned to be a key asset]{.underline} as we continue to work to
bridge the valley of death," stated Heidi Shyu, Under Secretary of
Defense for Research and Engineering. "[The ten companies being funded
will fill critical capability gaps. Without APFIT, their innovative
technologies could take much longer to reach the hands of our
warfighters.]{.underline}" The National Defense Authorization Act of
FY22 directed the Secretary of Defense to establish APFIT as a
competitive, merit-based program for innovative and mature technologies
and products that can meet warfighter demands but currently lack the
necessary funding to transition the capability into the production
delivery phase**[. The U.S. Congress funded \$100 million in FY22. Ten
DoD program offices will each receive \$10 million in APFIT
funding]{.underline}**. [These program offices will in turn use that
funding to procure innovative technologies from small businesses or
nontraditional defense contractor vendors, as listed below]{.underline}.
To be eligible for APFIT funding, these vendors must have received less
than \$500 million in cumulative revenue from DoD.

### 2AC -- Solvency -- Doesn't Solve

#### The CP will just cause more wasteful spending

Kyle **Rempfer**, 3-12-20**19**, \"Use-it or lose-it: [DoD dropped \$4.6
million on crab and lobster, and \$9,000 on a chair]{.underline} in
last-minute spending spree,\" Military Times,
https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/03/12/use-it-or-lose-it-dod-dropped-46-million-on-crab-and-lobster-and-9000-on-a-chair-in-last-minute-spending-spree///jc

[[The federal government found a way to spend \$97 billion in a single
month]{.mark} last year, of which more than \$61 billion can be
attributed to the Pentagon.]{.underline} It's not a new phenomenon. [In
the last month of every fiscal year, federal agencies work to spend all
that's left in their annual budgets]{.underline}. If they don't, the
agencies worry they'll be appropriated a smaller share by Congress next
year, hence the "use-it or lose-it" spending sprees. Rather than spend
money on frivolous items, federal agencies like the Defense Department
should admit their offices can be run on less, according to Adam
Andrzejewski, founder and CEO of OpenTheBooks. OpenTheBooks is a
nonprofit aimed at bringing transparency and efficiency to the federal
budget. They released a report this March detailing fiscal 2018
use-it-or-lose-it spending habits. The military spent the most, by far,
which isn't surprising, Andrzejewski told Military Times. "Let me clear:
[[Congress is the problem]{.mark} here, not DoD or other agencies," he
said. "Historically, both parties tend to look the other way at Pentagon
waste. This is a shame because the troops and taxpayers suffer. Lower
priority items get funded while mission critical needs are
short-changed."]{.underline} Andrzejewski calls the spending spree
"Christmas in September" for the federal government. And last fiscal
year was the worst his group has tracked so far. [[One of the stand-out
purchases]{.mark} by **the Pentagon [included a \$9,341]{.mark} Wexford
leather [club chair]{.mark}** purchased from the Interior Resource
Group, according to the report]{.underline}. [The DoD also bought \$32
million worth of batteries, \$4.3 million worth of books and pamphlets,
\$220 million worth of furniture, \$7.6 million worth of workout
equipment and \$786.3 million on "guns, ammunition and
bombs.\"]{.underline} The Pentagon spent the most on five of those
products: \$124.3 million on medium caliber ammunition, \$92.3 million
for modification purposes, \$75 million on the Paveway family of
laser-guided bombs, nearly \$54 million on M795 TNT, and \$2.8 million
on 40mm ammunition systems. [Federal agencies also like to splurge on
luxury food items before the end of the fiscal year, according to the
report**. [The Pentagon spent \$2.3 million on crab]{.mark}**, including
snow crab, Alaskan king crab, and crab legs and claws, **[as well as
another \$2.3 million on lobster tail]{.mark}**. Federal agencies [also
spent \$293,245 on steak, to include rib eye, top sirloin and flank
steak**.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Marines eat their meals during a
birthday lunch at the Anderson Chow Hall, Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Nov.
11, 2018. Anderson Chow Hall held a birthday lunch celebrating the 243rd
Corps Birthday, serving steak, lobster, crab legs and cake. (Sgt. Jesus
Sepulveda Torres/Marines) Andrzejewski said that in some cases, like the
surf-and-turf, the spending can actually trickle down to the troops. But
that doesn't mean the dollars couldn't be better allocated on more
necessary items at the beginning of the year if the funds are actually
needed. "Our theory is that, in many cases, the people in charge of the
accounts simply follow the path of least resistance," he said. "When
faced with the structural use-it or lose-it deadline they spend as much
as they can on whatever is easiest to spend money on. Again, Congress
created this perverse incentive structure." The DoD also spent big on
public relations and marketing in September, inking \$153.3 million in
contracts. The military also dropped \$86.5 million on transportation
contracts, of which more than \$53.5 million went to passenger vehicles
from Navistar Defense, the maker of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected
vehicles. Some of the big ticket spending items are attributed to the
usual major defense contractors. The Pentagon spent \$8.1 billion on
contracts with Lockheed Martin and \$5.1 billion with Boeing in
September, for instance.

### 2AC -- Solvency -- AT: Sayler 22

#### Card flows AFF -- doesn't actually say funding solves case especially after we read a bunch of cards that prove the amount of funding is more than enough in the squo

**Sayler 22** (Kelley M. Sayler, Analyst in Advanced Technology and
Global Security, 4-6-2022, "Emerging Military Technologies: Background

**[Funding]{.underline}** Considerations

A number of [**emerging** [military
**technologies**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} including hypersonic
weapons and directed energy weapons, have [[experienced fluctuations in
funding]{.underline}]{.mark} over the years. According to a U.S.
government interagency task force on the defense industrial base, such
"**[[fluctuations challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [viability of
**suppliers**]{.underline} within the industrial base by
[**diminishing** their ability to hire and retain a **skilled
workforce**]{.underline}, \[[achieve\] **production**]{.underline}
**[efficiencies]{.underline}**, and in some cases, \[stay\] in
business." 174 Other analysts have noted that such fluctuations are
[often due to]{.underline} unavoidable [tradeoffs between technology
investment priorities]{.underline} or to questions about a given
technology's feasibility or maturity.175

Some analysts have suggested that, [given the potential for
technological surprise, **[funding]{.mark}**]{.underline} for overall
research and development [**[is inadequate]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
Summarizing such views, [technology expert Martijn Rasser]{.underline}
notes that [reducing overall]{.underline} research and
[development]{.underline} in order to enable "big bets" or heavy
investments in a particular technology or technologies, [can
be]{.underline} a [risky]{.underline} approach [because "we just don't
know where]{.underline} the [next breakthroughs will come
from]{.underline}." 176

### 2AC -- Turn -- Too Much Funding Bad

#### Increased DoD funding trades off from other programs

**Farhad Manjoo,** 01-13-20**22**, "We Must Stop Showering the Military
With Money", New York Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/opinion/military-budget-build-back-better.html//jc

Of course, I'm only kidding. I don't actually wonder about Manchin's
stance on showering the Department of Defense with more money than it
asks for, even more than it seems to know what to do with. [Right around
the time he was bayoneting Build Back Better, Manchin joined 87 other
senators --- Democrats and Republicans --- in rubber-stamping another
gargantuan budget for the Pentagon. They allocated \$768 billion for the
military in 2022, roughly \$24 billion more than the White House
requested from Congress.]{.underline} Given all the challenges we face
at home, does it make any sense to keep spending so many hundreds of
billions on the Pentagon? And even just in terms of fighting wars, can
anyone be satisfied with the way the military is managing its funds? The
Pentagon has never passed an audit and says it may not be able to until
2028. [In 2020 the U.S. military's budget accounted for almost 40
percent of the world's military expenditures]{.underline}. This level of
spending has long been excessive, but [after a pandemic that has claimed
the lives of more Americans than any war we fought, continuing to throw
money at the military is an act of willful disregard for the most urgent
threats]{.underline} we face. According to a projection by the
Congressional Budget Office, [Congress is projected to spend about \$8.5
trillion for the military over the next decade --- about half a trillion
more than is budgeted for all nonmilitary discretionary programs
combined]{.underline} (a category that includes federal spending on
education, public health, scientific research, infrastructure, national
parks and forests, environmental protection, law enforcement, courts,
tax collection, foreign aid, homeland security and health care for
veterans). You don't have to be a pacifist to wonder if this imbalance
between military and nonmilitary spending makes sense. [When we face so
many other major challenges --- from climate disasters to political
instability and insurrection --- shouldn't we ask whether it remains
wise to keep handing the military what is effectively a blank
check?]{.underline} Are such lavish resources even good for national
defense, or might the Pentagon's near-bottomless access to funds have
encouraged a culture of waste and indulgence that made it easier to
blunder into Iraq and contributed to its failures in Afghanistan? This
gets to what's most frustrating about the Pentagon's enormous budget:
the halo of protection it enjoys in our political culture. Despite the
Pentagon's numerous missteps, our representatives too rarely ask how
much money for the military may be way too much money for the military.
We have long national debates about whether it makes sense to spend on
things like parental leave or college tuition, but lawmakers seldom
expect such rigor from the Defense Department. For example, why should
we keep building aircraft carriers --- each of which costs about \$1.5
billion a year to operate --- when we've already got most of the world's
fleet of active aircraft carriers? (We've got 11; no other nation has
more than two, though China may be launching a third soon.) [There is
ample evidence that Congress's reluctance to ask basic questions of the
Pentagon has harmed, rather than helped, the military's
effectiveness.]{.underline} Consider the boondoggle that is the F-35
Joint Strike Fighter program --- the plan the Pentagon conceived in the
1990s to build a new plane, which is expected to cost taxpayers more
than \$1 trillion over its 60-year life span. A recent audit from the
Government Accountability Office found that even the Pentagon's extended
timeline for when the plane might finally go into full production is
"not achievable," and there were more than 850 "open deficiencies" in
the project as of November 2020. I wonder if Manchin could explain to
his constituents how tolerating such a level of mismanagement is good
for our security. I also wonder if Manchin could explain the staggering
size and top-heaviness of the Pentagon's staffing --- why the ratio of
enlisted troops to officers is declining across the U.S. forces,
cluttering the chain of command with layers of bureaucracy. A 2015
internal study found that the Pentagon employed (or hired contractors to
employ) nearly as many deskbound, back-office people as it had
active-duty troops. [The report found that it could save \$125 billion a
year by, among other measures, reducing overstaffing through retirements
and attrition. The Pentagon buried that report,]{.underline} according
to The Washington Post. [Not only do lawmakers give the Pentagon a free
pass on its budget; sometimes they even force the agency to keep the
little fat it's trying to trim.]{.underline} The Air Force says that
it's ready to retire its fleet of A-10 Warthogs, fighter airplanes that
date back to the 1970s. Congress forbade any such reduction in 2022.
[Starting in 2017, Congress even required each military service to
submit an annual wish list of "unfunded priorities" --- that is, goodies
that the services might want but that the White House had not requested
in its budget.]{.underline} It has since become routine for Congress to
not only give the Pentagon much of what it asks for but also ladle on
extras. The reasons such spending persists aren't a big mystery. The
military-industrial complex is every bit as politically powerful as
Dwight Eisenhower warned it would be. (A recent Wall Street Journal
headline captured the situation well: "Who Won in Afghanistan? Private
Contractors.") In another trick, [the military spreads its contracts to
a large number of congressional districts, giving every lawmaker a
reason to celebrate excessive military spending]{.underline}. (Manchin
put out a statement taking credit for all the benefits the new defense
appropriation will bring to West Virginia.) And finally, there is plain
patriotic posturing: [Because every dollar to the Pentagon can be
defended as protecting the troops and the nation's security, no
politician will ever get in trouble for giving too much money to the
military]{.underline}. Mandy Smithberger, who studies Pentagon excess at
the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan independent group,
told me that while she has hopes that younger generations will begin to
question the military's excessive spending, the situation is unlikely to
change anytime soon. "It's going to take members of Congress to really
step up," she said. That seems about as likely as pigs flying --- or,
more aptly, F-35s.

### 2AC -- UQ -- Space Specific

Thomas **Novelly**, 10-16-20**21**, \"Space Force Looking for Surge in
Funding for 2023 to Focus on Missile Defense Warning Systems,\"
Military,
https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/03/29/space-force-looking-surge-funding-2023-focus-missile-warning.html//jc

[The Space Force]{.underline}, America's newest and smallest service
branch, [is seeking a huge increase in funding]{.underline} as part of
the White House's 2023 defense budget, [with a goal of developing and
growing the nation's missile warning systems as tensions rise with China
and Russia.]{.underline} In 2023 budget documents released Monday[,
Space Force]{.underline} -- which falls under the department of the Air
Force -- [requested \$24.5 billion, which marked a nearly 40% increase
from the previous year.]{.underline} The majority of funds are projected
to be used on research and development as well as establishing more
missile warning systems in space. Advertisement "The reason there is a
Space Force, the reason the Obama administration changed its strategy
for space was because of the threat," Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall
told reporters during a media roundtable Friday. "[The widespread
investment that both China and Russia have in anti-space, counter-space
capabilities including things that threaten us in all different orbital
regimes."]{.underline} Read Next: New \'Basic Needs\' Allowance on Top
of Increases for Housing and Food in Air Force\'s 2023 Budget [The
majority of Space Force's 2023 budget, 65%, would be focused on
research, development, testing and evaluation, according to the budget
documents. It's a 33% increase from last year's ask]{.underline}.
Advertisement Since being created in 2019, [Space Force\'s mission \--
to protect and defend the massive U.S. satellite fleet \-- is crucial in
everything from the country\'s reliance on GPS to detecting
abnormalities in the Earth\'s orbit, and the 2023 budget shows some of
the largest investments in developing and growing their
capabilities]{.underline}. Todd Harrison, director of the Aerospace
Security Project at the nonprofit Center for Strategic and International
Studies, said Monday's budget numbers show that the military is taking
space capabilities seriously with the Department of the Air Force
focusing its attention not just on Russia but primarily on China. This
past November, the Russian Federation destroyed one of its own
Soviet-era satellites with a missile, sending thousands of scraps of
shrapnel hurtling through space, a cloud of debris that threatened other
orbiting satellites, including those belonging to the U.S. But even with
that notable incident, [China remains more of a threat, Harrison added.
"China has the full suite of anti-satellite weapons, everything from
jammers that could do electronic attacks to lasers that could blind the
sensors on satellites, and missiles that could shoot down satellites and
create debris," Harrison said. Nearly \$3 billion would be spent on
missile warning development programs, which Kendall underscored as the
biggest priority and goal for the new service.]{.underline} "There\'s no
more important services than missile warning, and nuclear command
control, particularly from space," Kendall said. "So we\'re trying to
move forward aggressively." [Many of the funding increases come from
reallocated money and resources as the Space Development Agency moves
from the Secretary of Defense's Office to being a part of Space
Force]{.underline}, and very little of the funds are connected to
personnel increases, according to the budget documents. The 2023 budget
transfers \$1 billion to run personnel expenses separate from the Air
Force, and would build the active-duty strength of the Space Force to
8,600 -- adding 200 new Guardians to the total force, mostly through
transfers from other service branches. The 2023 budget also requests
funding to provide a 4.6% pay raise, a 4.2% basic housing allowance
increase as well as a 3.6% basic allowance for subsistence, which can be
used to offset the price of groceries during inflation. It also allows
for a 4.6% pay increase for civilian contractors in the Space Force.
There were no construction estimates in the 2023 budget request for
Space Force, but the Air Force budget did ask for \$68 milion to build a
dormitory at Clear Space Force Station in Denali, Alaska.

#### SDA and Space Force got a pay raise

**[The 2022 spending bill added nearly \$1.3 billion for U.S. Space
Force and Space Development Agency programs above what the Biden
administration requested]{.underline}** WASHINGTON --- [The defense
spending bill for fiscal year 2022 that Congress passed last week gives
the Pentagon \$743.4 billion. Military space programs got a big
boost]{.underline}. Appropriators added nearly \$1.3 billion for U.S.
Space Force and Space Development Agency projects above what the Biden
administration requested. [President Biden is expected to sign the \$1.5
trillion federal spending bill before current funding expires on March
15]{.underline}. The government has been operating under continuing
resolutions since the 2022 fiscal year started Oct. 1. [The \$1.3
billion Congress added for military space funds technology development
projects run by the Space Force, pays for an extra Global Positioning
System satellite, increases spending on small launch services and Space
Development Agency (SDA) missile-detecting satellites]{.underline}. One
of the largest items appropriators inserted into the budget is a \$550
million demonstration of missile-tracking satellites to be developed by
SDA for the U.S. Indo-Pacific military command. "The [threats are
driving space spendin]{.underline}g," said Peter Garretson, a space and
defense consultant and senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy
Council. China's recent displays of advanced space technology have not
gone unnoticed, and there are growing worries about Russian aggression,
he said. [SDA is building a large mesh network of satellites in low
Earth orbit to detect and track enemy missiles, and to move data around
the globe. Increasing the agency's budget is "absolutely the right move
at this point in time,]{.underline}" said Garretson. "I'm hoping that
SDA with their multiple layers of satellites will really get the DoD
back in the game of rapid innovation and technology development."

### 2AC -- Net Ben -- No Link

#### It only needs to send a few ambassadors to negotiate -- an MOU can be done over the phone

Office of the **A**ssistant **S**ecretary for **P**lanning and
**E**valuation, 12-31-19**81**, \"A Guide to Memorandum of Understanding
Negotiation and Development,\" ASPE,
https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/guide-memorandum-understanding-negotiation-development-0

Stage One. Planning Stage. [The planning stage is essential]{.underline}
as a basis for subsequent MOU activity and will, if carefully executed,
provide a set of decisions and determinations [which will facilitate
smooth negotiation and implementation of the relationship with the
provider.]{.underline} It is also essential as the basis for developing
a contract. Step One. [Begin with internal brainstorming.]{.underline}
Administrators, case managers, or others involved in your agency\'s
efforts should identify: What you want or need another party to provide;
What you are willing to negotiate; What you are willing to give up; What
you have to offer; The rationale for entering the MOU process. Step Two.
[Identify the potential providers in the community]{.underline}. In this
process, identify provider needs and explore ways in which you can, to
some extent, [address their needs. Be realistic about what you can
expect]{.underline} providers to deliver and what you can deliver.
[Explore ways to establish appropriate relationships]{.underline} in
order to maximize the probability of achieving what you want. Step
Three. Define your agency\'s program objectives for a particular MOU and
evaluate whether you can accomplish the objectives without the MOU. The
definition of program objectives is a crucial process in the development
of an MOU. Clearly defined program objectives can be translated into the
terms and conditions of the MOU. In developing the objectives you
should: Define the client population to be served; Define the service to
be provided, or the understanding you desire; Assess any costs, both
direct and indirect, to your agency and the agency with which you are
negotiating an MOU; [Define the minimally acceptable standards of
performance. Program objectives stated in terms of measurable outcomes
will facilitate monitoring, evaluation, and MOU renogotiation later on
after the MOU has been implemented]{.underline}. Program objectives can
be used as a point of reference against which to weigh the advantages
and disadvantages of developing an MOU. Their consideration will assist
you in determining whether the creation of an MOU will unnecessarily
formalize a relationship, create unnecessary bureaucracy or be
counterproductive. An MOU should not be attempted if it will disrupt a
good relationship. [Finally, reference to program objectives will help
you set up the criteria for agencies and individuals with which to
negotiate an MOU.]{.underline} Step Four. [Identify the level of staff
to be involved in the negotiation process. Involve those persons in the
process as early as possible]{.underline}. Their value in negotiation
will be enhanced if they are thoroughly familiar with what you want
accomplished. Step Five**[. Identify agencies which have money for
services.]{.underline}** Consider some of the ways you can tap into
their money and services. For example, you could act as a referral
source to the agency or perform preauthorizations for service for them.
Step Six. [Identify agencies which authorize or pay for
services]{.underline}. Consider ways to negotiate some transfer of
authority to the case management agency. Step Seven. Identify
individuals who are influential among service providers and enlist their
support and assistance. Stage Two. Negotiation Stage. [The negotiation
stage begins through contact with the agency, preferably
in-person]{.underline}. It is a good idea to include the staff member
who will be responsible for implementing the MOU in the initial visit.
Have a clear agenda for the meeting. Describe your agency, what you hope
to demonstrate through case management, why the participation of the
provider agency is Important, and how clients will be better served by
the joint effort. Sell the concept of case management as one that
eliminates duplication and enhances delivery of services to clients and
their families. After the sales pitch, service providers will probably
be able to anticipate what you want from them. You have spent time
during the planning stage identifying what you want and what you are
prepared to negotiate and now is the time to lay out your expectations.
Be realistic about what you expect and be prepared for trade-offs.
Develop a timetable with the provider, setting clear deadlines. It is
helpful if each party knows what time constraints and limitations exist
in the process. Important points to consider are listed below. Identify
the internal review process for both your agency and the provider. If
the approval of an Advisory Board or Board of Directors is required,
learn when these groups meet and plan with that date in mind. Check on
whether you or the provider require a legal review and build that into
the timeline. Identify any insurance needs, relevant personnel policies,
and requirements for physical examinations, T.B. or other tests. Decide
who will pay if any tests are required. Identify strategies for
enhancing the professional status of both the provider and the case
management agency in the community. One strategy is to jointly serve on
each other\'s Boards. Identify whether staff in-service training is
required in order to implement the MOU. Agree on how, when, and who will
provide that training. If the reaction is negative, you might try a
little community pressure. Find an influential friend in another agency,
or locate a helpful Board member or use your state agency contacts. A
little persuasion or arm-twisting is all part of a tough negotiation
process. Any research components in your program should be discussed in
the process of negotiating MOU\'s with provider agencies.
Confidentiality assurance should be discussed with the provider during
the negotiation stage. It should be understood that only authorized
persons may have access to client information and records, that the
records must be adequately secured at all times, that release of
information is allowable only with the client\'s permission. These are
good practice procedures which protect the rights of clients. Stage
Three. Completing the MOU. [This final step begins with the preparation
of a draft of the MOU instrument which is based on your meeting and
negotiations with the provider agency]{.underline}. Generally, since you
are initiating the process, you will assume responsibility for preparing
the draft. Send the draft to the other party, along with a cover letter
in which you identify controversial areas. Try to negotiate those points
where there is some flexibility and identify the immutable points. [This
phase of the negotiation could be handled by phone or in person, however
personal contact may carry more impact in terms of developing the
relationship.]{.underline} Involving the persons with the authority to
negotiate for the agency at this draft stage can minimize the time to
complete the MOU. If programmatic objectives have been specified in the
planning process, developing a system for monitoring and/or evaluation
can be fairly easy. You could identify data needs and develop the
appropriate forms and filing and tracking systems to be used jointly by
your agency and the agency with which you are developing the MOU.
Special Concerns. [**Timing. The finalization process can take as little
as a few days,** or as long as a few months.]{.underline} Factors which
tend to increase the amount of time to finalize the MOU are: the people
